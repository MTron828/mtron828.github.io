Chapter 2348: Very shocking

Ling Han tested the little beast’s defenses as well, and was stunned once more.

The little guy’s defense was also shockingly strong, capable of matching Seven-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, which was the same level as its destructive power.

No wonder this little guy would be called a Battle Beast. It had a combination of frightening destructive power and defense, and was born specifically for the purpose of bloodshed and destruction.

Ling Han couldn’t help but think that there were War Soldiers in the Dark Inverse Realm, and the Foreign Realm had Battle Beasts. Was this a race that the Foreign Realm had given rise to for the sake of its own protection?

After all, they were already at the Ascending Origin Tier from birth. This was too shocking, and did not match the normal pattern of heaven and earth, either. Powerful strength should be attained only through hard work, and not be something that one was born with, a harvest that was reaped without sowing.

Hence, if Battle Beasts were born by the Foreign Realm for the sake of self-protection and to stand against the War Soldiers, this would actually be a very logical deduction.

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, and planned to ask Wally some questions.

“Wah, what a cute puppy!” When they saw Little Terror, all the women’s eyes lit up, looking like they wanted to pounce at any moment.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sweat madly. These women really should not see any adorable things, especially when they could not give birth to their own babies. Because of that, they had even less immunity to cute things.

Furthermore, did this look like a puppy? What was wrong with your eyes!

“It looks quite delicious.” Hu Niu stroked her chin as she set her eyes on the little beast, already about to drool.

Only she was different from the rest.

Sensing Hu Niu’s “animosity,” Little Terror immediately turned to look at her. It bared its mouth, revealing two rows of snow-white teeth.

In adulthood, it was extremely ferocious with those two rows of teeth looking like blades, and would cause a chill to rise up in anyone’s heart, but at present, it could not look ferocious at all. Instead, others would only think that it was extremely cute and adorable.

It was just like when a little puppy that had just been born was showing its rage—who would be afraid?

Ling Han laughed involuntarily, and said, “Niu, calm down. This little guy is very fierce.”

Hu Niu was naturally unafraid, and snorted. “Just a little guy, Niu doesn’t think it can even fill my stomach!”

“Ao!” Little Terror released a roar, and howled at Hu Niu. But it was very childish, and did not seem at all threatening.

The women couldn’t help but laugh loudly, feeling that this little guy was really so fun to play around with.

“Come, let Big Sister hug you.” Bewitching Maiden Rou stretched out her hand.

Little Terror was furious. It was no pet, but rather a Battle Beast, born purely for the sake of battle. Cuteness had absolutely nothing to do with it.

“Ao…” it released another howl, but it was not out of rage this time, but rather because Ling Han was scratching its neck with a finger, which made it feel great comfort.

The little guy looked plaintively at Ling Han. ‘I am a mighty Battle Beast, not a pet!’ Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ao!”

It had not expected that the women would also rush forwards, and would rub it repeatedly, making the little guy so comfortable that its tail was stretched straight, and its gaze was even more adorable now.

‘I am a Battle Beast! Battle Beast! Battle Beast, you bastards!’

The little guy’s tummy was exposed. It was completely unguarded, allowing the women to ravage it as they liked.

Of course, this was also because it knew that these were all its mistresses, and did not dare to resist. Otherwise, if anyone else had dared to “bully” it like this, the little guy would have long since exploded.

It obediently took on the role of pet for the women to play with. In any case, it would not be hurt with its tough hide.

Ling Han went off to seek out Wally.

“What relation do Battle Beasts have with War Soldiers?” Ling Han asked directly.

Wally searched his memories, and replied, “Battle Beasts should be creatures that this Realm has created to oppose the War Soldiers of our Realm. They possess the unique traits of high defense and high destructive power, and that is for the purpose of destroying the War Soldiers of our realm. However, the heaven and earth could not possibly interfere too much, and added with the extreme difficulty of reproduction of Battle Beasts, they have long since disappeared, and can be considered a failed attempt of the heaven and earth.”

Ling Han was curious, and asked, “Then which of the two is stronger?”

“If they were of the same level, it would naturally be the Battle Beast that was stronger,” Wally immediately said. “However, the number of Battle Beasts cannot compare to the number of War Soldiers. A single War Soldier may not be a match for the former, but they could attack in a group of 10, 20, or even 100 all at the same time.”

Ling Han nodded. Why had Battle Beasts gone extinct, and why could they now only be found in an ancient tomb? It was because this was an attempt that could not be emulated, and that was why they had been eliminated by the heaven and earth, the latter no longer willing to expend further energy on this aspect.

However, though Battle Beasts had been eliminated, it did not mean that this kind of creature was not strong. It was just that their numbers were too low, and could not have extensive effects.

“You actually have a Battle Beast!” Wally appeared slightly surprised. The expression of surprise was merely a slight widening of his mouth on his wooden face, but it was already a very impressive feat to actually manage to cause him to feel surprise.

“No need to admire me. I know I am very awesome,” Ling Han said, smiling.

Wally looked at Little Terror. Weng, his eyes lit up with a green light, and began to scan Little Terror up and down.

“Roar!” Sensing this kind of green light, Little Terror immediately flipped over and stood up. It fixed its eyes on Wally, exploding with terrifying ferocious might.

It did not know Wally, but the light that he emitted caused it to instinctively feel discomfort, or even fury.

The moment this ferocious might was revealed, the women all got a scare, and only then did they know that this little guy actually had such a dominant side to it.

“For better or worse, it is still a Battle Beast, after all.” Ling Han deliberately stepped back a little, and did not stop Little Terror from attacking. He was extremely curious about Wally’s small world. The latter could absorb even one of the essence powers of a Genesis World, Void Particle Energy. What kind of freak was this?

Wally did not react, and continued scanning Little Terror.

Little Terror was completely enraged now. Since Ling Han did not stop it, its bloodthirst as a Battle Beast immediately exploded. Teng, teng, teng, it moved its two hind legs. It was very strong and powerful. Even though its feet were tiny, it had astonishing explosive power.

Xiu, it instantly rushed in front of Wally, and then stretched out its claws which swiped outwards.

Wally stepped back, but his feet did not move. Instead, his whole person simply slid back like that, which was extremely bizarre.

However, this kind of evasive method was extremely efficient. No matter how Little Terror attacked him, he would always manage to dodge in time.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. What Wally was using should be Regulations of Space, but they were not Regulations of Space, which was extremely strange.

This was the power of heaven and earth that was superior to Regulations?

Regulations were manifested from the power of heaven and earth, and actually belonged to the power of heaven and earth as well, but when cultivators battled, they would have to first draw on Regulations, and convert them into attack power or speed. There was a process of conversion.

No matter how fast this process was, it would still need time. Hence, Wally would have the chance to dodge.

Of course, aside from Wally, others would also need to use Regulations for evasion. This similarly had a process of conversion. In that case, there was no visible advantage.

As Ling Han studied, he actually could also use a sliver of the power of heaven and earth, and that was thanks to his body that had been tempered by Void Particle Energy. He could directly draw on his own power, and would not need to stimulate Regulations first to convert them into either attack power or speed.

‘Theoretically, though my power is only at the pinnacle of the Ascending Origin Tier, my battle prowess should not be limited to that if I could fully make use of my advantage,’ he mused. As expected, having Little Terror battle Wally was a wise decision.

Wally soon stopped the scanning green light. While calmly dodging Little Terror’s attacks, he said to Ling Han, “This Battle Beast has very strong genes, and is worth nurturing.”

Though a Battle Beast would definitely become a Celestial King, there were still nine heavens in Celestial King Tier.
