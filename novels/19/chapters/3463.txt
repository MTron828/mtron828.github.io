Chapter 3464: Fierce battle with Tong Miao

Translator: Henyee Translations , Editor: Henyee Translations

“You really do have some abilities!” Tong Miao was surprised. He believed that Ling Han’s cultivation level was Sixth Extreme, and that was why he had pulled his cultivation level to Sixth Extreme, so that they could have a fair battle.

He was confident that he was invincible among his peers, and now that he had actually failed to gain the upper hand with a single strike, he was slightly surprised.

Aside from Dong Qi and Xin Ruyue, there was actually another prodigy that was not inferior to him?

“Where are you from?” he asked.

“Dark North Nation, Ling Han,” Ling Han said calmly.

“En?” Tong Miao was even more shocked. In this world where martial arts could only be considered primitive and obscure, there actually appeared such a prodigy?

“Twin Prodigies of the Imperial City, Hong Tianbu and Ling Han, so you are Ling Han!” Xin Ruyue had long since stood up to watch the battle, and when she heard this, she couldn’t help but give an ‘oh’, revealing an expression of realization.

Yet Tong Miao was at a loss. Hong Tianbu, Ling Han, what the heck were they? Forget it, there was no need to care. In any case, they would only become dead souls under his sword.

“Die!” He brandished his sword in a slash. Even if power was equal, it was only power that was equal, but it did not mean that the battle prowess of the two of them was also equal. This was a completely different concept.

Martial arts techniques, experience, and adapting on the spot would all influence the scales of victory and defeat.

The sword slashed down, and with a chi, blazing flames burned on the blade, slashing down on Ling Han.

The sword had not reached him, but the incredibly scorching heat wave had already assaulted him, causing Ling Han to feel as if even the hairs on his skin were about to be burnt, and a burnt mark had appeared on the comer of his robes, with smoke rising from it.

Was he trying to make him run naked?

Ling Han was furious. Peng! He activated the energy of Stone, forming a defense in front of him. Then, with a soft whistle, he charged towards Tong Miao.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Iron fists endlessly struck the long sword, and tongues of fire spat out madly. High-level energy clashed, creating dazzling sparks.

Xin Ruyue and Dong Qi were both watching the battle, and in unison, they exchanged a look, revealing a hint of wariness.

This outsider was really very strong.

Under normal circumstances, they would have an extremely high cultivation level and could easily kill Ling Han. However, in this place of trial, the battle would become relatively fair, and having a higher cultivation level would not have much of an advantage either.

And only one person could emerge from each peak. In other words, they were all competitors, and there was not the slightest bit of room for compromise. Only one person would be able to rise above the others.

Thus, the fact that Ling Han was so powerful also gave them a great warning.

As it turned out, there was a third powerful competitor.

They watched the battle seriously, capturing the weak points of Ling Han and 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tong Miao.

Everyone had their own weaknesses. Some were because the technique itself was not perfect enough, while there were some that had a mishap when they were cultivating.

It was the same for Ling Han and Tong Miao. They were both searching for the other’s weak point, so that they could kill the other with a single strike.

However, their strength was definitely strong and close in level, and there were pitifully few openings. Even if they were exposed, it would only be a flash. To grasp and react in such a fast-paced battle, this was incredibly difficult. Only if they battled for a long time, and familiarized themselves with each other’s moves, would they be able to truly make use of the other’s weaknesses, and decide the victor in an instant.

“Hahaha, great! Great!” Tong Miao laughed loudly, “Though your cultivation level is not high, your battle prowess is really not weak. You are qualified to become someone that I will kill and remember your name.”

Was this considered glory?

Ling Han chuckled, “How boastful!”

“You will soon know if I am boasting or not.” Yet Tong Miao was not angered, and merely showed a cold smirk. His left hand stretched out to his right hand, and in some unknown way, he actually moved, and he was already holding a sharp sword in each hand.

Yi, this could be dismantled?

“Only with two swords can I unleash my battle prowess!” Tong Miao stuck out his tongue to lick the blade, his face filled with bloodthirsty madness.

“Freak!”

“What a maniac!”

“It’s too ugly!”

The children said, but their eyes were bright.

Ling Han shook his head, “Looks like I definitely have to teach you a good lesson. Otherwise, what if you lead little kids astray?

“Cheeky mouth!” Tong Miao charged over, both swords dancing at the same time. A strange scene appeared. The sword in his right hand was still entwined in flames, but the sword in his left hand was frozen in ice. It was clearly two opposing energies, yet he had perfectly fused them together, and they did not clash with each other.

One was cold, while the other was hot. The might of this attack was extremely astonishing.

Ling Han only felt that one side of his body was boiling hot, while the other side was icy cold. This greatly affected the flow of his blood, causing the circulation of his mystical power to become slightly sluggish.

He had unleashed a powerful move.

Ling Han humphed. The Demonic Monkey Fists channeled, and instantly, a ruthless aura circulated in Ling Han’s body, making him seem as if he had transformed into an ancient Demonic Monkey that was out of control, capable of shattering the heavens and severing the earth.

instantly, the effects of the cold and heat attacks on him decreased greatly. Ling Han shuffled out, and began his counterattack on Tong Miao.

“Yi”’ Tong Miao couldn’t help but feel surprised. With both swords in hand, he has always been successful in every endeavor. Even in the previous great battle with Dong Qi and Xin Ruyue, the two of them were still greatly affected. However, they also had powerful ultimate moves, which also affected him. Otherwise, he would have long since severed the heads of those two.

However, though he was shocked, he naturally wouldn’t lose his composure. Brandishing his twin swords, he slashed them at Ling Han.

This time, Ling Han did not release the image of the ancient Demonic Monkey, instead, he fused it with himself, which had the effect of resisting cold and heat. This was also something that he had grasped after seeing the battle between the Monkeyman and the giant spider.

perhaps he had only unearthed one percent of the might of this fist technique. Dong Qi and Xin Ruyue were both surprised. Previously, though they had dispelled Tong Miao’s twin swords, they themselves had still been affected, unlike Ling Han, who seemed completely unscathed.

How could this outsider be so freakish? In comparison, it was as if he should be the one who had inherited the true essence of cultivation, while they were the wildlings.

“Haha, interesting, interesting!” Tong Miao was more and more frenzied. His blood and Qi suddenly boiled, and his battle prowess instantly soared. With a few slashes, Ling Han was no match for him, and was struck a few times in a row, blood gushing out.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and his blood and Qi also boiled. He did not believe it.

The two of them battled fiercely, but this time, it was Ling Han who was slightly on the upper hand.

This caused Tong Miao, Dong Qi and Xin Ruyue to all be moved. How could they not know that this meant that after Ling Han’s blood and Qi boiled, his battle prowess would increase even more than them.

in fact, this increase was one of the criteria to measure the potential of a cultivator. It was mainly the extent of perfection to which a Meridian Opening Tier had cultivated.

Ling Han had the advantage, which meant that he had perfected the cultivation of Meridian Opening Tier.

Hiss, this monster!

Tong Miao was speechless. He was an existence inside the prison. Though that was a prison, there were innumerable elites inside. The sect master of Heaven Crushing Sect was even standing on the second level of Celestial Path, and with his teachings, his foundations were actually not as perfect as that of an outsider?

Gritting his teeth, he placed the sword in his left hand into his right hand, and reassembled it into a single sword. Meanwhile, his left hand that was freed took out a small stone.

Pa, he squeezed forcefully, and the rock shattered. Furthermore, it had shattered very thoroughly, and had completely turned into dust.

Tong Miao took a deep breath, and the ashes all entered his mouth. Instantly, his eyes became bloodshot, and his aura also soared madly, far surpassing the amplification that the boiling of blood and Qi should have..
