Chapter 2254: Niu Will Battle

Tu Ta was far too arrogant, and this enraged all of the cultivators from the Celestial Realm. However, he was indeed powerful, so most people could only stare daggers at him in futility. This was because accepting his challenge would be akin to seeking death.

“I’ll go!” Another person from the Celestial Realm stepped forward. She was as beautiful as peach blossoms, yet as aloof as frosty ice.

It was surprisingly An Ran!

She was a supreme monarch tier, and she was also the disciple of Shang Zhiwei. As such, she naturally had the right to enter the Saintly Origin Academy, so appearing in this place was also understandable.

However, what made Ling Han gloomy was the fact that she had also advanced to the Fifth Secret.

The past 1000 years were a time when monarch tiers soared. This was because the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had ignored all expenses as they provided an endless stream of cultivation resources, giving these prodigies the best possible cultivation environment. As such, the monarch tiers naturally ascended in leaps and bounds, further widening the gap between them and the emperor tiers and king tiers.

Nie Heshan’s assertion that Ling Han had abandoned something important to take something unimportant had indeed been a fair observation. It was just that no one knew that he had obtained the Origin Magic Cube. This was something far more important than a measly few minor levels.

“Die!” Tu Ta showed no mercy as he attacked.

An Ran humphed coldly, and she channeled numerous celestial techniques as her hands danced in the air. Her battle prowess was astonishing.

She was a supreme monarch tier, someone who stood in the upper echelon of all monarch tiers. She was far more powerful than the youth who had preceded her.

However, Tu Ta was truly powerful, and he was clearly no weaker than An Ran. He didn’t dodge or evade her strikes, and he instead chose to clash with her head-on.

Everyone was engrossed in watching the battle. To the Celestial Realm, each battle was of utmost importance as winning once could bring 10,000 years of peace. Moreover, it could also raise their morale.

After all, they had lost far too many times before.

An Ran was indeed powerful, and she was no weaker than Tu Ta. However, the cultivators from the Celestial Realm all had an Achilles heel: they could only lock a limited amount of Regulations in their bodies, an amount that was far smaller than cultivators from the Foreign Realm.

Because the Foreign Realm was the invading party, they would start learning how to lock more Regulations in their body from a very young age. Otherwise, what right would they have to invade the Celestial Realm? How could they hope to achieve victory?

An Ran was no weaker than Tu Ta, yet she had never specifically trained to increase her capacity to hold Regulations before. In the Celestial Realm, such training would be a complete waste of time and effort. However, the birth of the neutral zone finally allowed the cultivators from the Celestial Realm to truly recognize the power of the Foreign Realm.

Eight hours into the battle, An Ran finally showed signs of struggling.

Solemn expressions spread across the faces of the cultivators from the Celestial Realm. One had to realize that Tu Ta had already fought a battle before this, yet he was still brimming with the power of Regulations. This was truly terrifying.

By doing battle in this neutral zone, it was as if they had gifted an advantage to the Foreign Realm instead.

Another 30 minutes passed, and An Ran had already lost all ability to attack. She had no option but to admit defeat and retreat.

Fortunately, her battle prowess was no weaker than Tu Ta’s, so Tu Ta had no opportunity to threaten her life.

They had lost another battle!

“I’ll go!” The third challenger from the Celestial Realm stepped forward. It was none other than Yi.

He didn’t say any more, and he immediately unleashed a flurry of attacks after charging onto the platform.

This was a sparring match, so the use of treasures, decrees, and so on was all banned. Otherwise, it would be a battle of resources instead of a battle of personal strength.

“Give me your head!” Tu Ta roared with a loud laugh. He swung his blade-like arms, and numerous symbols pulsated with raging killing intent.

Another intense battle ensued.

Yi had started from a lower cultivation level than Ling Han, but he had also advanced to the Fifth Secret now. This caused Ling Han to involuntarily feel gloomy. Presumably, everyone from the alliance had already reached the Fifth Secret. Only he remained at the Second Secret. Even though he was unfathomably powerful as a Second Secret elite.

Yi was even more powerful than Yan Xianlu, and his freakish talent was no less than that of An Ran. In turn, he was no weaker than Tu Ta. The battle between them was intense and furious.

After battling for six hours, both the human and the insect displayed signs of fatigue, with their battle prowess starting to gradually decrease.

Even though Tu Ta had locked more power of Regulations in his body, he was finally reaching his limit after battling against three monarch tiers in a row.

However, the cultivators from the Foreign Realm were far too familiar with doing battle in such a state, so under the same condition of exhausted power of Regulations, Tu Ta had special methods to slow down the consumption of his power of Regulations. Yi was forced to admit defeat.

Three defeats in a row!

After successfully completing his task, Tu Ta left the platform, and vacated his position for someone else.

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm all wore ashen expressions. Under the condition of having similar battle prowess, prodigies from the Foreign Realm could battle against three prodigies from the Celestial Realm. Their stamina was far too terrifying.

Fortunately, they were the defending party. If the Foreign Realm attacked the Clear Heaven Pass, they wouldn’t need to worry about the weakness of not having enough power of Regulations.

“Hahaha, it’s mine, Mu Leng’s time to shine now,” another prodigy from the Foreign Realm said as they walked onto the platform. He was a humanoid, with a pair of wings and a long tail. However, he also had a pair of horns protruding from his head, and his skin was crimson like blood and densely covered with symbols.

“Who’s going to battle against me?” he roared, with his voice booming like thunder.

This was another Fifth Secret monarch tier.

There were naturally young prodigies from the Celestial Realm who stepped forward to accept his challenge. However, the problem still remained. They couldn’t gain an advantage in terms of battle prowess, and their stamina was also clearly inferior. That being the case, how could they hope to achieve victory?

Three young monarch tiers accepted his challenge one after another, and only then was Mu Leng’s stamina finally depleted. However, they were still unable to achieve a single victory for the Celestial Realm.

Fretful and anxious expressions appeared on the faces of the cultivators from the Celestial Realm. Were they going to continue losing like this?

“Niu will battle!” Hu Niu couldn’t help but jump forward.

“A young girl with delicate skin and tender flesh… I’m going to gobble you up! You’re definitely full of nutrients!” The opponent was an emerald-green insect. He looked like a grasshopper, yet his strength was surprisingly great. He had already defeated a Fifth Secret monarch tier.

Without speaking another word, Hu Niu directly swung her small fists.

Ling Han smiled in his mind. With a single thought, a wisp of mystical power instantly crept into Hu Niu’s body, elevating her battle prowess.

Peng!

Hu Niu unleashed her might, and she instantly gained the upper hand.

She was already a supreme monarch tier, and it was only because she hadn’t come across enough opportunities that she hadn’t cultivated nine divided souls in the Dividing Soul Tier. However, this imperfection still couldn’t conceal her immense power. One had to realize that she had cultivated a secret realm of time. In fact, all five of her secret realms were secret realms of time. She possessed the Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique, and she had the ability to manipulate time.

Her battle prowess was most likely at a level between supreme monarch tiers and Monarch Stars, so she could have actually gained an advantage even without Ling Han’s help.

Peng, peng, peng!

Her battle instinct was extremely powerful, and once she gained an upper hand, she would firmly hold onto it with both hands, rapidly transforming this advantage into victory.

The insect from the Foreign Realm was both furious and astonished. His opponent clearly wasn’t a Monarch Star, so why could her battle prowess let her suppress him?

She was measly trash from a super low-level dimension, so how was she more powerful than him, a monarch tier?

However, this was the undisputed reality, and the insect from the Foreign Realm had two of his legs brutally snapped by the young woman. He had no option but to admit defeat. Otherwise, he would have been mercilessly dismembered by Hu Niu. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

They had won!

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm all cheered in delight. They had finally won a battle. They had finally achieved this extremely difficult feat.

Hu Niu placed her hands on her hips, and said in a delicate voice, “Who’s next? It’s best if you have some flesh. Niu doesn’t like to eat insects.”

Her words infuriated the cultivators from the Foreign Realm.

It had only ever been them who had eaten the cultivators from the Celestial Realm. Now, however, this young woman was actually saying that she wanted to eat them? How could they not be infuriated?

“Who’s going to defeat this piece of weak trash?!” they all shouted.

However, the cultivator who had been defeated by her was already a prodigy among the Fifth Secret monarch tiers, so finding someone even stronger than him was almost an impossible task.

By the looks of it, they could only rely on their Monarch Stars.

The mighty figures from the Foreign Realm were also slightly reluctant about this. They wanted to comprehensively shatter the morale of the Celestial Realm, so they naturally had to achieve crushing victory in each different level.. By actively deploying a Monarch Star first, wouldn’t they be somewhat admitting the strength of the Celestial Realm? In fact, wouldn’t that be admitting inferiority?
