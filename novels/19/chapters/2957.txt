2958 Who exactly is it?

“Milady—”

Thank you readers!

Pu!

A Sixth Tier spoke up, wanting to beg for mercy, but just as he opened his mouth, a bloody hole had already appeared in his chest.

He wanted to speak, but all that came out of his mouth was blood, and his eyes instantly dimmed.

A Sixth Tier elite was killed just like that?

Whether it was Ling Han or the remaining five elites, they were all shocked speechless.

The strength of a Seventh Tier was really unimaginable.

That Sixth Tier’s eyes were filled with defiance. He was already a Sixth Tier, and there were only a limited dozen or so people that were stronger than him in the entire Genesis World, but now he was killed with a single strike, so how could he be willing to close his eyes?

Jue Huo was unmoved, and there was only an endless coldness on her face. It was as if killing a Sixth Tier did not matter to her at all.

Those below Seventh Tier were all ants.

Ling Han suddenly thought of a saying. Even though they were all Heavenly Venerates, Seventh Tiers were invincible, undying, and indestructible. There was no need for them to give any regard to anyone at all. If they were displeased with someone, they would kill them.

The world was big, but there was no one more powerful than a Seventh Tier.

“Let’s go!” The remaining five elites were all scared out of their wits. So what if they were Sixth Tiers? In front of a Seventh Tier, they were nothing but prey, mere trash.

Jue Huo was cool and beautiful, yet she was also exuding a boundless killing intent. She stretched out her slender hand, and it was as if the five great elites were instantly stopped by an invisible wall. Not one of them managed to escape.

There was only the difference of a single tier, yet it was as if there were multiple mountains separating them. The gulf between them was greater than the gulf between heaven and earth.

The five great elites all showed expressions of despair. Jue Huo was obviously going to destroy them completely, and a Seventh Tier did indeed have that kind of strength. No matter how much they struggled, it was useless.

Pu! Jue Huo was like a goddess of death, destroying a Sixth Tier with a single strike. Her methods were extremely cold and violent, her slender hand directly penetrating through the other party’s chest, not caring at all that her hand was stained with blood.

Pa! She smashed the head of another Sixth Tier, causing blood and brain matter to splatter. A few drops even dripped onto her delicate face, causing her exquisite beauty to have a sliver of demonic cruelty.

In front of a Seventh Tier, a Sixth Tier was actually so weak.

Ling Han knew that Seventh Tier was strong, but he had never imagined that the gap would be so wide.

It was no wonder that though Zhou Heng and Chu Hao were only a line’s breadth away from Seventh Tier, they were still not taken seriously by any Seventh Tier at all. Without taking that last step, they would be trash to the latter.

The remaining three elites resisted with all their might. They were Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, and which of them had not gone through trials and tribulations to reach this step? Even if they were only left with despair, they would still battle to the last drop of their blood.

However, in front of a Seventh Tier, they would only be killed with a single punch or palm strike.

Jue Huo’s killing intent blazed, and her dark red eyes focused on Ling Han. Her eyes were cold and heartless, as if she was looking at a dead body.

She absorbed most of the life essence, but there was still a considerable amount that flowed towards Ling Han. WIth the life essence of six elites added together, this amount still surpassed a single Yue Borong, making Ling Han feel as if he had “earned” it back.

He hurriedly dismissed these strange thoughts quickly, and similarly stared at Jue Huo.

Every single hair on his body stood on end, filled with nervousness. Unbeknownst to him, sweat flowed down his body like a stream, instantly soaking his clothes wet.

Ling Han was even wondering: would he have the time to tear a rip into the Void and flee if Jue Huo wanted to kill him?

Previously, he had not left, and that was the reason. He had been locked by the divine sense of Jue Huo. If he made any rash move, he would definitely suffer a thunderous strike from her. He could not afford to take such a risk.

This was the true strength of a Seventh Tier.

Ling Han sighed in his mind. He had initially thought that he had battle prowess on par with the Sixth Tier, so even if he was faced with such ultimate elites like Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, he could still choose to leave even if he couldn’t defeat them. However, from the look of things now, he had been too assuming.

Jue Huo didn’t speak or make any move. She was just staring coldly at Ling Han.

Ling Han naturally didn’t speak, either. At present, no matter what movements Ling Han made, it would draw an attack from the other party under the influence of his aura.

Since Jue Huo had not made a move all this while, there was still room for him to turn this situation around. Thus, Ling Han did not take any risks.

Of course, if Jue Huo made a move, Ling Han wouldn’t give up without a fight. He would definitely throw everything on the line to fight.

One moment, or an epoch later, Ling Han finally lost all concept of time. He only knew that Jue Huo’s killing intent was finally beginning to subside.

Her eyes had gone back to normal, and were no longer as red as blood.

“Who am I?” she murmured. Her eyes would become fierce at times, and then clear at others, as if two minds were fighting.

“Who are you?” Ling Han asked. He was really outrageously bold. He actually dared to provoke her at a time like this.

“Who am I?!” Jue Huo let out a battle cry, her black locks dancing in the wind. Her figure shot up into the skies. Peng, peng, peng! She directly crashed through the dimension of this level, and all the way upwards, creating a massive hole.

It was unknown which level this was, but all the dimensions on the upper levels had practically been crashed through in an instant. She had already entered into the Void, and there was no sign of her.

Boom! The energy storm surged down from the hole that she had created, turning into a divine waterfall.

Ling Han hurriedly retreated. Jue Huo could ignore this storm of energy and directly penetrate it with her physical body, but he couldn’t. If he was swept up by it, he would definitely be severely wounded.

He left this place, and found a place to go into seclusion so he could refine the life essence that he had gained. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, he released the Empress and Hu Niu from the Celestial Guest Residence. After he explained the situation, both women were stunned.

“Who exactly is this Jue Huo?”

“Is she really a seed that Hysteria had planted in the Genesis World of the last era?”

“However, before she could explode, she was destroyed by that last desperate measure, and this trump card was not used?”

“Hang on, she calls herself Jue Huo. There’s only a slight difference between Fire and Extermination, and if Absolute Extermination is pronounced the other way around… then wouldn’t that be Extermination[1]?”

Extermination was Hysteria’s name in the Genesis World from the last era.

The three of them exchanged looks, their expressions serious.

The Genesis World of the last era had been destroyed, and it was possible that Jue Huo had been unprepared. Thus, her spirit had been wounded by the power of the great destruction, and she was like a blank piece of paper. However, she had absorbed life essence previously, and her instincts had restarted, stimulating her, and causing her violent nature to explode, which led her to unleashing a massacre.

She had not made a move on Ling Han, probably because she had not awakened her memories yet, and had still been thinking about how well she had gotten along with Ling Han previously.

But if the deductions of Ling Han and the others were correct, then when Jue Huo recovered her memory, the entire Genesis World would become her enemy.

This was too terrifying. Hysteria had a helper who was in Seventh Tier, so what kind of terrifying damage would that cause?

“The situation might not be as terrible as that. Who knows, it might be that Jue Huo was stimulated, and that was why she took some drastic actions,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded slowly. “No matter what, I need to increase my strength and advance to the Fifth Tier as soon as possible. Only then will I have the strength to stand against a Seventh Tier.”

Even if he advanced to the Fifth Tier, he would only be able to match a Seventh Tier, because Seventh Tiers were undying and indestructible in terms of physique, and could only be suppressed, but not killed. However, Ling Han could be injured and killed. It would still be unequal.

Ling Han began to search for raw stone mines again. As he continued to cultivate diligently, an incomparably oppressive feeling rose up in him.

[1] A bit confusing here. Basically, the Huo in Jue Huo, “绝火”, only has the difference of a single brush stroke from the word 灭, and if 绝灭 is read the other way round, it would be 灭绝 aka the boss evil that almost destroyed the Genesis World of the last era.
