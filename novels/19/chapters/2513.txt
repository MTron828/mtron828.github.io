Chapter 2514: Change of Mind

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Just then, they had all been speculating about Ling Han’s strength. After all, none of them had caught the instance when Ling Han had sent Yang Zhixuan flying.

Now, however, the situation was completely different. They could all see the scenes in the sky clearly.

Just how powerful was that suit of Battle Armor?

Everyone was aware of this. After wearing it, Yang Zhixuan could even defeat Doka, someone he couldn’t rival with his own strength.

This Battle Armor wasn’t a Celestial Tool, yet it was only slightly inferior to Celestial Tools. It was incredibly rare and valuable.

But now?

Someone had brutally ripped it to shreds with their bare hands!

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!’ ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Who could believe this? This was like a scene out of a legendary tale. Even though they were witnessing it with their own eyes, they could still barely believe what they were seeing.

After tearing the Battle Armor to shreds, Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. He had overestimated this suit of Battle Armor. He had initially thought that it was very sturdy, but as it turned out, it was only so-so. It was only defensively powerful thanks to the symbols engraved on its surface, which allowed it to form a powerful defensive barrier of light.

Of course, if one’s strength couldn’t suppress the Battle Armor by too much, it would indeed appear to be indestructible and invincible. Moreover, it could even regenerate itself.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Should we continue this battle?”

Yang Zhixuan instinctively shook his head. Even with the suit of Battle Armor, he had still been no match for Ling Han. Thus, what was the point of continuing the battle?

......

Most importantly, Ling Han still appeared as if he were an extremely weak person. This contrast was far too great, and it was almost impossible to accept.

Ling Han slowly descended from the sky. This wasn’t on purpose. Rather, if he wanted to fly, he had to rely on the power of Regulations. However, in terms of his mastery of the Regulations, he was only at the Dividing Soul Tier. Thus, this was the limit of his speed.

Everyone was rendered speechless upon seeing this. No matter how they looked, Ling Han was only at the Dividing Soul Tier. However, he had managed to defeat a mighty Celestial King.

“L-Lord Ling!” Tang Chi and Xu Qiang said in a reserved manner upon seeing Ling Han land as they walked over.

This was a freakish person who could easily defeat a Second Heaven Celestial King! Would they still dare to refer to Ling Han as a brother?

Ling Han smiled in reply, yet he didn’t say anything to console them. After all, his strength was indeed far superior to that of these two people. In a world where the hierarchy of power meant everything, it was indeed impossible for them to act as equals.

“It was fun hanging out with you guys. If you ever encounter any troubles in the future, you can come to the academy to find me,” Ling Han said to them.

“Thank you, Lord!” Tang Chi and Xu Qiang replied in delight. To say nothing of whether they could actually gain an audience with Ling Han in the future, just the fact that he had said this in public before so many people was already enough. This would act as a warning for other people. If they dared to target Tang Chi and Xu Qiang, they might possibly incur Ling Han’s wrath.

Ling Han nodded in reply. After this battle, he was confident that the martial academy would definitely send someone over to meet him.

He left the marketplace, returning to the small village. He would wait for the people from the martial academy here.

Since he was free anyway, he decided to put on a disguise and visit the tavern again. Right now, he was still extremely unfamiliar with the martial academy.

While sitting around in the tavern, he heard the spirited discussions of many people.

“If we’re talking about the most powerful new disciple of the martial academy, that’s got to be Huo Furong!” someone shouted after having one too many drinks. He was arguing with someone else, and he continued, “According to rumors, she actually possesses an origin flame! Just this alone is already enough for her to crush Celestial Kings at the same level.

“Moreover, she’s indescribably powerful to begin with, and I’ve heard that her Evolution Index is extremely close to 12!”

He was extremely loud, and his comments instantly caused the surrounding customers to reply with an “oh.” Only a pitifully few people possessed an Evolution Index above 10, not to mention an Evolution Index of close to 12.

“I say, Ji Wuming is the most powerful!” someone said in disagreement. “In a short one million years, he’s already soared from the First Heaven to the Third Heaven! Who can compete with such progress?”

“No, Lord Luan Xing is the most powerful! There’s no reason for this, other than the fact that Lord Luan Xing is the most beautiful! Her beauty is unrivaled through the ages!” someone shouted.

This viewpoint won the support of many people. Everyone nodded in agreement. Even those who supported Huo Furong and Ji Wuming had to concede that she was indeed unbelievably beautiful.

Ling Han smiled in his mind. His wife was indeed stunningly beautiful. Even he felt extremely smug about this.

A grossly drunk person suddenly stood up, and said, “No, no, no, even though these people are all very powerful, which of them can rival Lord Heavenborn?”

The tavern instantly fell silent.

“…That person’s an absolute demon. Just because someone slandered him behind his back, he destroyed an entire city as revenge!” someone said with a pale expression.

“But his talent is far too impressive! Two Heavenly Venerates actually argued over the right to take him as a disciple! In fact, they even threw hands!

“Even as strong as Huo Furong is, she’s only at the Third Heaven. However, Lord Heavenborn is already at the Fifth Heaven! His cultivation speed is unrivaled in all ages! No one can compare to him!

“His strength had already far exceeded those at the same generation as him. In fact, only the older generation of prodigies can compare to him.

“For example… A’mu.”

“There’s also Can Yue.”

“And Du Shiyi.”

The others also chimed in with several names. Each one of these prodigies was powerful enough to make heaven and earth lose its luster.

“These people have already reached the peak stage of the Nine Heaven long ago, and they’re only a single step away from reaching the Heavenly Venerable Tier. All they need is a suitable opportunity.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. Heavenborn’s power was far superior to those at the same cultivation level as him.

“I’ve heard rumors that the same dimension also produced another prodigy. In fact, Lord Zhou Heng even left a Dimensional Transfer Seal for him. Since he’s regarded with such importance, he can’t be much weaker than Lord Heavenborn, right?” someone suddenly said.

Ling Han’s ears immediately perked up. Were they not talking about him?

Upon hearing this, the others instantly clicked their tongues in wonder. Zhou Heng was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, almost belonging to the strongest echelon of elites. His every action would attract the gaze of others.

“Heh, I’ve heard that he’s already dead?” someone else said in disdain.

“I’ve also heard that. He was enemies with Lord Heavenborn, and in the end, he was slain by Lord Heavenborn.”

“To become enemies with Lord Heavenborn… He deserved to die.”

“If he’s alive, one million years have already passed, so why has he still not appeared?”

“He’s already a dead person, so what does it matter how astonishingly prodigious he was? All of that is worthless.”

Many people shook their heads, expressing their extreme disdain for Ling Han.

Ling Han was extremely displeased upon seeing this. These people had never seen him before, so how could they possibly know that he was incapable?

Heavenborn was indeed very powerful, but that was because he was the embodiment of the Celestial Realm. His physique was astounding, and he had also been tempered by fundamental power before. Thus, his battle prowess was naturally terrifying.

However, all of this was because of his incredible birth. Moreover, one had to realize that the Celestial Realm was only a low-level dimension. In fact, it was a super low-level dimension. Thus, even though it had “cheated” and created an embodiment of itself, the growth of this person would definitely have a limit.

At most, he could only become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate due to his background. Afterward, he would need to rely on himself and his opportunities to advance any further.

If Ling Han wanted to suppress Heavenborn, he would need to possess an upper hand in terms of cultivation level. After reaching the Heavenly Venerable Tier, however, Heavenborn’s advantage due to his physique would also vanish. This was because Divine Metal couldn’t withstand the destructive power of Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han was extremely confident in himself. Moreover, he would also cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll diligently, fighting to raise his physique to the level of Divine Metal as well. At that time, he wouldn’t suffer a disadvantage when facing off against Heavenborn again.

At this moment, a thought suddenly occurred to him. Before cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to a pinnacle level, he definitely couldn’t reveal his true identity. Otherwise, what would he do if he came across Heavenborn?

Perhaps he could only flee?

However, he didn’t want to be on the back foot. Thus, concealing his identity was most likely the best choice.

He silently stood up and left, not returning to the inn. Instead, he strode away from the village, directly setting off for the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.
