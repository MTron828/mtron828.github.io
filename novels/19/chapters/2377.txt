Chapter 2378: Visiting family

Luan Tianjun immediately scoffed. How shameless. To actually want to develop relations with the descendants of a Celestial King? Just how shameless was this?

“Just who do you think you are!!” he retorted disdainfully.

Pa!

The Empress moved, and delivered a slap right on Luan Tianjun’s face, which suddenly sent him flying.

So what if they were family? If they actually dared disrespect Ling Han, she would pummel even her own siblings.

Luan Tianjun got back to his feet, holding his cheek with his right hand, and showing an expression of both fury and shame.

Just who was he? He was the descendant of a Celestial King, and someone actually dared to strike him? More importantly, the one who struck him was actually a woman at that, which was unacceptable to him, who was an extreme male chauvinist, and he was humiliated and infuriated to the extreme.

“You, how dare you!!” he shouted lowly as he sent out a signal for reinforcements.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and advised, “Young man, you should be less proud and humbler in the future. In this world, there are a great many people that are stronger than you, and you should always be respectful, or you will be dead before you even knew it.”

This was really a genuine piece of advice from him. The Nine Snake Tribe had only had a Celestial King before, and they were a target that was beaten down on at that; how many forces would feel wary about attacking them?

If this brat still acted so arrogant when he ventured out, he would definitely lose his life the moment he encountered anyone with great strength or a powerful background.

How could Luan Tianjun be willing to listen? He only knew that he had suffered an extraordinary humiliation. His eyes glared furiously at Ling Han, as if the one who had slapped him was not the Empress, but rather Ling Han. He did not immediately refute him, because he knew that he could not afford to mess around with this group of people.

It was fine. HIs reinforcements would soon be arriving.

As expected, only a while later, a loud whistle rang out, and a figure in black arrived in a flash.

He was a young man in a tight-fitting black suit. He was extremely handsome, and it was clear that the Nine Snake Tribe possessed very attractive looks. He was filled with heroic spirit, and it seemed like there was a great furnace inside his body, exuding a frightening aura.

It was obvious he was still very young, but astonishingly, he was already in the Immortal Palace Tier. His talent was indeed extraordinary.

This was also the reason for his soaring pride. He stood, arms crossed behind his back. It was only when he set eyes on the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou that his eyes shone involuntarily, but he managed to hide it very well. He was still looking very arrogant.

“Greetings, Clansman Sang!” Luan Tianjun hurriedly paid his respects, seeming extremely respectful, and making it seem like this was not a fellow clansman, but like he was a servant that was meeting his master.

Luan Sang nodded proudly, and then asked, “What is going on here?”

“They barged into our Forbidden Land, and even attacked me!” Luan Tianjun quickly made his complaint.

This Luan Sang was one of the strongest of the younger generation. Even outside, he would still be considered one of the elites, and it was definitely no issue for him to suppress Ling Han and his group.

Luan Sang humphed, and only then surveyed Ling Han and his group, stating calmly, “I shall give you a chance to explain. Why have you barged into the Forbidden Land of our tribe?” If it was not because of the Empress and the others, he would definitely not be so amicable, and would directly suppress them.

Ling Han said to the Empress, “Your family do not seem very friendly!” Then, turning his head, he said, “Is this a Forbidden Land? Why did we not see any plaque that said ‘This is a Forbidden Land, no trespassers allowed’ when we landed on the island?”

“Humph, this is the ancestral grounds of our Nine Snake Tribe; how could others be allowed to commit sacrilege here!” Luan Sang declared menacingly. His eyes burned with killing intent. Ling Han was the only man in his group, so he was displeased at this, no matter how he looked at it.

Hence, he would find a reason to get rid of him.

“Hehe, it is yours just because you say it is?” Ling Han retorted with a laugh.

“You dare to insult our line, you are seeking death!” Luan Sang moved aggressively, delivering a palm strike to Ling Han.?Boom, a brilliant light filled the skies.

He had cultivated his third Mystery Realm, and now these three Mystery Realms were glowing simultaneously, exploding with terrifying power. As his strike shot out, it turned into a primordial great beast.

“Go!” Bewitching Maiden Rou moved. She waved her slender hand, which looked like it was made from jade, but that primordial great beast was instantly shattered upon contact. It could not even withstand a single blow.

Luan Sang couldn’t help but feel greatly shocked. He had always had a very high opinion of himself, and thought, what other more outstanding prodigy could there be aside from himself in this world. But the flame of life burning in Bewitching Maiden Rou looked like it had only been burning for several million years. How could she be stronger than him?

When they were of the same cultivation level, he should be the strongest.

…Actually, Bewitching Maiden Rou had still reserved some power. Though she had not recovered the cultivation level that she should have had at the Ascending Origin Tier, she had already returned to Fifth Secret Immortal Palace Tier, and added with how she had refined some Source Power, she actually already possessed a portion of the might of the Ascending Origin Tier.

Luan Sang was not an Eleventh Secret monarch star, either, but rather just a Third Secret emperor tier. He was completely someone that the Bewitching Maiden Rou could insta-kill. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His heart was apprehensive, and he couldn’t help but ask, “Just who exactly are you people?”

“All right, no more jokes,” Ling Han said, smiling. “This wife of mine also has the surname of Luan, and belongs to your line of the Nine Snake Tribe. We initially planned to return to the ancestral grounds to pay our respects, but we did not expect that we would still be able to actually encounter her clansmen.”

“This…” Luan Sang looked towards the Empress, and paused. “Since you belong to the bloodline of our Nine Snake Tribe, you should possess the mystical power of our bloodline, correct?”

Actually, the Empress could not even be bothered to recognize these clansmen of hers. With how proud she was, she thought she was ruler of the entire world. Aside from Ling Han, everyone else should bow down to worship her.

However, Ling Han thought that she should still recognize them, so she reluctantly agreed. With a thought, her nine doppelgangers appeared.

Luan Sang was moved. The line of the Nine SNake Tribe could form their own doppelgangers. This was a unique ability that belonged solely to them, but because of the purity of bloodline, some clansmen could manifest five or six doppelgangers, while others could only manifest one or two.

Someone who could manifest nine like the Empress was indeed very, very rare. There were merely two that possessed this ability in the entire Nine Snake Tribe now.

“So we are a family!” Luan Sang nodded, a smile appearing on his face. “Come, come, come. Everyone, please follow me. The ancestor will definitely be extremely pleased.”

He made an inviting gesture, and then led the way in front of them.

Ling Han smiled, and followed his lead, with the Empress and the other women in tow.

Meanwhile, Luan Tianjun was extremely depressed. The Empress had slapped him, which was a great humiliation in his eyes, but it looked like he would not be able to get his revenge for this.

…The Empress had nine doppelgangers, and this was a proof of the purest bloodline of the Nine Snake Tribe. The ancestor would definitely value this incredibly and treasure her highly, so how could he possibly get his chance for revenge?

With Luan Sang leading the way, Ling Han and the others ascended the mountain. Actually, it only had the height of about three kilometers. Very soon, they arrived at the summit. This broken peak was unusually flat, and it could practically claim to be as smooth as a mirror.

Perhaps an elite had cut it with a Divine Sword all those years ago, and that was why the broken peak appeared so smooth and even.

Ling Han sent out a strike with a finger, testing the toughness of this rock.

Weng, seals actually flashed on the mountain, though they were broken seals. Very quickly, they dimmed again, but they still completely eliminated the force of Ling Han’s strike.

Luan Sang couldn’t help but explain proudly, “This is the ancestral grounds of our Nine Snake Tribe, and has been refined through a supreme secret technique by an ancestor many years ago. It is comparable to a Celestial Tool!”

Ling Han only responded with a smile, though he was shaking his head internally.

It looked like the members of the Luan Clan were still living in the remaining shadow of their ancestor. They kept talking about the Nine Snake Tribe and how great their Celestial King had been all those years ago, yet did not even think about how they had already lost the protection of a Celestial King long ago. Where did they still get this feeling of superiority from?

This mountain was indeed very tough, but it was only that. Otherwise, it would not have been cut in half in the past.

Seeing the lack of concern in Ling Han’s expression, Luan Sang couldn’t help but humph internally as his animosity increased even further.
