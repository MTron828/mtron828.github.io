1531 Surrounded by Saints

“How dare you!!” the Tranquil Heart Saint roared in rage. This person actually dared to kidnap his disciple before his eyes? Did this person think that he was a pushover?

He lashed out with his palm, his might as a Saint also emanating outward. Even heaven and earth would lose their luster when a Saint unleashed their fury.

Hu Yingmu humphed upon seeing this. He had no choice but to retract his hand and parry the Tranquil Heart Saint’s attack.

Even though he viewed himself as far superior to the Tranquil Heart Saint, his opponent was still a fellow Saint, after all. Thus, how could he dare to face the Tranquil Heart Saint’s attack without any defenses? That would be seeking death!

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a strike, sending bursts of shock waves rippling into the surroundings.

Boom!

The entire campus was instantly obliterated by these devastating shock waves. At the same time, countless people were thrown into the air as if they were mere hay. Some of them vomited blood, while some others suffered even worse fate—they had their arms or legs brutally torn off. At this moment, it was as if the campus had become a living hell.

Fortunately, they still had the Saint-level formation to block some of the shock waves. As such, none of the disciples were killed.

This was the power of Saints. Just a tiny fraction of the shock waves from their exchange was already devastating enough to slaughter countless people. Moreover, this was already in the scenario where there was a Saint-level formation to block some of the shock waves. If they continued to exchange blows like this, the disciples of the academy would definitely suffer huge casualties.

“Damn it!” the Tranquil Heart Saint cursed. His hair was standing on ends, and it was clear that he was beside himself with fury.

Under the influence of the Star Sand Saint, the Tranquil Heart Saint and the other eight Small Saints had all developed a hobby of nurturing young talents. They didn’t necessarily treat each of their disciples as a son or daughter, but they did indeed pour a lot of their time and effort into raising them.

However, the academy that they had developed for so many years was going to be whimsically destroyed just like this? And their disciples were more so going to be wantonly slaughtered? Thus, it was only natural that the Tranquil Heart Saint was incandescent with rage.

“Do you have the right or ability to stop me?” Hu Yingmu sneered. Couldn’t they see that he had come from the Forbidden Land? As such, was his battle prowess one that a Small Saint could rival? He couldn’t care less about the lives of these cultivators. He immediately launched another attack, seeking to suppress the Tranquil Heart Saint.

“You’ve taken things too far!!” the Tranquil Heart Saint roared.

Weng!

The Godly bones in his body lit up as he activated them. He raised a hand, and a burst of sword light instantly swept outward, illuminating the entire sky.

“Hmm?” Hu Yingmu faltered for a moment. He then turned around and retreated several steps. He was slightly astonished. “I’ve indeed underestimated you. You’ve actually managed to transform your own body into a formation.”

The Tranquil Heart Saint remained silent as he continued to launch attacks at Hu Yingmu. His body was surrounded by sword intent, and it was extremely evident that he was truly enraged. His killing intent was already soaring into the sky.

“However, this still isn’t enough to stop me!” Hu Yingmu announced haughtily. “Eight Stones Technique!” His muscles started to bulge up, and he quickly transformed into a gigantic rock golem. Each rock that he was composed of was like an indestructible Saintly Material.

That was right, his body would be as tough as Saintly Material of the same level when he channeled the Eight Stones Technique!

“You’re nothing but a mere ant!” He wore an expression of utter disdain as he charged at the Tranquil Heart Saint.

In the eyes of those from the Forbidden Lands, cultivators from the Immortal Realm were nothing but mere ants. This would be the case even if they were Genesis Tier Saints. At most, they could only be considered as slightly more powerful ants. This was an innate contempt that they held.

The two Saints were locked in an intense battle. Meanwhile, the others were all fleeing for their lives. Otherwise, they would definitely be killed if they were accidentally hit by a shock wave from the battle.

Weng, weng, weng, weng!

Several golden paths streaked over one after another. The Black River Saint, Dawn Cloud Saint, and the remaining eight Small Saints had all rushed over. They acted in unison and immediately dissipated the shock waves that were surging into the surroundings. If they didn’t do so, the disciples would definitely suffer a casualty rate of over 60%.

Moreover, these Small Saints hadn’t come by themselves. In fact, they were all accompanied by some disciples from their own campuses. Of course, these were all the most outstanding disciples.

With his worries gone, and with eight other Small Saints to guard the surroundings, the Tranquil Heart Saint instantly unleashed his full battle prowess.

However, Hu Yingmu truly hadn’t been lying. He was indeed more powerful than the Tranquil Heart Saint!

This was especially the case now that he was channeling the Eight Stone Technique. His physique was astonishing, and few at the same cultivation level as him would be able to wound him. Put simply, he was near undefeatable. This was also the reason why he dared to provoke others so wantonly, and the reason that he looked down upon other Saints.

“What? The Tranquil Heart Saint is actually being suppressed by him?!”

“It can’t be... Although the Tranquil Heart Saint is the eighth out of the Star Sand Saint’s nine disciples, his battle prowess is definitely powerful enough to rank within the top three.”

“Don’t worry! We have nine Saints on our side!”

The disciples were all engrossed by the spectacular battle. Saints were synonymous with invincibility in their minds, yet a battle between two Saints would naturally yield a victor and a loser. It was just that they hadn’t expected Hu Yingmu to be more powerful.

“Humph!” The Dīpankara Saint and Hardship Alchemy Saint leaped forward and joined the battle in unison. If they didn’t act now, it would only be a matter of time before the Tranquil Heart Saint was defeated.

“To say nothing of three Saints, I’ll still suppress you if all nine of you join!” Hu Yingmu said with a sneer. These Saints had relied on themselves to discover the Saintly Dao. Thus, how could their Dao rival the inheritances from the Forbidden Lands?

Hu Yingmu roared as he swung his fists in unison, unleashing a boundless power.

His three opponents didn’t dare to face his attack head-on. In fact, they had no option but to continuously retreat.

The Torrential Rain Saint and Iron Saber Saint exchanged a glance before both leaping over to join the battle as well.

However... they were still unable to gain the upper hand!

Everyone was stunned. They were all Saints, so how did their battle prowess differ by so much? This wasn’t a small gap in power, but rather a huge gulf in power! The five Saints had teamed up, yet they were still unable to suppress Hu Yingmu. In fact, Hu Yingmu was the one who was enjoying the advantage!

This was unbelievable!

Now that it had come to this, the remainder of the nine Saints had no choice but to join the battle. Only then were they able to wrest back some momentum. However, defeating Hu Yingmu was nothing more than a pipedream.

“That’s enough!” a calm voice suddenly said. This voice was like the intent of heaven and earth, and it was not something that the cultivators could resist.

“Master!” The nine Saints naturally pulled away from the battle.

A conflicting look appeared on Hu Yingmu’s face. In the end, however, he still decided to stop. “So there was still another Saint! Your strength is above mine, so I wasn’t able to detect you at all.”

Even though he said this, the look of haughtiness on his face wasn’t dampened in the slightest. This was because he was a member of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land. Any random grand elder from there could easily crush the cultivators of the Immortal Realm.

“You can leave now,” the Star Sand Saint said calmly.

“Fine. Hand the culprit over, hand the treasures over, and... also hand that woman over.” Hu Yingmu pointed at Empress Luan Xing as he spoke. Just then, he had only discovered her otherworldly beauty. Now that he looked more carefully, he discovered that even her physique was freakishly powerful. She definitely possessed a Divine Fetus!

If he had children with this woman, they would definitely possess unparalleled talent!

“You’ve crossed the line!” the Star Sand Saint said coldly. In his eyes, his disciples weren’t just his disciples. They were also his face and his reputation. If he failed to protect even his disciples, then what right did he have to be a Great Saint?

In any case, Hu Yingmu was just a Small Saint. Regardless of how powerful he was, the fact remained that he was a Small Saint.

“Friend...” Hu Yingmu began. The nine Saints were furious upon hearing this. Hu Yingmu was but a Small Saint, yet he was actually referring to their esteemed master as “friend”. Was he trying to speak on the same level as their master?

How audacious!

However, Hu Yingmu was unfazed by their furious glares, and he continued, “You can’t begin to imagine just how powerful the place that I come from is. If you disobey me, all of you... will die!”

“Humph!” The Star Sand Saint was also unable to contain his anger any longer. A large hand instantly descended from the sky and swatted at Hu Yingmu. The Star Sand Saint didn’t even need to show himself. The gulf in power between a Great Saint and a Small Saint was analogous to the gulf in power between a Mountain River Tier cultivator and a mere mortal. It was insurmountable.

Boom!

To say nothing of blocking this attack, Hu Yingmu didn’t even have the ability to flee from this attack. He instantly disappeared under the large hand.

However, there was a sudden flash of gray light.

Pa!

The large hand was surprisingly shattered, revealing Hu Yingmu’s unscathed figure.

Gasp! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Even a Great Saint couldn’t contain him?!
