2721 Defeat!

Who could’ve expected such a result?

For a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to say that he would allow a Celestial King the first nine moves, anyone would think this was a natural course of events. To speak nothing of nine moves, even 900 would not be anything strange.

Yet what was the result? This was only the sixth move, and the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had no choice but to break the agreement and move to counter.

How could there be such a powerful Celestial King?

“Come on, I have no interest in taking advantage of you,” Ling Han stated evenly, crooking a finger at He Yufeng.

Since He Yufeng had already moved, he would naturally not continue to be reserved. What was the point of continuing the act?

“Ling Han, I have underestimated you,” he said in a dark tone.

Ling Han shook his head. “What I want to hear is not these words.”

“What do you want to hear?” He Yufeng asked.

“You owe me an apology,” Ling Han stated seriously.

Previously, He Yufeng had used his superior position as a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, as well as the fact that he had an old man that was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, to just break the rules of the martial academy without concern, demanding that Ling Han submit and become his servant. He even wanted to kill the latter.

This was unjust, and what Ling Han despised the most was injustice. Thus, he wanted to demand an explanation for this.

“A puny Ninth Heaven.” He Yufeng’s face was filled with disgust.

Even if Ling Han had already proven his strength, he still thought that there was no way that Ling Han could be his equal. This was the pride of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“I will have to beat you into submission then!”

Peng! Ling Han bounced, and charged forwards with force, rushing towards He Yufeng.

There was naturally no way He Yufeng would be afraid. He clashed directly with Ling Han.

Two forces at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier clashed intensely. Both of them had a determination that would not allow them to lose, and both of them went all out. All their moves held nothing back, clashing with blood-boiling intensity.

In terms of battle prowess, there was not much difference between the two. They were both at the late-stage Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, but Ling Han’s physique was extremely tough and comparable to Divine Metal. Even if he did not fight back, it was still extremely difficult for He Yufeng to use brute force to penetrate his defense, and with Ling Han’s recovery ability added into the equation, it was possible that he could not even wound Ling Han.

Hence, the longer their battle progressed, the more disadvantageous it was for He Yufeng. Ling Han was completely unafraid of trading injury for injury, but He Yufeng was filled with wariness. He did not dare to forcefully clash with Ling Han like this, and this meant that he began to have reservations in the battle.

Peng!

Long-term defense would ultimately lead to defeat, and He Yufeng finally sustained a punch from Ling Han. Suddenly, he stumbled backwards, and his face flushed red before he spat out a mouthful of blood.

But he did not have the time to catch his breath at all before Ling Han’s attack was heading his way again. He had no choice but to parry.

Peng!

Several dozen moves later, He Yufeng sustained another punch. Fortunately, whether it was him or Ling Han, they could not possibly channel the Heavenly Venerate Technique all the time. Thus, this punch had not been delivered with the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll or the Five Elements Lightning Technique.

Peng, peng, peng! He Yufeng was continuously hit, and he was also continuously throwing up blood.

“He Yufeng, do you remember that I have said this? That even the wrath of an ordinary man can still cause blood to splash three feet?” Ling Han asked. “Now, I have another saying to bestow on you: tides will turn, and power will also shift hands, so do not bully a youth when he is weak!”

He Yufeng shouted in extreme fury. To be taught a lesson by a puny Ninth Heaven Celestial King… How could he bear such humiliation?

“A mere brat, you have gone too far!!” he roared furiously, trying his best to counterattack, yet had completely no power to turn this situation around.

Faced with Ling Han, who possessed a physique of Divine Metal and battle prowess of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, it was useless no matter how hard he tried.

“Lower your head and admit your mistake, and I would not think any less of you,” Ling Han said.

“In your dreams!” He Yufeng said through gritted teeth. He would rather die than submit.

“Then I will just have to beat you into submission.” Ling Han delivered a mad barrage of punches, holding no mercy for his opponent at all.

Crack! He Yufeng’s bones were broken forcefully, but he was very headstrong, and did not even groan.

But so what? Would this cause Ling Han to have any mercy?

Finally, He Yufeng could not help but grunt in pain. The injuries he had sustained were really too heavy.

“Enough!” Nong Gaolin rushed into the skies. He definitely could not allow Ling Han to defeat He Yufeng. This was not just He Yufeng’s defeat, but would also humiliate the whole circle of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tiers.

For a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to be outmatched by a Ninth Heaven, what kind of joke was that?

“Sure then, all of you come together.” Ling Han laughed loudly, holding absolutely no fear.

His physique was too tough. Even if he had to fight two people alone, he would not be disadvantaged at all. His target was very clear, and that was to just attack He Yufeng. As for Nong Gaolin, he ignored him completely, and allowed the former to attack him as he liked.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel numb. Two great Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were still unable to stop Ling Han?

Heavens, what kind of monster was this?

Wu Yuanqing hesitated for a moment, and then charged towards Ling Han as well, stopping Ling Han from perpetuating his “crime.”

But it was still useless.

Ling Han’s physique was already tough enough to allow him to have no fear of the attacks of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. The attacks they delivered could only leave behind grooves on Ling Han’s body, but before they could pursue their advantage, these grooves would rapidly recover.

Was he even a human? This was practically a monster.

Lou Tianqian also joined the ranks of battle, and there were even more Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. They were already deeply involved in this. If so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were still unable to stop Ling Han, how would they be able to raise their heads high in the future after this?

“We attack together!” The remaining Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates also moved as well.

It could not be denied that the combined force of over 20 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates was really too strong. Even if they still could not wound Ling Han, it was an easy feat for them to stop him. As long as each of them delivered a single punch, that would form a terrifying amount of power, and forcefully strike Ling Han backwards.

He Yufeng finally broke free of this dangerous situation.

Ling Han stood still, and did not make another move.

It was actually very simple for him to break this stalemate; he only had to draw the Divine Demon Sword. With the Heavenly Venerate Tool in hand, he could conquer anyone. These Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could only flee in various directions.

But once the Divine Demon Sword was drawn, that would result in either death or severe injury, and this would no longer be something as simple as a “spar.”

At the moment, Ling Han only wanted to teach He Yufeng a lesson. He had no plans to throw himself into it too.

“He Yufeng!” Ling Han stood in the air, looking down. “Do you feel any regret now? For those who use their superior position to bully others, there would come a day when they would also be bullied. Do you yield?”

He Yufeng gritted his teeth. He naturally did not want to yield, but since he was outmatched, what was the point of speaking tough?

Previously, though Ling Han had lost to him, the former was only a Seventh Heaven Celestial King. Though he had lost, it was an honorable defeat. But now?

Ling Han was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, yet had used his genuine strength to defeat He Yufeng. What else could the latter say? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Now, even speaking one more word would only make him even more humiliated.

Ling Han laughed loudly, descended, and said, “Wife, let’s go.”

The Empress nodded, and left hand in hand with Ling Han.

Yet everyone was still in a state of shock. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King had actually pointed a finger at the nose of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate and lectured him face-to-face. This was something unprecedented.

“How could a Ninth Heaven Celestial King possibly be so strong?”

This was something that everyone could understand even less.

“That’s right. This is strength beyond description. It is completely impossible.” Everyone shook their head. How could there possibly be such a strong Ninth Heaven Celestial King in this world?

Yet someone sighed slowly, and said, “It is possible, but this kind of prodigy is much, much too rare.”

“How could that be?” Everyone was in disbelief.

That person countered, “Could it be that you guys have forgotten Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu?”

“These lord and lady!” Everyone inhaled sharply. Lin Youlian and Xin Qihy were both absolute legends—they could be ranked in the general leaderboard, and had used such little time to accomplish this. This naturally was a miracle that would have praises sung about it for generations.

Furthermore, the battle merits of these two people had been produced through real battle. There was not the slightest exaggeration involved at all.
