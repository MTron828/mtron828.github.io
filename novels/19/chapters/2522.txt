Chapter 2523: Sorting him out

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What’s wrong with you?” Zhuo Kai laughed loudly. For a great Third Heaven Celestial King to actually look so embarrassing, this was really too funny.

The purple-robed young man coughed continuously, and could not even speak. He merely pointed a finger behind Zhuo Kai’s back.

Zhuo Kai was curious, and turned his head. Instantly, he felt a chill rise up this spine as he almost called out in spite of himself.

…A face had suddenly appeared at the window of the carriage. Who else could it be but the person he had previously mocked?

He had to be seeing things; the other party actually caught up to them so soundlessly. Was he planning to scare them to death?

Moreover, the carriage was clearly still advancing at a rapid speed, yet this man could actually keep up with them. His speed was shockingly stable. Just what kind of monster was this?

“Country bumpkin, scram!” Zhuo Kai shouted loudly, feeling a slight burst of anger at his own embarrassment. He had actually gotten a scare.

In the Flaming Frost Realm, there were actually a great many people that felt great prejudice towards outsiders, and thought that it was they that had snatched away too many opportunities that originally should have been theirs. This was a very great conflict. If it weren’t for the fact that there were a considerable number of powerful figures suppressing this conflict, it would probably have long since resulted in the outburst of an intense civil war.

Zhuo Kai was a “local,” and had never liked outsiders. That was why he had deliberately shown himself and thrown out a mocking remark when he had previously passed by Ling Han.

At first, he had thought that Ling Han would definitely be no match for him in terms of speed, since he had been surpassed by the carriage. Who would have thought that that was not Ling Han’s full speed at all?

Ling Han humphed, and demanded, “Apologize!”

Actually, he was a very amicable person. If others did not trifle with him, he would not offend others of his own volition, either.

But who asked Zhuo Kai to be so wretched, and insist on provoking him?

Then he would show the other what his temper was like.

“Get lost!” Zhuo Kai calmed himself, and immediately waved out an arm, sending out a gust of power.

He, too, was a Third Heaven Celestial King. This strike was extremely shocking, and had terrifying might.

Ling Han shot out a casual punch.?Boom, this gust of power was instantly and incredibly easily obliterated.

“What!?”

The purple-robed young man also paled in shock. He had not thought that Ling Han’s strength would be so great. Hurriedly, he moved as well, and delivered a palm strike, aimed straight for Ling Han’s shoulder.

Xiu, Ling Han’s figure disappeared from the window in a flash.

Zhuo Kai and his companion sighed in relief. What kind of person was this? Why was his strength so terrifying?

Thankfully, they had managed to throw him off their tail in the end.

It was at this very moment that they felt the carriage shudder, and then they were both thrown into the air.

‘What’s going on?’

Peng, the carriage fell onto the ground, releasing a massive bang. At the same time, a powerful impact also ensued. After all, at such a great speed, the carriage suddenly overturning would naturally cause a frighteningly strong impact.

Peng, peng, peng.?Zhuo Kai and his companion were violently shaken inside the carriage. Thankfully, they were Celestial Kings, after all. As they channeled their Regulations respectively, they both floated in midair, a protective layer of light wrapped around them resisting the force of the impact.

After the carriage had stopped completely, they also pushed open the door of the carriage and walked out. Immediately, they got a scare because the great dragon that was playing the role of their steed was already lying on the ground, its claws facing skywards. A large bump had also risen on its head. Clearly, someone had knocked it out cold.

The culprit was… Ling Han!

They saw a man that was standing right next to the carriage. His arms were crossed behind his back, exuding the air of a show-off.

“How dare you!!” Zhuo Kai roared in fury. “You dare to attack even my steed; are you tired of living?”

This was the pride of a “local”; they would always look down on outsiders.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. Just how ignorant was this guy? Hadn’t he learned enough of his lesson? He still dared to be so arrogant?

Rubbing his chin, Ling Han said, “Has anyone ever told you that you are ignorant?”

The purple-robed young man nodded internally. He had known Zhuo Kai for some time, and naturally knew that the latter was a little ignorant. Usually, he would make a lot of enemies, but in truth, it was all unnecessary.

If it were not because Zhuo Kai had an ancestor that was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, who knew how many times this brat would have been pummelled, and he might have long since died by now.

Yet Zhuo Kai did not have this kind of self-awareness at all. He was too proud. Because he had an ancestor that was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he considered everyone else below his notice. He humphed. “Kneel down and apologize, or I will make you want to wish for death!”

Ling Han chuckled. This kind of idiot was really ignorant; merely conversing with him was practically a humiliation to his own intelligence. He directly moved, stretching out a large hand, and seal after seal formed.

After he had replenished himself with the Regulations of the Flaming Frost Realm, his battle prowess had already soared directly into the Fifth?Heaven1

, which was practically on the same level as his Body Art. Furthermore, his Body Art was also limited by his own cultivation level. As long as he had not yet advanced into the Fourth Heaven, he would only be limited to this extent. However, with the different Regulations, he was still just at the early stage of the Third Heaven presently, and there was still space for improvement.

Going by Ling Han’s deductions, ultimately, his Body Art and power of Regulation should be equal.

The purple-robed young man and Zhuo Kai both rose up to counter him. The former was a monarch tier, but Zhuo Kai was only an emperor tier. The fact that he managed to enter into the martial academy was due to his ancestor, or there would be absolutely no possibility that he could appear here.

…That was the truth as well. It was his ancestor that had brought Zhuo Kai through the Nine Deaths Formation, and Zhuo Kai had not gained the recognition of the martial academy. Thus, he did not have his own abode, nor did he have any cultivation resources issued by the martial academy. With his own power, he could not leave or enter. He was merely deceiving himself.

What use would their counterattack be?

The descent of Ling Han’s hand was not obstructed at all.?Peng, Zhuo Kai and his companion both trembled at the same time as they involuntarily threw up blood madly, feeling an agony that could not be described.

Only now did Zhuo Kai and his companion know just what kind of hard rock they had crashed into, and they both couldn’t help but turn pale.

Ling Han stroked his chin. “How should I deal with the two of you?”

There was a Heavenly Venerate standing guard here, so murder was definitely forbidden. There were some rules that had to be adhered to.

En, he’d do?that?then.

Once Ling Han was really angered, he naturally would not be appeased so easily.

He broke into a grin, and picked up both the purple-robed young man and Zhuo Kai at the same time. Then, with a burst of power,?pa, the clothing the two were wearing instantly turned into ash.

“Y-you, what do you want to do!?” Both of them were stunned. Even if they were Celestial Kings, so what? They still broke out in a cold sweat in their terror.

Ling Han’s gaze was too evil, right? It couldn’t be that he was the type of pervert that would be interested in raping men, right?

“Don’t worry, don’t worry. My tastes are not that hardcore,” Ling Han replied, laughing.

Zhuo Kai and his companion finally breathed a sigh of relief at this, but then they thought further. ‘Hey, that’s not right. If your tastes are not so hardcore, what are you taking our clothes off for?’

Ling Han first threw the purple-robed man onto the ground, then pushed Zhuo Kai onto him.

At this, both Celestial Kings looked livid.

Ling Han chuckled, and tapped a finger on a specific spot on each of their bodies.

“Ah!” Zhuo Kai and his companion screamed at the same time, feeling as if their hearts had been ripped. Their agony could not be described, and even their bodies were twitching slightly.

However, anyone who saw this scene would exclaim with an “oh” in understanding.

…Two men were doing something shameless, and were even shamelessly moaning and groaning in their lust!

Ling Han was extremely satisfied. His skill in giving others a hard time seemed to have improved further.

This was worth celebrating.

He walked to the great dragon, and lightly patted the latter’s head. A force reverberated out, and this great dragon was instantly awakened.

When the great dragon regained consciousness, it couldn’t help but be enraged upon spotting Ling Han. It was this guy that had blasted it to the ground.

It knew that it was no match for Ling Han, and was about to complain to its master when it suddenly saw a scene that even it could not bear to witness.

‘Oh, my poor draconic eyes!’
