Chapter 1866: 10 Slaps

Even though a great many forces had offered generous conditions, Ling Han did not agree to any one of them.

What a joke. Even if he had become a Holy Son, so what? All those gathered here were only two-star forces and three-star forces. Their influence was too limited.

Only Alchemy City’s range of influence was wide enough. Wasn’t it said that at least 40 percent of all alchemical pills in the Celestial Realm came from Alchemy City? Then, they had more or less coverage of the whole Eastern Celestial Realm.

To become the Young Master of Alchemy City, one would at least have to be a heavyweight character. Then, it would be much easier for Commander Guan to find out where he was. Moreover, using this identity to traverse the boundless seas would have a higher level of safety.

Of course, this would also bring a new problem—the Thundercloud Palace and Zihe Clan.

They obviously would not spare Ling Han. Then, even if they were wary of Roc Palace, they would assassinate him secretly. After all, due to the Celestial Realm being so colossal, with innumerable elites, who would dare say that they were the culprits as long as there was no evidence?

Perhaps they would think that this Ling Han was not that Ling Han. The true Ling Han had already gone to the Western Celestial Realm, and this was only someone bearing the same name.

After all, one was a prodigy of martial arts, yet had now suddenly become a prodigy of alchemy. This transformation was too drastic. How many people would actually believe the two were one and the same?

Ling Han tactfully declined all the offers of recruitment. Some expressed pity, some asked Ling Han to reconsider, and some issued vague threats, and those Ling Han did not pay any attention to, and rebuffed them with cold words, throwing them out.

In Alchemy City, even if they were Dividing Soul Tiers, or Immortal Palace Tiers, would they dare make a move on him?

Maybe an Ascending Origin Tier would. This was a great elite that could write their own rules. Of course, they, too, could play around outside the rules of the game, and who could control them?

A night passed, and a new tournament day had come again.

There was no way to describe Ling Han’s luck.

If you said that he was unlucky, he always managed to encounter such precious treasures like the Heavenly Dao Jade and Nine Heavens Flame. To say nothing of Celestial Kings when they were young, they might not be able to get such treasures even now. But if you thought he was lucky, he would always encounter people like Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun too, which would lead to a series of events.

This time was no exception. He had hopes of getting the Dao Regulating Pill, but the opponent he encountered today was another king tier.

Even though this was a Four-Star City, where there were countless prodigies, there were really not that many that had managed to reach the level of king tier.

But Ling Han repeatedly encountered them. Just what kind of luck did he have?

Today, his opponent was Yi Tianhe, the Holy Son of Crimson Rainbow Sect, a three-star force.

“Young Master Cheng... Why don’t you provide a commentary again today?”

Practically the same group from the day before yesterday and yesterday had appeared, and the spectators had again fixed their eyes on Cheng Fengyun. Battles progressed fiercely in the arena, and there was no shortage of excitement outside, either.

Cheng Fengyun could be considered to have astonishing toughness. Yesterday, he had already eaten a stone chair, and had also paid for the damages because of it, yet he had come again today. It was unknown whether he really had a masochistic inclination by nature.

Wrong, he wanted to rise from where he had fallen.

He did not believe that Ling Han would be able to walk all the way to the end, and this was a firm dispute for him.

“Yi Tianhe is the Holy Son of Crimson Rainbow Sect. Furthermore, his bloodline is also extremely powerful. Even if he is not a Divine Fetus, he possesses strong special abilities, and his strength is superior to Tang Feng’s,” Cheng Fengyun said. In any case, he was not going to support Ling Han.

Everyone only smiled slightly. You f****** said the same thing yesterday, and what happened?

“Then does Young Master Cheng still think that Ling Han would lose?” someone deliberately asked, wanting to force Cheng Fengyun to directly give a definite answer, and not this kind of assessment that was just focused on strength.

Cheng Fengyun gritted his teeth, and said, “This time... Ling Han will definitely lose!”

“Young Master Cheng, why don’t we make another wager?” There would always be people who wanted nothing more than for the world to be in chaos.

Cheng Fengyun glared harshly at that person. What f***** wager? If he won, he would not gain any profits. He had really been too careless yesterday. Today, he was not going to make the same mistake.

“I bet that Ling Han will win!” A very melodious female voice rang out, and a woman with a voluptuous figure walked over. “Do you dare accept the bet?” She looked at Cheng Fengyun.

This naturally was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Yesterday, she had already taken notice of the happenings over here, and discovered that Cheng Fengyun was still determined to pester her husband today, so she was naturally furious. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Cheng Fengyun’s heart rippled. There were not many exquisite beauties as beautiful as the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. They would either be hidden from the world, or marry the young masters of noble clans, and there was no hope for him at all.

“Fine, what should we bet?” His fighting spirit instantly rose.

“If I win, you will slap yourself 10 times,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said.

An angry expression flashed over Cheng Fengyun’s face. A mere Genesis Tier, and she dared to challenge him? ‘Do you think that just because you are a little beautiful, you can be completely unreserved?’ He humphed, and said, “If I win, I will slap you 10 times!”

He would first slap her until she knew the pain, and then he would softly knead with the next few strikes so he could take a little advantage of her.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was displeased. She knew what kind of ideas the other party had. However, what they were betting were 10 slaps, and from this aspect, the other party had not gone overboard.

Thus, she nodded, and said, “All right!”

She was naturally filled with confidence in Ling Han. To say nothing of the fact that it was only a king tier, even if it was an emperor tier, Ling Han had already killed two.

The spectators were naturally even more excited. A wager added with a beautiful woman; they instantly became more exhilarated.

In the arena, Yi Tianhe strode into the ring of battle. He wore a silvery white tight fitting suit, enhancing the slenderness of his figure. His features were also incredibly handsome, enough to incite envy from others.

His natural talent in martial arts was already so high, and he was still so indescribably handsome at that. How were others supposed to live?

He looked at Ling Han, and after a while, he said, “I watched you fight yesterday.”

“How was it?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

“You’re very strong!” Yi Tianhe nodded somberly. “However, I have never had the habit of retreating without a battle. Fighting with an elite like you may compel me to become even stronger.”

Ling Han still smiled. He did not say that fighting with someone like him actually did not bring him the slightest benefit. Furthermore, the other party had not offended him, so he would not get any pleasure from stepping on him.

Then he should just quickly do away with him. Perhaps, when he went to the fourth level, there would be stronger opponents appearing, and he, too, wanted to take a look.

“I hope you will not disappoint me,” Yi Tianhe said.

He began to gather power. Boom, a mighty river surged from the top of his head, soaring straight into the skies. The sounds of water thundered loudly, resembling the appearance of great dao.

“I am Master of the Divine River!” Yi Tianhe declared loudly a few breaths later. His whole person was wrapped in Regulations of Water, while his feet were stepping on the river as he soared in midair. It was like he had turned into a river god.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Come!”

“Charge!” A three-pronged halberd appeared in Yi Tianh’s hands. It was manifested through Regulations of Water. He held it with both hands, and the water under his feet surged, bringing him in a rapid dash towards Ling Han. Then, he stretched out the halberd in a stab.

Boom, the waters rolled out, all turning into the force behind this strike, and surging towards Ling Han in an astonishingly frightening way.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and grabbed out at the three-pronged halberd.

“How dare you!” Yi Tianhe roared angrily. ‘To actually look down on me so far, you are too arrogant.

‘Then you must pay the price!’

The river underneath his feet turned into two clear beasts of jade water, and as their hooves galloped, their speed became faster and faster. The halberd’s blade pierced out rapidly. It was formed from Regulations, and had endless destructive power.

Ling Han only acted like he had not seen it. His right hand descended, and pa, he grabbed the three-pronged halberd.

“Explode!” Yi Tianhe shouted loudly. The Regulations of Water burst, wanting to shatter Ling Han’s hand forcefully through the explosive impact.

Ling Han smiled slightly. Boom, he began to unleash flames that flickered and danced through the whole sky.
