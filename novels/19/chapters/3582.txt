Chapter 3583: Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“All right!” The others all nodded.

Though Ling Han was the “culprit”, Sima Huai had acted as an accomplice, so he naturally could not be spared either.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said to Sima Huai, “How is it? I said your acting was too exaggerated, right?”

Meanwhile, Sima Huai sighed. He felt that he was very engrossed in his performance.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The people in the surroundings had already moved, attacking Ling Han and Sima Huai in unison.

“Sigh, why do you all insist on courting death?” Sima Huai asked calmly. His figure suddenly charged out, as elegant as a ghost. Pu, pu, pu! He shuttled freely through the crowd, and saw streaks of blood spray out. All of them had their heads plucked off, and collapsed dead on the ground.

He killed a dozen over people consecutively, yet there was not a single trace of blood on him. He was elegant and confident.

Meanwhile, the others were almost scared out of their wits. How could this person be so strong?

Since they dared to come and fight over it, they were definitely stronger than Mystery Realm Tier. However, with so many people ganging up on him, he was still able to kill one of them with a single strike. Just how wide was the gap in strength between them?

They all suspected that this person was a Celestial Path elite.

Immediately, someone turned and fled. This kind of god of death was no match, so it was best not to go and seek death.

Where there was one, there would be two. Very soon, the people here had all fled.

Sima Huai turned around, and smiled at Ling Han, “I am still quite loyal. I didn’t implicate you, did I?”

“But I am still very displeased,” Ling Han said calmly.

“So what?” Sima Huai looked towards Ling Han, his eyes suddenly becoming bloodshot, as if they were stained with blood, “You are a good opponent. I think, using your human skin as a table lamp, you should be very beautiful.” ‘Aren’t you an actor? Why have you suddenly become a psycho?’

Ling Han took out the broken piece of the tombstone. He decided to teach this guy a good lesson.

“Haha, you want to use a rock slab to oppose me?” Sima Huai laughed loudly. “Can Ye, looks like you were not named wrongly; you really have a crippled brain.0”

Ling Han’s right hand gripped the piece of the tombstone, while his left hand crooked a finger at Sima Huai, “Come.”

“I’ll oblige you!” Sima Huai attacked.

Ling Han directly threw the rock slab over. Xiu, like a cannonball, it smashed towards Sima Huai.

“Ignorant!” Sima Huai gave a careless flick, and shot out a burst of energy, intending to send the broken piece of the tombstone flying. However, his expression immediately changed, because it was as if the broken piece of the tombstone could not be touched by any technique. The force he had shot out was completely ineffective, and that “brick” was still smashing towards him. At this time, he had already missed the best time to dodge, so he could only cross his arms in front of his face.

Peng!

He felt a pain in his arms, and then his whole body felt uncomfortable. It was as if he had been entwined by Yin Qi. Though this was formless and shapeless, he still had a feeling as if he had been entangled by something.

Pain, pain, pain! He lowered his head, and saw that both his hands were deformed, and his bones must have broken.

He was shocked. What kind of precious tool was this? It was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Ling Han’s figure approached, and followed up with a punch.

Sima Kui hurriedly retreated. It was unknown how seriously injured his hands were, so how could he possibly dare to clash with Ling Han head-on?

Ling Han took advantage of the opening to retrieve the broken piece of the tombstone. He had only thrown this thing out to test it out, but he had not thought that its effects would be so amazing.

“I think you should play the role of a dead man!” He threw a series of punches,

as fast as light.

Sima Huai was both furious and shocked. If he was still in his prime condition, he naturally would not be afraid of this Lightning Fist, but it was as if a few bones had been broken in his hands, and his meridians had also been wounded, so how could he be suited for battle?

He could only retreat, and retreat again and again.

This was utter humiliation. It had always been him to toy with others, yet now, he had actually fallen into such a sorry state.

Feeling the increasing pain in his hands, he no longer lingered in battle. Instead, he turned around and fled.

If Ling Han used Imminent Skyline, he would definitely be able to catch up and send Sima Huai flying. However, this movement technique was extremely likely to expose him, so it was best to use it cautiously.

Forget it. In any case, this guy was already miserable enough.

Ling Han put away the piece of the tombstone, and continued to search for the celestial technique.

He calmed his heart, searched thoroughly, and finally found this celestial technique.

This was a roll of animal hide, which naturally hadn’t been peeled off from a Void Beast. It was a bit old, and when unfolded, it showed a golden condor hunting. Different angles, different opponents, but it was rapidly taking down all enemies.

Yi, wasn’t this some kind of claw technique? Why had it become a golden condor hunting?

“Young man, you can descend the mountain.” A voice rang out by Ling Han’s Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

ear.

Now that he had obtained the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle, he could directly advance into the actual tournament.

Ling Han nodded, though he was a little anxious internally. He did not know if this person had glimpsed the scene when he had wounded Sima Huai just now. Though the broken piece of the tombstone was an ominous object, its effects were astonishing. He had better not let the elites of Celestial Path see this, or they would have evil intentions towards him.

Thankfully, after he descended the mountain, no one came out to look for him. The moment he returned to his courtyard, Ling Han immediately began to cultivate the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle.

This celestial technique was not directly taught, but rather should be comprehended through observing the golden condor’s hunt.

He stared closely, and in his mind, the initially still scene began to move.

It was as if Ling Han had returned to the primitive era. A golden condor with a wingspan of 300 meters flew in the skies, and very soon, he discovered that a giant python that was 300 meters long had appeared below him. It was presently breathing towards the skies. A black Qi flowed back and forth from its mouth, and there was also a bronze bead floating in front of its mouth, which had an indescribable charm to it.

A Core Formation Tier python!

Ling Han immediately thought. Xiu, the golden condor directly launched an attack, swooping down from the skies, its claws rapidly clawing downwards, raising a golden brilliance.

The giant python and the golden condor battled fiercely, yet it was torn to pieces by the golden condor in a few moves.

The scene changed, and the golden condor was once again searching for prey. This time, it focused on a silver rhinoceros, but the sharp horns on its forehead were like blades.

That was a Blade Rhinoceros. According to ancient information, after this kind of Demonic Beast matured, it would be a being of the Core Formation Tier. Furthermore, it was one of the strongest among Core Formation Tiers. That blade-like horn could cut through anything, and was indestructible.

However, the golden condor aggressively launched an attack, directly grabbing this Blade Rhinoceros, rendering its advantage useless. Then, it forcibly tore this rhinoceros into two in midair.

And… and… and…

Ling Han saw scene after scene of the golden condor hunting. There were land-based vicious beasts, vicious fish from the sea, and similarly vicious birds from the air, but they were all torn to shreds cleanly by it.

When all the images disappeared, Ling Han began to appreciate it, turning the attack of the golden condor into a claw technique that he could use.

His comprehension ability was incredibly frightening. One day later, he had already gained a preliminary grasp.

At this time, someone came to deliver a message, telling Ling Han to rush to the plaza in front of Tai Yi Pavilion at ten o’clock tomorrow morning. The actual tournament would be held there.

Aside from Ling Han, there was also Niu Jianhua who had received the message in this courtyard.

In reality, those who had been eliminated had already left the Primordial Sect. Those who remained here were all qualified to participate in the actual tournament.
