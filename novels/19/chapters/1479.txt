Chapter 1480 Summoned by a Sain

Just then, they had still been saying that Ling Han couldn’t possibly have defeated Jia Liang; they had said that this was merely a rumor. However, what now?

Ling Han had defeated another disciple who was just as powerful as Jia Liang right before their very eyes.

He had defeated them head-on, and he hadn’t used any underhanded techniques, either. He had achieved a crushing victory with a single strike.

Everyone was transfixed with shock.

Weng!

The sound of the great dao suddenly traveled over from heaven and earth. At the same time, a golden lotus started to descend from the sky. This was an indescribably blissful scene.

This signified the arrival of a Saint.

Looking up, they could see that the Tranquil Heart Saint had suddenly appeared atop the golden lotus. No one knew how he had arrived, yet it was as if he were always meant to be there.

The Saint swept his gaze over the cultivators. However, he suddenly paused when he saw Ling Han. A look of astonishment spread across his face.

He hadn’t used an air of Primal Chaos to mask his face, and thus everyone could see his expression of astonishment.

This... Saints would be unblinking even if the heavens were to collapse before them. With a casual wave of their hand, they would be able to stabilize and support the sky. Thus, how could they be astonished?

What had he detected from Ling Han? It was extraordinary enough to astonish even a Saint?

However, this also seemed to make sense. After all, who had ever witnessed a Heavenly Body Tier cultivator defeating an Eternal River Tier elite before? This was an elite at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, no less!

The Tranquil Heart Saint observed Ling Han for a moment longer before retracting his gaze, and saying, “We’ll discuss the basic transformations of formations today. Dao begets one, one begets two, two begets three, and three begets all matter...”

The Tranquil Heart Saint started to teach his disciples, explaining profound principles in simple and easily understandable language. As a Saint, his understanding of formations was naturally in-depth and profound. Thus, he was able to clearly explain and analyze all kinds of details easy to miss. The disciples before him continued to nod in realization and understanding.

These were things that they would often neglect. However, pondering it carefully, they realized that their grasp of these areas wasn’t as solid as they had imagined. There was still much room for improvement.

Ling Han also continued to reinforce his knowledge. With this knowledge, he was preparing to tackle Saint-level formations.

Things that were related to Saints were all profound and extraordinary. One would need to accumulate boundless knowledge before they could comprehend Saint-level matters. If one wanted to master Saint-level formations, they would need to fully comprehend all of the foundations of the dao of formations. Merely copying the construction of the formations wouldn’t be enough.

Thus, Ling Han was captivated by the teachings of the Saint. Anyhow, he possessed a Reincarnation Tree, so compared to others, he would have 400 times the amount of time to digest and comprehend this information.

The teachings of the Saint lasted for half a month. After finishing his teachings, the Tranquil Heart Saint suddenly said, “Ling Han, come to the Tranquil Heart Pavilion.”

The Tranquil Heart Pavilion was where the Tranquil Heart Saint normally resided. This pavilion was located inside the eighth campus, and it was most certainly a holy land of the academy. Only a rare few people could enter this pavilion. Usually, only the four big shots would have the right to enter and seek guidance from the Saint.

However, how long had Ling Han been in the academy for? Yet, he was already being summoned by a Saint?

Ling Han nodded in understanding. After the Tranquil Heart Saint left, he started to make his way to the Tranquil Heart Pavilion.

This time, no one dared to block him.

First of all, even an elite at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier hadn’t been able to block him. Thus, if an elite at the high extreme or consummate level didn’t step forward, who would dare to block him? Second of all, he had been summoned by a Saint. Who dared to make a Saint wait?

“It’s that large black dog!”

“F*ck! The despicable dog has appeared again!”

“Beat it to death!”

However, the attention of the disciples was instantly drawn away by the large black dog. Everyone stared at the large black dog. Just then, they had been completely focused on the teachings of the Saint. As a result, they only discovered the large black dog now. Several thousand disciples instantly charged forward, all of them wearing menacing expressions. It was as if they wanted to swallow the large black dog whole.

What kind of deplorable sin had the large black dog committed? He had actually attracted the fury of so many people?

Ling Han expressed sympathy in his mind. However, he didn’t stop to help.

It wasn’t long before he arrived before the Tranquil Heart Pavilion. In fact, this was just a small courtyard that had a small pavilion within it. There was an air of antiquity about this place. There was a young boy standing before the gate of the courtyard, and upon seeing Ling Han, he immediately said, “It’s Senior Brother Ling Han, am I right? The Saint said that you can enter by yourself.”

Ling Han glanced at the young boy. He was at the Eternal River Tier. Moreover, he was far older than his outward appearance would suggest. There were wrinkles on his head, and there was more so a feeling of age and death emanating from his body.

This was most likely an old man who had already lived for hundreds of millions of years and followed the Tranquil Heart Saint the entire time. However, the lifespan of a Small Saint was a whopping one billion years. Thus, even though this old man belonged to the same generation as the Tranquil Heart Saint, he was already in old age, while the Tranquil Heart Saint was still young and full of vigor.

Cultivation was a cruel matter. If one couldn’t continue to advance, they would eventually be eroded by age and pass away.

Ling Han sighed in emotion as he entered the courtyard.

From the outside, the courtyard appeared to be very quaint. However, upon entering, he discovered that there was a whole different world inside.

A vast sea appeared before him, and there were countless azure lotuses blossoming in this sea. Each lotus was tens of thousands of meters tall. Before this sea, even ginormous Demonic Beast would feel miniscule and insignificant.

In fact, if one observed this sea from the outside, they would realize that this was simply an ordinary pond that was filled with ordinary lotuses.

Transforming a pond into a sea and transforming the lotuses into gigantic azure peaks—this was the action of a Saint.

Meanwhile, the Tranquil Heart Saint was sitting on a lotus far away in the distance, a fishing rod in his hands. He was clearly hundreds of thousands of kilometers from Ling Han, yet Ling Han could still somehow see him clearly. This wasn’t because his vision was incredible, but rather because the Tranquil Heart Saint was like the ruler of this heaven and earth.

Ling Han activated the Star Plucking Step and hurried toward the Saint.

His speed was extraordinary, yet after advancing for a while, he discovered that the distance between him and the Tranquil Heart Saint hadn’t decreased at all. In fact, the distance between them had become even greater.

He was clearly dashing forward, and the Tranquil Heart Saint clearly hadn’t moved. So, why had the distance between them become even greater?

Ling Han stopped where he was. He observed his surroundings carefully, and a look of realization eventually appeared on his face.

This was a formation!

The sea of azure lotuses was in fact a formation. This was a peculiar formation that was constructed from the petals and stems of the lotuses.

Ling Han started to observe and resolve the formation.

The Tranquil Heart Saint smiled upon seeing this. To discover that he was trapped inside a formation so quickly wasn’t an easy feat. Among all of his disciples, Ling Han could rank inside the top 10.

However, discovering and resolving the formation were two completely different matters.

In any case, this wasn’t a difficult formation, and he wanted to see how long Ling Han would need to resolve it.

Yu Susu had spent six days, Ren Feiyun had spent nine and a half days, and Cai Miao had spent 10 and a half days.

The Tranquil Heart Saint was aware that Ling Han possessed extraordinary talent in cultivation. Thus, in the beginning, he hadn’t expected for Ling Han to be outstanding in the area of formations. However, while teaching on the public square, he had glanced at Ling Han and been astonished to discover that there were actually 10 formations inscribed inside his body. As someone who cherished talented disciples, he decided to summon Ling Han to his courtyard.

He would put some effort into raising Ling Han as long as he could resolve the formation within 20 days. It didn’t matter if he wasn’t exceptionally talented with formations. He was able to inscribe 10 formations inside his body, after all, so wouldn’t this be enough to overcome any deficiency in talent?

Ling Han analyzed the formation for three days before shaking his head.

His foundational knowledge of formations was severely lacking, and thus he would most likely need in excess of 20 days to resolve this formation. However, he understood that this was a test from the Tranquil Heart Saint. Moreover, he didn’t know what time limit the Tranquil Heart Saint had in mind. Thus, he was starting to become a little worried.

He couldn’t genuinely spend 20 days, could he? Moreover, that would be the best-case scenario. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Since that was the case, he would use the simplest method—brute force!
