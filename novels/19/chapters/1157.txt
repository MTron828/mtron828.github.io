Chapter 1158: Arrival of Yang Hao

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In some sense, He Tao and Wu Zhe were actually quite decent people. At least, they had both offered genuinely good and valuable treasures to share with their junior brothers and sisters. If Wu Zhe hadn’t been too insistent on winning and used shady techniques against the Rain Emperor, Ling Han wouldn’t have challenged and humiliated him.

Only after asking around did Ling Han learn that the other four king tiers had all gone out to explore and train.

In reality, the disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect all had fairly good relationships with each other. If the seniors obtained valuable items during their adventures, they would take them out to share with the newer disciples of the sect. This was a tradition.

When the other four king tiers returned, they would also share some valuable treasures with Ling Han and the others. Such practice was repeated generation after generation, and it had already become a good tradition of the sect.

Everyone picked the 10 most outstanding individuals of the dao discussing segment—these 10 cultivators would enjoy an extra Serene Poplar Tea Leaf in their tea. Ling Han was naturally chosen as one of the 10. If he couldn’t qualify for the top 10, who could?

The Rain Emperor also had the honor of being chosen as one of the top 10. However, Ding Ping didn’t win this honor. He had lost to Lan Luan, and regardless of the reason, a defeat was a defeat. In any case, it had revealed that his mental state still wasn’t up to scratch yet.

He Tao walked over, and asked, “Brother Han, are you interested in exploring an ancient land?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “What kind of ancient land could this be?”

“It’s most likely a large sect from the distant past. It appears as if the sect was destroyed, though many valuable items still remain at the site,” He Tao replied with a serious expression. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to convince Ling Han if he didn’t reveal some information of substance.

“Being as powerful as Brother He is, there’s no need for you to invite me, is there?” Ling Han said.

He Tao chuckled, and said, “There’s a treasure storage, and it can only be opened by the combined power of seven people. Moreover... these seven people all have to be at the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier!”

Ling Han was astonished upon hearing this. ‘There’s such a high bar for opening up a treasure storage?’

This ancient sect must have been super impressive. The Majestic Heaven Sect had gathered all of the most brilliant prodigies from the 100 or so nearby planets, yet only seven of the newest generation of disciples had succeeded in forming five Mountains and Rivers.

“I guess I can go then!” Ling Han’s interest was piqued, and he asked, “When are we setting off?”

He didn’t ask where the ancient land was, as that would be far too insincere and insensitive.

He Tao laughed heartily, and said, “There’s no hurry! This ancient land is actually controlled by our sect. In fact, it’s a Mystery Realm that opens once every 100 years. However, it’s close to opening again, and we’ll probably be able to set off within the next half of a year.”

To Immortal beings, half a year was indeed a very short time.

“The sect has wanted to open that treasure storage for a long time, yet there are strict requirements for who can open and enter it. To be more precise, one must be at the Mountain River Tier. However, only six of us were at the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier before, so we could only sigh in disappointment every time we passed by that treasure storage.

“If it weren’t for this treasure storage, Shen Zhu’er, Shi Anguo, and Wu Wentong could all have broken through to the Sun Moon Tier several decades ago. However, they held onto the hope that they could one day enter this treasure storage, and it was because of this hope that they suppressed their cultivation level. They’re planning to break through to the Sun Moon Tier after exploring this treasure storage.

“Hehe, the heavens have carried out the desire of man. Now that Brother Han has joined, there’s a large chance that we’ll finally be able to open that treasure storage.”

Ling Han was astonished, and he said, “So, what you’re saying is that Shen Zhu’er, Shi Anguo, and Wu Wentong have all reached a state of perfection in the Mountain River Tier already?”

Gasp! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

They possessed a power that could surpass 10 stars! In other words, their power was on par with cultivators at the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier!

He Tao smiled faintly, and said, “Indeed, these three have already perfected the Mountain River Tier. Kuang Peishan formed his fifth River a dozen or so years ago, but I’m unsure as to whether he’s perfected the Mountain River Tier yet.”

After forming a fifth Mountain, one’s power would surpass seven stars. After cultivating the fifth Mountain to a state of perfection, one’s power would surpass eight stars. And, after forming a fifth River, one’s power would surpass nine stars!

Ling Han was especially curious, and he asked, “What about Brother He?”

“Hehe.” A smile appeared on He Tao’s face, and he paused for a moment before saying, “I’m a bit behind the four of them. I only formed my Fifth River a few days ago.”

Gasp!

His power had surpassed nine stars!

In comparison to the other king tiers, Wu Zhe was the weakest. His fifth Mountain definitely hadn’t reached a level of perfection yet. Otherwise, his power should have been enough to overwhelm Ling Han, not just be slightly higher.

‘As expected of king tiers! So powerful!’

Ling Han hadn’t dared to underestimate the six kings to begin with. Now that he heard He Tao’s introduction, he naturally held them in an even higher regard. However, this didn’t mean that he would venerate or fear them. He had his own trump cards, after all, so there was no need for him to be fearful or overly cautious.

Everyone continued to drink tea and discuss dao.

This was good tea brewed with good water, and this caused everyone to become immersed in the great dao.

The prodigious nature of those present became clear at this moment as divine light started to exude from almost everyone’s body. Even the Regulations of the great dao could be seen, and this was naturally thanks to the effects of the Serene Poplar Tea.

However, there were also exceptions, such as Ling Han. There was no sign of divine light on his body.

There was nothing he could do about this. He had drunk Reincarnation Tea before, so how could mere Serene Poplar Tea have any significant effect?

There was no divine light on Ling Han, nor was there any on He Tao. He had either drunk this tea before, or he had drunk tea with even better effects. Tea such as Serene Poplar Tea would be most effective the first time one drank them. Afterward, its effects would decrease with each increasing time it was drunk.

The two of them exchanged a glance, and both of them smiled. At the same time, they both held each other in even higher regard.

Weng!

A devastating aura suddenly swept through the peak, and it was as if a demon god were descending into the world. A cold chill gripped at everyone’s heart.

‘Who is this?!’

Everyone was stunned. This was an important peak of the Majestic Heaven Sect, so who could swagger over here to show off their might?

This thought had barely crossed their minds when a male in white walked over, his hands clasped behind his back.

He was a stunningly handsome male, with his complexion as clear as jade and his body slender and tall. This was the kind of male who could elicit shrieks from fangirls with a single glance cast in their direction.

“L-Lord Yang!” many people instantly shouted in astonishment. Even though they were seeds, there was still a deep sense of fear and respect on their faces when they saw this young man.

Yang Hao—a prodigy among prodigies. He had reached the Sun Moon Tier after a mere 600 years of cultivation, and he was more so invincible against those at the same cultivation level. The other prodigies were merely his stepping stones; they were side characters whose existence was to highlight his might.

What cultivation level was he at right now? No one knew. However, they knew that he had definitely improved in leaps and bounds.

The Sun Moon Tier and Mountain River Tier were two completely different tiers. Even if one reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, they would only be able to challenge the weakest of the weak Sun Moon Tier cultivators.

Many people stood up and bowed respectfully to Yang Hao, saying, “Our respects to Lord Yang!”

In the Majestic Heaven Sect, those at a higher cultivation level were all referred to as lord rather than senior or master.

He Tao remained silent. He was about to perfect the Mountain River Tier, and breaking through to the Sun Moon Tier would be especially easy for a prodigy like him. Thus, he didn’t respect or fear Yang Hao much.

However, strength was the most important attribute in the cultivation world, so he would remain a peg lower than Yang Hao as long as he didn’t advance to the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, he wouldn’t actively provoke Yang Hao.

A domineering aura radiated from Yang Hao, and he was like a demon lord who people could only kowtow and gaze up to.

He swept his gaze across the peak before saying calmly, “Which of you is Han Lin?”
