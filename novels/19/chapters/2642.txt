Chapter 2643: Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword

Gu Heyi was filled with confidence. Since Ling Han could advance during battle, he could definitely do so as well.

In terms of talent alone, he was no weaker than anyone.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “I’ll behead you within 100 exchanges.”

Gu Heyi remained silent. Ling Han was correct. If he didn’t advance, he could only last 100 exchanges at most. However, he was confident that under this life-and-death pressure, this would be enough time.

Ling Han also didn’t speak anymore. At this time, it would be pointless to say anything else.

He strode forward, bearing down on Gu Heyi.

Gu Heyi held up his sword. This was a Celestial Tool, and at this moment, numerous symbols lit up, radiating with a terrifying aura.

Ling Han lunged forward, stabbing with his sword. All of his fury gathered at the tip of his blade.

When entering the martial academy, Gu Heyi had already expressed hostility toward him. This was because Ling Han was the Empress’ lover.

When entering an ancient ruin, Gu Heyi had set up a deadly trap for Ling Han. However, because the Heavenly Venerate hadn’t actually been dead, that had instead resulted in Gu Heyi, Xiao Yingxiong, and the others almost being massacred completely.

Now, the three of them had pursued Ling Han into the Celestial King Graveyard, with their attacks almost leading to his death.

Who could endure such villainy?

In any case, Ling Han couldn’t endure this. Accompanied by his roar, his Divine Demon Sword unleashed a boundless radiance. It was as if he had become an invincible god of war.

“Come battle!” Gu Heyi roared as he charged forward with his sword.

Clang!

This was their first exchange, and Gu Heyi was immediately sent flying, only coming to a halt after several hundred kilometers. His face was as white as a sheet, and his entire body was shaking slightly.

One had to realize that Ling Han was purely relying on his Body Art at this moment, something that didn’t depend on the Regulations. Even though he couldn’t draw on the power of heaven and earth, the strength of his body allowed him to unleash even more chaotic and destructive power.

Gu Heyi felt like every bone in his body was rattling. It was as if they were about to shatter at any moment.

“I overestimated you! Perhaps you can’t even withstand 10 exchanges!” Ling Han said in a calm voice. However, he felt pity in his mind.

He had finally exhausted the power of the Dimension Scroll. In the future, he wouldn’t be able to rely on it to elevate his Body Art anymore. Moreover, because he had relied on one of the six Source Powers of the Genesis World to temper his body, he would be unable to elevate his Body Art any further without this sort of power. He would be stuck at this level forever.

This was unless he could absorb the six Source Powers again. However, that would at least have to wait until he reached the Ninth Heaven.

However, Ling Han only felt slight pity. Right now, his Evolution Index had already reached 12, and he had more so mastered three Heavenly Venerate Techniques. Thus, which Celestial King would he fear?

He charged forward again, not showing Gu Heyi an inkling of mercy.

Gu Heyi met his attacks. However, he was completely unable to block them, and he was easily sent flying again.

Wah!

He violently vomited blood, and it was as if his insides had been turned upside down. In fact, he felt an urge to throw up even his internal organs.

Gu Heyi’s expression changed drastically. Even though he was filled with confidence, the prerequisite to advancing under pressure was that he could cope with this pressure. For example, even though Ling Han had been riddled with wounds at that time, he had still been able to guard his own life.

However, Gu Heyi’s situation was different. Each strike could seemingly send him into hell. At this point, this wasn’t simple life-and-death pressure. Instead, these were strikes that could directly lead to his death!

If this continued, to say nothing of advancing during battle, it was very likely that he would be killed before long. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Fuse with my soul and spirit!” he roared. He then grabbed at his head, forcefully extracting a streak of azure and white, and pressing them into his Celestial Tool.

He practiced the Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword, a technique that could destroy one’s soul and spirit. By sacrificing his own divine sense first, he could cause the might of his technique to increase tenfold. Of course, the price to pay was also huge. A person only had three souls and seven spirits, so by sacrificing a soul and a spirit at this moment, he was causing irrevocable damage to his future.

However, he had no other choice. If he didn’t fight with his life, his only fate would be death.

Moreover, Gu Heyi firmly believed that he could advance during battle.

“Die!” He charged forward with his Divine Sword, unleashing the Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword. His battle prowess instantly soared into the Ninth Heaven, finally giving him the right to rival Ling Han.

His battle prowess was also at the Ninth Heaven!

Ling Han roared with laughter. He naturally wouldn’t be afraid. He slashed and hacked with his Divine Demon Sword, facing Gu Heyi’s strikes head-on.

Weng!

Gu Heyi unleashed a spiritual attack. However, it was a shame that Ling Han had already advanced, meaning that this kind of attack could only cause some slight pain in his mind. With Ling Han’s willpower, he could naturally endure this with ease. As such, its effect on him was negligible.

They continued to battle.

Both prodigies displayed their might. However, even though Gu Heyi had already gone as far as to cripple himself to raise his battle prowess, he was still slightly weaker than Ling Han. He was sent flying left and right by Ling Han, suffering a clear disadvantage.

Gu Heyi remained solemn and calm. At the very least, he had stabilized himself now. What he needed to do next was to advance.

Ling Han shook his head. Gu Heyi’s expectations were far too idealistic. Advancing during battle required a lot of prerequisites to be fulfilled, the most important among them being that one had already reached the peak stage of a cultivation level. For example, why had Ling Han held back for so long just then? Was it not to refine the celestial fruits?

This was a process of accumulation, something that required an exorbitant amount of time. However, advancing to the next level only required an opportunity. For example, facing life-and-death pressure. In such an environment, advancing might come swiftly and naturally.

However, even though Gu Heyi was already at the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven, he was still a small distance away from reaching the pinnacle. Otherwise, as a supreme monarch star, how would he need any celestial fruits? There would be no barriers to speak of, and he could directly advance to the next cultivation level.

This amount of distance was nothing to Gu Heyi. As long as he had a few dozen millions of years, he would definitely be able to overcome this distance and easily reach the Eighth Heaven.

However, the problem was, could he endure until that time?

Gu Heyi had crippled himself to increase his battle prowess… How long could that last?

Ling Han’s left hand balled into a fist as he channeled the Three Lightning Technique. He then buffed it with the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, allowing each of his punches to become chaotic and explosive. His physical body was his most terrifying and destructive weapon.

Peng, peng, peng!

Their exchanges were deafening, and Gu Heyi finally started to suffer wounds. Blood sprayed through the air, and it was clear that his opponent’s power had already exceeded his limits. Even after sacrificing a soul and a spirit, the Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword was still no match for Ling Han.

“Sacrifice another soul and spirit!” Gu Heyi said through gritted teeth. He grabbed another streak of azure and white from his head before pressing them into his Celestial Tool. His battle prowess instantly increased another threefold.

Even though it was only threefold, this was threefold on top of the tenfold that he had already experienced. In other words, this was a whopping 30-fold increase of his original battle prowess!

At this moment, he could finally hold his own against Ling Han.

“Ling Han, I, Gu Heyi, have never been weaker than anyone!” Gu Heyi roared.

Ling Han scoffed, saying, “I’m a level below you, and you’ve more so activated a sacrificial technique. Even so, you can only draw level with me, yet you still have the face to say that you’ve ‘never been weaker than anyone’?”

Gu Heyi was instantly rendered speechless. He had felt far too stifled when being suppressed by Ling Han just then, so after finally drawing level, he felt as if he were gaining an advantage as the underdog. Yet, he had forgotten that Ling Han was only at the Sixth Heaven.

This person was the true freak! How could Gu Heyi compare with him?

“I don’t believe this!” Gu Heyi roared. His fighting spirit raged, and he said, “It’s because of your immense fortune! It’s because of this that you could extract the power from the Dimension Scroll. You’re being helped by the heavens! Otherwise, at the same cultivation level, how could I be afraid of you? Not to mention that I have an advantage of one cultivation level.”

“No matter how much nonsense you spew, you still can’t change the fact that you’re a loser!” Ling Han said, with each word piercing into his opponent’s heart like a dagger. His Divine Demon Sword thrust forth, not showing an iota of mercy.
