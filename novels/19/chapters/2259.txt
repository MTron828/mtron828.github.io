Chapter 2260: Vile Person

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If Ling Han had been truly at the Eleventh Secret, he would have definitely attempted to end this conflict as soon as possible and flee. After all, each second wasted was a step closer to death.

However, he was the ruler of this heaven and earth. All of the Celestial Kings here combined were still no match for him.

Thus, he was in no hurry as he smiled, and said, “Oh, why is that?”

“Because you deserve to die!” Shen Chao replied as he lashed out. He couldn’t waste any more time. It was because the Celestial Kings from the two realms were holding each other back that he had this opportunity to act. However, he definitely didn’t have much time.

He didn’t dare to let Ling Han develop. He was actually at the Eleventh Secret… Eleventh Secret! If Ling Han advanced another step, he would be able to rival or even suppress him. He couldn’t accept this!

However, where was his confidence coming from?

Ling Han had just been engaged in an intense battle, and he had more so combusted his ancestral bloodline or activated some secret technique. Thus, his battle prowess was definitely far inferior to that before. As such, this was the best opportunity to strike. Afterward, he could lay the blame on the cultivators from the Foreign Realm.

In this heaven and earth, even the divine sense of Celestial Kings couldn’t observe anything across a great distance. Thus, he didn’t need to worry about being caught.

Boom!

He retrieved a weapon. This was no sparring session right now, but an act of killing someone. He didn’t need to follow any rules.

A precious pagoda hovered about his head. This pagoda had seven levels, and it was snow-white in color. Rays of earthen-yellow light radiated from it, and each was astonishingly dense. In fact, they were powerful enough to shake Ascending Origin Tier elites to death.

“Detestable thing. Exterminate this impostor!” Small Tower immediately shouted.

‘Tsk, it’s at it again.’

Ling Han shook his head. Small Tower disliked all other pagoda-shaped treasures.

“Die!” Shen Chao lunged over, with his precious pagoda exuding a powerful aura and shooting rays of light at Ling Han as he did so. He had yet to arrive, yet a devastating pressure had already surged over. Even Ascending Origin Tier elites would shudder in the face of this pressure.

Ling Han retreated, choosing not to face this attack head-on.

Shen Chao roared with laughter. This was the only time that he had ever gained an upper hand against Ling Han. He couldn’t help but feel euphoric.

He dashed over, throwing a punch. Imbued with the Regulations contained within the precious pagoda, his punch then transformed into an Earth Dragon.

“Shen Chao, you’re using public office to avenge private resentments. What audacity!” Ling Han said in a calm voice.

Shen Chao sneered, and said, “My ancestor is a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, and I’m also a monarch tier myself. Moreover, I’m the most doted descendant of my ancestor, so he’ll help me escape punishment no matter what troubles I cause.”

Ling Han shook his head upon hearing this. This person had truly been ruined by his doting seniors. If Ling Han were truly an Eleventh Secret Monarch Star, and if he were truly killed by Shen Chao, it would be easy to envision every single Ninth Heaven Celestial King flaring up in wild rage. They would capture Shen Chao, and brutally tear him to pieces.

The death of such a person… would be no pity.

“Han Lin, after killing you, I’m also going to seek out your women. Do you want to guess what I’m going to do to them?” Shen Chao asked in a sinister voice. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ling Han’s gaze involuntarily became ice-cold. Initially, he had still had the patience to deal with this person. Now, however… his patience had vanished.

Moreover, the number of Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm had already reached 137. It was almost time to act.

Ling Han lashed out, grabbing at Shen Chao.

“You’re seeking death!” Shen Chao said with a sneer. The precious pagoda above his head had been personally refined by the ancestor of the Shen Clan. Even though it wasn’t a Celestial Tool, it possessed a wisp of a Celestial King’s power.

He couldn’t channel the full power of this pagoda by himself, yet the rays of light that shone from it were powerful enough to mercilessly suppress all Ascending Origin Tier elites.

Yet, Ling Han actually dared to attack? Was he not seeking death?

“Have a taste of pain!” Shen Chao said with a sneer. At this moment, Ling Han’s hand had already made contact with the rays of light.

Peng!

There was a crisp cracking sound as Ling Han’s hand punched through the rays of light, and grabbed the precious treasure. With a powerful twist, the precious pagoda that had been forged from heaven knew what level Pseudo-Divine Metal was then instantly reduced to pieces.

When Ling Han’s hand fell down again, it had already wrapped around Shen Chao’s neck.

Everything had occurred far too quickly, so much so that Shen Chao still hadn’t come to his senses. He wore an expression of confusion as he dazedly stared at Ling Han.

How was this possible?

That was an eight-star treasure personally refined by his ancestor! Even Ascending Origin Tier elites couldn’t have shattered it! Yet, Ling Han had crushed it with a single hand? This was unfathomable!

“Impossible, impossible, impossible!” Shen Chao could only mutter this word.

“Alright, let me show you something even more impossible!” Ling Han said with a smile. He turned around. It was finally time for him to reel in the net.

“Measly human, offer me your life!” Upon discovering Ling Han’s whereabouts, a Celestial King from the Foreign Realm instantly charged over.

There was no Celestial King protecting Ling Han right now, so it was the best time to kill him.

“No!” the Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm roared. Regardless of how prodigious Ling Han was, the gulf in cultivation level between him and Celestial Kings was far too huge. A Celestial King could reduce him to ashes with a single casual attack.

“No!” Shen Chao also shouted. This was because he was being held by the neck by Ling Han. If attacked by a Celestial King, he would definitely die as well. Wouldn’t that be a huge loss? What the hell did this have to do with him? Why did he have to die alongside Ling Han?

Ling Han wore a beaming smile, and he said, “It’s fine, it’s fine.” He raised his arm, and made a light pressing motion.

Weng!

The Celestial King’s attack ground to a sudden halt before shattering to pieces.

The surroundings became deathly silent.

That was the attack of a Celestial King! Yet, Ling Han had casually blocked it just like that?

Was this possible? Was this realistic? Were they not dreaming?

However, after faltering for a brief moment, the Celestial Kings immediately started to scour the surroundings. Who had helped Ling Han? To convince them that a measly Immortal Palace Tier elite had blocked a Celestial King’s attack? Impossible!

“Humph!” The Foreign Realm elite sneered before launching another attack.

Boom!

He unleashed a ray of black light that shot toward Ling Han like an arrow.

“Hurry up and release me!” Shen Chao roared. Ling Han was about to die, so why did he have to drag him down alongside him? A Celestial King could block one, two, 10, or even 100 attacks for Ling Han. However, they would eventually make a mistake.

Once they made a mistake, the fate of him and Ling Han would be sealed.

Right now, he couldn’t care less about whether Ling Han died or not. Most importantly, he didn’t want to die.

Ling Han shook his head. “I already said, it’s fine. Why won’t you believe me?” He raised his arm, and made a pressing motion again. The ray of black light immediately stopped. In fact, it even turned around to shoot back at the elite who had launched it.

The Celestial Kings were all stunned upon seeing this.

Blocking a Celestial King’s attack was no great feat. After all, there were innumerable Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings here. However, to reflect the attack of an Eleventh Lotus elite? Even Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings couldn’t achieve such a feat.

What in the world was going on?

“I don’t believe this!” the Foreign Realm elite roared as he started to accumulate power for an ultimate attack. He was convinced that Ling Han was being protected by a powerful Celestial King.

He was at the Eleventh Lotus, so he was definitely no match for Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings. However, he would definitely find an opportunity to exterminate this measly Immortal Palace Tier cultivator. This was only a matter of time.

Everyone would eventually make a mistake—even Celestial Kings were no exception.

This was especially the case since he was unleashing an ultimate attack. Just a single remnant shock wave would be able to kill Ling Han.

“Have you gone mad? Hurry up and dodge! Dodge!” Shen Chao bellowed. He truly didn’t want to die at all. At this moment, he was even willing to call Ling Han his ancestor.

‘My great ancestor, I beg you to please dodge! That’s a mighty Celestial King Tier figure!’

However, Ling Han simply smiled as he raised his right foot, and stomped down at the Foreign Realm elite.
