Chapter 1803: Capturing the Demonic Tree

“This is truly a demonic tree!” Ling Han remarked.

The Empress nodded in agreement. She was indeed proud and haughty, yet she definitely wouldn’t be careless during this kind of critical moment.

The headless corpses encircled them again, yet they stopped 60 or so meters away from Ling Han. It was as if this distance was their limit, and they couldn’t advance any further.

Ling Han chuckled before actively charging toward the monstrosities.

“You truly think that I can’t deal with you monsters?” he said with a humph. He immediately unleashed his Cracking Light Sphere before shouting, “Explode!”

Boom!

As the headless corpses lunged over, the Cracking Light Sphere had already exploded with a resounding rumble. Lightning arced through the air, and this was an incredibly devastating power.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The headless corpses were all blasted back, and several of them were directly blasted into smithereens under the overwhelming power of the lightning.

Meanwhile, Ling Han stealthily reappeared again. Just then, he had activated the Banishing Technique to hide in a separate dimension. By doing so, he had avoided the devastating shock waves of his own attack. Indeed, the explosion of the Cracking Light Sphere would even affect him, the wielder.

Right now, there were still seven headless corpses that hadn’t been destroyed yet. However, they were all missing either arms or legs, meaning that their battle prowess was much weaker than before.

Seeing this, Ling Han immediately charged forward to attack the demonic tree. He was going to take it down in one fell swoop.

Whoosh!

The remaining headless corpses immediately lunged toward Ling Han to stop him with their bodies.

“Piss off!” Ling Han roared. He unleashed the might of the Xuanyin Source Water, instantly freezing all of the headless corpses. He then launched a furious punch toward them.

Crack!

The headless corpses were all smashed into broken shards of ice.

The faces of the trunk of the White Demon Tree instantly contorted, and it was as if they were facing some kind of unimaginable terror.

Pu, pu, pu!

The trunk of the tree split open again, and it spat out numerous additional headless corpses. This time, however, all of the corpses were relatively old. Only their bones remained, and all of their flesh had already disappeared.

These skeletons locked onto Ling Han, and even though they didn’t have skulls, it still felt as if they were staring at him. More and more of these skeletons fell out from the White Demon Tree.

“F*ck! You bloody demonic tree! Do you have a sick hobby of collecting corpses?” Ling Han murmured. He couldn’t help but feel disgusted by this sight. This White Demon Tree was like a black hole that could spit out corpse after corpse.

In just a short moment, several hundred corpses had already been released from the trunk of the White Demon Tree. Right now, they were standing around it like guards.

The White Demon Tree raised its leafless branches slightly, and upon receiving this signal, the army of skeletons instantly charged toward Ling Han.

Pu, pu, pu!

When these skeletons neared Ling Han, they all extended their arms to release bursts of green liquid toward him. With hundreds of skeletons performing this action in unison, this was an incredibly astounding sight.

A dizzying smell instantly rushed into Ling Han’s nose, causing his entire body to become weak. It was as if he were about to collapse into a heap.

‘Poison!’

Ling Han immediately channeled his Nine Heavens Flame.

Boom!

A barrier of flames instantly materialized around him, vaporizing all of the green liquid, and it turned into black smoke.

With a single thought, he immediately activated his Flame Control Technique as well. The flames in the surroundings instantly fell under his control, and he gathered these flames into a blazing fireball with the Nine Heavens Flame as a medium.

“Ten Beasts Technique!”

Ling Han activated yet another celestial technique.

Pa, pa, pa!

The flames immediately transformed into 10 Immortal Beasts.

In the past, he had only been capable of summoning three Immortal Beasts. This was due to the limitation of his Origin Power. Here, however, there were far too many elemental particles of flames in the surroundings, and these were all particles that he could absorb and use. Thus, he was easily able to summon 10 Immortal Beasts.

Moreover, these were all extremely powerful Immortal Beasts. If it weren’t for the limitation of his cultivation level, Ling Han could have summoned Immortal Beasts that were at the Dividing Soul Tier. Even so, the beasts that he had summoned were already at the peak stage of the fourth severance. Moreover, they were all powerful king tiers.

The 10 Immortal Beasts were blazing with flames as they lunged forward, and these were flames that even Dividing Soul Tier elites had to use their full power to resist. In fact, after reaching this location, even Immortal Palace Tier elites needed to rely on Blood Dragon Armors to resist the power of the chaotic fire particles.

It was only because the White Demon Tree was native to this land that it wasn’t targeted by the chaotic fire particles. However, because of Ling Han’s manipulation and the appearance of the 10 Battle Beasts, things had become completely different. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Boom, boom, boom!

The 10 Battle Beasts unleashed their formidable might, pushing the skeletons over. As they released their scorching flames, the skeletons were more so incinerated, transforming into ashes.

The 10 Battle Beasts were formidable as they charged forward and obliterated the army of skeletons.

Expressions of terror spread across the faces on the trunk of the White Demon Tree again. However, Ling Han was speechless when he discovered that the demonic tree was slowly sinking into the ground. It was as if it were attempting to stealthily escape.

“Can you flee?” Ling Han said with a humph. The Nine Heavens Flame surged forth, forming a giant net that locked the surrounding heaven and earth.

The White Demon Tree had already developed intelligence, and it was, in fact, quite smart. Upon discovering that it had no path of escape, it resolutely abandoned all thoughts of escape. It then stared at Ling Han and split open its trunk again.

Pu, pu, pu!

Several things were spat out again.

However, it wasn’t headless corpses this time. Rather, these were the faces of men and women, all of which were filled with expressions of agony.

These faces hovered in the air, and they started to slowly float toward Ling Han.

After a brief moment, they suddenly spat a burst of black air in unison, and these bursts of black air transformed into countless swords and spears. There were constructs of Regulations, and there were also flashing symbols of the great dao.

This attack was extremely terrifying. Ling Han’s physique was indeed powerful, and it allowed him to easily defend against purely physical attacks. However, it would be weaker against the power of Regulations.

Thus, even though those at the Severing Mundane Tier couldn’t kill Ling Han using brute strength, they would be able to refine him using the power of Regulations.

Anyhow, this attack naturally couldn’t kill Ling Han. However, it would be capable of giving him some minor trouble. At the very least, it would cause him some pain.

As such, Ling Han didn’t want to face this attack head-on. He extended his arm and activated Tide of the Ages, aiming to age the attack from the White Demon Tree.

This was the power of time, the most powerful Regulation under the level of Celestial King Tier. It was naturally formidable, and it instantly decomposed the attacks from the swords, spears, and whatever else was flying toward him. It was as if Ling Han were taking a casual stroll as he neared the White Demon Tree. As he advanced, he also continued to snap his fingers and unleash bursts of Sword Qi that obliterated the faces in the air.

These people had already died, so they were better off returning to the earth.

The White Demon Tree made one final struggle, opening its trunk to unleash a boundless murderous aura.

This was a unique type of tree that absorbed all kinds of violent and chaotic auras to grow, so it was only natural that they possessed bursts of extremely concentrated murderous auras inside their bodies. As it radiated outward, the murderous aura transformed into a black skeleton that wielded a giant scythe.

The scythe swung down, and Ling Han could feel a tearing pain on his skin even before the blade of the scythe reached him. He humphed softly, and he immediately activated his water-element Source Power as he unleashed a punch.

Pa!

The entire White Demon Tree was frozen in place.

With a wave of his hand, Ling Han immediately absorbed the White Demon Tree into the Black Tower.

‘Done and dusted!’

“Hand the White Demon Tree over!” a cold voice suddenly shouted. Ling Han looked over, only to see a man dashing over from the distance. His expression was incredibly domineering and haughty.

This man was extremely young, and his appearance was also very handsome. However, Ling Han didn’t recognize him at all.

“For what reason?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“If you don’t... you’ll die!” the young man said in an ice-cold voice. This was a mystery realm, so it was extremely natural for people to die here. Anyhow, there would be no ill consequences as long as one killed all of the witnesses.

Of course, people wouldn’t dare to kill successors of Celestial King Tier forces such as Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng even if they had the opportunity to do so. Otherwise, that would be taking an extraordinary risk. If the Celestial King Tier forces couldn’t find the culprit, they might simply kill everyone who was related to the case!

Trying to reason with a Celestial King Tier force? That would be far too foolish and naive!

However, there were only two successors of Celestial King Tier forces inside this mystery realm. Moreover, Ling Han clearly wasn’t one of them!
