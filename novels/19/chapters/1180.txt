Chapter 1181: Who Else Wants to Stop Me?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Sha Yuan’s talent in martial arts was indeed inferior to Zhao Lun’s, but his skills were truly impressive for him to be recruited as a key disciple.

Hong, the large hand descended, covering the skies and blocking the sun.

A cold smirk curled up the corners of his lips. What was this genius of the Scarlet Heaven Academy worth in front of him? No wonder how freakish or how genius you were, cultivation level was the deciding factor.

‘Go die!’

He would take advantage of the instant before Ling Han’s soul dispersed to extract his memories, and obtain all the fated opportunities the latter had gained.

Ling Han shook his head. What effect would this kind of attack have on the present him? He puffed up his cheeks, and then blew out a breath of air skywards.

Pa!

That huge hand of Origin Power instantly crumbled, turning into endless scattered shadows, and floating out in all directions.

‘Crap!’

Sha Yuan and his group were all gaping wide in dumbfounded shock, completely unable to believe their eyes.

That was too exaggerated, wasn’t it? Just blowing out a breath of air was already so awesome? That was not just a boast!

This guy.... could it be that he was in the Sun Moon Tier? But Sun Moon Tiers wouldn’t be able to enter here! Even if some forces nurtured a few Sun Moon Tiers, and commanded them to destroy their own cultivation level, and then boost their power through consuming some banned medicine to return back to the Sun Moon Tier, with how young Ling Han was, could he possibly crumble his own cultivation level?

“No, impossible!” Sha Yuan should be the most familiar with Ling Han among their group. His whole face was filled with disbelief; pointing at Ling Han, he exclaimed, “How could you possibly possess this kind of battle prowess, this is absolutely impossible!”

“Sha Yuan, there are many things that may seem impossible to you, but they will still become reality. For example... that I will kill you!” Ling Han declared malevolently.

If he had said such words earlier on, Sha Yuan definitely would not have believed him, but Ling Han had dispersed his giant hand of Origin Power with just a breath of air. The power gap between both sides was clearly visible.

Sha Yuan humphed, and said, “Fine, count yourself lucky this time! You can leave!”

Ling Han was surprised, practically not daring to believe his own ears.

This guy still thought that he had the upper hand, didn’t he? He actually said that Ling Han could leave as if he had granted him some great mercy.

“Hehe.”

Ling Han understood now. This guy felt too good about himself, still thinking that this was Point Star City, and he was the son of the Great General Sha, and could do as he liked because he had the signboard of Heavenly Body Tier behind him.

“What is it? Why aren’t you getting lost?” Sha Yuan asked coldly, appearing very impatient.

He had already granted him great leniency, so why did this guy not quickly thank him heartily for the mercy and get lost?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Sha Yuan, in the past, I only thought that you were arrogant, a tyrant, and a profligate young master. Only now do I realize how terribly wrong I was.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

‘Haha, you finally discovered how exceptional I am, right?’ Sha Yuan thought, a sliver of a smile curling up his lips.

“You are a f****** idiot!” Ling Han continued.

‘F***!’

Sha Yuan’s smiling face immediately became incredibly awkward. He had never expected such a sudden turn of events, and that Ling Han would actually betray his expectations. He balefully asked, “What exactly do you want to do?”

“Nothing much, I just want to borrow your head!” Ling Han said calmly.

“You are looking for death!” Sha Yuan flew into a rage. Who was he? He was the son of an elite of Heavenly Body Tier, and someone actually said that he wanted to borrow his head?! Furthermore, this man was a bumpkin from a small world!

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I had better not speak too much nonsense with you, or even my intelligence may be dragged down by you. All right, then. I have allowed you to speak so much before you die. It’s about time that you pass on.”

“You, you dare to kill me?” Sha Yuan was filled with shock, a gigantic shock. He practically could not accept this reality.

Who was he?

How high was his status? Yet Ling Han actually wanted to kill him?

Ling Han did not answer him further, and merely stretched out his right hand. A strong power began to condense, and killing intent also simmered below the surface.

Now it was Sha Yuan, and it would be Zhao Lun later. For those that owed him a debt, he would ask them for repayment one by one.

He flicked a finger, and xiu, a flash of sword light swept past, heading to slash at Sha Yuan.

Pu!

Blood spattered, but Sha Yuan had not been sliced in half. A flash of golden light flickered on him as if he had transformed into a god of war clad in golden armor.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han’s eyes widened, and he could see that there was actually a golden decree wrapped around Sha Yuan’s body. It was precisely that decree that had taken effect in the nick of time, blocking Ling Han’s fatal strike.

Obviously, this was a decree that the Great General Sha had bequeathed to his son.

“You, how dare you!!” Sha Yuan was in a towering rage; even his voice was trembling. If this decree had actually taken effect, that only meant one thing—he had encountered a fatal danger. Only that would cause this decree to take effect automatically.

He had almost died!

“You deserve to die!” Sha Yuan roared loudly. This decree could only be activated by external stimuli, but now that it had been activated, how could he possibly let such an opportunity pass by? He was going to use this chance precisely to kill Ling Han.

He moved, and as he shot out a punch, the decree boosted his attack, turning into a golden bull that charged towards Ling Han.

Sigh, why were these rich kids so difficult to kill?

“Ah!” While Ling Han was still mocking his enemy in his heart, Sha Yuan gave a muffled grunt, and looked to be in pain. Furthermore, the golden light on his body also trembled for a while. The decree was bright at one moment, and dim at another, just as if it was going to be extinguished. The bull also dispersed by itself along with the power of the decree.

At first, Ling Han was startled. He hadn’t even made his move yet, so why did Sha Yuan look to be in tremendous pain? However, he immediately understood.

There were restrictions in place here. The moment one’s power reached the Sun Moon Tier, one would definitely be targeted!

Previously, the decree had activated to block a strike from him. Though its might was extraordinary, it had not reached the level of the Sun Moon Tier yet. But now that Sha Yuan was taking the initiative to attack and stimulating the decree, his power had reached the level of the Sun Moon Tier. Naturally, he would be targeted by the restrictions of this place. He had not damaged his enemy yet, but had damaged himself first.

Sha Yuan himself did not understand it yet, and thought that Ling Han had used some kind of secret technique to target him. Not only did he not suppress the might of the decree, he further drew upon the power of the decree.

After the decree was activated, its power would slowly wear down. Even if he left it alone, he could not possibly regain it. Thus, he naturally wanted to take advantage of this rare opportunity to kill Ling Han.

“Ah...!” However, as he drew upon its power, he was yelling out in even more pain. The decree trembled endlessly as if it was about to shatter apart at any moment.

Pa!

The decree finally crumbled, turning into pieces that flew in all directions. Sha Yuan immediately experienced the backlash, and was throwing up blood madly. Thankfully, he had not been destroyed along with the decree.

His bafflement was clear for all to see. What was going on here? Was this the result when a decree activated? He pointed at Ling Han, and asked in a shaking voice, “You, what demonic tricks have you used?”

“How ignorant!” Ling Han shook his head, and with a flick of his finger, sword light swept past, heading to slice at Sha Yuan.

“Stop!” Ji Zhengping and the others leaped out, helping Sha Yuan to disperse this blow. However, though this was just a careless strike from Ling Han, his present power had reached eight stars above the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier, so how strong was he?

Peng, peng, peng, peng. All four of them were sent flying by this blow. However, also because of this, Sha Yuan managed to fortunately escape death.

“If you all want to help him, I will slice you apart together as well,” Ling Han said calmly. “So, who else wants to stop me?”
