Chapter 1245: Lovers Finally Reunite

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Old geezer, are you prepared to die now?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

The elder from the Heaven’s Sword Palace simply glared at Ling Han. Origin Power surged from his severed shoulders, transforming into two arms. Powerful immortals wouldn’t lose their battle prowess even if all four of their limbs were severed.

However, the elder had already lost his courage to battle at this moment. He was going to return to the Heaven’s Sword Palace immediately. He would report Ling Han’s appearance to the higher-ups.

This brat was far too terrifying—he was like a freak. If they left him alone for a few more years, wouldn’t he reach the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier? Or even the Heavenly Body Tier? At that time, it would useless even if the Five Sects formed an alliance. Who would be able to oppose him?

Right now, however, there were still numerous elites in the Five Sects. The strongest individuals more so possessed battle prowess that could surpass four stars. Any one of them would be able to kill this brat.

However, his life was extremely precious, so he definitely couldn’t die here.

This was what the elder told himself. He definitely wasn’t a coward who would do anything to live. He was simply staying alive so he could contribute more to the sect.

However, he hadn’t been able to oppose Ling Han even at his peak. Now that both his arms had been severed, how could he still escape? Although he was an elite of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, the relatively low standing of this sect meant that he had no trump cards on him.

He had spent his entire fortune on the Level Seven God Tool. Unfortunately, even this God Tool hadn’t been able to save him.

The elder fought as if his life depended on it—he was going to flee from this place. As long as he made it to Wolf Fang City, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t dare to target him anymore. Wolf Fang City prohibited cultivators of the Immortal Realm from killing each other, regardless of what animosity existed between them.

They had to focus their energy on external enemies!

Ling Han chuckled coldly. ‘You still want to escape?’

He lashed out with his sword, and tens of thousands of sword projections burst from the Divine Demon Sword. This wasn’t the Mysterious Three Thousand, but rather the inherent might of the Divine Demon Sword. If it weren’t this powerful, how could it live up to its future identity as Divine Metal?

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

The ferocity of the sword projections was earth-shattering.

Meanwhile, the elder’s Level Seven God Tool parried this attack by itself, buying time for the elder to escape.

This was the difference between God Tools and ordinary weapons—God Tools either possessed a Tool Spirit or possessed martial intent. In both cases, it was equivalent to the God Tool possessing a consciousness of its own.

Ling Han released his Divine Demon Sword, and let it battle the elder’s Level Seven God Tool on its own. With his hands now free, he retrieved his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

Xiu!

The arrow was as quick as lightning as it whizzed toward the elder.

Pu!

The elder’s back instantly became a patch of mangled flesh. He wailed in agony as he collapsed to the ground. This arrow had wounded him quite severely.

At the same time, the Divine Demon Sword also unleashed tens of thousands of sword projections and suppressed the elder’s Level Seven God Tool. This was truly hard to fathom. A Level Five God Tool had actually suppressed a Level Seven God Tool! This defied all the laws of cultivation.

However, who let the material of the Divine Demon Sword be so freakish?

Ling Han dashed forward, using his finger like a sword as he unleashed his Lightning Sword Technique. Killing intent oozed from his body.

His physique was on par with Level Six God metal, and thus the attacks from his finger-sword couldn’t be underestimated. Such an attack wouldn’t be weaker than an attack from a Level Six God Tool.

The elder still wanted to resist, yet his heart was pierced by Ling Han’s Sword Qi. His body was more so slashed into two. However, immortals wouldn’t die so easily, and his divine sense dashed out from his body, attempting to flee into the distance.

Theoretically speaking, one’s divine sense would be like a fish out of the water once it left the body—it would become exhausted and eventually die. However, the more powerful one was, the slower the rate of their divine sense’s exhaustion. Elites at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier could survive in this state for several months. This would be enough time for one to find a fresh corpse—or a living person—to possess.

“Humph!” Ling Han lightly snapped his fingers, unleashing a burst Sword Qi that caught up to the elder.

Pa!

The elder’s divine sense was instantly obliterated. He had died once and for all.

The elder’s Divine Sword instantly rang in sorrow. It was just about to flee, yet it was struck several hundred times by Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword. The martial intent within the Divine Sword was ruthlessly erased, causing it to transform back into an ordinary sword.

Without martial intent, God Tools wouldn’t be God Tools anymore. They would simply be sharp weapons.

Ling Han put the Divine Sword away. He could let the Divine Demon Sword swallow the weapon later; he naturally wouldn’t waste it.

‘I never thought I’d come across the Five Sects in such a way. Anyhow, they actually sent people to look for this map. Judging by their actions, this map is definitely extraordinary!’

Ling Han retrieved the treasure map again. However, he knew pitifully little about the Cloud Apex Planet, so he couldn’t figure out the location marked on the map for the life of him.

‘I guess even the Five Sects couldn’t make head nor tail of this map. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have run around randomly. They would have definitely gone to retrieve the treasures.

‘I’ll see how things go. If I’m lucky enough to come across the illustrated area, it won’t hurt to look for the marked location and retrieve the treasures. Otherwise, there’s no need for me to waste my time.’

Ling Han returned to his original spot, and continued to wait for the Purple Moon Army’s movements. Meanwhile, he retrieved the egg and placed it beside himself so that it could enjoy more time in the sun. Perhaps this could speed up its growth.

Several days passed, and Rabbit and the old ginseng finally returned. They both appeared especially disheveled. As it turned out, they had come across elites from the Netherworld. If it hadn’t been for their ability to tunnel underground, they would have definitely been made into rabbit meat and old ginseng soup.

Rabbit tugged at Little Han, and said, “Little Han, hurry up and come with Uncle Rabbit. We’ve got to take revenge.”

“Yeah, that’s right, Grandpa Ginseng has never suffered so badly before! We can’t let it slide like this! That one-eyed dragon almost chopped my third leg off! I’ve got to use a 20-year-old dudou to suppress my fright.” As he said this, the old ginseng retrieved a pink dudou and took a huge sniff. His expression instantly became carefree and relaxed.

Pa!

Ling Han immediately kicked him aside.

How could a spirit of the five elements be so sleazy?

Compared to him, Rock Spirit was completely like a saint.

“I don’t have time!” Ling Han rejected their request, and said, “But since you two have so much time on your hands, hurry up and observe the Purple Moon Army for me. I need to know when they’re setting off.”

“As expected of someone I have high hopes for!” The old ginseng ran back over, and his expression was as if he were looking at a fellow sleaze. “However, you’re much greedier than Grandpa Ginseng. You actually want to target an entire army! Even Grandpa Ginseng has to admire your courage.”

Ling Han chuckled as he launched another kick. There was a wretched wail as the old ginseng flew toward the horizon.

“Brat, have you had enough yet?!” This voice became more and more distant. In the end, the old ginseng became a little star in the sky. Peace and quiet finally returned.

“Huh?!”

Ling Han suddenly stood up. 50 kilometers away, a brigade of soldiers was walking out from the encampment of the Purple Moon Army.

With his eyesight, he could naturally see 100 kilometers away. Anyhow, he was observing from this far away because the Purple Moon Army had an elite at the Eternal River Tier keeping guard. The perceptive ability of such an elite would definitely be terrifying. Thus, he didn’t dare to venture too close. Otherwise, he’d have no one to complain to if he were mistaken for an enemy scout and killed.

Although killing fellow cultivators was forbidden, who would dare to question the actions of an Eternal River Tier elite? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Might was right! This had been proved time and time again.

In any case, there was finally movement from the Purple Moon Army—although this was only a small brigade.

Ling Han activated his Eye of Truth. This way, he would be able to see the appearance of everyone more clearly.

This brigade was only 100 strong, and Ling Han started his observation from the head of the brigade. When his gaze moved one-third of the way down, his eyes suddenly locked onto a person. There was a look of emotion on his face.

It was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden!
