Chapter 2199: Compensations

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han arrived at the first floor, accompanied by the Empress. Hu Niu had once again ran out to play, previously complaining about how Ling Han did not show her enough affection by accompanying her. As for the other women, they were earnestly cultivating inside the Black Tower. They had unlocked the upper limits of their cultivation level, so they naturally could not bear to waste any more time.

When they arrived downstairs, they could see four people seated in the VIP area. The person who sat in the forefront was an extremely young-looking man. His fingers were slender, smooth, and fair, finer than even those of the majority of women. He was presently sipping tea, his left hand holding the tea cup, while his right hand was holding the cup’s lid. His ring finger and pinkie were slightly raised, appearing very effeminate.

However, there were three men who had overflowing masculinity seated behind him. One had his eyes closed in a doze, his figure so astonishingly fat that even his flesh was spreading out, inciting fear that the chair he was seated on would collapse at any moment. Another was dressed completely in green, only lacking a green cap on his head. The last person finally looked more normal, but there was a sword lying across his legs, while his right hand was holding tightly the sword’s hilt, which was also a little weird.

Ling Han had cultivated the Heaven Deceiving Technique, which could not only conceal his own cultivation level and aura, it would also allow him to be extremely sensitive to the auras of others. He only probed slightly, and he discovered that the effeminate man was a Yin Soul, while the fat man, man in green, and swordsman were all Heaven Souls.

A Yin Soul could actually lord over three Heaven Soul elites?

It was either that this sissy had a powerful background, or that he had another identity, which was strong enough to cause even Heaven Souls to follow his lead.

Immediately, a name rose up in Ling Han’s mind: Liu Jun.

This man was a Three-Star Alchemist, and in terms of mere status, he was equivalent to an Immortal Palace Tier. In that case, it was naturally no strange thing for him to have a few Heaven Souls under his command.

“So you are the new boss of this place?” the effeminate man asked.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “So a sissy like you is Liu Jun?”

S-sissy?

Liu Jun’s body trembled slightly, almost spluttering out the tea that he had just sipped.

What part of him was like a sissy?

Because the extraction of medicinal ingredients was required for alchemy, he was naturally extremely cautious so as not to damage the medicinal ingredients, and had thus cultivated the habit of being gentle in his actions, such as sticking out his pinkie finger. This kind of habit had also been brought into his daily life, but was this considered being a sissy?

The man in green suddenly stood up, and shouted harshly, “How dare you!”?Boom, his voice became a sound wave.?Peng, peng, peng, it shattered the floor tiles, and rushed out towards Ling Han.

Ling Han sent out a casual palm strike.?Shua, the assaulting sound wave was immediately separated into two, passing by on either side of himself and the Empress.?Peng, peng, peng, it destroyed all the floor tiles, tables, and chairs behind them. He was completely unconcerned; in any case, all of this would ultimately be placed on Liu Jun’s tab, and he would be paying compensation. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“So you do have some strength; no wonder you dare to repeatedly refuse my good intentions.” Liu Jun humphed, temporarily suppressing the displeasure he felt when Ling Han called him a sissy. “I want this shop, and you can name your price.”

“100,000,000 Star Stones,” Ling Han answered.

Liu Jun immediately looked furious. This broken-down shop’s owner actually asked for a price of 100,000,000 Star Stones? You might as well be committing robbery!

“Don’t misunderstand.” Ling Han smiled slightly. “This sum is for compensation. You wouldn’t be thinking that with you having beaten my people and crashed my shop, the matter would be resolved so simply, right?”

At this, to say nothing of how Liu Jun was fuming mad, even the fat man had snapped his eyes open, showing a gaze burning with viciousess, while the swordsman had also pulled his sword slightly out of its sheath, blazing with killing intent.

“Ha! Ha! Ha!” Liu Jun laughed coldly. “You are really very brave. I have never seen anyone as outrageously brazen as you! However, with no respect and no sense of propriety, a person like you would also die early!”

“Oh, are you threatening me?” Ling Han cracked a smile.

“It’s not a threat; I am just stating facts!” Liu Jun humphed. “Brother Hu, please make your move! Humph, he is unwilling to listen to kind words, and is so determined to make me use force; how preposterous!”

As his words fell, the fat man stood up.

Pa, once he stood up, the chair he was seated on immediately announced its timely death.

“A million Star Stones,” Ling Han kindly reminded him, pointing at the broken chair. Then, he turned, and said to the fat man, “Are you going to pay yourself, or will you be placing it on the sissy’s tab… You are his subordinate, so I might as well just write it on his tab. It would also be more convenient for me to collect.”

“Tear his mouth apart!” Liu Jun roared his fury. He was really extraordinarily furious.

He was a Three-Star Alchemist, and had hopes of advancing to become a Four-Star Alchemist even. To say nothing of how even Immortal Palace Tier elites would have to be polite towards him, even Ascending Origin Tiers would give him some face, and now Ling Han was repeatedly calling him a sissy. How could he tolerate that?

“Arrogant fool, you will be paying a painful price for your ignorance!” the fat man declared menacingly. Though he was exceedingly fat, the thing he hated others saying the most were words like plump, fat, and so on.

He raised his right hand, and an inky black seal lit up. Immediately, a darkness spread out from underneath his feet, extending out in all directions.

This was powerful poison, exuding a rotting smell that would induce nausea.

Not only was the smell extraordinarily foul, when the floor tiles and everything else were touched by the darkness, they would all be turned into poisonous liquid, and were also emitting waves of black gas.

“Haha, in my Dark Poison Territory, poison is everywhere, and with just the slightest skin contact, the spirit would immediately be numbed, and then would slowly rot, turning into a pool of poisonous liquid.” The fat man laughed loudly. Once his Dark Poison Territory was unfolded, it meant that he had already won half the battle.

Ling Han swept an eye over the surroundings, and couldn’t help but shake his head, saying, “4,000,000 Star Stones, 8,000,000 Star Stones…” With every table, chair, or floor tile that the poison corroded, he would call out a number for compensation, and the number naturally grew increasingly, soon reaching an astronomical sum.

At first, the fat man was extremely confident, but after a few breaths, the grin on his face disappeared, and he looked disbelieving. “Why haven’t you collapsed yet?”

This was not logical!

Ling Han glared at him, and demanded, “Are you planning on reneging on your debts?”

At this, the man in green and the swordsman both stood up, the looks they directed at Ling Han filled with wariness.

The aura that Ling Han had at Heaven Soul’s level, similar to them, but just now, Ling Han had clearly done nothing, but still the poisonous attack of the fat man was completely ineffective. This was something that they could not comprehend, and as a result, it caused a powerful wariness to rise up in them.

“240,000,000 Star Stones, thanks for the business,” Ling Han said smilingly towards Liu Jun.

Liu Jun gave Ling Han a profound look, then stood up abruptly, and said, “Consider it my error in judgement. As it turned out, the mere Rain Imperial Pavilion is actually concealing talent as well! This time, I will admit my defeat. Let’s go!”

He turned, planning to leave the shop. However, he had just turned around when he felt a grip tighten on his neck. Then, his body lightened as he was forcibly picked up.

A familiar face appeared in front of him. Who else could it be but Ling Han?

Liu Jun was both angered and astonished. He actually dared to pick up a Three-Star Alchemist like him by the neck; this was an outrage! On the other hand, he also felt teror. With the fat man and others by his side, Ling Han still managed to capture him. Could it be that the three of them were just props?

There was only one reason, and that was Ling Han was too strong, so strong that the fat man and the others did not even have the time to react.

“You, what do you want?” he asked in a trembling voice..
