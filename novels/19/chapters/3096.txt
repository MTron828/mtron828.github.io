3097 Attribute of good luck

“It’s too chaotic here. Senior Brother will bring you to a quieter place.” Zheng Tongfeng smiled.

He brought Ling Han to the elevator, and brought them to level one of the basement.

Elevator, something else powered by electricity.

Ling Han nodded. No wonder the rise of Demonic Beasts had caused such a huge upheaval to humanity.

Because humans relied too much on electricity, once the “power plant” was destroyed, the entire city would completely stop working.

Basement 1 was really quiet. There were private rooms here, and there was a beautiful woman with a superior temperament standing at the door of each private room. She didn’t have heavy makeup on, and her clothes weren’t revealing at all. However, her tight dress completely outlined her curves, making one’s blood rush faster.

“Welcome, Young Masters!” A beautiful woman with an elegant aura immediately came forward and bowed to the two of them. Looking downwards from her neck, one could see her snow-white breasts bulge through her collar.

However, this scene only lasted for a moment, and it made one feel a sense of regret at its disappearance.

Zheng Tongfeng couldn’t help but swallow his saliva. He was not just young-looking; he was indeed only 20 years old. He was in the prime of his youth, and a little teasing could make him lose his composure.

“Invite your lady boss over,” he said, his gaze fixed on the chest of the elegant beauty.

“Yes, Young Master.” The beauty bowed again and turned to leave. Her small butt was tightly wrapped in fabric, and she looked flirtatious with the swaying of her hips.

Although she was new here, she knew that the people who could enter this place were definitely major patrons of the casino, so she didn’t dare to neglect them at all.

Soon, a woman with a voluptuous figure walked over.

“Yo, isn’t this Young Master Zheng? Forgive me for not welcoming you from afar!” This woman walked over, swaying her voluptuous hips. Her slender waist and ample behind formed a sharp contrast. Coupled with her long legs, she was really capable of causing a nosebleed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In particular, her dress had a high-cut slit at the side. When she walked, a snow-white thigh was revealed, revealing her beautiful curves. It was so fair that it was dazzling.

Zheng Tongfeng’s eyes suddenly lit up as he scanned the woman greedily. After a while, he said, “Sister Yang, you’re really flattering me. I’m just a small fry. How can I be worthy of you coming over to welcome me from afar?”

“This is…” Sister Yang looked towards Ling Han. She bit her red lips, and her charming eyes were like water. She truly was captivating without even attempting to.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “Ling, Ling Han.”

He had seen too many beauties in the Genesis World, and there was no lack of seductive women among them. But had he ever been tempted?

Sister Yang couldn’t help but be surprised. She was very confident in her looks and figure. Any upright gentleman would be tempted by her. At the very least, they would blush, and their hearts would race. They wanted to look at her, but they didn’t dare to.

However, this young man in front of her was too calm. In his eyes, it was like she was just empty air.

However, she naturally wouldn’t show her thoughts. She smiled, and said, “This is Young Master Ling’s first time here. I will definitely treat you well.”

She invited Ling Han and Zheng Tongfeng into a private room, and a beautiful woman immediately brought over fine wine and fruits.

“Sister Yang, let me have some words with you.” Zheng Tongfeng waved at Sister Yang.

“Yo, what’s the matter? Why are you being so mysterious?” Sister Yang smiled as she walked out of the private room with Zheng Tongfeng.

“Sister Yang, Junior Brother Ling is the future Dao Child of our Ancient Dao Sect. Lord Sect Master dotes on him very much, and even bestowed him with a Meridian Guiding Fruit. You have to know that he has only joined our sect for less than 10 days,” Zheng Tongfeng said.

Sister Yang’s beautiful eyes couldn’t help but light up, and her small mouth opened slightly, revealing a row of snow-white teeth. This was an extremely charming sight.

Zheng Tongfeng felt a ball of fire ignite in his chest. He wished he could pounce on this coquettish beauty, but he could only think of this in his heart.

Not only was this beauty an elite of Six Meridians, but it was also said that the person behind her was a king tier of Eleven Meridians!

To say nothing of him, even Li Changdan couldn’t afford to offend her.

Otherwise, how could Sister Yang be safe and sound all this while, with her being such a beautiful woman and having such a profitable business?

“So, Sister Yang, why don’t you make a killing off him?” Zheng Tongfeng said with a smile.

Sister Yang also giggled. “You’re really bad. You are screwing over your own people!”

“Isn’t it because I like Sister Yang?” Zheng Tongfeng said as he stretched out his hand, wanting to take advantage of her.

However, Sister Yang twisted her delicate body and dodged it. She giggled, and said, “Alright, alright, alright. I’ll remember this favor. I’ll give you a 10% commission, alright?”

Zheng Tongfeng nodded. If Sister Yang was willing to sleep with him for a night, he would definitely not want anything else. However, even if Sister Yang was the one to offer it, he wouldn’t have the guts to do so. That would really be asking for death.

A beautiful dealer came into the room. She smiled sweetly at Ling Han, and asked, “Young Master Ling, what do you want to play?”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I don’t have a single cent, so I can’t play at all.”

“It’s fine. Sister Yang said that Young Master Ling’s identity is special, and his credibility is completely trustworthy. She gave Young Master Ling a quota of 100,000 Ancient Dao coins and 100 jade seeds,” the beauty said.

Ancient Dao coins were the currency issued by the Ancient Dao Sect, and were used by ordinary people. However, jade seeds were commonly used worldwide. Everyone knew the value of this thing.

“Here, these are your chips. The silver ones can only be exchanged for Ancient Dao coins, while the golden ones can be exchanged for jade seeds.” The beautiful woman pushed the chips of two colors over to Ling Han.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “Then let’s play dice, and compare the value we roll.”

He had a guess in his heart that needed to be verified.

“Okay.” The beautiful dealer took out some dice, and placed them on the table. “Young Master Ling, how much are you betting?”

“1,000 Ancient Dao Coins.” Ling Han searched for a while, and then tossed out a silver coin. This was also the smallest face value.

The beauty nodded. “Young Master Ling, please go ahead. According to the rules of the casino, the one with the bigger value wins. If the value is the same, the dealer wins.”

Ling Han picked up the dice, and casually tossed them out. One of them was actually one, and the other was two. This was practically the smallest value there could be.

The beauty revealed a smile. She would win as long as she didn’t throw two dice with a value of one point.

Putting aside the fact that she was well-trained, even a completely ordinary person would have a 90% chance of winning.

She picked up the dice and tossed them. The two dice began to spin.

The dice became slower and slower, and they were about to stop.

The two dice rotated at different speeds, so one of them stopped first. Just as it was about to stop on six points, for some reason, it moved slightly and became one point.

The beauty was stunned. She had actually made a mistake?

‘It’s fine, it’s fine, as long as the second dice isn’t the same value.’

However, things did not go as planned. When the second dice stopped, it was clearly a three, but for some reason, it moved again and became one.

‘This!’

Two ones, of course, lost to three points.

“Y-Young Master Ling is really lucky to have won the match right off the bat,” the beauty said reluctantly, her heart filled with confusion.

Ling Han smiled. He had guessed correctly. The luck attribute had taken effect.
