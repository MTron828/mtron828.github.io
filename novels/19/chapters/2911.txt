‘You’ve played a cruel trick on me, yet you’re still looking down on me?’

If Nalan Xiong possessed enough strength, he would definitely move to kill Ling Han. He couldn’t bear this anger.

“If you’re not here to register yourself, what have you come for?” Ling Han sat down, crossing one leg over the other.

Nalan Xiong wanted to say that he had come to laugh at Ling Han, but after what had just happened, how could he say such words? He was the real joke here, okay?

!!

“Ling Han, I really want to see how you will come back alive!” he said balefully.

“You don’t have to worry about that.” Ling Han waved his hand dismissively. “I am completely unrelated to you, so it won’t be good for you to stick close to me like this. Those who know will naturally understand that you are trying to curry favor with me, and those who don’t know will think that there is a problem with your sexual orientation in some aspect.”

‘This, this, this…’ Nalan Xiong was once again dumbfounded. This was too vicious, wasn’t it?

He really wanted to vomit blood.

“Humph, you can only talk tough now. I really want to see who will join a team of certain death like yours!” He regained his composure. After all, he was a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han chuckled. “Are you worrying for nothing again?”

Nalan Xiong took a few steps back, and then sat down cross-legged at a corner of the city wall. In any case, there was only three days’ time. He wanted to see how disappointed Ling Han would look. No one would be stupid enough to go with Ling Han.

Actually, it was not difficult for Ling Han to find someone to go with him. The Empress, Hu Niu, Hu Niu, the Rain Emperor, and the others would definitely agree to his request without a second word.

But how could Ling Han possibly allow them to take such risks?

Moreover, without battle prowess of the Fifth Tier, they wouldn’t be of much use even if they did go.

It was still better for Ling Han to go alone. When he saw that something was off, he could immediately flee, and could come and go as he pleased.

One day, two days, and three days’ time soon passed, yet not a single person took the initiative to look for Ling Han, wanting to join this decapitation mission. This was naturally within Ling Han’s expectations. He was completely unconcerned.

The cold smile on Nalan Xiong’s face became wider and wider. He wanted even more to see how Ling Han would begrudgingly go out to battle alone tomorrow. That would make him feel even more pleased.

However, right at this moment, a person walked over from a distance. When he arrived in front of Ling Han’s stone house, he stopped, and said to Nalan Xiong, “Is this the manor of Ling Han, Brother Ling?”

‘F*ck! Do you think I’m a doorman?’

Nalan Xiong’s expression immediately became very ugly. Nalan Xiong felt an urge to beat someone up again, but he didn’t make a move.

It was not that he did not want to, but rather that the other was also a Fifth Tier.

This was Fu Yuan, and it should only be tens of billions of years since he advanced into Fifth Tier, but his momentum was extremely shocking, and it was extremely possible that his strength was not inferior to Nalan Xiong’s.

Moreover, he hadn’t said anything insulting. If Nalan Xiong made a move rashly, it would definitely be his fault in the end, and he might be pressured into apologizing to him instead.

Nalan Xiong humphed, and acted as if he had not heard.

“Looking for me?” Ling Han pushed open the doors and walked out.

Fu Yuan smiled faintly, and said, “Brother Ling, I’m Fu Yuan, and I’ve come to ask if there’s any room left in this decapitation squad.”

Nalan Xiong couldn’t help but look surprised. Judging from the tone of this person, it seemed like he wanted to join the decapitation operation.

‘Hiss, has your head been kicked by a donkey?’

Even if he was tired of living, there was no need for him to use this kind of method to commit suicide, right?

Not even a complete corpse would be left behind.

Ling Han also faltered slightly, and then said, “There is room. Could it be that Brother Fu wants to join?”

Fu Yuan smiled slightly, and said, “That will depend on whether Brother Ling is willing to take me.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Brother Fu, don’t you know that this mission is extremely dangerous and fraught with danger?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Fu Yuan laughed loudly. “If that was not the case, wouldn’t it be boring?”

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. This answer surprised him slightly, but also gave rise to a feeling of appreciation of someone who shared the same principles.

“If Brother Fu does not fear death, then there is indeed room left for Brother Fu,” he said.

“Alright.” Fu Yuan nodded, and sat down at one side.

Nalan Xiong was extremely surprised. At first, he had thought that there would definitely be no one that would be going with Ling Han, but now Fu Yuan’s appearance caused his jaw to drop. Fu Yuan was a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and not some young brat. This was not a decision made in the heat of the moment.

“Is Brother Nalan going as well?” Fu Yuan looked towards him.

Nalan Xiong hurriedly waved his hands. He didn’t want to be morally kidnapped.

“Yi, then what is the meaning of Brother Nalan being here?” Fu Yuan’s expression was filled with confusion.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “I also want to know that myself.”

Nalan Xiong’s face involuntarily flushed red when he saw the two of them mock him together. Come to think of it, they were making sacrifices here, and it was one thing for him not to support them, but he actually came to see them make a fool of themselves. What was he doing?

Naturally, he naturally also treasured his pride as well. Immediately, he immediately stood up in anger and ran off.

Ling Han and Fu Yuan exchanged a glance, both laughing loudly.

“Brother Fu, do you know that the mission this time is extremely dangerous?” Ling Han asked seriously.

Fu Yuan nodded. “I have encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation, and need to experience life and death to help me break through.”

“All right, then we’ll support each other,” Ling Han said. With the help of a Fifth Tier elite, he had more confidence.

The two of them waited for a while, and the third day finally ended. However, no other person came over to register to participate in this mission. This was also within Ling Han’s expectations. In truth, Fu Yuan’s participation was already very surprising to him.

“Let’s go.”

Ling Han left behind the Celestial Guest Residence. Even if he could traverse freely in the Void, he had already become hostile with Hysteria. What if Hysteria just happened to catch him? Even if Hysteria could not use the power of its main body, one would still need Sixth-Tier power to resist a doppelganger.

At the very least, Ling Han had to take another step further, and only then would he be able to truly roam freely.

The team of two exited from the city wall, retracted their auras, and headed towards the enemy camp.

Though Hysteria’s troops were stationed 10,000 miles away, what was this bit of distance worth to Heavenly Venerates?

...

After only a short while, the two of them arrived outside the camp.

They shook their bodies slightly, and changed their form, becoming more or less like Hysteria’s troops. In any case, it was fine as long as they had many hands and feet, and looked extremely ugly. Then, it was their aura, which became cold and sinister.

They could not imitate the aura of Fifth Tier monsters, but there was no problem with Fourth Tier and Third Tier. Of course, this could only fool the enemy for a while. If they were carefully probed, they would not be able to hide at all.

The two of them swaggered into Hysteria’s encampment just like that. Most of the monsters here were brainless killing tools, and now they were resting under orders. The whole encampment was dead silent, as if it was a cemetery.

This was very bizarre. This was clearly a camp that had hundreds of thousands of troops, yet it was this silent.

“Where do we start looking?” Fu Yuan communicated through divine sense.

Though they had disguised themselves as Hysteria’s troops, all the “people” were resting, and only they were moving around. This was too obvious.

Although this was a base camp, Hysteria’s troops didn’t need tents and the like. The entire army was seated on the ground, like stone statues. All of them had their eyes closed, and though they all looked different, they felt more or less the same. How were they supposed to find their leader?

‘Those that had been bestowed with intelligence would definitely be slightly different,’ Ling Han thought.

He pulled Fu Yuan with him and sat down as well. Then, he released his divine sense, and began his search.
