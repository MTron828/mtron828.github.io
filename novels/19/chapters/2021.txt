Chapter 2022: Battle with Lan Tianyu

Lan Tianyu’s black hair was flowing and untied, and this gave him the charisma of an unrestrained and wild individual.

“Lan Tianyu,” Ling Han said with a nod. He sheathed his sword as he turned around to face this powerful opponent.

Lan Tianyu cracked a smile, and said, “I heard Xiao Jun say that you tried to lead others astray in the resting room. At that time, I already realized that you were unreliable, so I decided to keep an eye on you. Sure enough, I discovered that you immediately vanished after the battle. After looking around for a while, I’ve finally found you again.”

“So what?” Ling Han asked in a calm voice. Since he had been discovered, they would simply resolve this with a battle.

Was he afraid?

“I knew that a person like you couldn’t possibly be subdued. You simply put up a show so you could save your own skin. However, I’m truly very curious. Why have you suddenly decided to tunnel underground? Perhaps you discovered something?” Lan Tianyu asked in curiosity.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Oh? There’s something underground? Perhaps this is some secret?”

Lan Tianyu stared at Ling Han for a moment before saying, “Even though I find this hard to believe, I have to concede that a person like you won’t do something for no good reason. So, you definitely discovered something, am I correct?”

“Discovered something?” Ling Han replied with a faint smile.

Lan Tianyu was trying to pry information from Ling Han. He wanted to see if Ling Han had truly discovered the Source Power of heaven and earth that was hidden underground. If he had discovered it, then it was extremely likely that he wasn’t acting alone. Instead, he was most likely being supported by some powerful figure.

If that were the case, then they definitely couldn’t let their guard down. To say nothing of the fact that their Island Master was only at the Ascending Origin Tier, above which there was still the Celestial King Tier, what would it matter even if their Island Master were at the Celestial King Tier? They were like pests of heaven and earth, pests that were hunted and despised by everyone.

“There’s a Source Power of heaven and earth here,” Lan Tianyu said slowly. He stared at Ling Han as he said this, examining the minute changes in his expression.

However, Ling Han remained calm and composed, and he said, “I’m also very curious. Your elder brother is at the Ascending Origin Tier, so why are you such a disappointment? How are you only at the Dividing Soul Tier?”

Lan Tianyu humphed, and said, “My progress is slow because I’m reaching the level of perfection for each cultivation level. When I advance to the Ninth Lotus, which is equivalent to the Ascending Origin Tier, I’ll be invincible among those at my cultivation level.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but bend down in laughter. “Say, can you stop being so self-confident? Your aptitude... is indeed slightly stronger than that of those at the king tier. You can just barely be considered as an emperor tier. However, once you can’t draw on external power, what right will you have to stand here and say that you’re invincible among those at the same cultivation level?

“Trash like you then is abundant in the Eastern and Western Celestial Realm.”

This was naturally an exaggeration. To say nothing of emperor tiers, even king tiers were rare in the two Celestial Realms. However, as a top-tier monarch tier, Ling Han often came across fellow prodigies at the same level. As such, he naturally felt like such prodigies were abundant in number.

Lan Tianyu exploded in rage upon hearing this. He stared daggers at Ling Han, and a strong killing intent exuded from his body.

He had always been proud of his talent and aptitude, and he thought nothing of all other prodigies. It was because he was stuck in this place that he hadn’t been able to make a name for himself.

Now, however, Ling Han actually dared to belittle his talent?

He couldn’t endure this. He definitely couldn’t endure this.

“You actually dare to question my talent?” he asked in rage.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “Right now, I’m at the late stage of Yang Soul. What cultivation level are you at? Not only that, but even after drawing on the power of the sh*tty deity or whatnot, you’re still unable to defeat me. What right do you have to mention the words ‘talent’ before me?”

Lan Tianyu was rendered speechless. His cultivation level was equivalent to the peak stage of Yin Soul. However, without the power of the deity, his battle prowess would only be invincible among those at Earth Soul. It was still some way off from reaching Heaven Soul.

Compared to Ling Han, he was indeed far inferior.

Ling Han was truly a prodigy. Moreover, he was far more talented than Lan Tianyu. This caused the latter to feel wild with jealousy.

Since he was inferior... he would simply kill Ling Han! That way, there would be no one who was more prodigious than him.

“I initially planned to spare you. However, you’re seeking death yourself!” Lan Tianyu said in a baleful voice.

Ling Han roared with laughter as he brandished his Divine Demon Sword. “Then come battle!”

With a flash, he charged at Lan Tianyu.

During their previous battle, Lan Tianyu had enjoyed a small advantage. This wasn’t because Ling Han was weaker, but it was because the latter hadn’t wanted to unleash his trump cards. However, a battle to the death was different. He would unleash his full power to annihilate his opponent.

Most importantly, the Divine Demon Sword had advanced to the level of Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool. This was equivalent to reaching Heaven Soul.

Whoosh!

With a single slash, space was severed and clouds were obliterated. The surrounding earth was instantly shattered into nothingness.

Lan Tianyu was astonished. Ling Han’s cultivation was clearly unchanged, yet his battle prowess had surprisingly become several times more powerful. This was simply inconceivable!

It was that sword!

“A mere sword can actually elevate your battle prowess by so much? How astonishing!” Lan Tianyu’s feeling of jealousy became even stronger. His opponent was more talented than him, and he even possessed a peerless divine sword.

“It’s mine!” he roared.

Boom!

He became enveloped in a black aura, and a black lotus with seven petals also materialized between his brows. He immediately launched a counterattack.

Boom!

Ling Han’s sword slashed down, and Lan Tianyu was instantly sent flying, crashing into the wall with a thundering boom. This collision sent him flying back, and he couldn’t help but shudder due to the forceful impact. He felt as uncomfortable as could be.

At this moment, Ling Han had already caught up, and he immediately launched another slash. Lan Tianyu had no time to feel astonished, and he could only spit a burst of black air with a loud roar. This burst of air transformed into a violent column of flames, amid which a black symbol was materializing.

This wasn’t a symbol of the great dao. Ling Han was certain of this. After all, this symbol was completely different from the great dao of heaven and earth that he understood.

If this had been a symbol of the great dao, it would have intertwined and resonated with the Regulations of heaven and earth.

‘Hang on...’

Ling Han could sense mysterious power traveling over from above them, from the direction of the ancient castle. This power was fusing together with the black symbol, causing it to become more powerful.

Boom! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The black symbol smashed over with terrifying power.

Ling Han sneered upon seeing this. He then clenched his fists, and replied with a punch.

Boom!

The shock wave of the collision caused the newly created cave to shudder violently, with stone debris and dust raining down. It was as if the cave were about to collapse at any moment.

“Haha! Your strength is only so-so. Watch how I behead you!” Lan Tianyu said with a loud laugh. Without his divine sword, Ling Han’s battle prowess was no different from before.

Since he had been able to enjoy an advantage before, he could naturally replicate the same feat again.

“Is that so?” Ling Han said. He launched a flurry of punches, showing no signs of shirking from Lan Tianyu’s attacks. He would face his attacks head-on.

He still needed to obtain the Source Power of heaven and earth, so he had no time to waste here.

That being the case, he would end this battle as quickly as possible. He would end the life of his opponent.

“You’re seeking death!” Lan Tianyu said with a cold sneer. He was enjoying the protection of a deity, so his defenses were as powerful as could be. As such, facing him head-on would be nothing more than seeking death.

“I hope you can remain stubborn until the very end,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

They exchanged a flurry of punches in quick succession. Lan Tianyu couldn’t help but feel shocked. This was because his bones were already creaking under stress. However, Ling Han was still completely unscathed.

‘How is this possible?!’

“Y-you’re wearing some kind of protective armor!” Lan Tianyu exclaimed. He didn’t dare to face Ling Han head-on anymore.

In his mind, there was only a single answer to Ling Han’s defenses being stronger than his.

Ling Han scoffed upon hearing this, and he couldn’t be bothered explaining. Instead, he summoned his Nine Heavens Flame divided soul. Normally, this divided soul would comprehend the great dao under the Reincarnation Tree, allowing Ling Han to continually improve his cultivation.

At this moment, Ling Han unleashed his Heaven Destroying Nine Swords, while his divided soul was bathed in flames as it scorched heaven and earth with the Nine Heavens Flame.
