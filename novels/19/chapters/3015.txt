3016 White Snake

Ling Han sat there and enjoyed the wine, not showing any signs of wanting to help.

His cultivation was far too high, so in his eyes, this kind of conflict was nothing more than a skirmish between children. Thus, it naturally wouldn’t astonish him.

He wanted to see when Ning Haixin would remember him and ask him for help.

Moreover, just how powerful was her affinity?

Meanwhile, the Azure Sky Sect had already begun the battle. The Ascending Origin Tier elites all unleashed powerful attacks toward the lake spirits from the Heavenly Treasure Lake.

The 11 elites, which included Ning Daolan, were all brimming with killing intent.

Since the white snake hadn’t appeared yet, they would quickly dispose of all the Ascending Origin Tier enemies first. Afterward, they would encircle and attack the white snake. They were confident that the 11 of them would be enough to suppress the snake spirit.

Sure enough, the lake spirits from the Heavenly Treasure Lake quickly fell into a disadvantage. Even though they had the numbers, there were only seven Ascending Origin Tier elites among them. In this sense, they were at an absolute disadvantage.

In terms of individual strength, Ning Daolan, who was at the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, was more so able to crush everyone present.

Thus, this was an uneven battle that would most likely end soon.

The guests were all astonished. Were the lake spirits who had troubled the Azure Sky Sect for so long going to be thoroughly dealt with today?

If this were the case, then it would be a delightful occasion for the Azure Sky Sect. After all, who didn’t know that the Heavenly Treasure Lake was renowned for producing all kinds of natural treasures? However, the presence of the lake spirits meant that the Azure Sky Sect could only obtain a tiny amount of these treasures each year.

“Hmph!”

Right at this moment, a cold humph suddenly cut through the air. Everyone looked over, only to see a white shadow slice through the sky like a heavenly dragon. It radiated with an astonishing might.

Everyone instantly stopped their attacks.

They looked up, and what they saw was a colossal white snake that measured a whopping 30 kilometers in length. There were two small horns on its head, and there were also four legs on its abdomen.

“Is this… a True Dragon?” someone asked in a quivering voice. The pressure that the white snake exuded was far too immense, and it was as if a Celestial King had descended.

“No, its horns are too small, and there are only three claws on its feet. It can only be regarded as a flood dragon, not a True Dragon.”

“But it’s already close to becoming a True Dragon.”

The elites from the Azure Sky Sect knew that this was the white snake from the Heavenly Treasure Lake.

This white snake was extremely powerful, and since it possessed the bloodline of a True Dragon, it was very likely that it would become a Celestial King in the future.

If it weren’t for her, the Heavenly Treasure Lake would have become a private property of the Azure Sky Sect a long time ago.

Now, she had finally appeared, radiating with a boundless might. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

If the white snake weren’t completely focused on cultivation, and if it weren’t fond of peace and tranquility, then the Azure Sky Sect would have never been able to occupy the Heavenly Treasure Lake.

Facing the white snake again, Ning Daolan instantly felt a slight sense of trauma.

With a flash, the white snake instantly vanished from the sky. She transformed into a beautiful woman in a white dress, with her curves voluptuous and shapely. Her waist was also thin, and it could genuinely be said to be as thin as a snake’s waist.

She glanced at Ning Daolan, and said, “I want to bring your daughter away. Do you have any objections?”

Her voice was filled with a domineering aura.

Ning Daolan’s aura was immediately suppressed. He initially wanted to shake his head, but he hurriedly pushed away the urge in his mind, and said, “Celestial Maiden Bai, my daughter has already agreed to marry Brother Lu, Celestial King An Teng’s son!”

He was clearly using the Celestial King to suppress the white snake. Even though she was powerful and could crush those at the same cultivation level, what could she do against a mighty Celestial King?

However, the white snake was unfazed, and she simply gestured at Ning Haixin. “Come!”

How could Ning Haixin walk over? She was completely suppressed by Ning Daolan at this moment.

In reality, however, she was only doing this to put pressure on Ning Daolan. Was he going to release his daughter or not?

“A measly snake like you dares to act with such arrogance?” Lu Yang exclaimed, finally unable to endure this any longer.

‘F*ck! Are you people going to let me marry her or not?

‘Are you going to keep jumping out one after another? Is this very fun?!’

He was the son of a Celestial King!

Who dared to provoke a Celestial King?

“Hmph!” The white snake was a resolute being, and she didn’t utter any nonsense as she directly unleashed a palm strike at Lu Yang.

Boom!

A formidable power surged forth, carrying with it the projection of a colossal white snake.

Ning Daolan hurriedly stepped forward to block this attack. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to shake off the responsibility if something untoward were to happen to Lu Yang here. At that time, what would he say to Celestial King An Teng?

Peng!

The two attacks collided, transforming into a gust of chaotic wind that swept into the surroundings.

The guests instantly started to flee in disarray, afraid that they would be struck by this shock wave. This was a deadly shock wave that could easily kill them.

Peng, peng, peng!

As the gust of chaotic wind swept past, the already damaged wedding hall instantly transformed into a pile of debris.

Ning Daolan’s face was bright red. He did indeed block the attack, but the force of the white snake’s strike was so powerful that he felt as if he were about to explode.

He couldn’t help but feel astounded. After so many years, his strength had naturally improved by a significant amount. However, even though the white snake hadn’t advanced to the Celestial King Tier yet, the gulf between them had actually grown larger instead of smaller.

It was just a single exchange, but he felt pain all over, and it was as if his bones were about to fracture.

The white snake humphed and unleashed another palm strike.

Boom!

The projection of the colossal white snake appeared again.

Even though Ning Daolan felt pain all over, he had no option but to step forward and block this strike for Lu Yang again.

Peng, peng, peng!

The white snake unleashed 10 palm strikes in quick succession, yet they were all blocked by Ning Daolan. However, his expression was grim at this moment, and his aura was also as chaotic as could be.

He was already unable to fight. Otherwise, his body would soon explode.

However, the white snake resolutely unleashed another palm strike.

This strike would end Lu Yang’s life.

“Father-in-law, save me!” Lu Yang yelled. This wasn’t a strike that he could block.

Ning Daolan wanted to help him, but this was clearly something that was beyond his ability. He couldn’t sacrifice himself for Lu Yang, could he?

Boom!

The palm strike surged over.

Death was about to befall Lu Yang, yet a hand suddenly reached over from somewhere at this moment, catching the white snake’s strike.

“Sigh…” There was a soft sigh, and the person said, “How did my son offend you? Why are you so intent on killing him?”

Boundless iridescent light appeared in the sky, amid which there stood a person. There was a ribbon or iridescent light around him, and he looked much like the ruler of heaven and earth at this moment. He was paramount and lofty, and it was as if all beings had to prostrate before him.

This was a Celestial King.

“Father!” Lu Yang exclaimed in delight.

He had been harrassed for half a day, being called a bastard and being attacked by that white snake. None of them had treated him with respect. However, he had been unable to do anything about this.

Now, though, things were different. His father had arrived.

Even though An Teng was only a First Heaven Celestial King, was this not enough to deal with a measly Ascending Origin Tier elite?

A solemn expression finally spread across the white snake’s face. She hadn’t anticipated that Celestial King An Teng would personally come here.

What could she do now?

Boom!

Celestial King An Teng lashed out, grabbing at the white snake.

The white snake naturally wouldn’t stand there and allow herself to be captured. She immediately reverted to her original form, becoming a colossal white snake that possessed boundless power. With a shake, she could shatter mountains and depress the earth.
