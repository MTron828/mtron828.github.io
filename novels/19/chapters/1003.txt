Chapter 1004: Lustful Young Gang Leader

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was slightly surprised. The Black Five Gang had actually come for him and Shui Yanyu with such swagger?

Neither he nor Shui Yanyu had been too vicious or merciless when dealing with the five gang members. In fact, those five gang members had been the ones asking for trouble. Thus, it was quite surprising that the Black Five Gang had led so many members over for such a small matter.

“Hahahaha!” The members of the Great Chariot Gang all started to roar with laughter upon hearing the youth’s words.

“What a good beating!”

“We should beat the kids from the Black Five Gang whenever we see them!”

“Is the person living at our inn? Hehe, we should give him a free stay as a reward!”

A composed middle-aged man walked out from the crowd of people. He was the head of Great Chariot Gang in this area, and his cultivation level was at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. “Young Gang Leader has personally come for such a small matter?”

The young gang leader was called Jiang Anyun, and he was the only child of Jiang Ji, the gang leader of the Black Five Gang.

It was quite strange that the only child of the Black Five Gang’s gang leader had been drawn over for such a small scuffle.

“Young Gang Leader, it was them!” shouted a man who had a cast on his arm suddenly as he pointed at Ling Han and Shui Yanyu. He was none other than the man whose arm had been shattered by Ling Han after he tried to collect entrance fee yesterday.

Jiang Anyun looked where he was pointing, and his eyes swept over Ling Han without pause. To be exact, his gaze came to an abrupt stop on Shui Yanyu’s body. His eyes instantly widened, and his mouth involuntarily cracked into a grin. His throat moved a little as he gulped in excitement.

She was far too beautiful and far too bewitching. Her stunning beauty was like a little hand that tickled at his heart, and he could barely stop himself from lunging over and pushing the seductive beauty down.

Indeed, it was extremely normal for someone’s underlings to be beaten in Tyrant Axe Harbor. Who told them to be the weaker side? Generally speaking, the Black Five Gang would let such matters slide if no one was killed or severely wounded.

After all, who knew if the aggressor had any powerful background or not? If the aggressor included descendants of some elite at the Heavenly Body Tier, even the Yang Clan would be obliterated in a day, much less the Black Five Gang.

However, Jiang Anyun had coincidentally heard his underling say that there was a breathtakingly beautiful woman among the two people.

Who didn’t know that Young Gang Leader Jiang couldn’t resist the charms of beautiful women?

Thus, he personally led his gang out under the guise of revenge when his goal was, in fact, meeting the stunning beauty.

Sure enough, she was as beautiful as a fairy, as beautiful as peach flowers!

“Cough, cough!” He finally regained his senses after coughing for a while, and said, “Brat, you wounded my underlings. How are you going to pay?”

At this moment, there was no more noise from the Great Chariot Gang.

After all, Jiang Anyun wasn’t a normal member of the Black Five Gang. If he was wounded, there was a possibility that Jiang Ji would seek revenge without any thought for consequences. Although the Great Chariot Gang was hostile toward the Black Five Gang, they definitely didn’t want to force them into a life-and-death struggle.

As long as the Black Five Gang didn’t overstep any boundaries, they weren’t willing to make the first move.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Your underlings frightened me. How are they going to pay?”

‘Oh, so it was him!’ This thought appeared in everyone else’s mind when they heard the exchange between Jiang Anyun and Ling Han.

They couldn’t help but find the situation funny. ‘You beat his underlings, yet you’re saying that you were frightened?’

Sure enough, trouble would follow Ling Han wherever he went.

Jiang Anyun humphed, and said, “You’re standing there without a scratch on your body; why do we need to pay? Enough with the nonsense. Hand your female companion over, and I’ll count this matter as settled!”

‘So that’s what he wants!’

The spectators instantly understood what was going on. No wonder Jiang Anyun had come for such a small matter. He had set his eyes on Ling Han’s female companion!

‘Pei! What a lecherous bastard!’

However, many people were actually extremely envious of Jiang Anyun. If they were as powerful as him, they would also barge in with a domineering aura and forcefully make the seductive beauty their own. Truly, it would be worth sacrificing 10 years of their life just to touch her slender and beautiful hand. If they could embrace her for a night, hehe...

Shui Yanyu drew her Divine Sword in fury, and was just about to charge over.

Ling Han raised his arm to block her, and said, “There’s no need for you to mind this barking dog. If it truly jumps here to bite people, we can lop its head off then.”

Shui Yanyu nodded as she sheathed her sword. However, her face was still frosty with anger. Even so, her angry expression was still captivating enough to bewitch many people.

Jiang Anyun gulped down his saliva, and suddenly shouted at Ling Han, “Brat, I’m willing to pay 1,000,000 True Origin Stones for her!”

Gasp!

Everyone inhaled sharply. 1,000,000 True Origin Stones! What king of stunning wealth was this?

Generally speaking, one True Origin Stone was enough to buy a flower-like beauty. Meanwhile, 10,000 True Origin Stones was enough to captivate the heart of a beauty at the Mountain River Tier. So, what could 1,000,000 True Origin Stones buy?

Young Gang Leader Jiang was truly addicted to beautiful women.

Ling Han humphed in anger. He wouldn’t sell Shui Yanyu even if he were short on money. Moreover, how could Jiang Anyun truly pay him 1,000,000 True Origin Stones? He was merely a young gang leader, not the actual leader of the gang.

His offering a whopping 1,000,000 True Origin Stones was simply bait to lure Ling Han away from the territory of the Great Chariot Gang. That way, it would be much easier for them to snatch the beauty.

“Wife, don’t mind these stupid fools,” Ling Han said to Shui Yanyu.

Shui Yanyu nodded in understanding. She naturally wouldn’t bother with such boorish people. The two of them turned around to enter the inn.

Jiang Anyun wanted to chase them, yet the members of the Great Chariot Gang had already formed a barrier to block his path.

“Young Gang Leader!” The members of the Black Five Gang hurriedly held Jiang Anyun back. If he were captured by the Great Chariot Gang, they would definitely be beaten to death by Jiang Anyun when they returned to their territory.

“Let go of me!” Jiang Anyun shouted. His soul had already been stolen by Shui Yanyu.

“Young Gang Leader, please listen to me,” an elder said. “These two youths have definitely come here to search for treasures in the sea. If that’s the case, dealing with them becomes simple. As long as we board the same ship as them, we can... hehe... They won’t be able to escape our grasp!”

Jiang Anyun’s eyes lit up in delight. This was a brilliant idea. However, he immediately said, “We have to wait until tomorrow for the earliest ship.”

“Young Gang Leader, endure for one more day, just one more day,” the elder said hurriedly. ‘This young gang leader is far to rash. How can he be so addicted to female beauty? Fortunately, our gang leader is still young and healthy, and will definitely live longer than Jiang Anyun. Otherwise, if this person were to become gang leader, the gang would definitely collapse in 10 days.’ RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Let’s go!” Jiang Anyun only waved his arm and signaled for everyone to leave when he couldn’t see Shui Yanyu’s figure anymore.

‘One day... will pass by quickly.’

However, Jiang Anyun exploded in rage the very next day. Ling Han and Shui Yanyu hadn’t boarded a ship! Rather, they were still holed up in the inn.

“Why aren’t they setting out to sea yet?” he asked loudly. He really wanted to kill someone right now.

The elder who had proposed the plan wiped beads of cold sweat from his forehead as he replied, “Er... Young Gang Leader, perhaps they’re afraid of you?”

“Trash!” Jiang Anyun slapped the elder in fury, and then said, “Keep them under constant surveillance and don’t let them escape. Otherwise, I’ll skin you alive!”
