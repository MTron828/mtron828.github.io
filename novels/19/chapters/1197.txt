Chapter 1198: The Rain Emperor had Disappeared

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They were prodigious king tiers, yet they could only act as mere bait.

This left Ling Han and the others feeling extremely uncomfortable. However, this was the undeniable truth—as prodigious as they were, they were still mere trash before power at the Eternal River Tier.

The death of Wu Zhe was a bloody reminder of this fact. He had become a host to the divine sense of a Netherworld elite, and in the end, he had been mercilessly killed.

Before the blue-skinned elite, even the most talented prodigies of this galaxy were like fragile debris. They didn’t even have the right to make him hesitate.

This was a fate that could befall any one of them.

However, why had such a fate befallen Wu Zhe? That was simply because he had been the weakest member of the seven king tiers. He was the easiest to possess, and thus he had been chosen.

The king tiers were unable to accept this.

They could die in battle, but dying like this... It was far too vexatious, and it was far too meaningless.

However, whom could they complain to?

The blue-skinned elite had died, and the Netherworld elite had also been killed. Wu Zhe, the unfortunate victim of all this, had also died.

The six king tiers remained silent for a long time. Only the Yellow Spring continued to crash through the sky. This river was formed from the corpse of an Eternal River Tier elite, and it continued to flow even tens of millions of years after his death. It was as if it would flow for all eternity.

At this moment, they all understood why this Yellow Spring felt so eerie and so harrowing. This was because it contained power from the Netherworld.

“Let’s explore the palace and see if we can obtain some more secret techniques,” Shi Anguo said. He was the first to break the silence.

Everyone nodded in agreement. What was done was done, and the dead couldn’t be brought back to life, either. Moping over this matter wouldn’t be of any help. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They returned to the palace, where the light orbs still silently hovered in the air. However, these light orbs would still dash away when they tried to grab them, giving them no chance of obtaining the secret techniques inside.

By the looks of it, their strength was insufficient to obtain these light orbs.

As king tiers of the younger generation, Ling Han and the others naturally knew when to let things go. They resolutely turned around to leave.

There were still many valuable items on the way out, such as Godly medicines and perhaps some ancient techniques left in the ancient sites. Staying in the palace would be a complete waste of time. If they made their way to the entrance now, they would at least still obtain some treasures. It was just a matter of how much they obtained.

After exiting the palace, they all turned around to take one final look. That was where Wu Zhe had died, though not a single scrap of his being was left. They all shook their head before leaving.

After a long time, Ling Han released Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun from the Black Tower. When the old ginseng appeared, his expression was dark, and he said, “Sh*tty brat, what kind of Spatial Tool is that? Why is it so freakish?”

He had almost been planted, and he had almost had his awareness erased by the Tool Spirit inside. In other words, he had almost become a Godly medicine for consumption again. Not only that, but there was even an old divine tree inside, one that was far higher in grade than himself. He had no choice but to obediently call him grandpa.

Moreover, the divine sense of a Saint was wrapped around a branch of the divine tree, and this person still terrified him, even though his might was already non-existent.

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “Was it fun?”

“Fun your mom! See how I stomp you to death! You actually dared to scare your grandpa!” The old ginseng became angrier by the second, and he angrily launched a kick at Ling Han.

Ling Han casually blocked his strikes. The old ginseng was simply venting his anger, and he wasn’t genuinely having a falling out with Ling Han. Thus, he quickly stopped his attacks.

“What a hot temper,” Ling Han said with a smile.

The old ginseng’s eyes darted about, and he turned to Shui Yanyu, saying, “Beauty, want to change a partner? I’m definitely more useful than that brat. See, my entire body is exuding a treasured aura. Breathing in a lungful will increase your lifespan by three years and make you younger by 10 years! Ow!”

Ling Han had hammered him on the head, and he instantly grabbed his head in pain.

They returned the way they came, and they arrived before the medicinal mountain after just a few days. Ling Han started to undo the restrictions again, and they tried to harvest as much Godly medicine as they could. However, undoing the restrictions took an extremely long time, and thus they were forced to set off again after obtaining just two Godly medicines.

They walked against the flow of the Yellow Spring, and they quickly arrived at the place where they had entered.

This place was already brimming with people as there were only three days left before the half-year time limit expired. People naturally came here a few days earlier because missing the exit date and being trapped inside this mystery realm meant death.

“Master!” Ding Ping was the first to run over. Mu Rong Qing and the others followed after him. None of them had reached the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, and thus none of them had gone to the Eagle Beak Mountain and so on. Instead, they had deviated from this standard route and went elsewhere in search of their own opportunities. This allowed them to obtain quite a bountiful harvest.

“Huh? Second Brother still hasn’t returned,” Ling Han said as he looked around. Out of those who had entered this mystery realm, only the Rain Emperor was still missing.

Feng Po Yun and the others all shook their heads. They had each gone their own way, and thus they didn’t know what opportunities the Rain Emperor had come across, nor did they know what troubles he had encountered.

“With Second Brother’s strength and willpower, he should be able to stay safe and escape even if he comes across dangerous situations,” Ling Han said. He was confident in the Rain Emperor’s abilities.

“Huh? Sister Shui, Ninth King, why are you ladies also here?” Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er walked over at this moment. They were also disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect, so they could naturally enter this mystery realm as well.

Ling Han hadn’t revealed his identity to them yet, and thus they didn’t know that he was Ling Han. They merely found it strange that Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun were in the company of an unfamiliar man.

This was especially the case with Shui Yanyu. Hadn’t she been all lovey-dovey with Ling Han? Perhaps she had dumped him after not seeing him for three years?

‘That stupid blockhead! So pitiful!’

Shui Yanyu nodded at the two women. Hu Feiyun was much friendlier in comparison, and she immediately started to chatter with them. She was extremely young, so she naturally craved friends that were at a similar age to her. She wanted friends with whom she could share her grief and happiness.

Fortunately, Hu Feiyun guarded the secret of Han Lin’s identity... but this was probably because Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er hadn’t asked. If they asked, Ling Han was almost certain that Hu Feiyun would spit out the truth. Ling Han didn’t trust this ditzy woman to keep a secret.

A day passed, and then two...

However, the Rain Emperor still didn’t return.

Ling Han and the others started to become anxious.

There was only a day until the entrance to the mystery realm reopened, and they would all have to leave at that time. Otherwise, they would remain in this mystery realm forever.

What on earth had the Rain Emperor come across?

In this anxious atmosphere, the third day rolled around. However, there was still no sign of the Rain Emperor.

Weng!

The air distorted, and a passageway silently appeared in the sky. They could vaguely see a giant ripping space apart with his hands.

This giant was none other than Venerable Trinity.

“It’s time to leave.”

“Let’s go!”

The cultivators started to stream out. However, there were quite a lot of people here, so they couldn’t all leave at once.

“Where’s Second Brother? Why has he still not returned?” Mu Rong Qing was pacing about in unease.

Ling Han was also extremely worried. However, a thought suddenly flashed through his mind, and he said, “Perhaps Second Brother is the chosen one.”

“What chosen one?” Feng Po Yun and the others asked.

“I entered the abode that belonged to the owner of this mystery realm, and he had left a dying note. He said that ‘when the seven stars align, ’tis the time my successor appears’. The seven stars referred to me, He Tao, and the others. It was us seven who had opened the door to the palace. As for the latter half of that sentence, it’s probably saying that the senior will choose a successor.

“I had initially thought that it would be one of the seven king tiers. However, by the looks of it now... he probably chose someone else.

“It’s extremely likely that he chose Second Brother!”
