2960 Descendants

Ling Han nodded. “I want to see your clan leader.”

“Please wait for a moment, milord.” The two guards hurriedly nodded. One stayed behind to speak with Ling Han, while the other hurriedly flew into the mountains to make his report.

After a short while, a Celestial King approached them. However, this Celestial King was only at the First Heaven.

He was a young man dressed in green, exuding an extraordinary bearing.

“I am Ling Gaoyuan. Greetings, Senior!” This young man bowed respectfully towards Ling Han.

The Empress and Hu Niu couldn’t disguise themselves as Celestial Kings, so they simply suppressed their auras. They were roughly equivalent to Ascending Origin Tiers, and they had also changed their exquisite appearances. Thus, they didn’t attract any attention at all, and were completely ignored by this young man.

Ling Han looked at him. His surname was Ling, and that meant that he was Ling Jianxue’s descendant. However, he didn’t know which generation of descendants he belonged to.

His aptitude… wasn’t all that impressive.

Ling Han sighed internally. It could not be helped. The bloodline would definitely become thinner and thinner the more it was passed on. From the fourth generation, Ling Tianhua, there were signs that he was far inferior to Ling Jianxue and Ling Feifan. It was practically impossible for him to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Hence, when it was passed down to Ling Gaoyuan’s generation, there would be no hope of becoming a Heavenly Venerate. It would already be very impressive if they could become Celestial Kings.

Ling Han nodded. “I am Han Lin. I just happened to pass by here, so I have come to pay you a visit.”

Ling Gaoyuan was slightly puzzled. This could be considered a reason?

However, the other was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, so whatever he said was naturally true. Ling Gaoyuan had no right to refute. He wasn’t afraid, either. His father was a Sixth Heaven Celestial King. There were nine Heavens in the Celestial King Tier, and advancing one step further was as difficult as ascending the heavens. Was there any need to worry that this Han Lin would harbor malicious intentions?

“Those who come are guests. I am sure that my father would definitely be willing to converse with Senior. Please!” Ling Gaoyuan’s expression was respectful.

He invited Ling Han to ascend the mountains, and after entering into an elegant guest room, he called over a manservant to serve fragrant tea. “Senior, please sit down for a while, and allow me to withdraw and ask for instructions from my father. However, my father is presently in seclusion, and may not be able to entertain Senior in the next few days.”

“No matter,” Ling Han said with a smile. In any case, he had all the time in the world.

After Ling Gaoyuan left, Ling Han released his divine sense and scanned the entire Western Desert Desert Mountains. Soon, he revealed an astounded expression.

There was not a single Heavenly Venerate here.

Previously, he had only thought that Ling Jianxue, Ling Xi, and the others had gone into seclusion. After so many years, the Heavenly Venerates had also developed the habit of keeping a low profile, and it was normal for them not to show themselves.

But no matter what, there should at least be a Heavenly Venerate in the main camp, right?

Aside from Ling Jianxue and Ling Xi, what about the large black dog, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, the Rain Emperor, and the others?

Ling Han was extremely confused. Logically speaking, this shouldn’t be the case.

He had to find out.

‘Then let’s just wait.’

Ling Han, the Empress, and Hu Niu all suppressed their impulse and settled down here. They would eat and drink well every day, and wait for that Sixth Heaven Celestial King to come out of seclusion.

This Celestial King was called Ling Feizhou, but no one knew the name of Ling Feizhou’s last generation, because Ling Feizhou had only moved here a few hundred million years ago. As for where he had previously lived, no one knew.

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

Ling Han woke up early as usual, and walked around on the mountains, comprehending the heaven and earth.

There were dimensions in his body, but every dimension was empty, and had not nurtured any life. This was still very far from the real Genesis World.

Being able to create things was true transcendence from the heaven and earth, transcending life and death.

Hysteria was capable of creating things, though all it created were monsters. This was something that no Seventh Tier could compare to.

Ling Han pondered over this question. If he could create, his power would undoubtedly be greatly boosted.

Just look at the Realm War. The more living beings there were in the dimension, and the stronger they were, the stronger the dimension itself would be.

Previously, the Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm had battled for countless years. Why was it that the Foreign Realm was still unable to achieve victory? That was because there were many living beings on the Celestial Realm, and they had boosted the power of the dimension.

However, creation was far, far too difficult.

Ling Han appreciated heaven and earth, appreciating every blade of grass and every tree in the mountains. Though they were extraordinarily weak, they were all living beings, and he could not duplicate them.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! A few figures streaked across the skies, and an instant later, their auras assaulted, enshrouding the entire Western Desert Mountains.

These were four Celestial Kings. The strongest had reached the Eighth Heaven, while the others were all Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Ling Han frowned slightly. These Celestial Kings were all filled with animosity. Had they come to crash the party?

If it weren’t for him, that Eighth Heaven Celestial King would have been able to suppress a Sixth Heaven Celestial King. The Ling Clan would have definitely suffered a loss. However, with him here, hehe…

“Surviving dregs of the Ling Clan, get out here!” A loud shout rang out, rumbling like thunder.

Ling Han was instantly angered. Surviving dregs of the Ling Clan?

Surviving dregs!

“Four seniors have arrived, please forgive this junior for not coming out to receive you.” Ling Gaoyuan flew into the sky, paying his respects to the four Celestial Kings.

This caused Ling Han to feel displeased. The other had already delivered a slap, and you still took the initiative to approach?

But upon further thought, the Ling Clan only had a Sixth Heaven Celestial King Tier, so how would he have the confidence to do anything else?

Ling Han suppressed this displeasure, and the killing intent in his heart rose.

Did they really think of him as a traitor, and wantonly beat down on his descendants?

Where were Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the others? Why didn’t they help take care of his descendants?

“There is no need to be so hypocritical. Descendants of a traitor, kneel down quickly and accept your punishment!” a Fifth Heaven Celestial King said. He was dressed in a long red robe, his hair black, exuding an air of elegance.

However, when he was saying these words, there was a strong hint of disdain and superiority in his tone.

Ling Han finally couldn’t bear it any longer. With a thought, the red-robed Celestial King let out an exclamation of surprise, and instantly fell from the skies. Peng! He landed heavily on the ground, and the whole upper half of his body was embedded into the ground.

What was going on?

The remaining three Celestial Kings were all very confused. Even Ling Gaoyuan was surprised. No matter how much the other party looked down on him, there was no need for him to use such a method, right?

“Ling Feizhou, is there any point to secretly move and bully a junior?” that Eighth Heaven Celestial King spoke up, his voice booming.

Ling Gaoyuan heard his words, and only then did he know that his father had made a move. His face was filled with surprise. Could it be that his father had broken through?

However, he clearly hadn’t seen a heavenly tribulation descend, so how had his father silently advanced to the Seventh Heaven?

“Scram!” Ling Han spoke up, his voice reverberating in all directions. Celestial Kings couldn’t possibly discover where he was.

“Humph, you are just a mere Sixth Heaven Celestial King, what shameless boasting!” The Eighth Heaven Celestial King humphed coldly, and sent out a palm strike, which descended downwards.

When an Eighth Heaven Celestial King moved, they could easily flatten the Western Desert Mountains.

“Sir, why do you have to be so forceful?” A figure flew out from the mountains, and delivered a large palm strike.

This was Ling Feizhou, but how could a mere Sixth Heaven Celestial King be capable of matching the might of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King?

Ling Han shook his head, and quietly flicked a finger.

Boom! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the skies, the giant hand crashed into that attack from the Eighth Heaven Celestial King, and both were instantly annihilated.

‘Huh?

Everyone was astonished.
