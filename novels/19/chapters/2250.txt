Chapter 2251: Second Secret

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In order to boost the morale of the army, the Celestial Kings also divulged some other news.

For example, Ji Wuming and the other Monarch Stars had all received extremely good nurturing. Several Celestial Kings who were skilled in the Regulations of Time had provided help, even sacrificing some of their essence to accelerate the flow of time for them. They had artificially created more time for these prodigies to cultivate.

In addition to the endless flow of cultivation resources from the entire Celestial Realm, the cultivation of these Monarch Stars had progressed at an astonishing rate. All of them had already surpassed the Fifth Secret.

However, the Celestial Kings didn’t reveal the exact cultivation level that they had reached.

One had to realize that there were potentially spies of the Foreign Realm in the Clear Heaven Pass.

This was extremely normal. After all, the Celestial Realm was the weaker of the two, and they were in a position of absolute disadvantage. Thus, it was only natural that some people would change their allegiance and betray the Celestial Realm. In fact, there might even be powerful and influential beings among the traitors.

As such, they naturally couldn’t reveal too much important information.

The two sides agreed to hold the third sparring session in the neutral zone in one month’s time.

It was referred to as sparring, yet in reality, these were incredibly bloody and vicious battles. Which sparring session hadn’t resulted in death? Which sparring session hadn’t resulted in prodigies becoming cripples, completely severing their cultivation journey?

It was just that these sacrifices had all been suffered by the Celestial Realm.

Now, however, the Celestial Realm was brimming with confidence. This was because they could finally unleash their own Monarch Stars this time.

In the past, they had achieved a draw in the battle between Ailean and Gaddalon. Recently, the “chicken slayer” had defeated Yamu with a single punch. Now, they were going to send Ji Wuming and the others. The morale of the Celestial Realm rose by a noticeable amount.

Taking advantage of this one month, Ling Han exchanged all of his bountiful harvest for Star Stones. He then wantonly purchased Godly metal.

At the same time, he also returned to the neutral zone, where he extracted all of the Godly metal from the realm. He used all that to elevate the level of his Divine Demon Sword.

However, he immediately sighed after doing this. This was because this heaven and earth was truly far too small. It had simply been created by the collision and fusion between the two realms. Thus, there wasn’t too much Godly metal in this realm.

Of course, this was only comparatively speaking. The Divine Demon Sword hadn’t ascended to become a Celestial Tool, yet it still soared from the level of Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool to Eight-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool.

Eight stars!

What kind of concept was this?

Right now, the Divine Demon Sword could even breach the defenses of Ascending Origin Tier elites and threaten their lives.

“It’s drawing closer and closer to 10 stars,” Ling Han said with a beaming smile. After reaching 10 stars, the Divine Demon Sword could undergo a final ascension, and become a Celestial Tool.

If it were any other Celestial Tool, he wouldn’t be able to wield it even if it were gifted to him. However, something that he had personally refined was completely different. He could unleash its full might. Of course, with his current strength, he couldn’t engrave a Celestial King Tier martial intent on the Divine Demon Sword. He could only use it as a physical weapon.

Even so, just a wisp of murderous aura from such a Celestial Tool could easily shred apart the body of an Ascending Origin Tier elite. Its might was simply astonishing.

This was similar to how Ji Wuming had forced him to flee and hide when wielding a divine sword in the past.

After enhancing the Divine Demon Sword, Ling Han entered the Black Tower, and started to cultivate toward the Second Secret.

Even though he had continued to obtain knowledge from the Origin Magic Cube all these years, this was a treasure at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Just a small amount of benefits would help him immensely. Thus, his cultivation had unknowingly reached the peak stage of the First Secret. He could now attempt to break through to the Second Secret.

“Second Brother, Hu Niu, Luan Xing, and the others were most likely able to reach the Second Secret or even Third Secret long ago. Fortunately, I refined many Thousand Year Dream Pills, and already gave them to them. Otherwise, I would have hindered their progress,” Ling Han murmured to himself as he retrieved a Thousand Year Dream Pill, and popped it in his mouth.

Boom!

His body shuddered, and his divine sense was forcefully dragged out from his body, entering the river of time.

The memories that he had had severed instantly returned, and he recalled that he had once been hunted by the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate here.

“Just what in the world are these Heavenly Venerates playing at?” he murmured. He mulled over this as he advanced.

“If the Celestial Realm is destroyed, how does this benefit them? Why are they so passive in defending against this invasion?

“Alternatively, if they wish for the Celestial Realm to be destroyed, why don’t they actively attack and help the Foreign Realm?”

If the three Heavenly Venerates teamed up, they could easily massacre the entire world. At that time, there would naturally be no one to stop the invasion from the Foreign Realm. As a result, they could engulf this heaven and earth countless times quicker.

“Also, the Ancient Realm being cut into two was also the doing of the Heavenly Venerates. Only they have such immense abilities. However, this has essentially prohibited Genesis Tier cultivators from ascending into the Celestial Realm.

“Moreover, there are also strict rules that prohibit people from the Celestial Realm bringing cultivators back from the Ancient Realm.

“At the end of the day, they don’t want people to enter the Celestial Realm. What’s the reason behind this?”

As smart as Ling Han was, he still couldn’t fathom the reason behind any of this. He couldn’t help but find these decisions conflicting or illogical.

“Forget about it. With my current cultivation level, I don’t have the right to make any sense of this. It’s more important to raise my cultivation level first.”

His ascension was extremely smooth this time. No Heavenly Venerate entered the Timestream to attack him, so he was able to reach the Second Secret with ease. This time, he chose his liver as the secret realm. With two secret realms cultivated, he instantly felt his power rising by a significant amount.

“The cultivation level of Second Secret Monarch Stars is equivalent to the Third Secret. Meanwhile, their battle prowess can rival those at the peak stage of the Sixth Secret!”

Comparatively speaking, Monarch Stars possessed a cultivation that was one Secret superior to monarch tiers. The gulf between them was like the gulf between monarch tiers and emperor tiers. It was extremely evident.

“Heh, in any case, my progress is indeed very slow. Ji Wuming and the others have already surpassed the Fifth Secret, and perhaps they’ve already reached the Sixth, Seventh, or even Eighth Secret,” Ling Han murmured to himself. However, he didn’t pay much heed to this.

He had witnessed the secret of the birth of heaven and earth, so the level of his knowledge was transcendent above the Regulations. As a result, his way of considering problems and viewing things had also changed. This would most definitely be reflected in his future cultivation.

To him, the nine heavens of the Celestial King Tier would truly be a walk in the park. Even if he weren’t a Monarch Star, advancing through these cultivation levels would still be a breeze.

Monarch Stars could definitely become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. However, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings weren’t necessarily all Monarch Stars. Thus, there was still a huge gulf between the different Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

“Second Secret, huh? This is most likely at the bottom of the pile among the Monarch Stars. However, if we do battle in the neutral zone… Heh…” Ling Han stroked his chin in thought. If Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could enter the neutral zone, he could hunt them down with an intention to kill.

He didn’t exit the Black Tower, and he instead started to investigate the Regulations contained within the Origin Magic Cube.

This was something born from the fusion between the two realms, so it contained the Regulations of not only the Celestial Realm, but also the Foreign Realm.

Right now, he was investigating the Regulations of this Foreign Realm. This was because he harbored a daring plan—he wanted to enter the Foreign Realm to have a look around. However, if he didn’t practice the cultivation method of the Foreign Realm, entering recklessly would be no different from seeking death. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

With the Origin Magic Cube, however, he now had a chance to investigate the Regulations of the Foreign Realm.

Several days passed in the outside world, and this was equivalent to several thousand years in the Black Tower. Ling Han attained a certain level of enlightenment.

“Gaddalon and the others are all extremely arrogant. They view the Celestial Realm with disdain, and they refer to us as a super-lowly dimension… I don’t understand what dimension means, but their power and arrogance aren’t without reason.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. The Regulations of the Foreign Realm also possessed flames, time, and all other things. Comparing them against the Regulations of the Celestial Realm, Ling Han discovered that they were all more powerful.

The Regulations being more powerful also signified that their heaven and earth was more powerful. The neutral zone was a tangible proof of this—its heaven and earth was weaker, so the upper limit of its Regulations was also lower.

Thus, a higher-level… dimension could affect the overall level of cultivation.
