Chapter 3414: Threats

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xuanyuan Dingguo rambled on for a while, but Ling Han completely ignored him.

Ling Han didn’t care whether this guy misunderstood or not. The ones who would truly affect Ling Han were the Seventh Imperial Prince and other extremely terrifying beings who held real power and were strong themselves. Among the Majestic Empire’s elites, aside from the Four Great Generals even the Council Chairman, Grand Tutor Hong, and the others weren’t allowed to have private troops. However, this kind of restriction didn’t apply to the Imperial Princes.

As long as you had enough wealth and charm, you could strengthen yourself however you liked.

This seemed to be Chen Fengyan’s intention to test his sons, so that they could compete with each other and he could choose the most suitable person to inherit the throne.

Firstly, the younger Imperial Princes were not very talented, and secondly, they had also missed the best time for their development, so they were completely negligible. However, those who were older, especially the Imperial Princes who were the ten eldest, all possessed powerful abilities, and their subordinates were also filled with talent.

Thus, if Ling Han was targeted by the Seventh Imperial Prince and the others, it would be very troublesome for him.

Thankfully, his present strength was enough to sweep aside all Inscription Tier opponents, and even if it was the Seventh Imperial Prince and the others, could they have the subordinates that were Enlightenment Tier elites?

Perhaps there were, but it was definitely very rare. Ling Han could rely on Absolute Fairness to pull down the other’s cultivation level, and easily kill them.

But if the Imperial Princes joined forces to attack him, that would be troublesome.

After all, Absolute Fairness could only be used for 10 minutes. Moreover, just like boiling blood and Qi, it couldn’t be stopped once it was activated.

This little girl!

Ling Han mulled over how he was going to solve this dilemma.

However, Xuanyuan Dingguo had just left when the Seventh Imperial Prince walked over.

“Greetings, Your Imperial Highness.” Ling Han clasped his fists respectfully. The Seventh Imperial Prince nodded, his expression slightly serious, and asked, “Ling Han, how have I treated you?”

What was this?

Ling Han smiled, “Your Imperial Highness treats me quite well.” Previously, he had indeed treated him well. He had even given Ling Han the Lightning Fist, but with the pressure of the Demon Race, he had still made the wise choice to save himself. This allowed Ling Han to see clearly the ruthless nature of him, and subconsciously distanced himself from him.

The Seventh Imperial Prince pondered for a moment, then said, “I have heard some rumors recently.”

“May I know what rumors Your Imperial Highness has heard?” Ling Han asked, feeling a little tired. Couldn’t you just speak frankly if you had any questions? ’ Wasn’t it tiring to go around in circles like this? You would be suspected of dragging out the show.

The Seventh Imperial Prince glanced at him, “I heard that you are very close with Princess Bixiao?”

There s no such thing,” Ling Han immediately denied.

The Seventh Imperial Prince nodded, “That had better be the case. You have to know that the princess of the Demon Race is here to make peace, and can only marry a single Imperial Prince, and if you interfere, others would laugh at you for overestimating your own abilities, and would even make all the Imperial Princes view you as an enemy.”

This was a blatant threat.

Ling Han was internally displeased, and merely smiled, but did not answer. “This world belongs to the Chen Clan, and no matter how much we brothers fight over it, it will not change.” The Seventh Imperial Prince patted Ling Han’s shoulder, “So, you must adjust your position, and adjust your mentality.” What he meant was, no matter how outstanding you are, you are still a citizen of the Dark North Nation, and a dog of the Chen Clan.

Originally, with the ambitious and ruthless nature of the Seventh Imperial Prince, he should not have said such words. This would definitely injure Ling Han, and thus affect the relationship between the two of them.

However, probably because he was too captivated by Princess Bixiao, he couldn’t care less.

The bewitching maiden’s charm was really great.

“You’re on your own!” The Seventh Imperial Prince did not give Ling Han the chance to explain himself. He turned around and left.

F***|

Flames of fury flickered in Ling Han’s eyes. He had never accepted threats. Furthermore, though this Seventh Imperial Prince looked young, he was at least in his nineties, so wasn’t he just an old cow preying on young women?

“Father, let’s charge up and kill him!” Eldest Baby’s killing intent was ice-cold. “That’S right, kill him.” Fourth Baby and Fifth Baby nodded at the same time. Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle, saying, “I’ll deal with this. You kids hurry up and go play.”

“Father, we’re not kids!” Eldest Baby argued strongly, puffing out her chest.

Lmg Han was amused, and he rubbed Eldest Baby’s head.

However, the trouble wasn’t over yet. Not long after, the Ninth Imperial Prince’s… servant arrived with a letter.

The letter was more or less telling Ling Han to stay away from Princess Bixiao and avoid attracting trouble for himself. His words were extremely forceful, and they were completely command-like, filled with threat.

Another while later, Ling Han received a letter from the Fifth Imperial Prince The contents were more or less the same, and the words he used were similarly overwhelmingly forceful.

There were also letters from the Fourth Imperial Prince, the Sixth Imperial Prince, the Tenth Imperial Prince, the Third Imperial Prince… the letters on Lmg Han’s table had already piled up to a very high level. All the Imperial Princes that had some ability and some power were issuing a warning to Ling Han.??? °

Alright, Ling Han glanced at him. At present, it was not a question of how many Imperial Princes had issued threats to him, but rather how many more Imperial Princes that had not issued threats to him.

The Chen Clan, the most terrifying clan in the world. Chen Fengyan had already stepped onto the Celestial Path, and looked down on all life on the level of being.

“We can only resolve it from the source.”

Ling Han murmured to himself.

A night passed. Ling Han cultivated in the morning, and acted as if nothing had happened. Then, he studied formation techniques, startedd the furnace, and concocted alchemical pills. Extreme Bone Tier cultivators naturally had the pill recipes that Extreme Bone Tier cultivators would use, though the number was relatively small.

It wasn’t long before night fell, and Princess Bixiao gracefully arrived before him again.

She had not come quietly. With her ability as a Mystery Realm Tier elite, if she did not want others to know, they would definitely be completely unaware However, she had come in a luxurious carriage, so it could not be more ostentatious.

This Demon Race princess acted as if she had entered into her own home. She walked easily to the living room, and sat down in an elegant manner. She did not even need Ling Han to serve her tea, and prepared her own tea and snacks as if she was afraid that Ling Han would drug her and harm her.

This indeed required caution, because Ling Han was a Four-Star Alchemist. It wouldn’t be strange for him to concoct some poison.

Princess Bixiao’s eyes swept over the six Calabash Brothers, and there was a sliver of curiosity in her eyes. She herself knew how powerful these babies were, and this was also what stunned her. They were already so powerful at such a young age, so how powerful would they be in future?

“Ling Han, I heard that a considerable number of Imperial Princes have sought you out?” She withdrew her gaze, and asked calmly.

“I have indeed collected a considerable number of letters.” Ling Han pointed at the pile of letters on the table.

Princess Bixiao smiled beautifully. She was too confident in her charisma,

“Looks like your situation is extremely dire.”

“It’s all thanks to you!” Ling Han said calmly.

Princess Bixiao was slightly surprised. Ling Han’s temperament was truly calm This was the most basic, yet extremely difficult, quality for one to become an elite. She held Ling Han in higher regard, yet her expression remained unchanged.

Ling Han, you only have two options now.”

Firstly, you may be killed by those Imperial Princes!”

“I know that you have Absolute Fairness, but I believe that it can’t be used for more than half an hour, and the time for charging is also very long. You can block an elite, but can you block a second, or a third?”

“Secondly, you submit to me.”

“As long as you submit to me and join the Demon Race, I will naturally protect you.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Indeed, Your Imperial Highness is a Mystery Realm

Tier elite, which is enough to ensure my safety..”
