Chapter 1161: Empress Protecting her Husband

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yang Hao suppressed Ling Han in all aspects.

Even with the protection of the Vajra Seal, Ling Han was still riddled with an increasing number of wounds. If it weren’t for the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, there was no way that he would still be standing at this moment.

The onlookers couldn’t help but sigh in admiration of his tenacity.

Not only were his defenses and recovery ability astonishing, his willpower was even more terrifying.

It wouldn’t be surprising or humiliating even if someone at the same cultivation level as Yang Hao were to lose to him. Thus, it would be very normal for Ling Han to lose, seeing as his cultivation level was so much lower than Yang Hao’s.

So, why was he persisting?

Anyhow, Ling Han wasn’t merely acting as a sandbag. He had also managed to cut Yang Hao, though they were only two very small nicks. However, a cut was a cut, and being able to wound Yang Hao was an astounding feat. Which other disciples under the Heavenly Body Tier could achieve this?

Ling Han would eventually be defeated, but it would be a glorious defeat. That was already enough!

“Until when can you persist?” Yang Hao said with a cold smile. In reality, he could still deal more damage to Ling Han. However, he purposefully held back. This wasn’t because he was benevolent, but rather because he wanted to torment Ling Han even longer.

His position as a king tier had actually drawn skepticism! This was unforgivable!

Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared as he wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth. He wasn’t simply taking a beating and doing nothing else. Battling against such an opponent allowed him to grasp a deeper understanding and comprehension of his Lightning Sword Technique.

He wanted to keep fighting. However, the Lion Seal and Vajra Seal were almost completely exhausted.

Both of these divine seals could be used a maximum of 10 times. However, this number wasn’t absolute, and a time limit existed for each time the seals were used. Thus, the Lion Seal was almost exhausted even though Ling Han had only used it this one time. This was because he had already battled for too long.

The Vajra Seal could still last for a while, though it definitely wouldn’t last for too long.

‘What can I do?

‘Do I have to hide in the Black Tower? But that will expose the secret of the Black Tower. That’s a Spatial God Tool! Moreover, it’s one that can become “invisible”. I’m afraid that even the Venerable Trinity will become interested in it.’

“Enough!” a cold voice suddenly shouted.

Yang Hao turned to look at the source of the sound. It came from a girl, one who looked charming and innocent. However, she was only at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier, so what right did she have to command him?

He ignored her and threw another palm strike at Ling Han.

Peng! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

There was a flash of light, and the young woman uncannily appeared before Ling Han. Her slender hand was raised, and she easily dealt with his palm strike.

Yang Hao was deeply astonished. He had failed to detect how that young woman had arrived before Ling Han!

‘Something’s off!’ he exclaimed in his mind.

The young woman’s aura was extremely unstable. She was clearly at the Mountain River Tier, yet the pressure radiating from her body caused apprehension to grip at his heart. In fact, there was even a hint of fear.

This was the overwhelming pressure from a higher-tier cultivator.

How was this possible?

He was at the Sun Moon Tier, so one had to be at the Heavenly Body Tier if they wanted to pressure him with their cultivation level. However, was this young woman at the Heavenly Body Tier? What a joke!

He refused to believe that she was at the Heavenly Body Tier.

Yang Hao attacked again, this time pushing his palm toward the young woman.

“I said, enough! Are you seeking death?” A frosty look appeared in her eyes, and she also replied with a palm strike.

Pa!

Yang Hao was instantly sent flying. Clouds of blood exploded from his body, and then he collapsed on the ground, unmoving.

He had been beaten unconscious.

Everyone on the mountain peak felt their face distort. They could barely believe their eyes.

That young woman was a seed who had just entered the sect. However, she didn’t appear special, nor did she stand out in any way. Yet, right now? She had just sent Yang Hao flying with a single strike! What kind of formidable strength was this?

They had to be seeing things!

It had been Ling Han before—he had appeared out of nowhere and defeated Wu Zhe, one of the six kings. Not only that, but he was even able to hold his own against Yang Hao. This was already deeply astounding. Yet, an even more freakish person had appeared at this moment. She had defeated Yang Hao with a single strike!

Were the disciples of this new cohort trying to defy the heavens?!

“W-who is she? Isn’t she a bit too powerful?”

“She’s called Hu Feiyun, and she’s from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire of the Joint Peace Planet.”

“That’s right, she’s the Ninth King of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.”

“Gasp! Isn’t she at the Mountain River Tier? How can someone at the Mountain River Tier be so freakishly powerful?”

“Er... Han Lin is also at the Mountain River Tier. Isn’t he also unimaginably freakish?”

“That’s different!”

Everyone was overwhelmed with shock. They could still accept Ling Han’s freakish power as they had all seen him using the divine seals. Even so, his strength was still inferior to Yang Hao’s. However, what about Hu Feiyun? Her power hadn’t merely been at the Sun Moon Tier. Rather, it had been at the Heavenly Body Tier!

They couldn’t accept this fact. Mountain River Tier cultivators couldn’t become that powerful even if they swallowed divine pills!

Only Ling Han knew that it wasn’t Hu Feiyun who had interfered. Rather, her body had been taken over and controlled by Empress Luan Xing’s soul.

Sure enough, this empress had him in her mind. Upon seeing him being beaten, she had resolutely come to protect her husband!

‘Tsk, she speaks tough, but her heart is soft. I likey.’

Yang Hao regained consciousness, and he stared at Hu Feiyun in disbelief. She had only thrown a casual strike, yet he had been utterly defeated. In fact, he didn’t even have time to react. How large was the gulf between their power?

He should have been invincible against those at the same cultivation level. Yet, right now? A Mountain River Tier cultivator had managed to hold his ground against him, albeit with a lot of difficulty. The next person was even more freakish, defeating him with a single strike. He felt as if his outlook on life had been distorted. How could such things occur?

“Did you enjoy your battle?” Hu Feiyun asked coldly. It was the domineering Empress Luan Xing who was in control of this body right now, and she made a striking motion at Yang Hao as she spoke.

Peng!

Yang Hao was thrown into the air, and clouds of blood once again exploded from his body. In fact, a large amount of his life essence also drained away.

He was severely wounded, so much so that the foundation of his cultivation was endangered.

A middle-aged man appeared, and said, “Heh, don’t overdo it!”

There were two great stars hovering behind him, both of which were protecting Yang Hao.

Although Yang Hao had faced some challenges before, he could have still ground the edge off Ling Han’s spirit. However, Yang Hao had been beaten to the point where even his life essence was starting to drain away. Things had been taken too far, especially since the sect held relatively high hopes for Yang Hao.

“You dare to stop me?” Empress Luan Xing said coldly. A boundless might exuded from her body.

The middle-aged man smiled, and said, “You’re Empress Luan Xing, aren’t you? You left a spiritual mark on this person’s body, and thus you’re able to project a portion of your power into her body. However, it’s only a spiritual mark, after all. I don’t want to erase it from her body, so why don’t we call it a day?”

Who could guess that Empress Luan Xing was a member of the Nine Snake Tribe? Who could guess that she had the ability to separate out nine souls and form nine clones?

This wasn’t as simple as leaving a spiritual mark. Not only could Empress Luan Xing’s nine clones mature like normal cultivators, but they could even host her awareness and become infinitely more powerful.

A baleful smile tugged at Empress Luan Xing’s lips, and she said, “You can try!”

How domineering was a ruler? She didn’t give him the time to refute her, and she immediately lashed out with her slender hand. Power at the Heavenly Body Tier burst into the surroundings, and it was as if heaven were about to collapse and stars were about to fall. It seemed as if an apocalypse were about to befall them.

The middle-aged man’s expression changed drastically. ‘How is she so powerful?!’

He had no time to think, and he frantically moved to block her attack.

Peng!

He was sent flying by Empress Luan Xing’s strike.

Everyone was stunned.

‘What the absolute f*ck?! She’s so powerful that she probably has no friends!’
