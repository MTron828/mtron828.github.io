Chapter 809: Reappearance of the Alternative Dragon

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The little boy was startled in spite of himself, and asked, “Why would you make such a guess?”

“F*ck, if you weren’t that alternative dragon, why would you be able to absorb the essence of the True Dragon’s Tooth? Furthermore, you’re acting so mature and old that merely the sight of you would make one think in that direction!” Ling Han said with exasperation, but did not continue the spanking, either. He casually tossed the little boy over to one side, then threw a piece of clothing over.

The little boy slipped it on, but this was Ling Han’s clothing, and for him, it was really a little too big, so long that even his hands could no longer be seen, the sleeves dragging onto the floor. He could not help but feel depressed, and asked, “Is there nothing smaller?”

“Yes, but they’re all for girls. Do you want them?” Ling Han asked.

The little boy hesitated for a moment, then, with a shake of his head, said, “I’ll just wear this one, then.” He rolled up the sleeves and trouser legs, but the clothes were too large, so he still looked a bit out of place, causing Ling Han to laugh in spite of himself.

“Since you already know who I am, and yet you still dare to laugh at me, are you tired of living?” the little boy threatened fiercely.

Pa!

Ling Han delivered a knock to his head, instantly causing the little boy to grab his head in pain. “What is it? Have I not beaten you into submission just now?”

The little boy was confused, and asked, “Why are you not affected by my dragon’s might? Although I have lost all my cultivation, my dragon’s might is still the strongest in the world. Any descendant of the dragon race would be affected by me!” ( .c om )

Ling Han clicked his tongue, and said, “Open your damn eyes and look carefully. What part of me looks like the descendant of the dragon race?”

“What, you actually are not a descendant of the dragon race?” The little boy’s face was filled with disbelief. “But I obviously sense the aura of dragon race from you!”

This was normal. His wife was a member of the dragon race, and his son also had the bloodline of the dragon race. Furthermore, he was also cultivating the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art, so what was odd about him having a little “dragon smell” 1 ? Ling Han picked up the little boy in a single move, and said, “I actually forgot to ask you. What are you called again?”

The little boy worked hard at presenting a serious expression, crossing his arms over his chest, pretending to be reserved. However, Ling Han was holding onto the collar of his shirt, and his body was endlessly wriggling around, which instantly caused this air of utmost seriousness that he was trying to put on to completely vanish.

He flew into a rage from the humiliation, and said, “Even if you are not a descendant of the dragon race, I am your senior by who knows how many years. You need to maintain appropriate respect towards me. Besides, this realm still needs me to come out and save it!”

A thought streaked through Ling Han’s head. In the past, the alternative dragon was incomparably powerful, and even the Immortals that descended could not kill him, so he definitely had to know the truth of the Reckoning. Now, after passing through endless years and being reborn, he would definitely not be satisfied to die here of old age, completely helpless.

The so-called saving, could it also be indicating the splitting open of the skies?

He did not ask directly. Instead, he said, “Don’t think that I don’t know. This damn place can only be entered with the Flower of Dead Souls. It must be your trick, and has a definite relation with your rebirth! You have to know, I was the one who brought the Flower of Dead Souls, so I am your benefactor. You still put on the airs of a senior with me? Is it that your backside is itching for another spanking again?”

Although the Flower of Dead Souls had been brought by Xu Xiu Ran’s group, did Ling Han need to explain it so clearly to the alternative dragon?

The little boy’s aura could not help but weaken. Ling Han was right. The key to his rebirth was the Flower of Dead Souls. This was something that could not be missed, and from this aspect, Ling Han was indeed his savior.

He humphed, and retorted, “Fine, I shall tell you my true name! My surname is Helian, with the name of Tianyun, and I am the strongest dragon of this realm!” He was very proud of himself, which caused Ling Han to look down on him in spite of himself.

( .c om ) From the looks of it, after he had gotten a new life, this alternative dragon’s personality had also undergone a great change. Otherwise, what need was there for an ultimate elite with twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier to be so tsundere? This kind of existence had absolutely no need to seek the approval of others, and would be able to match even the Immortals that descended into the lower realm, being powerful to an indescribable level.

However, the surname of Helian? Could he be the old ancestor of Helian Rong? F*ck, then he definitely could not let him find out that his wife was Helian Xun Xue. Otherwise, this guy would definitely act tsundere to the death, and put on the airs of an elder in front of him.

Ling Han stretched out his hand, a clear threat, before he asked, “You have obviously died for who knows how many millenia, so how have you come back to life?”

“Hmph, with the powerful existence that I am, what is so strange about me being able to live a second life?” Helian Tianyun humphed.

Ling Han was naturally not going to believe him. Even in the Immortal Realm, it was immeasurably difficult to reincarnate a soul, so it was obviously even more difficult here in the lower realm. However, this was their first encounter, so even if he had saved his life, how was it possible that Helian Tianyun would easily reveal his secrets?

If you wanted to know the secret of another, you’d have to reveal your own secret. Only then would you be able to win the trust of others.

Ling Han asked, “You mentioned saving this world, were you referring to splitting open the skies?”

Hong!

Even if this was the Ghostly Dragon Cave, which could claim to be an independent plane, the moment Ling Han said the words “splitting open the skies”, thunder still rang out around them.

Helian Tianyun could not help but be stunned, and exclaimed, “You monster, you are actually not tolerated by the heavens! No, no, no, you have the potential to threaten this world. That is why you were sensed by the world, which wanted to draw out a tribulation of thunder to eliminate you!”

Ling Han’s face darkened in spite of himself. To have an old monster from who knew how many millennia ago point at his face and call him a monster, no matter what, still made him feel awkward.

“How long have I actually slept that there would actually appear such a strange person in the world!” Helian Tianyun grabbed his head and exclaimed, “Waaaaah, and I still wanted to rescue all the life in this world and become the Messiah, but I never thought that my business would be snatched from me! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, why didn’t I wake up earlier!”

“Restrain your grief!” Ling Han said from the side.

“No one died in my family, so what grief would I feel!” Helian Tianyun said with irritation.

Ling Han was momentarily speechless. Looks like this alternative dragon should have been a joker in the past as well. As the saying went, it was easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one’s character. Even if he had been changed from the experience of obtaining a second life, it was not possible that he would have changed so much.

Only if he were a natural joker would he be like this.

“However, you mentioned splitting open the skies, so you should already know the truth of the Reckoning of the Immortal Realm,” Helian Tianyun said, quickly regaining his composure.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “In the past, you did not shatter the void and become an immortal. Was it because you discovered the Sky Sealing Great Formation?”

“That’s right. Initially, I thought that after I cultivated to the highest degree, it should not be a problem to shatter the void. Unexpectedly, I was still not a match.” Helian Tianyun sighed. “Thankfully, I had an alternative plan. Though I suffered serious injuries at that time, I still managed to escape back here, and died seated here. However, I nurtured a sliver of my divine sense inside the dragon fang to seek life from my death.

“When I was young, I obtained a Divine Herb that would allow the soul to undergo a metamorphosis. Thus, I simply hardened my heart, abandoned my original body, and reformed my body with the True Dragon’s Tooth. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, I have cultivated this fang to the level of a True Dragon’s, and even in the Immortal Realm, it would be an awesome treasure. Now, after uncountable years, condensing the essence of the dragon fang into my body, and taking the final step with the help of the Flower of Dead Souls, I have finally come back to life again.

“At that time, though my body was already very powerful, I was still not strong enough to bear the thoughts of all life of this world, but this time, I will definitely be able to!”
