Sealed Mountains were filled with mountains that extended endlessly, with innumerable dangerous peaks.

The target of Ling Han and the others was one of the mountains called Heaven Gazing Peak. The mountain slopes were extraordinarily steep. Fortunately, they were all above Seven Meridians, at the very least. Their power was as high as 5,000kg, and they were agile. Dangerous peaks weren’t a big problem.

However, the mountain was dangerous, after all, and it was difficult to climb. Thus, they still spent half a day’s time to finally arrive at the mountain peak.

An ordinary mountain peak was naturally sharp, like a sharp sword that pierced directly into the clouds, but this mountain peak was flat, like a bald head.

On such a flat mountain peak, there was a pool. It was oval in shape, and at its longest, it was about 300 meters or so. At its widest, it was only about 150 meters. On the mountain peak, this pool really did not seem small.

The sun was clearly shining brightly, but everyone felt a coldness rise up in their hearts. They had to channel their power to stimulate their blood flow, and only then would they be spared from being frozen.

This cold air came from the pool. Above the pool, because the hot air encountered coldness, it turned into fog, making one feel as if they were floating.

Ling Han and the others naturally weren’t the only ones on the mountain peak. There were also nine groups of people, each occupying a specific spot.

The number of people in each group varied. At least, there were only nine of them, and at most, there were twenty plus of them. However, they had one similarity, and that was there were old and young, and the gap in age was very wide.

“The Ancient Dao Sect is here!”

When they saw Sun Jianfang and his group, these forces spoke up one after another.

“Even Sun Jianfang has been mobilized? Hehe, looks like the Ancient Dao Sect really values this!”

“Hasn’t your Netherworld Faction also mobilized Meng Ruining, Leader Meng?”

“Hehe, for the sake of Volcanic Fruit, this is very normal.”

Sun Jianfang’s eyes swept over them, and paused on every group of people. He smiled, and said, “There are really a lot of old friends here!”

“Old geezer Sun, you’re not dead yet!” A white-haired old man called out loudly. His body was thick and sturdy. Even though he was old, he was like a human-shaped bear, exuding an astonishing feeling of power.

“This is Ji Yuanlong, the sect master of the Divine Wind Sect,” Sun Jianfang introduced in a low voice to Ling Han and the others. Then, he laughed loudly. “Old geezer Ji, you didn’t die yet, so do you have the nerve to curse me?”

“You’re already a Twelve Meridians, so why are you still here?” Ji Yuanlong asked.

Sun Jianfang shook his head. “Isn’t it the same as you? I can’t let go!”

“I heard that your Ancient Dao Sect has a prodigy called Li Dan or something. Just in time, I also have a great-grandson, who can be considered quite successful. Why don’t we let them spar for a while?” Ji Yuanlong said.

He waved his hand, and a young man walked out. His figure was also extremely sturdy, like an iron tower.

This young man clasped his hands in greeting, and said to Ling Han, “I am Ji Pengfei, and would like to ask Senior Brother Li for some guidance.”

Sun Jianfang’s mouth involuntarily twitched. Li Changdan had betrayed the sect, and he had long since been killed by Ling Han. How could he come out to spar? However, this was an internal scandal, so there was naturally no reason to publicize it.

He said indifferently, “Li Changdan didn’t come.”

Ji Yuanlong glared at him, and said, “Old geezer Sun, are you afraid of losing?”

Sun Jianfang looked at Ji Yuanlong and said, “If you are not convinced, I’ll beat you into submission!”

Ji Yuanlong was instantly enraged. He rolled up his sleeves and said, “Fine, we’ll fight. Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

“Hehe, calm down, both of you. Don’t be so tense!” Someone stepped out to mediate the fight. He was also indescribably old. His white brows drooped down for about an inch, and even his eyes were covered. Who knew if he could see clearly.

“Why don’t we compete and see who can kill the giant python in the water first?”

This was Cao Cong from the Blue Feather City. He belonged to the same generation as Sun Jianfang and Ji Yuanlong. Now, he was also naturally the strongest king tier of the Twelve Meridians.

“How do we kill it?” Ji Yuanlong asked with a roll of his eyes. He had a fiery temper, and it was as if he didn’t like anyone he saw. “We can hold our breath for at most ten minutes, yet this pool is extraordinarily deep. It’s impossible to kill that Demonic Beast in such a short amount of time.”

“A giant snake above the level of Nine Meridians, its gallbladder is a treasure!” An old woman clicked her tongue, and said, “According to the ancient books, this can turn into a hundred poisons, and can also nourish the eyes and improve the vision.”

“What’s the use of talking about this?” Ji Yuanlong still had a bad temper, and he would speak back to anyone he saw. “Can you force that giant python out, or can you hold your breath for half an hour?”

“I can’t be bothered to talk to you!” The old woman waved her sleeve and didn’t reply. It was as if she knew that this old geezer had a strange temper, so she didn’t lower herself to his level.

“Actually, there is a way.” An old man walked out. He was dressed in robes, and was waving a feather fan in his hand, looking quite sage-like.

However, when they saw this old man walk out, both Sun Jianfang and Cao Cong frowned. Even Ji Yuanlong didn’t oppose him.

“Old poisonous creature, you’re always playing with poison, and you’re actually still alive. This is really a miracle,” the old woman said instead.

The old man in robes laughed loudly, “If we still do not break through, in ten years at most, it would be about time for us to step into the coffin, right?”

Sun Jianfang and the others were all solemn. The limit of their lifespans had always been a problem that they had deliberately avoided.

This old poisonous creature was also from the same generation as them. At that time, he had been a doctor who had saved lives and healed injuries, but who knew that after the Great Calamity, he was further and further down the path of playing with poison, causing others to feel wary.

Afterwards, he established the Hundred Poisons Sect, and took in a considerable number of disciples, all of whom were skilled in poison.

Poison has always been feared by others. Even the king tier of the Twelve Meridians didn’t dare to be careless in the slightest.

“Old Venom, what do you suggest?” Ji Yuanlong asked. His tone was slightly more polite than usual.

“Simple,” Old Venom said calmly. He took out a bottle from his robes, walked to the side of the pool, opened the cork, and carefully dripped a drop of liquid. He revealed a smile, and said, “This is a new type of poison that I’ve carefully developed. Don’t underestimate it. Although there’s only one drop, it can turn the entire pool into a pool of strong poison.”

Everyone came over to take a look, and saw that the originally clear pool was rapidly turning black. There was also a faint pungent smell that assaulted their noses, causing them to feel dizzy.

This was truly terrifying. Merely the smell was already making them so uncomfortable, then what would happen if the body really touched it?

Boom, right at this moment, ripples appeared on the water’s surface, and a large snake as thick as a water bucket suddenly broke through the water’s surface, turning into something akin to a stream and soaring onto the shore.

Sure enough, this poison was far too terrifying. Even the Demonic Beast that was as powerful as a king tier was unable to withstand it.

Once ashore, this large snake coiled its body, its head protecting its body that was like a small hill. It swept its gaze around proudly, its eyes like lanterns, exuding a murderous light that would make one shiver.

“Old Venom, you’ve poisoned the Volcanic Fruit as well!” Ji Yuanlong roared.

“Don’t worry. A treasure like the Volcanic Fruit is only afraid of fire attacks. Poison is harmless against it,” Old Venom said calmly. “Now that this large snake has come out, how do you guys want to kill it?”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
