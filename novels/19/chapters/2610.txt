Chapter 2611: Fighting Luo Fuming again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Everyone was bursting with shock.

Three great elites had joined forces to attack Ling Han, yet the result was one attacker dead and another injured. This young man’s battle prowess was a little too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Ling Han smiled at the large gorilla, yet there was no emotion in his smile. It was as if he was looking at a dead body. “I have already said before; don’t court death!” He tapped out a finger, and pressed down on the large gorilla.

“Ah…” The large gorilla naturally knew that he had crashed into a hard wall, but how could he be willing to just raise his head and wait for death? With a loud roar, the means to cause spiritual damage was already unleashed by him, blasting out towards Ling Han. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Weng! Ling Han felt a slight pain in his head. Even if he had already prepared himself, he had still been stung by this attack, though it was not very serious.

!!

It could not be denied that this kind of means was very astonishing. It was no wonder that so many Celestial Kings had fallen into the trap. For Celestial Kings, what could be more tempting than great strength?

When the large gorilla saw that this attack was effective, he couldn’t help but look pleasantly surprised. He put his two fists together, and pounded his fists down like they were a heavy hammer.

Ling Han shook his head. Though this was effective on him, the large gorilla was only a Fifth Heaven Celestial King. At most, it would only cause Ling Han a slight sting, but how long could this effect last? His finger paused slightly, but it immediately tapped down on the large gorilla with harsh, severe, and unprecedented power.

Pu!

Though the large gorilla tried his best to parry, it was completely ineffective. Ling Han’s strike forcefully pierced through his forehead, and he died.

Everyone was once again rendered speechless. Was this really a Fourth Heaven Celestial King? Killing Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings was like slaughtering chickens to him. He was indescribably strong.

Yet the old woman snatched the black Qi that floated out after the large gorilla died. She released a series of cackles; the power bubbling inside her body filled her with incomparable confidence and greed. She wanted to swallow more black Qi so that she would become stronger.

She set her eyes on Ling Han.

Though Ling Han had killed two people in a row with a single sword strike and a tap of his finger, she was unafraid. That feeling of incomparable strength also numbed her at the same time.

“Surrender your life to me!” She flew out like a swooping bat, her arms spread apart. And while she was in midair, she opened her mouth. Weng! A sound wave blasted out towards Ling Han.

The sound wave had not reached him, but a spiritual attack assailed him first.

Because the sound blast was basically just a distraction.

Ling Han felt a stinging sensation inside his head. He shook his head. The spiritual attack from the old woman was much stronger than that of the large gorilla just now, and she had only devoured the two streaks of black Qi from the young man in red and the large gorilla.

The increase in strength seemed to be extremely simple, so it was natural that one would become addicted to it.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “I allowed you to snatch two streaks of black Qi in a row merely to see how far your strength would increase! Yet the end results have truly disappointed me!” He stretched out a hand, and pressed down on the old woman.

Peng!

The old woman instantly plummeted from the skies. She had been forcefully tugged down by an extraordinarily powerful force of gravity.

She was astonished. How could one that had reached a height as she had be affected by gravity? The only thing that could affect her could be Regulations!

The grasp that this young man had of Regulations far surpassed hers, and that was why a slight guidance of Regulations was enough to cause her to plummet.

Even if the old woman had already been affected by the black Qi, which caused her to become irritable and bloodthirsty, when faced with an existence that was far stronger than herself, she still showed a hint of fear.

Survival was the instinct of every intelligent being. As long as one still had intelligence, it would subconsciously take effect.

The old woman shuddered. Judging from Ling Han’s words, he had purposely allowed her to snatch the black Qi. Furthermore, it had only been so that she could become stronger.

What confidence!

Not only did these words stun the old woman, the others in the proximity were also gaping, and experienced a deep feeling of confusion.

No one knew the origins of the black Qi. However, they knew that it could increase their spiritual attack power. In fact, it could increase their cultivation by close to a whole cultivation level!

Who would not want this kind of good thing?

Yet Ling Han was actually throwing it away like worn shoes. Who could accept this?

Ling Han did not even spare a second glance. He merely pressed down on the air in the old woman’s direction. Pa! The old woman was crushed into a mush of blood. He clapped his hands, as if he had done something that was negligible. Then, he swept an eye over the people around him. “This is the price to be paid for provoking me.”

Everyone lowered their heads. This kind of person was definitely a dragon of the Nine Heavens. How could they match him?

If there were other Celestial Kings that were at the Fifth Heaven and above, they could still use their superior cultivation level to suppress Ling Han, but now?

Ling Han was the strongest here!

So what if there were countless Celestial Kings? So what if the black Qi would affect their minds? Faced with absolute power, these people had chosen to submit.

Yet Ling Han was not very pleased. He had initially planned to use the old woman to help him break through to the Fifth Heaven, but he had not thought that the old woman would still be so weak even when he had deliberately given her an advantage.

Fifth Heaven wouldn’t do it, and Sixth Heaven would probably be just barely enough. It had to be a Seventh Heaven Celestial King that could pose a great enough threat to him.

Ling Han did not barge into that final large tomb rashly. There were many Eighth Heaven and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in there. Furthermore, they also possessed the terrifying means of spiritual attack. Ling Han wouldn’t dare to guarantee that he would not pass out if he was blasted by this kind of being; his spirit might even be directly crushed.

He observed from the outside, hoping that he would be able to find some clues.

One day, two days, 10 days.

Hong, long, long! On this day, the ground suddenly trembled wildly, as if an earthquake was happening. Then, one figure after another shot out of various corners of the large tomb.

Peng!

One of them crashed down in the area near Ling Han. Looking at the extremely sorry state he was in, he had definitely not run out on his own will. He should have been forced or sent flying out here by another elite.

Ling Han looked over, and couldn’t help but look surprised, because he recognized this person.

Luo Fuming, Luo Yang’s father.

When Ling Han had killed Luo Yang, Luo Fuming naturally wanted to avenge the death of his son, and had fought an intense battle with Ling Han. However, in the end, the latter had used the Divine Demon Sword to send the other party into retreat.

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King should be an acceptable opponent.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up, and he strode forwards.

Luo Fuming scrambled to his feet, a hint of lingering fear flashing in his expression. He was seemingly filled with wariness towards this large tomb, but his greed could not be suppressed. Gritting his teeth, he planned to enter the tomb once more.

“Wait!”

Luo Fuming had not even moved yet when someone stretched out a hand in front of him, looking like he was stopping him.

Luo Fuming looked over, yet almost scoffed out loud.

A Fourth Heaven Celestial King.

A mere Fourth Heaven Celestial King actually dared to stop him?

Luo Fuming humphed internally, yet moved without the slightest hesitation, pressing down a palm on Ling Han.

This kind of dumb bug should just be crushed with a single strike.

His palm strike landed, and Ling Han raised his hand slightly. As Regulations clashed, countless ripples formed. This attack from Luo Fuming was instantly dispersed cleanly.

“En?” Luo Fuming couldn’t help but be taken aback. Though this strike was not his full power, it actually was still unable to suppress a mere Fourth Heaven Celestial King?

This caused him to recall a person, the great enemy who had killed his son. That man, too, possessed the ability to battle others superior to him in cultivation level. But that evil brat was a Third Heaven Celestial King. Furthermore, he did not have this appearance and this aura, either.

“Who are you? Why are you stopping me?” Luo Fuming asked darkly. The extremely terrifying aura of a Seventh Heaven Celestial King surged out.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Luo Fuming, do you no longer recognize me?”

“You are…” Luo Fuming frowned slightly. He did not recognize Ling Han, but felt that the tone the latter used was familiar.
