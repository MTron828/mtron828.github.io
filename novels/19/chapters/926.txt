Chapter 927: Deal

“Meow!” The big white cat purred before charging out at Luo Kaifeng.

Its speed was very swift, and there was practically none in the Shattering Void Tier who could compare to it. But, who was the opponent here? A Sun Moon Tier cultivator! In that case, naturally it would not pose any threat to Luo Kaifeng, but the problem was Luo Kaifeng dared not strike back, and merely kept dodging its attacks.

An elite of the Sun Moon Tier was actually being chased around in circles by a Shattering Void Tier individual... Probably only this demon cat was capable of achieving such a feat.

After chasing for a while, the big white cat jumped back onto Ling Han’s shoulder, and arrogantly combed through its whiskers while unsheathing its claws. Its expression was implying “Which one of you dares to bully my people? I will not let you off lightly.”

Zhang Deman could not hold back the hearty laughter that escaped him; who would have thought that Ling Han would become friends with this big white cat that none could afford to offend? He coughed, choking back his laugh as he said, “I still stand by my views. Luo Ba did not verbally admit defeat, therefore Ling Han is not at fault. If there are no further opinions from the two of you, then just let Ling Han go back.”

What more could Luo Kaifeng say? That beast was Academy Head’s favorite pet, and his affection towards it had even surpassed his affection for his own descendants!

Even if it were the elders of the Luo Clan here today, they would also have to yield. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He gave a resentful humph, picked up the pieces Luo Ba’s body, and stored it into the Spatial Spirit Tool. His figure leaped, leaving immediately.

Wei Qianshu sighed again; just now, he’d been put in a difficult situation. He shook his head, and also leaped and left.

“Many thanks to Senior for speaking up justly!” Ling Han spoke in all sincerity, clasping his hands in the direction of Zhang Deman.

Zhang Deman guffawed heartily, and said, “Even if I did not intervene, with this cat around, nobody would dare to even touch you in the entire Academy.”

The big white cat raised its head proudly. ‘I am that formidable.’

“I still have to thank you, Senior,” Ling Han insisted.

Zhang Deman nodded his head. This young man had a sense of propriety, observed etiquette, and had a pretty good disposition. Talent in martial arts was one thing, but one’s disposition was also similarly vital; otherwise, one would only become a danger to others in the future.

“Go on,” he smilingly said. A student dying meant that there were bound to be some loose ends to be tied, but that had nothing to do with Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, and clasped his hands once more as he said, “This student shall then beg my leave.”

Bringing the big white cat with him, he left. This guy, it was already on more than one occasion it was scratching his head. ‘Don’t you know that I am hungry?’

After Ling Han left, the spectators that had gathered to watch the fight naturally dispersed; there was big news now.

Ling Han’s battle prowess had already surpassed 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier!

“Big Brother Ye!” Mo Junren gave Ye Chengyuan a light pat.

Ye Chengyun was in a daze, his body drenched in a cold sweat as he suddenly turned around and uttered, “I kept on thinking... Supposed I were in Luo Ba’s shoes, how would I counter that strike? The conclusion was... it would be an imminent death no matter what.”

Mo Junren couldn’t help laughing as he responded, “Brother Ye, you could also choose not to spar with that maniac.”

Ye Chengyun’s eyes immediately brightened as he said, “Right, I have already cultivated to the ultimate of the Shattering Void Tier. With my talent, if I do not possess some kind of exceptional fated opportunity, I would not be able to advance a step further and break through to the battle prowess of 22 Stars. But, if I break through to the Mountain River Tier, then I will again have room to elevate myself further.”

“Yes, that is why we only spend a hundred years to reach battle prowess of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier. Although this maximum limit is very important, it is definitely not the most important,” Mo Junren continued. “One has to first become an immortal too. Only then would one be considered really powerful!”

Ye Chengyun breathed out a long sigh in relief as his self-confidence completely returned. He said, “Junren, you are way smarter than you let on!”

“Am I?” Mo Junren let out a laugh. “I am but a romantic person who enjoys playing with the flowers.”

At a certain place.

“Despicable old witch, let Niu out!” Yowling sounds resembling beast cries rang out, followed by drum-like raps on the doors of the room. “Niu wants to see Ling Han, you ugly old woman, quickly let Niu out!”

Hu Niu’s entire body was leaning on the door, her small hand clutching onto the lintel of the door. She looked just like a monkey.

“Nonsense!” The old lady garbed in black robes grabbed at empty air, and Hu Niu was immediately drawn over without even the slightest resistance.

“Niu is very angry, Niu wants to become bad, Niu no longer wants to cultivate!” Hu Niu puffed out her cheeks and put both hands on her waist.

“You little girl, which day have you been serious in cultivating ever since returning to the Roc Palace?” The black-robed old lady sighed. “Yi Yun only infused the Soul Essence of Martial Arts into your body; how much you can refine and digest still depends largely on your own efforts.”

“Niu doesn’t want to cultivate. Niu wants to see Ling Han!” Hu Niu was not about to listen to reason, and became even more oblivious to fear as she glared right back at the old lady.

The black-robed old lady got a big headache. Only the Imperial Empress could cultivate the three supreme secret techniques of the Mythological Beasts Palace. Because only their Milady could inherit the unique Soul Essence of Martial Arts, even with the Mystical Arts in front of you, you would achieve nothing if you weren’t her and didn’t possess the foundation.

Why did they encounter such an unreliable successor?

She had been with Hu Niu for more than a year, and also came to have a considerable understanding of this lass, knowing that being fierce did not work on Hu Niu, for she did not even know what fear was.

“Alright. I promise you, as long as you could cultivate to the Genesis Tier, I will allow you to go and see that guy. But only for three days at most, after which you must return. Our Roc Palace has a great enemy, and only if you have cultivated the three great secret techniques would you be able to oppose them. Ah, not letting you out is also for the sake of your own safety.” The old lady offered a compromise.

Hu Niu counted on her fingers, and said, “Fine, then Niu is going to use three years to cultivate to the Genesis Tier!” She leaned her head sideways and looked at the old lady as she said, “Rotten old lady, quickly go away! Your presence here only fuels my anger, and it’s making me lose the mood to cultivate.”

The black-robed old lady could not refrain from shaking her head. She was also someone on the level of the overlord of her territory, yet facing Hu Niu, she just could not muster up even the slightest bit of a temper, which showed that everyone had their weakness.

“Go on, don’t hinder Nu’s cultivation.” Hu Niu waved her hand, her face filled with impatience.

The black-robed old lady helplessly left, but at least now Hu Niu was finally willing to cultivate properly, letting her breathe a sigh of relief.

This little ancestor was really a big headache.

Nevertheless, unexpectedly a genius had emerged in that small world!

It was not apparent what was so particularly special about that human, but the fact remained that his son really was a prodigy of martial arts. Were it not for the fact that Roc Palace did not take in male disciples, she really would not have wanted to let the chance slip by.

“The Heavenly Saint Palace is currently taking in new disciples, and they have always been on quite good terms with our Roc Palace. Offering them a prodigy as successor would definitely make them utterly grateful. Just nice, we’ll be killing two birds with one stone.” She swiftly decided.

The Luo Clan Residence.

Luo Hongdao stared fixedly at Luo Ba’s body, both his hands clenched tightly as the flames of fury flared in his eyes.

The most outstanding successor among the Luo family’s younger generation was killed just like that.

Although grooming a Shattering Void Tier cultivator did not really require that big a sacrifice, the Bloodtear Stone was truly precious, and even the thought of it caused him heartache.

“We absolutely cannot let that lowlife off the hook!” he uttered harshly.

“But, Lord Patriarch, that fellow seemed to have some kind of relationship with Fu Hui!” Luo Kaifeng said. Shivers ran through his body at the mention of Fu Hui’s name, just as if the name of an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier possessed some kind of magical power.
