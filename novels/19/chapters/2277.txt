Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, but he merely smiled faintly ‘Why should I?*

The women indeed could not use as many as over 60 celestial fruits, but this object could grant others a sliver of hope of breaking through to the Fifth Severance. If left in the Foreign Realm, wouldn’t that cause trouble for the Celestial Realm?

Hence, even if he discarded them, he would not leave them for the Foreign Realm. Moreover, eating one would only give a sliver of hope, so wouldn’t eating a few more mean an even higher chance?

To say nothing of over 60 fruits, even if all 108 fruits were given to him, Ling Han would not complain.

“If you don’t, you die!” Di Fei declared harshly, the white lotus flower on his forehead glowing, appearing both sacred and dazzling.

The Angel Race and Demon Race were not on good terms in the first place. If there had been a shared target, they would have long since battled to death, but if it was contending over profit, they would still be battering each other.

“Die!” the others called out as well. It was not just the Angel Race, but also the Demon Race that was calling out.

‘When on the issue of profit, whatever race or justice was all superficial.

Ling Han chuckled, and retorted, “There are a great many people who want to kill me. As for you guys? Hehe, you are too far off.”

These words were really not any kind of exaggeration. The Heavenly Venerates of both Realms were hunting Ling Han, but wasn’t he still alive and kicking very well? Furthermore, he would become stronger and stronger, and then would become a Heavenly Venerate in the future, or even surpass the

Heavenly Venerable Tier, and beat down on the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the others.

Di Fei naturally would not believe it. The fact that Ling Han managed to come here meant that the other was only a Severing Mundane Tier, then there was absolutely no way Di Fei himself, a Fifth Severance monarch tier, would not be the other party’s match.

To say the least, even if the other man was also a Fifth Severance monarch tier, Di Fei was certain that he himself would still be slightly superior.

“You are courting death!” Di Fei moved aggressively, and an incredibly bright, extremely dazzling light surged out, turning into a sword that sliced out at Ling Han.

Though Ling Han had already had some exchanges with the cultivators of the Foreign Realm, he had only touched the Regulation of Darkness. Thus, seeing this monarch tier of the Angel Race, he couldn’t help but feel some interest. He wanted to see just how amazing this Regulation of Light was.

Hence, he did not use any kind of power, and carelessly moved to play around with Di Fei.

At present, Ling Han was really too strong. Though the overall level of the Celestial Realm was inferior to the Foreign Realm’s, it still had its value. Its Regulations still contained what the Regulations of the Foreign Realm did not.

To complete both was the wisest option.

If Ling Han returned to the Immortal Palace Tier, he would no longer be a Monarch Star, but rather an existence that had surpassed a Monarch Star, and could be called something like Monarch Moon, Monarch Sun, or something like that. Anyways, he would be all-powerful, so he would be beyond awesome.

Di Fei burst out with celestial might, channeling the Regulations of Light. It was as if he had become a war god of light, completely beating down on Ling Han.

His expression was filled with arrogance. As expected, he was the strongest monarch tier. There was absolutely no way that Ling Han could be his match. However, for some unknown reason, the latter was incredibly strange, and had actually grasped innumerable Regulations, plucking as many as over 60

celestial fruits.

Yet as time passed, Di Fei was slightly anxious because no matter how big his advantage was, he could not suppress Ling Han and obtain victory at all.

‘Why is this guy so tough? Di Fei thought, but surmised that Ling Han should also be a monarch tier, so it was logical that he had not immediately defeated him.

Others were also stunned. They had not imagined that Ling Han was so strong, and was actually also a monarch tier as well. Furthermore, the young man that had guided Ling Han previously was also gaping with shock. And to think he had actually told Ling Han not to have any extravagant hopes. He had

not thought that the latter would be this powerful.

“Great Blade of Light, killing all evils!” Di Fei roared loudly, suddenly brandishing a precious blade. It was blazing white, as if it was formed from pure light, and was extremely amazing.

Brandishing the sword, he slashed out at Ling Han.

Xiu, light burst, causing people to become blind even when they had their eyes open.

A strange feeling rose up in Ling Han. It was like innumerable beautiful celestial maidens were waving him over, as if he would willingly surrender to death, and from then onwards, he could soar into a plane of nirvana, where there would be no more worries. There would be no more battles, and only

pleasure

Immediately, his eyes snapped open, bursting with an astonishing chill. This Regulation of Light had the effect of enchantment.

Pa, the light of the blade descended, yet Ling Han grabbed it with a single stroke. With a slight tremor, he had immediately snatched the sword of light. He discovered that this material was extremely unique. It actually had no solid form, but rather was fused from pure Regulations.

‘A unique method of tool refinement,’ Ling Han thought. He raised his head, and saw those around him were all gaping, their mouths so wide that they could fit an egg.

The others were naturally astounded. ‘F***, is there anyone like you? Just now, you looked like you were outmatched, but with just a careless grab, you even plucked the weapon of your opponent. Cant you see that Di Fei is looking absolutely stunned now?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Sorry for scaring everyone! Er, those who said you wanted to kill me, take one step forward. It’s time for accounting,”

Shua, at least 90% of them all simultaneously took a step back, and a few people whose reaction was slightly slower immediately stood out.

“No, not me!” One of them saw this, and rapidly shook his head, defending himself as he pointed at himself. The others were much smarter, and hurriedly stepped back.

Di Fei suppressed his fury, and said, “Sell one of your fruits to me. Name your price.” He had agreed to produce a celestial fruit for Fairy Yunhe, yet now it was definite that he was unable to pluck it himself, so he could only choose to buy it from Ling Han.

Others would definitely be unwilling to sell as they only had one.

Ling Han was shocked, and asked, “Weren’t you planning to kill me?”

Di Fei avoided the question. If he could kill Ling Han, he naturally would not be wasting words, but who asked that he could not? He humphed, and repeated, “Name your price.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I have a better idea. Why dont I kill you? Wouldn’t everything you possess all belong to me then?”

“Haha!” Di Fei laughed arrogantly. Who was he? A monarch tier, and his elder brother was a Monarch Star, someone destined to become an Eighteenth Lotus supreme elite. Who would dare to kill him?

“Wu. His laughter silenced abruptly because his neck was already gripped by Ling Han, and he was lifted off his feet.

He had supreme great power, but in Ling Han’s grasp, he was like a harmless chick, losing all power. He couldn’t help but feel astonished. Just how wide exactly was the difference between himself and Ling Han for the former to actually be unable to sustain a single blow like this?

Seeing the menacing killing intent that Ling Han exuded, Fairy Yunhe spoke up. Sir, please have mercy. Di Fei’s brother is a Monarch Star, and now his cultivation level is the ninth level of Eighth Lotus, possessing invincible might.”

Ling Han broke into a smile, and demanded, “So I should just suffer in silence, and allow this brat to trample all over me?”

“Why must you act on impulse?” Fairy Yunhe persuaded. It was not that she held any kind of affection for Di Fei, but rather that she was very wary of Di Pang. He was a true prodigy, and it was said that even a great many Ancestral Kings had extended an olive branch to him, wanting to take him as a disciple.

“Then I’l consider,” Ling Han said thus, and in the blink of an eye, he spoke again. “All right, I have considered.”

‘You call that considering?

Fairy Yunhe couldnt help but feel torn between laughter and tears, feeling that though this person was of the Demon Race, he did not have a sliver of the malice of the Demon Race, but was closer to being a shameless ruffian.

“Then what is the outcome of your consideration?” she asked patiently.

“Kill him, of course.” Ling Han smiled slightly, showing a mouthful of snow-white teeth. With a twist of his right hand, pa, Di Fei’s neck was broken, and all life was immediately wiped from him.

“Now, the world is finally silent.” He efficiently found the Spatial God Tool on Di Fei, then casually tossed him aside. Turning to look at the masses.. “What do you guys think?”
