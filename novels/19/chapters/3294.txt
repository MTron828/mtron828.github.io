The world was so small?

Ling Han immediately came to a realization. Yan Jun was originally a formation prodigy from Huju City, and together with Tuoba Tianhuang and Zhong Yangbi, they were collectively called the Three Elites. Thus, he should have been selected by Huju City to participate in the formations competition.

What he did not know was that because of Niu Huaqings interference, Gu Tianhua had already intended to have Ling Han replace him. However, before he could report this, a beast tide had happened in Huju City.

Yan Junyan scoffed, and asked, “What are you doing here?”

Ling Han smiled faintly. He still hadn’t settled this debt with Yan Jun yet. However, he didn’t take Yan Jun to heart at all, so there was naturally no need for him to be so fierce to him. In the future, he would just find a chance to stomp him to death.

“What is it? Is this place also owned by your family?” he asked calmly.

“Don’t think that just because you have some accomplishments in martial arts, you can come to the Formation Masters Association to behave atrociously!” Yan Jun humphed. He looked disdainful, but in truth, it was unknown how jealous he was.

Previously, Ling Han had chased Tuoba Tianhuang off the pedestal and replaced him. Even then, he was only equal to himself and Zhong Yangbi. After all, the three of them represented different fields, but after coming to the Imperial Capital, though he could still be considered a genius, he had lost the halo of being a prodigy.

There were many hidden talents in the Imperial Capital, and his talent couldn’t be ranked in the top ten at the same age range.

However, what about Ling Han?

After defeating Hu Yang three times, he had risen up strongly, and was already known as the second Hong Tianbu.

It was Hong Tianbu, that freak!

Faced with that person, even Yan Jun would have to kneel down and admit that he was impressed. That was because Hong Tianbu was also a formation prodigy, and had long since obtained the qualifications of a High Level Formation Master. It was very possible that he would advance further in a short period of time, and become a Grandmaster.

In the entire Dark North Nation, how many formation grandmasters were there?

Two!

So, are you worthy of being called the second Hong Tianbu?

Ling Han looked at Yan Jun, and naturally could see his thoughts very clearly. In truth, if his present status was 100, then Yan Jun would only be seven or eight, at most. The two of them were on completely different levels.

There was absolutely no need for him to be angry. He would just find a chance to kill him.

“Who do you think you are? What right do you have to stop me?” he asked calmly.

“Humph, today is a big day for the Formation Masters Association. What is an outsider like you doing here?” Yan Jun asked coldly. He knew that Ling Han had already left him far behind, but being able to cause Ling Han some trouble at this time would also make him feel slightly better.

“What’s all the noise about? Don’t you know what day it is today?” A middle-aged man walked over with a displeased expression.

“Greetings, Grandmaster Zhou!” Yan Junxing hurriedly paid his respects. The other was a Middle Level Formation Master. Though he would definitely be able to surpass him in future, he had just arrived here, and feared that others would make life difficult for him, so his attitude was very humble.

This middle-aged man was called Zhou He. Though he was a Middle Level

Formation Master, he was a petty character. He nodded, and smiled at Yan Jun. This young man would be very successful in future, and he did not want to offend him either.

“This guy wants to barge in forcefully!” Yan Jun immediately turned around, and pointed at Ling Han.

Zhou He looked at Ling Han, and a mocking smile appeared at the corners of his lips. He said, “Young man, do you think this is a place for you to watch the excitement?”

He only thought that Ling Han had come because he had heard that the Formation Masters Association would be having a competition today.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You two are just talking on your own, but why didn’t you consider your own intelligence?”

Previously, when he had come to verify his identity as Formation Master, he actually did not encounter the slightest bit of trouble, which was already inconceivable to him. Could it be that his halo of attracting animosity had disappeared? But now he could verify it with his own strength, his ability to attract animosity was still very strong. He practically did not need to open his mouth to make others attack him with all their might.

Since that was the case, then let’s battle. Thus, Ling Han retorted forcefully.

Zhou He couldn’t help but feel his expression darken. He felt a little suffocated. These words were too harsh, weren’t they?

“You, you, you—” He pointed at Ling Han, wanting nothing more than to rush up and strangle Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly. His combat ability was still the same as before. In future, should he consider cultivating a “roar” -type technique? From the very beginning, he would be cursing and insulting loudly, which would be world-shaking, thus making his opponent lie down without him even making a move?

“Out of the way, out of the way.” He flicked his hand, and continued his verbal barrage. “Good dogs don’t block the way. Don’t be ignorant of even the most basic rules.’

“How dare you!” Veins popped on Zhou He’s forehead, and it was as if he were about to spit fire from his nose. “Who are you? Tell me, who are you? I’ll definitely make you kneel for a day and a night!’

“His name is Ling Han!” Yan Jun took the chance and immediately jumped out.

“Ling Han?” Zhou He was slightly startled. He seemed to have heard of this name somewhere. Forget it, forget it. What kind of reputation could a young man who was not even twenty years old have?

“I’ll give you one last chance. Kneel, or I’ll make you regret it!” he threatened.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Han didn’t explain, and he simply quietly turned on the recording function of the optical computer. He then said, “Grandmaster Zhou, right? You’re indiscriminate, and you’re threatening me right from the start. Is this in line with your status?”

“So what? I don’t like you, so 1 want to step on you and suppress you. What can you do about it?” Zhou He He said very arrogantly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said calmly, “Aren’t you afraid that I would have some astonishing background that would stomp you into sh*t?”

F* ** what a vulgar guy.

Zhou He certainly looked hesitant. There were many second-generation young masters with astonishing backgrounds in the Imperial Capital, and he seemed to have heard of his name somewhere before. Could it be that he was really the descendant of some noble clan?

He bullied the weak but feared the strong, and did not want to offend any noble clan.

However, which noble clan had the surname of Ling?

“Grandmaster Zhou, this guy is a refugee who has been forced into desperate straits!” Yan Jun exposed from the sidelines. How could he allow Zhou He to be scared off?

Although they hadn’t spent much time together, he knew that Zhou He was extremely vicious when he came across people weaker than him. Moreover, Zhou He would immediately cower whenever he came across someone with a powerful background. He was a typical example of someone who would bully the weak and fear the strong.

When Zhou He heard this, he immediately felt humiliated.

, a refugee from Huju City actually dared to boast in front of him, almost causing his legs to go weak.

‘I’m going to kill you today.’

“So you’re a refugee from Huju City. Hehe, I was almost scared by you.” Zhou He sneered, feeling humiliated and angered.

“So what if 1 came from Huju City? Are you looking down on me?” Ling Han deliberately tried to worm words out of him.

Sure enough, Zhou He immediately said, “A bunch of lowly commoners should all die in the beast tide. Living would only be wasting food!”

It was enough.

Ling Han nodded. Merely these words were enough to make this guy suffer.

Pa, he suddenly moved, and delivered a palm strike right onto Zhou He’s face.

Though Zhou He was a Middle Level Formation Master, his own strength had only just advanced into Blood Transformation Tier, so how could he possibly match Ling Han?

With this palm strike, his whole person was sent flying. He somersaulted a dozen over times in the air, and then flopped onto the ground in a ‘beautiful’ posture.

Yan Jun was dumbfounded. Ling Han was still as fierce as he had been, daring to make a move publicly in the Formation Masters Association.

However, he immediately revealed a smile. In that case, Ling Han would definitely not be able to escape death..
