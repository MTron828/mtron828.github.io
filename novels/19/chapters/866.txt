Chapter 867: Take me as your master

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han couldn’t help but burst out laughing, saying, “On what basis should I believe that a dog will change its ****?”

“I’ve applied a secret technique on these women. Just by projecting my intention, their hearts will explode, causing their death! Furthermore, as long as my heart stops beating, they will suffer the same fate!” Hu Jian Yi sneered. “As the ruler of the Great Ling Empire, can you bear those innocent people dying for your sake?”

“No!” Ling Han shook his head.

Hu Jian Yi immediately felt overjoyed, and said, “Then, quickly make an oath!”

“Who ever said that I will let you go?” Ling Han smiled. “You really are a shameless person. Don’t think too highly of yourself.”

“Damn it!” Hu Jian Yi’s eyes shot fire. “Are you making fun of me? I am a sect leader, at the least! If worse comes to worst, I shall destroy everything. Anyway, there are so many beautiful ladies to accompany me, so at least I won’t be lonely in the afterlife!”

“I’ve already said, in your dreams! Why are you still being so narcissistic?” Ling Han said smilingly.

“Humph! Then I shall kill a few as a reminder to you!” Hu Jian Yi said menacingly.

Since Ling Han became the sovereign of the middle state, he had foreseen that a day like this would happen. Of course, he would not be resigned to wait for death, and thus had prepared for the present scene.

So what if his act was despicable? As long as he could preserve his life, he would even do something that was more despicable by tenfold.

Pu!

He felt a flash before his eyes, and then heard two heartbeats ringing in front of him. At first, he could only stare blankly; he didn’t expect Ling Han to strike against him. Could the latter really disregard the lives of those women?

But, he then had another thought—why would there be two heartbeats? Wasn’t the other party just one person?

He looked at Ling Han, and saw the latter’s hand holding a bloody, red heart. The strange thing was that the heart was still beating.

His chest felt so painful!

Hu Jian Yi lowered his head, and was surprised to see that there was a bloody hole in his chest, where fresh blood was oozing out. Only then did he realize that the heart that Ling Han was holding in his hand was his!

When did the other party claw out his heart?

Incomprehensible thoughts flashed through Hu Jian Yi’s mind, but the fact was that his consciousness was becoming fuzzy. He had wanted to issue the order to kill, annihilating everyone and letting them be buried together with him in death, but this thought could not be projected out at all.

In front of him, there was only Ling Han’s chilly gaze. At the back of his mind, his consciousness which was getting more and more blurry slowly dissipated from his body, causing him to become a corpse.

Ling Han came onto the platform with a quick step, and unleashed his imposing aura. Peng, peng, peng , everyone was trembling all over, not even having the ability to move a finger. Ling Han’s divine sense swept past; with apa, pa, pa, the disciples of the Wind Moon Sect were killed as their hearts were crushed to pieces, while those captured women were released.

A plan to hinder him using a method of the Heaven Tier?

Ling Han summoned the guards in the nearby cities, and let them escort these women back. This kind of trivial matter certainly wouldn’t need to be taken on personally by the country’s sovereign. He linked with the totem and placed the entire lower realm under his telepathic sense.

He remained motionless, and abruptly opened his eyes a day later.

Found it!

He immediately unfolded his body, and flew to a place in the middle state.

***

One day later, Ling Han came to a small town. Just a day ago, he had discovered through the totem that a member of the Thousand Corpse Sect was roaming here, and he was one of the generals—Corpse Boss!

Before entering the Immortal Realm, Ling Han had to completely eliminate the Thousand Corpse Sect. On the contrary, there was no news on the remaining members of the five great sects such as the Sword King and the others. It was unknown on which mountain or deep in which forest they were hiding; they would likely only appear when the immortals descended to the lower realm.

Ling Han walked slowly, looking for traces of Corpse Boss. Without realizing, he came to a river.

In front, there was a young man standing on a large rock, with his gaze fixed on the river. His facial expression was very interesting; one moment he was angry, and the next disappointed.

He looked to be just about fifteen or sixteen years old, but seemed to have met with huge setbacks in life.

“Gonna jump?” Ling Han asked casually as he walked over.

The clothing worn by the young man was of very high grade, but the fabric was old and had been washed to the point that their colors faded, turning spotlessly clean. It seemed that he had been wearing the same piece of clothing without any replacement. He turned around to look at Ling Han before immediately regaining his composure. “You can be assured. I won’t jump.”

“Based on your looks, it seemed that you will jump in any time,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“This has nothing to do with you, right?” the young man said indifferently.

Ling Han was idle anyway, so he suggested, “Let’s talk about it, what grievances have you encountered?”

The young man cast him another glance. Naturally, he did not intend to have a heart-to-heart talk with a stranger, but he couldn’t resist Ling Han, who had rich experiences in life. With just a few words that had struck home with him, he unconsciously opened up and started talking about it.

“My name is Ding Ping, the first heir to the Ding Family. I have been strong as an ox since young, and have been hailed as a genius and incessantly sought after by my clansmen. I also have a very beautiful fiancee. However, time slowly passed, yet my Spirit Base has yet to be awakened. It was only half a year ago that my Spirit Base had finally awakened, but it is a wilted Spirit Base with no way to cultivate!

“Now, my family members regard me as trash, and my fiancee terminated our marriage contract!

“I’m resentful, wondering why would the heavens do this to me!

“What I am even more dissatisfied with is that I have worked harder and put in more effort than anyone else in the past few years. Why am I still lacking compared to the others?”

The young man felt extremely aggrieved.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “In this world, it has always been the case that success isn’t achieved just based on efforts alone.”

Bang , this was a hit on the head. The young man was already upset to begin with. When he heard those words, he couldn’t help but become so agitated that he wanted to bite someone. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“However, if you don’t work hard, then you definitely won’t succeed.” Ling Han turned his words around. He looked at Ding Ping, and said, “Do you have a lot of strength?”

Ding Ping could not help but reveal a little pride, saying, “Even those who have been cultivating for four to five years will not dare to compete with me in strength!”

This was quite amazing. One should have reached the fifth layer of the Body Refining Tier after four to five years of cultivation, right?

Ling Han couldn’t help but became intrigued. He clearly didn’t sense any strong bloodline from Ding Ping’s body. He said, “Give me a demonstration!”

Ding Ping initially did not pay any heed to Ling Han. Did the latter not see him being depressed? But the words of Ling Han seemed to have supreme charisma, so much so that he couldn’t help but do as requested. He jumped off the stone, and lifted up with both hands the huge stone that was comparable to an ox.

This stone was at least a few thousand kilograms!

Ling Han was taken aback. If this young man had practiced body arts, then it wouldn’t be unusual for him to lift such a large stone, but that didn’t seem to be the case at all. Ling Han activated the Eye of Truth, sweeping over the young man’s body with his eyes, and suddenly discovered wherein the strangeness lay.

The skeletal structure of this young man was completely different from ordinary people’s. Through the clever borrowing of power, it made him one-of-a-kind. It was clear that he only had the strength of four taels, but could raise up heavy objects of thousands of kilograms in weight.

Of course, this required the skeletal structure of this young man to be very sturdy. Otherwise, it would be crushed bit by bit under such weight. This could be seen from the streaks of patterns branded upon his bones—how many people would have been born with bone patterns?

Ling Han couldn’t help laughing, and said, “Young man, take me as your master!”
