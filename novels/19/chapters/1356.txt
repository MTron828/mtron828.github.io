Chapter 1357 Attracting Hostility

“Oh, how beautiful?” Zhao Ku’s eyes involuntarily lit up.

He’d pathetically fled back to the Zhao Clan, and could not avoid a heavy scolding from his old man. But who asked him to be Zhao Zuyi’s only son? Naturally, he could not bear to reprimand him seriously, so once he heard the news of the Highest Jade Essence Heart being on auction, he scrambled over.

Naturally, the more life-saving treasures, the better.

However, Ling Han had practically robbed him clean, and he had been scolded heavily by his old man as well, so it was natural that he was extremely displeased. Thus, he also planned to drive away his worries with this trip, and women, especially beautiful women, were naturally the best option for driving away his worries.

Hence, he was naturally tempted the moment he heard the word ‘beauty’, and in a level like theirs, ordinary beauties naturally need not be specially mentioned. They had to be top-grade beauties.

“I guarantee that Young Master Ku will be satisfied!” Situ Lin said mysteriously.

“Then bring me over quickly!” Zhao Ku was displeased. There was a woman like that, yet he actually still used ordinary beauties to entertain him the day before? What was he thinking?

Situ Lin’s face darkened involuntarily. ‘Aren’t you too quick to become heartless?’ However, firstly, Zhao Ku’s background was more powerful, and he himself was in the Heavenly Body Tier, and secondly, he still had to depend on Zhao Ku to deal with Ling Han, so he naturally did not want to offend him.

He could only smile awkwardly, and said, “I will immediately bring Young Master Ku to find that exquisite beauty.”

“Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!” Zhao Ku was excited, and immediately stood up.

‘Idiot! Trash!’ Situ Lin thought in his heart. If his old man was an Eternal River Tier elite, and he was the only son as well, he was sure he would definitely have reached the height of the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier.

His expression did not reveal his thoughts. Leading Zhao Ku out the doors, he headed in the direction of the auction house.

He had long since done his investigation. Ling Han and his group also wanted the Highest Jade Essence Heart. In truth, who didn’t?

***

Ling Han had only brought the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden with him. The couple headed to the auction house. Their only target was the Highest Jade Essence Heart, so there was no need to get their whole group involved.

“After we get hold of the Highest Jade Essence Heart, will we be returning to the Joint Peace Planet to meet your empress lover?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked as they walked.

Ling Han involuntarily shivered. This fierce woman was still feeling jealous. He thought for a moment, and then replied, “We have to return to Big Trade City first. After all, I promised to teach someone to concoct the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill, so who knows if the person has learnt how or not yet.”

“A woman?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked.

‘Could you not be so sharp?’

Ling Han smiled bitterly. This was really a coincidence. Whether it was Lin Yuqi or Han Xinyan, they were all women, and they were also above-average beautiful women. Furthermore, Lin Yuqi was a great bewitching beauty that could easily intoxicate a man with a single look. If this was known to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, she would definitely turn the heavens over in her jealousy.

“Just how much are you still hiding from me?” Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stuck out a hand at Ling Han’s waist and pinched his flesh strongly.

Ling Han naturally would not feel pain with how strong his physique was, but he still put on a pretence as if he was in unbelievable pain, and exclaimed, “Wife, not so hard, not so hard!”

“Stop pretending!” Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden declared, her face expressionless. This Casanova, she herself became a widow for him in the Immortal Realm, while he, on the other hand, played the romance game everywhere he went. Just the mere thought of it made her angry.

Ling Han saw that there was no one in the surroundings, and immediately pushed her into a small alley. Pushing this great beauty against the wall, he lowered his head and kissed the beautiful lips of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

“Wu!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden struggled, but soon lost her wits, and was only able to think about fiercely responding to his kiss.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel rueful. If he had known that this move would have been so effective, why would he have had to go everywhere to various ancient sites to seek a way of becoming stronger in the past? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Pervert!” After a long while, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s face was completely flushed. Her fierce attitude was no more, and she had completely become soft and dazed.

Ling Han snickered, and asked, “Wife, when are we going to consummate our marriage?”

“Go to hell!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stretched out a fist, ready to pummel Ling Han.

However, her present battle prowess was already far inferior to Ling Han’s. He merely stretched out his hand and caught hold of her wrist, and taking advantage of the opening, kissed her fiercely again. Furthermore, he touched her everywhere he could, causing her pale jade-like complexion to become enchantingly flushed all over.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel his heart throb. He really wanted to immediately bring this beauty into the Black Tower for a bout of intimacy, but when he recalled the Highest Jade Essence Heart, he still forcibly repressed the urge. He merely embraced this beauty in his arms, and slowly calmed his rapidly beating heart.

“Damn pervert!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden punched him lightly.

‘Why do women all like to say that?’

Ling Han was not such an idiot that he voiced out this question. Otherwise, this jealous lover that he had just calmed down would probably fly once more into jealousy.

They left the small alley, and continued their way to the auction house. Not long after, the auction house appeared within their sight.

“Young Master Ku, she’s here! She’s here!” At the main doors of the auction house, Situ Lin was stretching his head and looking here and there. When he spotted Ling Han walk over with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden beside him, he couldn’t help but look pleased.

‘Hehe, just wait for death!’

Unfortunately, the brat that had snatched his woman was actually absent!

Zhao Ku looked in the direction he was pointing at, and immediately looked stunned. However, it was only a moment, and this stunned expression immediately became one of fear.

He naturally remembered the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

True enough, when his eyes slightly slanted to the side, they caught sight of Ling Han. The coldness in his heart immediately increased a hundredfold. His whole person was almost frozen solid.

“Young Master Ku, this girl is not bad, right?” Situ Lin did not notice in the slightest, and was still proudly talking by his side.

Ling Han, who had already walked close enough, calmly asked, “What’s not bad?”

Situ Lin naturally was willing to become the lackey. He stood on the steps and looked down on them. He pointed at Ling Han, and exclaimed, “Young Master Ku is interested in your female companion! You are very fortunate. Quickly deliver your female companion, and Young Master Ku may perhaps grant you an important position.”

Every word was devastating. Having to surrender his own woman and still becoming someone’s lackey? Was that considered fortunate?

“Oh, is that right?” Ling Han looked at Zhao Ku smilingly.

“Not bad your sister!” Zhao Ku suddenly went crazy and gave Situ Lin a serious beating.

He was naturally furious. He had just fled from Ling Han’s grasp, yet Situ Lin actually pushed him back into the fire pit! F***, what enmity was there between them that he actually screwed him over like this?

‘Let’s see if I won’t beat you to death, bastard!’

In the first place, Zhao Ku was a standard idle young master. There were really not that many people in the whole Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire that would make him wary, and this mere Heavenly Body Tier-level force actually dared trick him. Now, he truly was of a mind to beat Situ Lin to death.

“Ah!” Situ Lin screamed in pain. He was completely confused. Could it be that Zhao Ku’s taste was so different from the masses? What would seem like an exquisite beauty in the eyes of others would actually be a hideous hag to him? If that was not the case, why would he be so furious?

“Young Master Ku, why are you hitting me?” He grabbed onto his head. With his abilities, he was naturally no match for Zhao Ku, and the question of his life or death was merely a single whim of Zhao Ku.

“Not only do I want to hit you, I also want to kill you!” Zhao Ku threatened menacingly. This guy actually dared to incite him to snatch the woman of a bringer of misfortune like Ling Han; wasn’t this trying to kill him?

‘What enmity do I have with you?’
