Chapter 1637: Battle royale breaks out

The eyes of these 15 Saint Kings were cold.

As they saw it, as long as Ling Han no longer had the trump card to kill Saint Kings, then they could not possibly be wary of him in the slightest.

The present Ling Han was indeed very strong, but that strength was based on his extreme speed and the power of his flame. His personal battle prowess was only that bit, and there was no need for them to be afraid.

Since they had now turned completely hostile, it was a good thing too; they’d just battle it out then!

“15 seniors that had matured for many years would actually go on to bully a junior; do you all still have any shame?” The Blue Feather Saint King stepped out, standing by Ling Han’s side.

“I am also very unconvinced.” Another Saint King stepped out, choosing to support Ling Han.

At the end, there were a total of nine Saint Kings that chose to stand together with Ling Han, and another seven Saint Kings chose to help neither side.

“Friends, what need is there to waste time on a junior?” an opposing Saint King asked, trying to draw a wedge between them. “This boy must have hidden a great secret. As long as we can apprehend him, with our abilities, we will be able to grasp all of them in a few million years, at most.”

“With our remaining lifespan, it would be no problem for us to live another several hundred million years, so why don’t we take his good fortune for our own, and break into the Celestial Realm with our own ability?”

“Don’t claim that you all have never had the thought. This boy must have obtained the secret technique of a Celestial King that has died years ago; otherwise, how could he possibly be this strong! This is a Celestial King technique we’re talking about. Friends, are you all just going to watch helplessly as this wonderful great fortune slips out of your hands right in front of you?”

The Blue Feather Saint King humphed, and declared, “We have all reached the Saint King Tier, so why don’t you all have the slightest bit of integrity? Speaking of your shameless behavior in such a self-righteous manner, you all are really thick-skinned!”

“Humph, when words get sour, what need is there to talk further?” One of the Saint Kings was more hot-tempered. “Let’s pick out nine of us to stand against the nine of them, and the remaining ones will work together to kill that boy. Then, there will naturally be nothing else that needs to be said.”

“That’s right!” The opposing Saint Kings nodded, and soon nine of their number stepped out, focusing on the Blue Feather Saint King and the other eight Saint Kings, while the remaining six Saint Kings were targeting Ling Han.

The Open Clouds King was also among them. He was the first to make his move. Boom, the power of time surged, making one have doubts whether he had come from the future or from the past. It was incredibly bizarre.

Ling Han’s figure moved, but he had just taken one step when he realized that it was as if he had slipped into mud, his speed actually dropping a good few times. Though he was still slightly faster than the Saint Kings, his advantage was not the slightest bit obvious now.

“Hoho, it’s a technique that you have used in front of us once, could it be that you think you can enjoy its effects a second time?” The Open Clouds King sneered. It was the power of time that he had unleashed that had slowed down the flow of time around Ling Han so that his speed would also become slower.

He broke out in a slight sweat. Ling Han’s strength spiked into the early stage of the Saint King Tier, and even if he was a peak stage Saint King, it was still very straining for him to restrict Ling Han’s speed. This could not possibly be maintained for too long a period of time.

“Charge!” All the Saint Kings made their moves—nine Saints against nine Saints, while the remaining six shot their attacks towards Ling Han. They wanted to take advantage of this time when his speed was hindered to kill him.

Ling Han sneered. Weng, his killing formations activated. Xiu, xiu, xiu. A frightening light shot out from his body, instantly rending the flow of time to pieces. All techniques in this world had to obey an iron-clad rule: when power was strong to a certain extent, techniques would become completely meaningless.

Faced with Ling Han’s killing formations, even the Open Clouds King’s power of time could not show its might.

“Damn it!” The Open Clouds King cursed. To be honest, his battle prowess was not the slightest bit inferior to Ling Han’s, but it would take too much from him to be able to trap Ling Han from such a long distance. However, he did not dare to take the risk to fight Ling Han at close quarters.

What if he was killed?

If he had been that kind of courageous character, why would he have hidden in his Forbidden Land and not come out all these years? Why would he have established his Forbidden Land in such a remote, distant location?

Ling Han had escaped, and immediately channeled the Immovable Deity Metal Body Mystical Power, creating another four arms that simultaneously channeled different celestial techniques, and charged towards the Open Clouds King. The first he was going to kill was going to be this person.

Firstly, this would fulfill his promise to the Heavenly River King, and secondly, the threat that this person posed to him was also considerably big. After all, time was one of the strongest Regulations of the world; it was even able to hinder his extreme speed! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Don’t even think about it!” The other five Saint Kings were not to be trifled with, either. They used their respective powerful techniques, which blasted towards Ling Han.

With a battle cry, Ling Han shot into the air, and took the initiative to relocate their battle. Otherwise, if they went full out in battle here, Wood Figure Planet would definitely be destroyed.

“Charge!” The six Saint Kings set off in rapid pursuit. One after another, attacks blasted out, stimulating the great dao. The light of Regulations danced wildly. Saint Kings were the strongest existence in the Immortal Realm, and every attack they delivered would resonate with the heaven and earth.

Ling Han had no more reservations, and turned around to charge at the six Saint Kings.

Various celestial techniques were unleashed from his hands, stunning all the Saints. How could one man simultaneously use so many different celestial techniques! But the most frightening thing was still those two swords that were channeling the Lightning Sword Technique. There were too many celestial techniques fused in them, and they could sever the heavens directly!

But Ling Han’s personal battle prowess was only in the early stage of the Saint King Tier. Even with his killing formations activated, he could only match a peak stage Saint King, and this was not power that truly belonged to him, so it was inevitable that he could not use it as well he pleased, especially in a battle of this grade. Immediately, he realized that killing formations were only killing formations, after all. There was still a great difference between them and his own personal battle prowess.

At that moment, the battle was stuck in a stalemate.

But all the Saint Kings were already struck dumb with shock. This was Ling Han’s genuine battle prowess, and unlike using some kind of trump card, there was no time limit to it. Instead, he could fight on like this without end.

To force a Saint King to battle to exhaustion... No matter how fierce the battle was, it was completely no problem for him to last a few hundred years. And this was a few hundred years’ time; even if Ling Han was not their match in the end, couldn’t he find some opening to flee?

Oh no, the rising of this young Saint could no longer be stopped. He was already so powerful at present; after a few more years, the whole Ancient Realm would have to treat him with respect.

“Charge!” All the Saint Kings’ expressions were icy cold. This was the last chance. If they still could not kill Ling Han this time, then there would not be any more chances left for them in future.

In the galaxy, the bloody battle surged on.

One one side, Ling Han wanted to kill these Saint Kings that bore malicious intent towards him, and on the other, these Saint Kings also wanted to kill him, both to remove the threat permanently and to obtain a gigantic profit.

Neither side was willing to retreat. Various celestial techniques were unleashed, lighting up the whole galaxy. Even those that were a few galaxies away could see that blinding light. Multiple shock waves that filled one’s heart with fear spread out. They were strong enough to travel for tens of thousands of years before all their energy had been exhausted.

Ling Han bathed in blood, covered with injuries. The people he was facing were six Saint Kings, and though only two of them had reached the peak stage, the combined force of six Saint Kings were still an extremely great threat for him. Sustaining one strike from them was enough to make him throw up blood, and even a physique that was close to the toughness of Level 20 Godly metal did not have very good defensive effects against such power.

But the six Saint Kings were not that much better off. He had torn off an arm and a leg, respectively, from two Saint Kings in the early stage, punched a hole through the torso of a middle stage Saint King, and pierced the lower abdomen of a late stage Saint King with the broken wooden sword. The latter was forced to give up and sever his lower body, or both his form and spirit would be destroyed.
