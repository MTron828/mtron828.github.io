Chapter 2182: From Make-believe to Reality

“But…” Chen Shuangshuang was clearly a little hesitant.

“So you’re not willing to help Junior Brother Ling?” Ling Han said slowly. “Sigh, and you say that you’re a loyal friend. You clearly just said that for show.”

Chen Shuangshuang immediately retorted, “Who was saying that for show? Fine, then I’ll get married to him!”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Alright, then I’ll organize this matter. You can prepare to become the bride.”

“A fake one,” Chen Shuangshuang stressed.

“Yes, a fake one,” Ling Han replied.

Chen Shuangshuang left, and the Empress and the others walked out from inside. When they became bored in the Black Tower, they would come out for a walk. However, they wouldn’t be seen by others.

“Husband, you’re truly so evil,” Shui Yanyu said.

She had been a teacher in the past, so she had a strong sense of righteousness.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “There’s nothing else I can do. Who told her to be so naive? Who told my stupid son to be so bad at expressing himself?”

“Who’s a stupid son?” Helian Xunxue asked in displeasure. In a mother’s eyes, their son was naturally always the best.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Anyhow, if this girl hadn’t had feelings for Jianxue, would she have become jealous and run over here to complain? Would she have agreed to the fake marriage to ‘save’ Jianxue?”

“That’s true,” the women said with a nod.

Chen Shuangshuang was simply airheaded, so she hadn’t realized her feelings for Ling Jianxue. However, she had barely hesitated before agreeing to the “fake marriage” with Ling Jianxue. This was already proof enough of her love for Ling Jianxue.

If it had been someone else, would they have agreed?

Ling Han chuckled in anticipation. Once the wedding was held, it would become real even if it was fake.

“We’ll seize this opportunity to create some more commotion.”

He spread news of this wedding, and the entire Heavenly Saint Palace instantly knew that Ling Jianxue was about to marry Chen Shuangshuang.

“What?!” Ling Jianxue, the bridegroom, only learned of this from someone else. He hurriedly ran over to Ling Han, asking, “Father, what in the world is going on?”

“Perhaps you don’t want to marry your Senior Sister Chen?” Ling Han said with a smile.

Ling Jianxue instantly became shy and bashful. He naturally wanted to marry her. However, this was far too sudden, and Chen Shuangshuang didn’t even know about his feelings yet. Why was she suddenly going to marry him? Moreover, he was the bridegroom, so why did he only learn of this wedding just now?

“I do want to, but…”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “No need for buts. Just wait to be a bridegroom.”

“Ling Jianxue, come out here!” Right at this moment, a loud shout suddenly traveled over from outside.

Ling Jianxue ran out, only to see Wang Liangchun standing at the door. He appeared extremely angry.

“Senior Brother Wang, what’s wrong?” he asked.

Wang Liangchun humphed, and said, “I forbid you from marrying Junior Sister Chen!”

Ling Jianxue scoffed, and said, “Firstly, you have no relationship with me. Secondly, you have no relationship with Senior Sister Chen. What right do you have to forbid this marriage?”

“Because you’re not worthy of her!” Wang Liangchun said with arrogance. “With your measly strength, how can you be worthy of Junior Sister Chen?”

“Then are you worthy?”

“Naturally!”

Ling Jianxue gestured for him to come over, saying, “Then please show me, Senior Brother Wang.”

“You’re seeking punishment!” Wang Liangchun said in disdain. He had reached the Fourth Severance millions of years before Ling Jianxue, and right now, he had already tempered the Fourth Severance to a consummate state. He was only a step away from advancing to the Dividing Soul Tier.

In other words, his battle prowess was naturally superior to Ling Jianxue’s.

“Since you’re asking for humiliation, I’ll satisfy your request!” With a tap of his feet, Wang Liangchun instantly soared into the sky. “Come, a battle in the sky!”

Ling Jianxue’s fighting spirit soared. After advancing to the Fifth Severance, he still had yet to fight with anyone else. He only knew that he was far more powerful than before, but he didn’t know just how powerful he was.

With a tap of his feet, he also leaped into the sky.

“Senior Brother Wang, please,” he said in a courteous voice. This was because he was confident, so he didn’t need to act in a reckless or sinister manner.

Wang Liangchun sneered, and said, “I’ll make you submit within 100 moves!” With a flash, he charged toward Ling Jianxue, unleashing a powerful celestial technique as he did so.

Ling Jianxue replied with a punch.

Peng!

In a single exchange, Wang Liangchun was sent stumbling back. He retreated several hundred kilometers.

“Waah!” Wang Liangchun violently coughed a mouthful of blood, an expression of shock and disbelief on his face.

How was his opponent so powerful?

In fact, even Ling Jianxue hadn’t expected this result. He only knew that he was definitely more powerful than Wang Liangchun. However, he hadn’t expected to achieve victory in a single exchange. Moreover, he had done so in a crushing manner.

Monarch tiers were naturally more powerful than emperor tiers, and it was when they became Fifth Severance cultivators that their advantage would be the most obvious. If they were both at the Yang Soul, even though Ling Jianxue would still be more powerful, he definitely wouldn’t be able to wound Wang Liangchun in a single strike.

Wang Liangchun took a sharp breath, and loudly asked, “Wh-what kind of celestial pill did you take?”

Ling Jianxue laughed, and said, “Senior Brother Wang, thank you for letting me win.”

Victory had been decided, so there was naturally no need to continue this battle. Moreover, he now understood just how much more powerful than his opponent he was.

“I haven’t lost yet!” Wang Liangchun shouted, clearly unwilling to give up. He immediately tensed up and charged at Ling Jianxue again.

“You can’t even see the gulf between us, so how can you possibly catch me?” Ling Jianxue said. He tapped his finger at Wang Liangchun.

Peng!

Wang Liangchun was sent flying again. He was still unable to block a single strike from Ling Jianxue.

The advantage of a Fifth Severance cultivator over a Fourth Severance cultivator was like the advantage of a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator over a Severing Mundane Tier cultivator. It was far too great.

Wang Liangchun finally understood the insurmountable gulf between him and Ling Jianxue. He could only glare at Ling Jianxue before turning around to leave. Just like he had said before, fighting any more would only be seeking humiliation.

Ling Jianxue descended from the sky, and excitedly said to Ling Han, “Father, I’m actually this powerful!”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Your journey is still long, so if you become content with your current situation, the gates to the Celestial King Tier might not open up for you.”

“I understand.” Ling Jianxue immediately suppressed his feeling of excitement.

Afterward, several more displeased senior brothers and junior brothers visited to challenge Ling Jianxue. However, they were all easily defeated. Who in the Severing Mundane Tier was his opponent? Even if Yang Soul cultivators challenged him, Ling Jianxue could still rival them. It was just that he couldn’t defeat them.

He won more and more battles, and this also caused the sect to view him in higher regard. In the end, they finally realized that he had become a monarch tier. This caused commotion to sweep through the Heavenly Saint Palace.

Monarch tiers were destined to become Celestial Kings. Even in the Heavenly Saint Palace, such a prodigy would only appear once every tens of billions of years.

Because of this, Ling Jianxue was also elevated to the status of Holy Son. His future path would definitely be bright and limitless.

With Ling Han’s earlier notification, Tu Hongying naturally wasn’t able to cause a fuss during the wedding, either. This allowed Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang’s wedding to proceed smoothly.

A day after the wedding, Ling Jianxue brought Chen Shuangshuang over to pay respects to his parents. During this process, Ling Han’s daughter-in-law shot a sharp glare at him. It was clear that even though she was airheaded, she had finally realized that she had been tricked by Ling Han.

However, what was done was already done. Last night, she hadn’t been able to resist Ling Jianxue’s stubborn coaxing, and she had also been slightly muddle-headed thanks to the large amount of alcohol that she had consumed. In the end, she had become one with that bastard.

Ultimately, it was still because her father-in-law Ling Han was far too shameless. He had actually tricked her into this result.
