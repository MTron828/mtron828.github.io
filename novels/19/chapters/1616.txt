Chapter 1617: Time Dragon Tribe

Boom!

Symbols of the great dao encircled Zhong Badu as he unleashed his might as a Saint. A silver river materialized in the air, a whopping 7,000,000 heavenly bodies contained within it.

Small Saints could at most only unleash 10,000,000 heavenly bodies. If they didn’t comprehend the great dao and advance to the level of Medium Saint, they definitely wouldn’t be able to cultivate over 10,000,000 heavenly bodies. Thus, it was evident that Zhong Badu’s cultivation had already reached the late stage of a Small Saint.

He made a pressing motion with his palm, his Origin Power gathering and forming an even larger palm. Great stars materialized one after another, yet they were like mere pellets before his formidable palm.

The power of this palm was utterly terrifying!

Ling Han snapped his fingers and activated his killing formations, unleashing a streak of sword light that slashed toward the colossal palm.

Compared to Zhong Badu’s palm, this streak of sword light was incredibly small—it was merely three feet long. Meanwhile, Zhong Badu’s colossal palm was larger than even heavenly bodies! Their attacks were on two completely different levels. Yet, upon impact, Zhong Badu’s colossal palm was instantly sliced into two by Ling Han’s sword light!

Zhong Badu grunted in pain. Raising his right hand, he saw that there was blood dripping down from his palm.

Although that colossal palm had only been a projection, it was still inextricably linked to him. Generally speaking, however, he wouldn’t be affected even if the palm were shattered. Otherwise, wouldn’t unleashing such an attack be the same as engaging in close-quarter combat?

However, Ling Han’s sword light was far too devastating. Not only did it cut through his Origin Power palm, but it even cut through to the origin and wounded his body.

“You’re a measly Eternal River Tier cultivator, yet your attacks are actually this powerful!” he exclaimed slowly. There was a look of extreme caution on his face.

He had exchanged a few casual strikes with Ling Han before, and thus he was already aware that Ling Han possessed the battle prowess of a Saint. However, he certainly hadn’t expected Ling Han to be powerful enough to rival him!

This was simply unfathomable!

Yang Zige finally understood why Zhong Badu had smacked him across the face. As it turned out, he had been rubbing salt into Zhong Badu’s wounds!

He exchanged a glance with Jing Yi, and they both saw a hint of worry in each other’s eyes. ‘Zhong Badu won’t lose to Ling Han, will he?’

‘No, he definitely won’t!’

They hurriedly shook their heads. Zhong Badu was the king tier of the younger generation in the Open Clouds Forbidden Land. The fact that he had become a Saint at only 100,000 years of age was proof enough of his mighty status. His talent was simply heaven-defying!

Regardless of how freakish Ling Han was, he was still only at the Eternal River Tier. So, how could he hope to defeat a Saint?

Yang Zige and Jing Yi could only reassure themselves with such thoughts. Before witnessing this battle, could they have fathomed an Eternal River Tier cultivator rivaling a Genesis Tier Saint? This being the case, would it still come as a huge surprise if Ling Han genuinely defeated a Saint?

“Ling Han, you’ve succeeded in capturing my attention!” Zhong Badu said with a smile. Ling Han possessed the battle prowess of a Saint even though he was only at the Eternal River Tier—it was clear that he possessed some earth-shattering secrets.

Zhong Badu was hell-bent on obtaining them!

However, Ling Han wore an expression of pure disgust as he said, “Disgusting freak, I didn’t think you were this kind of person!”

Zhong Badu faltered for a moment before finally realizing the reason behind Ling Han’s disgust. He couldn’t help but flare up in rage. They were both Saints—or at least both possessed the battle prowess of Saints—and thus they represented the most powerful beings in the world. Yet, Ling Han was actually slandering him without any hesitation? Where was his demeanor as a Saint?

“Die!” Zhong Badu roared, his black hair billowing up into the sky.

Peng, peng, peng!

His clothes exploded into shreds, leaving only his pants intact. This pair of pants was most likely a treasured armor that possessed an incredible toughness.

Divine patterns started to appear on his skin, and these were Saint-level patterns that could gather the Dao of Heaven and Earth and have them encircle his body.

He would kill Ling Han, and directly pluck his soul to learn his secrets!

“Dragon of Eternity!” he roared. A giant bronze dragon soared out from his chest. This dragon measured 3000 meters in length, and its appearance was extremely illusory. It was as if it existed in the past, yet as if it existed in the future at the same time. However, one thing was certain—it definitely didn’t exist in the present.

“Time Dragon Tribe!” the members of the Long Tribe all exclaimed in astonishment. There was a look of utter shock on their faces.

Dragon Tribe—this was an extremely general and broad concept.

According to the legends, the first dragon was nurtured and birthed by Heaven. This dragon was called the Origin Dragon. The Origin Dragon bore nine children, and they were the Golden Dragon, Green Dragon, Black Dragon, Crimson Dragon, and so on. These “Secondary Dragon” then copulated with beings of other tribes, and birthed even more diverse descendants.

Thus, Dragon Tribes that possessed different bloodlines naturally possessed different abilities as well.

For example, the Dragon Tribe of Gathered Seas Planet was descended from the Crimson Dragon, and they were skilled at manipulating fire. As for the Bronze Dragons, they were the most mysterious members of the Dragon Tribes. This was because they wielded the power of time. Fittingly, they were named the Time Dragon Tribe.

Time, space, darkness, massacre, and so on—these were all Regulations that were extremely difficult to grasp. However, members of the Time Dragon Tribe innately possessed the power of time. Thus, they were naturally viewed as impressively powerful beings, and they were also regarded as the elites of the Dragon Tribes.

“Who would’ve thought that the Zhong Clan also possessed the bloodline of a Dragon Tribe!”

“Gasp! Don’t tell me that their reason for marriage is to combine the bloodlines of the two Dragon Tribes so that they can bear descendants who possess both the power of time and the power of flames!”

The members of the Long Tribe all speculated over this. Otherwise, why would the Zhong Clan have traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers for a marriage with the Long Tribe?

The power of time surged through the air as the bronze dragon soared toward Ling Han.

Ling Han threw a punch, yet it was unable to cause any damage as it struck the bronze dragon. In fact, it was unable to shift even a single dragon scale.

This dragon didn’t belong to the present, so how could it be struck by an attack that existed in the present?

Ling Han smiled as he unleashed another punch. This time, however, he imbued his punch with the Tide of the Ages.

Peng!

This strike finally landed on the bronze dragon’s body. However, even though Tide of the Ages was a celestial technique, its power was limited by Ling Han’s lowly cultivation level. As such, there was no way for Ling Han to unleash the true might of this celestial technique. The bronze dragon simply faltered for a moment before continuing to charge at Ling Han.

Even so, Zhong Badu was still astounded by what he saw. His opponent had actually managed to affect the power of time! This was truly incredible!

At the same time, this further heightened his interest and curiosity regarding Ling Han’s secrets. He could barely wait to make them his! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han attacked again, activating his killing formations that released a brilliant light. This brilliant light then formed a Sword Ray that slashed at the bronze dragon.

However, it was a shame that the bronze dragon didn’t belong to the present. As such, this Sword Ray would be unable to wound it regardless of how powerful it was.

“Hahaha!” Zhong Badu roared with laughter as he commanded the bronze dragon to pounce on Ling Han. Upon being struck by the power of time, one portion of Ling Han’s body would enter the future, one portion would remain in the present, and one portion would return to the past.

In other words, he could only suffer one fate—dismemberment!

This was a celestial technique of the Open Clouds Forbidden Land, and it was an incredibly powerful technique that was inherited through their bloodline.

The bronze dragon was already upon Ling Han, its four claws locked onto his shoulders and legs.

“Shatter!” Zhong Badu roared.

However, Ling Han remained standing where he was, completely unscathed.

“Shatter! Shatter! Shatter!” Zhong Badu roared. He injected a burst of power into the bronze dragon with each roar, raising the overall power of the dragon.

Ling Han cocked his head slightly, poking his head out from behind the bronze dragon. There was a smile on his face, and he asked, “Are you tired from all that shouting? If you are, then why don’t you take a rest? Don’t damage your throat with all that shouting.”

‘How is this possible?!’

Zhong Badu was transfixed with shock. That was the bronze dragon, a dragon that possessed the power of time! Upon being attacked by it, one would instantly be dismembered into several pieces! Yet, what in the world was happening right now?

He funneled all of his power into the bronze dragon, yet Ling Han remained unscathed and unmoving regardless of how the power of time struck him.

Indeed, the power of time wasn’t all-powerful. Ling Han’s physique had already reached the level of Saintly Material, so as a fellow Small Saint, how could Zhong Badu’s power of time damage him?

Ling Han shuddered slightly as he unleashed a Dao Manifestation that measured over 30 thousand meters in height. This Dao Manifestation grabbed the bronze dragon and, following a loud roar, ripped it from Ling Han’s body. It held the dragon as if it were holding a snake.

How domineering!
