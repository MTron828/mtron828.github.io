Chapter 1500 Laying a trap for Gu Daoyi

Yet Ling Han knew nothing of this. He was engrossed in formations, and completely had no knowledge of the passing of time in the outside world.In the blink of an eye, two years had passed.

Ling Han suddenly moved, and opened his eyes underneath the Reincarnation Tree. He had completely grasped the Blood Crow Formation.

For formations below Saint-level, one only had to completely comprehend the formation patterns. But above that level, one would have to possess the power of construction. Without comprehension of that aspect, even if Saint-level formation patterns were inscribed on a formation eye and given to you, you would not be able to release its saintly might.

Just like how the power of a Saint Tool in the hands of an Eternal River Tier was limited to the peak stage of the pinnacle level, perhaps the power could reach Saint-level, but without corresponding power of Regulation, it could still not be claimed to be Saint-level power.

Ling Han used the Nine Heavens Flame like a blade, and inscribed the formation patterns on his bones. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As for the previous formations? Easy, with a simple thought, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll would naturally mend his Godly bones back to perfection.

Ling Han used his mind’s eye, his will as his hand, and the Nine Heavens Flame as a blade, and inscribed the formation patterns on his bones. Compared to Level 14 formation patterns, the complexity of the Blood Crow Formation was tens of thousands times higher.

But the present Ling Han was no longer in the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, but in the Eternal River Tier. The strength of his divine sense had also soared, and the speed at which he inscribed was actually even faster than the last time.

Was it more difficult to breach the gap between Level 14 and Level 15, or the gap from the Heavenly Body Tier to the Eternal River Tier?

It would have to be the latter, of course, and thus, it was absolutely normal for Ling Han to advance so rapidly at present.

Thus, Ling Han had covered his Godly bones completely with formation patterns—a total of 10 formations. In truth, there was still space on his Godly bones to inscribe half of the Blood Crow Formation, but the might of half a formation was too small, which he might as well do without. Hence, he just left the space empty.

He exited the Black Tower.

Two years had passed, and for the majority, they did not improve their cultivation level in the slightest, but Empress Luan Xing, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and the others were different. Not only did they have the resources supplied by the academy, they also had the Divine Pills Ling Han had refined, and could also comprehend Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree, so the advancement in their cultivation was extremely obvious.

Though Ling Han had been in seclusion previously, he had still left behind a sliver of divine sense still alert. For those who wanted to enter into the Black Tower, they needed only enter his rooms, and this sliver of divine sense would naturally take them into the Black Tower. For someone who had reached his height, this was no big deal.

“You’ve succeeded?” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden immediately approached him.

Ling Han nodded, and answered with an “en”.

“Here, Saintly Origin.” Empress Luan Xing handed a jade box that was tightly closed to him.

Saintly Origin was the precious treasure that a Saint extracted from the source of heaven and earth. It could greatly improve one’s cultivation level because the Regulations of heaven and earth that the Saint had grasped were also contained within. For cultivators below Saint-level, it was extremely beneficial.

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then answered, “You use it.”

Empress Luan Xing was startled slightly, and immediately understood Ling Han’s thoughts—this bad guy still wanted her to quickly become a Saint so that he could do some perverted activities with her.

What Ling Han wanted was what she liked as well. The Empress merely smiled gently, and put the jade box away. Since Ling Han had made such a request of her, she would advance to Genesis Tier as soon as possible.

“Get a few for my Feng’er as well.” Ling Han could not just favor one of them, and planted a kiss on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s cheek. In the end, she only rolled her eyes at him in return.

There was nothing to be done. A leopard could not change its spots; the personality of the fierce woman was hard to change.

“Did anyone come to make trouble?” Ling Han asked.

“How could there not? Though they were all beaten off by Big Sister,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden answered, covering her smile with a hand.

Ling Han laughed involuntarily. Though Empress Luan Xing was only in the low extreme, what could they do when she had a great weapon to use in any fights? Once the brick was out, who dared stand against her?

“I have to think of some way to screw Gu Daoyi over.” Ling Han supported his chin with one hand. However, he could not make a move in the academy—in fact, there was no chance for him to make a move even anywhere else on Wood Figure Planet. With 10 Saints standing by, even if they did not consciously will it, their divine sense was roaming over every corner of the academy.

And those like Gu Daoyi definitely belonged to the heavily watched characters. Once there was any slight move, it would definitely draw the attention of the Saints.

“I can only wait for some ancient site to appear, lure Gu Daoyi to make a move, and then kill him!” Ling Han said. This Gu Daoyi, like Empress Luan Xing, had cultivated the Nine Deaths Heaven Art, and both of them wanted to refine the other’s fruits of cultivation, so it was destined that only one of them would be able to stay alive.

What else needed to be said? Ling Han would definitely be helping his own wife. Furthermore, once she refined Gu Daoyi’s Divine Fetus, Empress Luan Xing would be able to reach Genesis Tier even sooner, and this filled him with motivation.

But it would be too difficult for such a chance to appear. Gu Daoyi had a grasp of celestial techniques, and also had the comprehension of cultivation levels right up to Severing Mundane Tier. What Mystery Realm could there be in the Immortal Realm that would be worthy of his notice?

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han thought for a moment with his hand supporting his head, and then suddenly was startled.

He had once obtained a set of coordinates when he had been in the Lower Realm. That had been created by one of the Twelve Generals under the Heavenly River King, and he had obtained the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art and the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow from within.

This Mystery Realm had been a part of the Immortal Realm in the first place, but had been forcibly sealed off as another dimension and stuffed into the Lower Realm. Such an action was extremely, extremely extraordinary.

Previously, Ling Han’s cultivation level had been too low, so he was unable to figure out the cultivation level of the Twelve Generals, but now, he was absolutely certain that these 12 people definitely had to be Saints.

Putting aside all else, when one had cultivated the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art to the peak, one could possess the power of nine True Dragons, and True Dragons were of the same grade as Saints! In fact, the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow was an attack that could shatter heavenly bodies and kill True Dragons. How could it be anything else but the means of a Saint?

Then, what kind of existence would that Heavenly River King, the master of the Twelve Generals, have to be?

A Great Saint? Or perhaps... a Saint King?

He got it!

Ling Han clapped his hands. The coordinates that he had obtained definitely corresponded to a secret treasure of the Heavenly River King. Who knew what had happened all those years ago, but the Heavenly River King had fallen, while the Twelve Generals had sunken the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realms into the Lower Realm.

If the secret treasure of a Saint King appeared—no, when the secret treasure of the Celestial Realm appeared, would Gu Daoyi be tempted?

‘Who cares if it really is as great as the Celestial Realm? So what if I exaggerated a bit? What’s important is that Gu Daoyi would be tempted to venture out.

‘I’ll do some scouting first, then lay a trap for Gu Daoyi,’ Ling Han thought.

He discussed this idea with Empress Luan Xing and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. They immediately decided to set out and scout out the treasure that the Heavenly River King had left behind.

In the case of ancient sites, especially a place that had been created by someone that was possibly a Saint King like the Heavenly River King, preparations naturally had to be done very well. They decided to set out 10 days later.

“Master! Master!” Ding Ping rushed over.

“What has happened?” Ling Han asked. It was very rare for this disciple of his to be in such a rush.

Ding Ping caught his breath back, and said, “The Star Sand Saint has already announced a Saintly Decree to take Gu Daoyi as his 10th personal disciple.” His face was filled with indignation. If he was to take someone as a disciple, it should have been his master. Didn’t he see that it was Ling Han who had defeated Gu Daoyi and obtained the name of the strongest in the competition of new students?

Ling Han smiled involuntarily, and said, “I know.”

To be honest, he did not have the slightest desire to take the Star Sand Saint as his master. Enrolling into the academy and taking a certain person as master were two completely different matters altogether.

“Master, why are you not the slightest bit worried?” Ding Ping asked anxiously. “The decision of a Saint would be like a strike of heaven’s will, severing your good fortune!”

Saints had attained Dao, and from a certain aspect, represented the will of heaven and earth. Furthermore, it was widely rumored that only one person would be able to attain Dao among millions of king tiers, and it would be a person who had gained the favor of the Star Sand Saint.

Now that the Star Sand Saint had taken a disciple, it meant that others would not have any more hopes of becoming a Saint.
