Chapter 3573: Victim

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Ling Han?” Princess Bixiao was extremely surprised. This stranger was actually Ling Han?

“Did you get a scare?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“That’s true,” Princess Bixiao said with a nod. Then, realization dawned on her, and she said, “You want to go to the Primordial Sect with this appearance?” “En, did you see any flaws?” Ling Han countered.

Princess Bixiao examined it carefully for a while longer, then said, “Change of muscle tissue is the most primitive method, but it’s also the most effective method; it’s very natural. But the problem is, can you always remember how you look like now? You have to know, to say nothing of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, even the divine sense of a Foundation Building Tier cultivator is incomparably strong, and will never forget what they have seen. You only have to make the slightest mistake, and you’ll be exposed.”

Ling Han smiled and said, “I’m confident about this.”

“You definitely have to go. I can’t stop you, right?” Princess Bixiao sighed.

“En.” Ling Han nodded.

“Then, be careful on your way,” Princess Bixiao said seriously.

“Are you worried about me?” Ling Han said with a grin, revealing two rows of white teeth.

“Yes.” Princess Bixiao nodded frankly, then stared at Ling Han.

Ling Han, on the other hand, felt slightly embarrassed, and asked, “You’re not saying that you’ve fallen for me, are you?”

“You’re the Chief of the Department, so it’s only natural that I care about you. Don’t get any ideas,” Princess Bixiao said calmly.

F***, he had been slapped in the face.

Ling Han laughed. He rather enjoyed the way he was interacting with this princess of the Demon Race. They were not distant, yet still maintained a certain distance, like good friends, and had not developed to the level of lovers. It was very relaxed.

“Beauty, just wait for me to return.” He directly left.

The Foreign Affairs Department had Princess Bixiao on standby, so he was very at ease.

On this trip, he did not bring the Essence Nurturing Gourd with him. Thus, he naturally did not bring his seven toddlers with him either. This had practically become his symbol. Since he was concealing his identity this time, he naturally had to hide everything that would expose his identity.

At first, he had wanted to bring the fat pig with him, but when he thought that this pig could not be penetrated by anything, and it was very possible that he too had been identified as a symbol of his, he had best leave it behind as well.

For the perverted pig, this was naturally a great thing. He could once again happily sneak into the female bathhouse, female dormitory and the like. In any case, it was fine even if he was beaten up, and with his appearance, the chances of him being pampered by others were actually higher.

Ling Han set out on his own, and once again left the Imperial City, heading towards the Primordial Sect.

The day passed. Facing the rising sun, Ling Han breathed in and out, while his hand held the Ice Origin Stone, endlessly gathering the power of heaven and earth in the surroundings, greatly increasing his rate of cultivation.

Half an hour later, it was as if the Ice Origin Stone had evaporated and completely disappeared.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel regretful. He had used up all the Ice Origin Stones, and from tomorrow onwards, he would return to the “turtle speed” state of cultivation.

Why couldn’t he get a few more of such good stuff?

Thankfully, he was only a sliver away from the peak stage of Seven Inscriptions.

He had initially thought that he would be able to finish cultivating Seven Inscriptions in a few days’ time, but the gap of Seven Inscriptions was too wide. His level of being had undergone an earth-shattering improvement, causing him to also need to cultivate for longer to be able to catch up.

Tomorrow, he should be able to cultivate the entire Inscription Tier to the extreme, and next, he would be able to break through to Enlightenment Tier.

Ling Han planned to advance into Enlightenment Tier before he made it to the Primordial Sect. In that way, even if he suppressed his battle prowess, he would still be able to sweep aside 99% of Mystery Realm Tiers. However, he wouldn’t expose his identity. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be too much of a coincidence for another freak to appear that could forgo the gap of two major tiers and be invincible?

He continued his journey. The Primordial Sect was not too far away, and with his speed, if he travelled at full speed, he would be able to reach his destination in about two days’ time.

Thus, when the sun set, the Primordial Sect was not too far away.

Ling Han planned to take a good night’s rest. In any case, the deadline for this martial arts tournament was three days later, so he could completely take it calmly.

He started a fire, and took out some food to cook. Not long after, the aroma of meat wafted in all directions. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ling Han had just begun eating, when he saw xiu, xiu, xiu, a few figures flew past, and suddenly stopped not far from him.

“My Young Master is hungry, get lost!” An old man shouted at Ling Han, his eyes fierce.

Ling Han took a look, and couldn’t help but look surprised.

There were a total of five people on the other side, and he had seen all of them.

This was the visitor from another planet. Wasn’t that young man precisely the target of his looting? Just look, there was still a bump on the back of his head.

Thankfully, they could not recognize him.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “I am a hospitable person. Come and join me.”

The elder was infuriated. ‘I told you to scram! Can’t you understand?’

“Forget it, let’s eat together,” the young man spoke up, slightly absent-minded.

Recently, he had been too unlucky. Nothing went smoothly for him.

And everything began from the moment he descended onto this planet.

He had just been left alone, when someone knocked him out and robbed him of all his possessions, including two extremely valuable Battle Armors. Next, when he drank water, he would choke, when he breathed in, he would end up in hiccups, when he walked, he would stumble, and bird sh*t fell from the sky… in short, all kinds of unimaginable disasters would happen to him, making him practically doubt life itself.

Could it be that this planet was his nemesis?

Precisely because of this, he couldn’t be bothered to bother about other matters. Otherwise, with his pride, he would definitely not allow Ling Han to sit by his side.

How could such a lowly commoner be qualified?

The whole group sat down, and without the slightest reservations, shared the fruits of Ling Han’s labour.

Ling Han only looked on. This young man was filled with bad luck, and had more so encountered the source of his miseries, him. He would definitely be out of luck.

Sure enough, after taking two bites, the young man’s expression changed drastically. He grabbed onto his throat, appearing to be in extreme pain.

“Is there poison in the meat?” An old man immediately stood up, glaring angrily at Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “If the meat was poisonous, I would definitely be poisoned to death first. In my opinion, he must have accidentally gotten a bone caught in his throat.”

Another old man stretched out a hand and patted the young man’s back. The young man’s chest suddenly puffed up. Pu, he spat out a piece of bone from his mouth, and instantly became relaxed.

There was really a bone stuck in his throat.

The elders all sat down. This was the most doted descendant of the ancestor of the Niu Clan, and nothing could go wrong at all — though he had already been sneak attacked and robbed, it was fine as long as he was fine.

Ling Han looked at the young man, and suddenly said, “I say, brother, I can see that your glabella is darkening. Recently, you should be quite unlucky, right?© I!

“Don’t spout nonsense!” An old man immediately rebuked, “Our Young Master’s fortune is equal to the heavens, so how could he possibly be unlucky?”

“Hehe, I have studied Natural Divination Images for thirty years, and am the most sensitive about fortune. I can see it clearly with a single glance,” Ling Han said proudly.

“Che, you are only twenty years old, so how can you study Natural Divination Images for thirty years?” The old man from before immediately undermined him.

Yet a thought flashed in the young man’s mind, and he asked, “Do you really know how to read fortunes?”

“Of course!” Ling Han said proudly, “Have you been having a hard time these few days? Would you trip for no reason while walking?”

F***, ^5 calculations were really accurate!
