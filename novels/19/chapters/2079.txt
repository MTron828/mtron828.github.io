Chapter 2080: Who exactly is it?

Amazing the world with a single brilliant feat.

Though the ability to recognize herbs did not mean that one’s skill in alchemy was definitely high, looking at the Stone of Herbology, there had only been a mere seven people who had passed the eighth stage since ancient times. Was that not enough?

If this kind of celebrity that had gained eternal glory was not recruited into the Ancient Alchemy Tower, wouldn’t they be laughed at by all the alchemists in this world!

“Wu Zixu is really too strong!”

“No, it is Alchemist Riyang, it must be Alchemist Riyang!”

After a momentary silence, the whole area burst into a chaotic state. Everyone was in a frenzy, excitedly calling out the name of either Wu Zixu or Alchemist Riyang.

And right at this moment, Alchemist Riyang withdrew his hand and stood up.

It was Alchemist Riyang!

A portion of people suddenly felt their scalps grow numb in excitement. Though this had absolutely nothing to do with them, seeing the person they supported win still made them profoundly excited as they jumped up and down in exhilaration.

Those that supported Wu Zixu, meanwhile, were hanging their heads in dejection, as if they had fought a battle that they had lost.

Alchemist Riyang’s expression was filled with pride, a slight smile hovering at the corners of his lips. Ths result this time was more outstanding than what he had anticipated. His time of passing through the seventh stage had been faster by close to an hour as compared to previous records.

An apprentice from the Ancient Alchemy Tower raced over. He clearly was also a self-interested snob. Previously, he was acting cold and indifferent when he had been registering the results for others, but now he was all smiles, appearing very ingratiating.

This was natural. There was a very high possibility that Alchemist Riyang would join the Ancient Alchemy Tower, and once he did, he naturally would also be an alchemist, a status that placed him who knew how many times higher than an apprentice like him.

Thus, he naturally had to make his attitude very, very humble.

Moreover, even if Alchemist Riyang did not manage to enter into the Ancient Alchemy Tower this time, wouldn’t there still be a next time? As long as the former advanced to become a Four-Star Alchemist, he would definitely be able to enter the Ancient Alchemy Tower.

“Congratulations, Grandmaster Riyang!” this apprentice said. “Let me give you a review of your results.”

“En!” Grandmaster Riyang’s expression was reserved, and he nodded.

“You have passed seven stages, the total time taken being two days and 22 hours,” this apprentice announced.

‘What?!’

Passed seven stages?

The crowd instantly broke out into a commotion. Then, the person who had passed the eighth stage was not Alchemist Riyang.

Hearing such noise from the masses, Alchemist Riyang showed a hint of displeasure in his expression. What kind of behavior was this? Acting so boisterous and noisy, what a scandal was this? Though he was very awesome, there was no need for you guys to make a big fuss about it, right?

“It must be Wu Zixu!”

“Heaves, Wu Zixu has passed the eighth stage!”

“The strongest in an entire epoch!”

“You can’t put it that way, either. Though a great many Five-Star Grandmasters have not managed to leave their names on the Stone of Herbology when they were young, they must have that kind of strength by now. They only disdain doing so now.”

“Still, it can’t be denied that Wu Zixu is heaven-defying!”

Alchemist Riyang’s expression immediately changed. What? Wu Zixu had passed the eighth stage?

‘Impossible!’

He naturally had also attempted the eighth stage, but he had failed not long after he had started, and then he was expelled from the spiritual world.

It was fake; it had to be. How could a mere junior possibly surpass him, and even reach a height that countless predecessors could only look up to?

Eight stages, that meant leaving his mark in history.

The old man felt exceptionally hurt, and there was no love left in this entire world for him.

After another while, Wu Zixu’s eyes snapped open. Withdrawing his hand, he then stood up.

“Wu Zixu!”

“Wu Zixu!”

“Wu Zixu!”

His supporters were all cheering for him, extremely overcome with excitement.

Previously, they had all wilted in dejection. Who would have thought that there would be such an unexpected turn of events? As it turned out, it was Wu Zixu that was truly awesome here. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Their insight was really too good to have supported him earlier, so they naturally had to cheer loudly for once. This actually was also support for themselves.

Wu Zixu was slightly confused.

He knew that he had a lot of prestige, and was acclaimed as the top alchemist in the younger generation—or at least one of them. After all, there were still quite a large number of prodigies in this world, and the Western Celestial Realm was too big, so it was impossible that all the prodigies would gather here.

‘But do you guys have to be so crazy? I have only passed the seventh stage. Hehe, though this is indeed still very impressive.’

“Congratulations, Young Master Wu, on having broken records, and becoming the strongest prodigy in an entire epoch!”

“Young Master Wu, I want to follow you!”

“I, too, wish to follow you!”

Someone expressed their congratulations to Wu Zixu, while some expressed their loyalty. If they were able to follow such a master, they would also feel pride from their association.

What was going on here?

Wu Zixu only felt baffled. When he had entered a spiritual state, his physical body was only an empty shell that could not hear or see. Thus, he had completely no idea about what had previously happened.

The strongest prodigy in an epoch?

Though he secretly thought that as well, how could this kind of thing be spoken out in public without shame? After all, he had not obtained an accomplishment that would garner the respect of others yet. How could he be qualified for the name of “strongest prodigy”?

Pa, pa, pa.?That apprentice from Ancient Alchemy Tower raced over again, an ingratiating expression on his face as well, and it was even more pronounced than before.

It could not be helped. Wu Zixu was too young.

To similarly be a Three-Star Alchemist, and having the standard of Fourth Refinement, it was naturally the one who had reached this level first that had more potential. In fact, he might even become a Five-Star Alchemist in the future.

How could this kind of prodigy be offended? He definitely had to garner his favor as much as possible.

“Congratulations, Young Master Wu!” This apprentice was smiling from ear to ear. “Let me verify your results.”

“En.” Wu Zixu acted like how Grandmaster Riyang had acted, his face bearing a reserved smile.

Pa, pa, pa.?Grandmaster Riyang walked over, and said, “Really, the new waves push the old waves[1]. In front of you, I have no choice but to admit that I am old now.”

With this interruption from him, that apprentice was immediately silenced, and did not dare interrupt.

Wu Zixu was even more confused now. Though he had indeed not taken Alchemist Riyang to heart, and thought that the latter had long since become a thing of the past, and could only become a stepping stone for him to surpass, he did not think that he had done exceptionally well, either, right?

‘Strange, are you purposely here to mock me?’

Still, this expression on Alchemist Riyang’s face did not seem to be one of mockery. He looked crestfallen and dispirited, as if he had been struck a blow to his pride.

Could it be that the old geezer had only passed six stages?

Such trash, too weak.

An expression of disdain appeared on Wu Zixu’s face, and he felt an arrogance that stemmed from feeling embarrassed by their association.

Seeing as Wu Zixu was temporarily not speaking, that apprentice finally found a chance, and announced, “Young Master Wu, your result is seven stages, spending a time of two days and 22 hours.”

Pu!

Abruptly, everyone spluttered. Even Alchemist Riyang was dumbfounded. F***, what was going on here?

It was not Wu Zixu, nor was it Alchemist Riyang. Then who was it?

A dark horse, definitely an extremely pureblooded great dark horse!

“Who exactly is it?”

“I’m dying from curiosity!”

“Reveal the truth quickly!”

“That’s right. Eight stages have already been passed, so why is he still not standing up?”

Hearing the complaints and exclamations of shock from the masses, Wu Zixu felt a bout of dizziness come over him, and almost passed out.

What? What? There was actually someone who managed to pass the eighth stage?

No wonder Alchemist Riyang congratulated him. As it turned out, the former had thought that it was Wu Zixu who had passed the eighth stage.

In all honesty, if he had been able to pass the eighth stage, he would definitely have been so arrogant now that his tail would be sticking up into the skies.

Was there really a person that could pass the eighth stage?

It was not that he had not attempted it, but he had failed very quickly, which also made him feel that the eighth stage was practically not something that could be passed by a human! At least, he couldn’t do so at the moment. Perhaps after he had attained Four Stars, he could possibly accomplish it.

Who, who exactly was it?

At this moment, Ling Han’s body trembled lightly, and he opened his eyes slowly.
