Chapter 1859: The invincible Qingfeng

It was said that after Ling Han left, Sun Dong and Liu Yu slowly woke up from the pain.

The moment they woke up, they discovered their a*ses were in agonizing pain. Then, the moment they turned around, they could see how the other looked, and then they could imagine how they themselves looked. Both their faces turned green.

All around them, there were also others watching the show.

Those who were watching the excitement naturally would not think it a big deal. The spectators conversed spiritedly, and their words made Sun Dong and Liu Yu want nothing more than for a crack which they could crawl into to appear. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The two of them hurriedly plucked out the bamboo poles and fled. After running some distance, only then did they enter into their Spatial God Tool. They took out new clothes which they put on, and carelessly used some medicine to temporarily treat their injury.

Very quickly, the two of them reappeared again.

Liu Yu’s expression naturally was even uglier. He had already had his a*s pierced twice. If this matter spread back to Blue Eternity City, how would he be able to face others in the future?

Sun Dong was not much better. He gripped his fists tightly, his expression livid.

Since childhood, he had never experienced such a great humiliation.

However, he had only had a single exchange with Ling Han, and he already understood that he was far from being a match for Ling Han. In fact, he was not able to withstand the power of a single look from the latter.

“Humph, just because you are a king tier, you think you can bully me?” Sun Dong forced out through gritted teeth. This was a Four-Star City, and there was definitely not just one king tier here!

As he saw it, Ling Han should be the Holy Son of some great Three-Star sect, and had deliberately disguised himself as a weakling to prey on the strong.

“However, this time, you have definitely met your match,” Sun Dong muttered coldly, his eyes sharp and cold. “It is true that I am no match for you, but I am the follower of Holy Son Lu. You bullied me to this extent, Lord Holy Son will definitely seek revenge on my behalf!”

“Young Master Dong!” Liu Yu approached. He also hated Ling Han very much, and now they were united against a common enemy.

“Scram!” Sun Dong shot a kick over. If it were not for this guy, how could he have experienced the tragedy that befell his a*s?

With a flutter of his sleeve, he turned and left. He was determined to avenge this deep hatred!

“Young Master Dong! Young Master Dong!” Liu Yu chased for a few steps, but was left farther and farther behind. Thus, he could only stop. However, he was not too disappointed. That was because he was already sure that Sun Dong would definitely seek revenge.

Since that was the case, he only had to take some notice, and watch the show when the time came.

Sun Dong ran all the way, and arrived at the location of the Transfer Formation. After showing a unique transfer pass, he directly went to the fourth level.

The Sun Clan was a three-star force. Their main branch was at the fourth level. As he was the direct heir of the Sun Clan, going to the fourth level was naturally just a matter of course for him.

Going by his routine path, he soon arrived at the abode of Lu Xianming.

This was a massive mountain manor, with mountains on one side and water on the other. Sun Dong did not have the heart to admire the beautiful scenery on his way there. He was one of Lu Xianming’s trusted aides, and did not even have to wait to be announced, but directly arrived in the living room.

When he arrived here, he lightened his steps, and his expression also became more serious.

He stretched his head over and looked, and saw that Lu Xianming was presently drinking tea with guests. There were a total of three guests, two male and one female. The only woman was indescribably beautiful, and had a kind of noble bearing such that others could only dare to stare at her from a distance.

The two men each had an aggressive charm, and could be considered as dragons among men.

These were definitely the Holy Sons and Holy Daughter of great sects because they were worthy of being received personally by Lu Xianming. Even the heirs of three-star forces or four-star forces could not possibly achieve this—alchemists were in a loftier position compared to others.

Only the heirs of Celestial King Tier-level sects would require Lu Xianming to personally receive them. To say nothing of the fact that he was presently only a Holy Son, even if he became the chairperson in the future, he would still have to maintain an appropriate level of respect for Celestial King Tier-level forces.

Of course, Celestial King Tier-level forces would also not offend an alchemist for no reason. It was only a win-win situation if they had mutual respect.

Sun Dong carefully and quietly walked in. He could be arrogant and wilful in the first level, but here, he had to present a demeanor of absolute respect. However, after he had taken a few steps, he shockingly discovered that there was actually a fourth guest.

He was first taken aback, and then was astonished.

With his strength, he actually discovered that there was a fifth person in the hall after so long had passed?

At this moment, that fourth guest seemed to have guessed his thoughts, and turned his head slightly to look at him. Immediately, Sun Dong’s mind was completely blank.

“Sun Dong! Sun Dong!” A voice seemed to be heard from a very far distance away. After a while, Sun Dong suddenly came back to his senses, and realized that it was Lu Xianming that was calling him. He involuntarily experienced a cold shiver, and felt a coldness rise up from the very soles of his feet, spreading out throughout his whole body.

If that person just now had made a move on him, he would definitely have been dead before he even knew it.

Too strong; only one look, and he had completely lost all battle prowess.

This made him recall Ling Han—he had also been like this. One look, and he had been able to win without even fighting. If this lord was willing to step out for him, then even if it would not be a sure victory over Ling Han, he would be able to match him at least.

“Holy Son!” Sun Dong hurriedly paid his greetings respectfully.

“What is it?” Lu Xianming frowned slightly. At present, he was entertaining important guests, yet Sun Dong was just standing there like an idiot, which made him feel very embarrassed.

Sun Dong gritted his teeth, and explained what had previously happened.

From his mouth, Lu Xianming naturally became a supremely arrogant character that did not give Lu Xianming any face at all, causing him to suffer inhuman torture.

“Holy Son, you have to give justice for my a*s!” He fell onto the ground, sobbing pathetically.

Lu Xianming’s face involuntarily turned dark. ‘What do you mean by giving justice for your a*s? Don’t speak in such an ambiguous way.’

Those who were not in the know would think that there was something suspicious between the two of them.

Yet that fifth person that had been overlooked laughed loudly, and said, “Is he really that strong? I would like to take a look for myself.”

Lu Xianming smiled, and then replied, “If Brother Qingfeng moves, who will be able to block you within the Severing Mundane Tier?”

These words caused the other three guests to show expressions of displeasure.

Who were they?

Any one of them was a Holy Son or Holy Daughter of a great Celestial King Tier-level sect, and had surpassed king tier-level, and reached the level of emperor tier. Yet Lu Xianming actually said that the other party had no one that could match him in the Severing Mundane Tier; what position was he putting them in?

“Heh, we’ve conversed for so long, but we have not asked the name of this guest?” A Holy Son directed the question at “Brother Qingfeng”. His name was Bao Cheng.

Lu Xianming laughed loudly, and interrupted, “It’s all my fault. I haven’t managed to introduce him yet. My three guests, Brother Qingfeng’s surname is Zhao, and he is one of the four Heavenly Kings under Yan Xianlu, Holy Son Yan. He is known as Invincible Qingfeng.”

Yan Xianlu!

The three Holy Sons and Holy Daughter simultaneously showed an expression of shock, and felt a fear that rose up from deep within their hearts.

They were all Holy Sons and a Holy Daughter, but they didn’t even have the right to carry Yan Xianlu’s shoes.

There were Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier, and every single step forward was as difficult as ascending the heavens. Not only was the hierarchy among Celestial Kings strict, even the descendants that they had respectively nurtured adhered to a strict hierarchy.

These three Holy Sons and Holy Daughter all belonged to a First Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force, but as for Yan Xianlu? Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force!

They had heard too much about Yan Xianlu, and a great many of his tales could even become legends.

Just take, for example, Yan Xianlu’s origins. He had been discovered by the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King on the Celestial Path, and thus the latter had carried him back to the Eternal Prosperity Sect. He became the personal disciple of Eternal Prosperity Celestial King, and was given the name of Xianlu[1].

And what was the Celestial Path?

If one wanted to transcend Ascending Origin Tier, and become a Celestial King, he would have to walk on the Celestial Path!

And Yan Xianlu was actually on the Celestial Path right from birth; just how astonishing was that?

This was a true prodigy. As he developed and grew, he had the good reputation of being invincible. Any prodigy would have to lower his head in front of him, and even king tiers would have to kneel. He was strong enough to drive others to despair.

However, they indeed admired Yan Xianlu very much, but to say that even one of his subordinates could actually be invincible in the Severing Mundane Tier... Wasn’t that a joke?
