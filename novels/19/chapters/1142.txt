Chapter 1143: Secret of the Nine Snake Tribe

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Empress Luan Xing naturally knew that Ling Han had a Spatial God Tool. If this hadn’t been the case, she would have pushed him over and done him already.

Her beautiful face involuntarily flushed red when she thought of this.

She couldn’t unleash all of her power in this current body, and thus she couldn’t maintain the air of Primal Chaos around her face. Ling Han could clearly see her expression. This left him astonished. ‘This empress actually has a coy side to her?

‘Has the sun risen from the west?’

Empress Luan Xing became a little angry, and said, “What are staring at me for?”

Ling Han chuckled in reply. It was truly impossible for him to fear this empress anymore.

“Come!” He swept the empress up in his divine sense and brought her into the Black Tower.

“How is this possible?!” Empress Luan Xing cried in surprise. The space inside this Spatial God Tool was far too vast.

“There are heaps of impossible things waiting for you!” Ling Han said smugly. Being able to astonish this empress so much made him feel extremely accomplished.

Empress Luan Xing felt more and more astonished as she walked through the land.

This was because there were all kinds of Godly medicine growing here. They were all thriving and brimming with vitality, and their ages were also extremely high.

She found this to be incredible. Ling Han had clearly only just arrived after opening the sky, so how could he have planted so many Godly medicines?

He didn’t have enough time!

“Come!” Ling Han grabbed the empress’ slender hand as he ran forward.

Empress Luan Xing instantly felt annoyed. ‘Has he become addicted to grabbing my hand?’

She tugged her arm and tried to break free from his grip, yet she realized that her strength was surprisingly no match for Ling Han’s. She couldn’t help but feel shocked.

Her cultivation level was clearly unchanged, so why couldn’t she break free from a mere Mountain River Tier cultivator? How was this possible?

“You...” She was so stunned that she could barely speak.

“Welcome to my world!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Here, I’m the one and only king!”

“Humph!” Small Tower appeared and humphed in displeasure.

Ling Han grimaced. He sighed, and said, “Of course, there’s also the Tool Spirit of this God Tool. It never treats me—its owner—seriously.”

“Well, I’m so sorry about that,” Small Tower said sarcastically.

Empress Luan Xing was transfixed with astonishment. ‘What kind of God Tool is this? How is it so impressive? It can even elevate Ling Han’s power to a level far above mine! Also, why is this Tool Spirit so human? It doesn’t seem like a Tool Spirit at all! Shouldn’t they be emotionless and rigidly following some sort of regulation?’

They quickly arrived before the Reincarnation Tree.

“Hmm?” Notionless Saint was the first person to notice them. A puzzled expression appeared on his face as he saw Empress Luan Xing, and he said, “You remind me of the girl from before. However, you’re clearly a different person. Strange!”

Can Ye and the three others all greeted him respectfully, and said, “Young Master Han!”

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “There’s nothing for you guys to worry about. Keep cultivating and strive to reach the Immortal level as soon as possible.”

“Understood!” The four people returned to their spots under the Reincarnation Tree and continued to cultivate.

Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing stared at the Reincarnation Tree, and it was as if she recognized this divine tree. After a while, she shouted in surprise, “This is the Reincarnation Tree!”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “You’re truly knowledgeable! You even managed to recognize the Reincarnation Tree!”

Empress Luan Xing pondered for a moment before saying, “You bought a seed of a Reincarnation Tree once. Could this be it?”

“Spot on!” Ling Han raised his thumb as he praised the empress. No praise would be too much praise for this kind of stunning beauty.

Empress Luan Xing naturally wouldn’t pay too much attention to his deliberate praises. Instead, she mulled over how this was possible, and said, “It’s only been a little over two years since you arrived in the Immortal Realm. Regardless of what you did, it would have been impossible for you to obtain so much Godly medicine, to say nothing of this Reincarnation Tree. That being the case, there’s only one possibility left...”

Her eyes lit up, and she said, “You’re able to accelerate the growth of Godly medicine!”

“Hehe!” Ling Han chuckled, and said, “How is it? Do you want to cultivate here? This is the Reincarnation Tree, so one day’s worth of cultivation is equivalent to one year’s worth!”

Empress Luan Xing was extremely tempted by this offer. Accumulating Origin Power was an easy task to an elite like her. She could complete this process in a few thousand years. However, comprehending the great dao was different. This step could take millions or even tens of millions of years.

The fact that this galaxy only had one Eternal River Tier elite was proof of just how difficult this step was.

Empress Luan Xing stared at Ling Han, and asked, “What conditions are there?”

This favor... No, this had already transcended the level of a mere favor. If she exposed the secret of Ling Han owning a Reincarnation Tree, he would definitely be hunted by all of the Saints in the world.

‘You don’t want me to marry down, do you?’

Ling Han’s expression became serious, and he said, “I already said just then. I’ll tell you my biggest secret, and in exchange, you also need to tell me your secret.”

Empress Luan Xing humphed upon hearing this. ‘Do you think this is child’s play? You’ll tell me one secret and then I’ll tell you one?’

However, she had to admit that Ling Han trusted her a great deal. After all, he had even revealed the secret of his Reincarnation Tree to her. She couldn’t help but feel slightly touched.

‘Yes, only slightly,’ she stressed to herself.

“What do you want to know?” the empress asked haughtily.

“What’s your relationship with this body?” Ling Han asked. This was clearly Hu Feiyun’s body, yet she had suddenly become Empress Luan Xing. Her power had risen along with this transformation, though it still hadn’t reached the same height as Empress Luan Xing’s original body. Even so, it had still reached the Heavenly Body Tier.

“Haha, I know!” Notionless Saint suddenly shouted. He wasn’t content with being left aside.

“Senior knows?” Ling Han said in surprise.

“Of course!” Notionless Saint replied smugly. “It’s simple: she’s from the Nine Snake Tribe!”

Ling Han was completely baffled. ‘How does her tribe have anything to do with this?’

Empress Luan Xing decided to spill the beans upon hearing this. Otherwise, Notionless Saint would reveal her secret anyway. “The Nine Snake Tribe has a natural talent. That is, we’re able to maintain nine separate clones.”

Ling Han was dazed for a moment. Then, he suddenly came to his senses, and said, “This is one of your clones? Hang on a second... Nine Kings... The Nine Kings are your nine separate clones?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Correct!” Empress Luan Xing said with a nod.

Ling Han finally understood why Notionless Saint had said that Empress Luan Xing’s power should have reached nine stars, yet the power that she had displayed was far below this level. This was because the empress had distributed her power among her nine separate clones!

No wonder the Nine Kings held such lofty positions and received the unconditional support of the empress. The reason for this was simple—the Nine Kings were Empress Luan Xing!

Empress Luan Xing saw that Ling Han was still a little puzzled, so she continued, “I cultivated the Nine Deaths Heaven Art and formed nine separate bodies. When all of my clones reach the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier and return to my primary body, I’ll be able to reach the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier!”

Ling Han’s eyes widened in surprise, and he said, “In reality, you’re already able to attempt breaking through to the Eternal River Tier. However, you’ve held back this entire time just because you wanted to cultivate the Heavenly Body Tier to perfection?”

“What do you think?” Empress Luan Xing replied haughtily.

Ling Han remained silent. However, he couldn’t help but admire her in his mind.

‘As expected of the talented and bold empress. She’s gone to such great lengths and even formed nine clones just to cultivate to a state of perfection.’

“What if something untoward happens to one of your clones?”

“Then I’ll suffer an eternal dao wound and lose any chance of becoming the strongest.”
