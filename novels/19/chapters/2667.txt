“Husband, you are mistaken by thinking like this,” Li Sichan said. “All of us are particularly aware of your strength, but Ma Yuhai had no idea.”

Shui Yanyu nodded immediately. “That’s right! Although Ma Yuhai is not your match, from his point of view, he probably thought that you were equivalent to one at the peak of the Ninth Heaven.”

Bewitching Maiden Rou continued, “However, he likely surmised that if you met a monarch star or even a supreme monarch star at the peak of the Ninth Heaven, then you wouldn’t be his match.”

“So, Ma Yuhai must have engaged such an elite!” All the women reached the same conclusion.

Ling Han laughed. “Conventionally, my battle prowess indeed appears to be only at the late stage of the Ninth Heaven. However, with the eruption of power from either the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll or Five Elements Lightning Technique, I could take on even a supreme monarch star at the peak of the Ninth Heaven. Furthermore, I still have the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll—when it is activated, my physique is comparable to Divine Metal, so escaping definitely won’t be a problem.”

“You will be going for this appointment?” All the women looked at Ling Han; even the Empress stopped cultivating, and gazed at him in wonder.

Ling Han nodded. “I also want to take this opportunity to get rid of Ma Yuhai in order to prevent him from creating more trouble for me.”

“At the end of the day, he is a disciple of the martial academy, so if this leaks out…” Helian Xunxue said hesitantly.

The martial academy did not object to healthy competition among its disciples, and it wouldn’t even matter if one was to bully others. As long as the gap in cultivation level did not exceed two levels, then they could horse around however they wanted. However, the bottom line was that one absolutely couldn’t kill or maim another. The people here might become part of the main forces resisting Hysteria in the future, so how could they be allowed to get hurt in an internal strife?

Ling Han thought for a moment. “I will assess the situation. I will kill if I can, but if I can’t… then I will kill him in the future!”

Ling Han was certain that Ma Yuhai had invited him out of the martial academy with the intention of killing him. Facing such a person, Ling Han naturally wanted the other party dead.

Of course, it would be best to be able to kill him this time, but if he couldn’t, then he would just keep it in mind first; he absolutely wouldn’t be letting him go.

Three days later, Ling Han set off towards Great Fiery Mountain.

Great Fiery Mountain was located in the west of the martial academy, and the journey there would take about two hours. Of course, this was calculated based on the pace of Ling Han’s stroll. The average Celestial King would need to be running and still take more time than this. If they wanted to arrive on time for their appointments, they had to set off even earlier.

Ling Han strolled at a leisurely pace, stepping on the Regulations of Space, whereby a single step covered a boundless distance.

He appeared to be absent-minded, yet everything happening in his surroundings was actually under his supervision—even a tiny bit of movement couldn’t escape his vision.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han let out a low hum in surprise. The day was originally clear and sunny, yet it seemed to have turned into a dark night all of a sudden, and it was pitch black everywhere.

Not only had the environment darkened, but it seemed that divine sense had also been restricted, and could only be released up to a distance of no more than 50 km away. Any further than that, it was as if it had hit a dam, and would bounce back immediately.

Ling Han stopped in his tracks, and crossed his hands behind his back, neither in a hurry nor in a state of panic.

Pa, pa, pa, the sound of applause was heard, and a hunched old man came out, looking like he was not far from death, but Ling Han didn’t dare to underestimate him at all. He sensed that this old man was like an ancient vicious creature, with murderous aura rising sky-high, incomparably formidable.

“You can still be so calm in the face of sudden change. Truly, that is rarely seen in my lifetime,” the old man commented.

Ling Han smiled lightly. “Since I have the strength, why should I be nervous? Even if you have countless different moves, I can resolve it with a single punch.”

“Hahaha, well said!” The old man laughed, and then coughed violently. “However, little guy, do you think your strength is enough?”

“It ought to fall short slightly in comparison to yours, but everyone has their own ultimate technique, and once the ultimate technique is launched, then it is difficult to say who is stronger.” Ling Han smiled. “Old sir, how should I address you?”

“Qin Shuang.” The old man stared at Ling Han, and his eyes gradually lit up as his oppressive power kept getting stronger.

“Ma Yuhai asked you to take action?” Ling Han asked another question—he was idle anyway.

“Yes, for a Heavenly Venerate Pill, which I’m very satisfied with.” Qin Shuang didn’t bother concealing the fact. “Little guy, are you committing suicide, or do you want me to take action?”

“Oh, why should I commit suicide without reason?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Because if I am to take action, then you will die… very miserably!” Qin Shuang said menacingly, his gaze glinting coldly, with spasmodic chills and full of murderous aura.

Ling Han wasn’t bothered. “As I have said just now, I may not be as strong as you, but once we fight and an ultimate technique is launched, then it is hard to say who is stronger.”

“Looks like you are determined to have me take action!” Qin Shuang stood up and moved towards Ling Han. His hand stretched out, and was transformed into a huge black palm, exuding a cold silver radiance as multiple seals appeared one after another, and emitting an overwhelmingly powerful oppressive force.

This was an overlord of the Ninth Heaven!

Ling Han intended to test the opponent’s strength, so he mustered up his power, and delivered it in a punch to counter the attack.

Boom!

In the midst of a huge explosion, Ling Han burst out like a cannonball. Peng, peng, peng! He broke through several mountain peaks in a row. He ultimately came to a stop, not because it was the end of the path, but rather it was due to him hitting an incomparably sturdy invisible wall, which blocked him.

“This is the Little Tianyuan Great Captive Formation. As long as one is a Celestial King, it is impossible to leave if one is already trapped in it.” Qin Shuang walked over from the distance step by step; he had the absolute upper hand in this exchange. “Only this core stone in my hand can unlock the great formation, so you can forget about escaping.

“By the way, this formation has isolated space, and is a small world by itself. It is impossible for the people outside to find out that a battle is going on here,” Qin Shuang said slowly with a cruel expression on his face, just like a cat toying with a mouse.

A long, long time ago, he had been the most brutal murderer. Countless elites and prodigies had died by his hands. Although he had behaved himself for the past few trillion years, his true nature remained unchanged, and now his bloodlust was aroused. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

According to the information that Qin Shuang had obtained, this person by the name of Ling Han was extremely freakish, with an Evolution Index of 12, yet his cultivation level was only at the Seventh Heaven. He defeated Ma Yuhai with a single blow through the eruption of some kind of secret technique. Although Qin Shuang was a little curious, he didn’t take it to heart.

Because he was a Monarch Star at the peak of Ninth Heaven after all!

Ling Han drew out Divine Demon Sword. The opponent’s strength was indeed too big, so there was no need to use his own shortcomings to counter the strengths of his opponent.

“Celestial Tool!” Qin Shuang frowned, but thereafter he immediately relaxed as he also possessed a Celestial Tool.

He also took out his own Celestial Tool, which was a saw blade. One could still see specks of blood on it, and it was extremely offensive to the eyes—some stains were as deeply cold as ice, some were like raging flames, and some were like flashing thunder.

This was due to him having killed too many powerful Celestial Kings, so the inextinguishable blood essence of these Celestial Kings had coagulated on his Celestial Tool.

“Die!” Qin Shuang moved forward again to attack; he was already in front of Ling Han in a single step, and slashed at him with his sword.

Terrible murderous aura was flaring up; wielding a sword in hand, Qin Shuang seemed to have changed into a different person. With the fluttering of his gray hair, there wasn’t any trace of old age at all.

Ling Han brandished his sword to counter the attack.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

As the Celestial Tools clashed, they raised a boundless storm. Under such overwhelming murderous aura, the Regulations of the surrounding area were all being cut off and smashed.

Qin Shuang laughed. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, after all, and his ability to control the Regulations superseded that of Ling Han. He stretched out his hand to grab, and all Regulations close and afar were immediately plucked out by him, with this move directly causing Ling Han to be unable to utilize any Regulations.
