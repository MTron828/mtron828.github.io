Chapter 2034: Story

“My name is Guo Ming,” the man said, starting to recount his story.

“I was born into an ordinary family, but my cultivation talent was fairly decent. Thus, I joined the Star Moon Sect to cultivate.

“In a chance of fate, I met a person. She was Liu Xueyan, my current wife.

“Xueyan was the granddaughter of the third elder of the Star Moon Sect, so her status was far superior to that of me, a measly outer disciple. Initially, I thought that I didn’t stand a chance with Xueyan. However, who can predict fate?

“Yet, when Xueyan and I fell in love, we were immediately faced with strong opposition.

“Not only did the third elder oppose us, but the seventh elder also opposed us.

“The third elder wanted to win the support of the seventh elder, so he desired for both of their descendents to join together in marriage. The seventh elder had a great-grandson called Ruan Dongxiang, and he already had feelings for Xueyan to begin with. With the support of his elders, he was naturally able to linger around Xueyan all the time.

“Xueyan pushed back against the third elder’s proposal of arranged marriage several times, yet her complaints were ignored each time. At the same time, she naturally remained cold and indifferent to Ruan Dongxiang.

“This caused Ruan Dongxiang to greatly detest me, so he used his ‘Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike’ to severely wound me. He wanted me to die in great agony.

“When Xueyan learned of this, she immediately took me with her to leave the Star Moon Sect.

“In order to avoid capture, we carefully concealed our tracks along the way. However, upon reaching this place, my wounds had already deteriorated to an uncontrollable state. We had no choice but to stop.

“Upon learning that there was a skilled alchemist here, Xueyan went over to work as a maid. After toiling away for two years, she finally managed to sneak into the alchemy room to steal the Undying Pills for me.

“This was all because of me!

“Xueyan is innocent! Do whatever you want, but target me instead!

“Wuuu, so pitiful!” someone said through sobs. They looked over, only to see tears streaming down Fu Yue’s face.

This… was a fairly exaggerated reaction.

Ling Han and the others exchanged a glance. They couldn’t help but think that this person was fairly sentimental and easily moved. Just then, he had still wanted to slice open this man’s stomach to retrieve the Undying Pill. Now, however, he was sobbing uncontrollably after hearing Guo Ming’s tragic story.

“Oi, oi, oi, your reaction is far too exaggerated, no?” Ling Han said as he patted Fu Yue’s shoulder.

“Wu… Aren’t you moved?” Fu Yue asked through sobs.

“A little bit. However, not to the same extent as you,” Ling Han said. He couldn’t help but shiver. Had this person reincarnated into the wrong body? How was he so sentimental and emotional? He should have reincarnated as a woman.

At the very least, others most likely wouldn’t find it weird if a woman were moved to tears.

“Wuu, so pitiful! So pitiful!” Fu Yue sobbed. He completely ignored Ling Han and the others.

Even Guo Ming was rendered speechless. Even though he was the protagonist of the story, and even though he would also feel pained at times, how could a man shed tears so easily? How could they be reduced to such a state? To say nothing else, even Xueyan hadn’t cried so miserably before.

“Oi, how long are you going to embarrass yourself for?” Ling Han asked with a sigh.

“Don’t disturb me. Let me cry for a bit longer.”

Hu Niu immediately lost her patience.

Pa!

With a kick, Fu Yue was instantly sent flying, smashing a hole into the mud and straw house. He then transformed into a small black dot that vanished into the distance.

‘Poor child.’

“Brother Ming!” a female voice exclaimed in worry. A woman immediately rushed into the house.

She was none other than Liu Xueyan, the “weak woman” that Ling Han and the others had encountered before.

Upon seeing the people in the room, all of whom she had encountered before, the color immediately drained from Liu Xueyan’s face.

They had been exposed? Their victims were here to settle the debt now?

“This has nothing to do with Brother Ming. It was all my doing! Whatever punishment you have in mind, target me!” she shouted.

“No, it was all because of me! Punish me!” Guo Ming hurriedly exclaimed.

“It was me!”

“No, it was me!”

The two of them fought to take responsibility for the crime. This was truly a moving scene.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head and say, “Are you two stupid? You still want to shoulder the responsibility alone? We’re naturally going to capture both of you.”

“No, you can’t do that!” Guo Ming and Liu Xueyan exclaimed. They wore terrified expressions as they furiously shook their heads.

“Xueyan, let’s become husband and wife again in our next life.”

“Alright, Brother Ming!”

The lovers exchanged a glance before suddenly slapping at their own temples. They were going to shatter their own divine senses to commit suicide.

Ling Han immediately reached over.

Weng!

A powerful force surged forth, forcefully stopping the two peoples’ movements.

“Say, are you two a bit too impulsive?” he said with a sigh. “I never said that I would capture you.”

‘That’s right, huh?’

Guo Ming and Liu Xueyan exchanged a glance, and they could both see the lingering fear in each other’s eyes. They had almost committed suicide for love.

Ling Han was rendered speechless. What in the world were they feeling relieved about? If he hadn’t interfered, they would have already died!

Why did he always come across such people?

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “This poisonous wound… I reckon I can treat it.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“For real?” Guo Ming and Liu Xueyan exclaimed. They could barely believe what they were hearing.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “That Ruan Dongxiang was most likely at the Dividing Soul Tier, am I correct? Was he at the Heaven Soul or Earth Soul?”

“Earth Soul!” Liu Xueyan immediately replied. She instantly felt more confident in Ling Han’s abilities.

If Ruan Dongxiang had been at the Immortal Palace Tier, Ling Han would have been powerless to help. However, since he was at the same major tier as Ling Han, Ling Han could still use his Source Power of Wood to help. This Source Power possessed the most powerful vitality, so in theory, it could treat all kinds of wounds.

There were many people who needed help in this world, and Ling Han wasn’t trying to be a savior, either. He wouldn’t stick his nose into everyone’s business. However, since he had come across this situation, he was naturally willing to do his part to help.

“Wuuu, so pitiful! We definitely have to help them!” Fu Yue said as he returned. His eyes were already puffy from crying.

This person was beyond saving.

“You guys go outside first. I need to channel some cultivation technique to treat him,” Ling Han said.

“Yes, yes!” Liu Xueyan hurriedly replied with a nod. If Ling Han harbored evil intentions, there was absolutely no need for him to go to so much trouble. He could have directly attacked them. After all, neither of them was a match for Ling Han.

“You go outside as well!” Ling Han said to Fu Yue.

“Hah? I also need to go outside?” Fu Yue asked in a daze.

“Go out, go out!” Hu Niu said. She walked over and picked Fu Yue up before striding out.

Ling Han was naturally shooing everyone away to keep the secret of his Black Tower.

After everyone left, Ling Han knocked Guo Ming unconscious with a palm strike before drawing him into the Black Tower. The power of time flowed, and the Black Tower started to experience a time scale 1000 times faster than the outside world.

Ling Han started to treat Guo Ming, activating his Source Power of Wood and funneling it into his body. He started to eliminate the poison bit by bit.

If Ling Han fought with Ruan Dongxiang, he could most likely dispose of him in a few hundred exchanges. However, eliminating the poison that the man had left in Guo Ming’s body was a much more difficult task.

In simple terms, destruction was much easier than construction. Not to mention, this was a case of large-scale construction after large-scale destruction.

This could only be resolved with effort and time. Moreover, this was only because Ling Han was practicing the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and possessed extraordinary comprehension of life and death that far surpassed that of ordinary Dividing Soul Tier cultivators. Otherwise, most cultivators only knew how to fight and kill. As for healing and saving?

Impossible!

Time flew, and in the blink of an eye, three years had already passed in the Black Tower. Only at this time did Ling Han finally retract his hand. He breathed a long sigh of relief.

He had already eliminated the poison in Guo Ming’s body.

A smile spread across his face. During this process, he gained an even deeper understanding of how to channel the Source Power of Wood.

Not only had he saved someone, but he had even received some benefits himself. Sure enough, the heavens wouldn’t treat good people unfairly.
