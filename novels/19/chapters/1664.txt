Chapter 1665: Hand over the Celestial medicine!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was a giant that looked human, yet had two pairs of eyes, with one pair slightly above and the other slightly below, yet they were practically overlapping each other.

His skin was not dark at all. In truth, it was golden, like metal, but there were multiple black patterns on his golden skin, and any single one of them seemed capable of suppressing all the heavens.

That endless black aura was emanating precisely from his body, and turned into that surging great river, and there was still blood flowing out of his body. This became the essence substance within the great river.

The source of cultivation of this Mystery Realm was actually a corpse!Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This was too shocking. Merely drinking the river’s waters, having contact with a slight bit of the martial intent of this giant, had led to the formation of a completely new cultivation system.

And in this place, just how many years had it existed?

Where there were official records, they had reached as far back as hundreds of billions of years!

At least 100 billion years, but there was still blood flowing from this giant. Judging by the look of things, it seemed as if there would be no difficulty for it to continue flowing for another 100 billion years.

Next, it was Xiao Gu running back, which did not have any meaning.

Everyone was speechless, and even Pang Zhen was stunned. He had completely not thought that such an astonishing thing would appear here.

He had to report this to the clan; perhaps a Celestial King had died here.

The cultivation technique of a Celestial King!

His eyes immediately widened. If they could obtain a Celestial King cultivation technique, the Pang Clan would definitely skyrocket from a two star force to three stars, four stars, or even until five stars, and become a Celestial King-level force.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Xiao Gu, can you take that medicine back?” He pointed at the Natural Psychic Fruit.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu did not say another word, and immediately broke into a run. It dug out the Natural Psychic Fruit along with a large portion of dirt, and then ran back to Ling Han’s side, handing him the Celestial medicine as if it was presenting him a treasure.

Everyone saw this, and almost called out “idiot”.

That was Celestial medicine!

Celestial medicine!

‘You f****** actually gave it to someone else? Are you foolish to the extreme, not knowing the value of a Celestial medicine, or are you so generous?

‘Rich guy, let’s be friends too.’

“Hand over the Celestial medicine!” Pang Zhen suddenly declared, his eyes focused on Ling Han.

Once he exited this Mystery Realm, he would return to the Celestial Realm and report this matter to the elders of the clan, but before that, he definitely had to get hold of this Celestial medicine.

...If he waited until the great elites of the clan entered into the Ancient Realm, then even if the Natural Psychic Fruit had not been consumed by Ling Han, it would not fall into his hands, either. It would definitely be taken by the great elites of the clan.

What if they could use this to break through to the Ascending Origin Tier?

No matter how he saw it, it would not be he that would lay hands on it.

But it was a different case now. He only had to obtain this Celestial medicine, then kill everyone else to prevent them from leaking out the truth, and who would know that he had obtained a Celestial medicine? To say the least, even if he did not kill everyone, and only consumed the Celestial medicine, the clan would only be able to accept it tacitly and earnestly nurture him.

Thus, he immediately became hostile.

“That’s right, hand it over, it’s mine!” The large black dog jumped up to join in the excitement.

“You should give it to me.” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was unwilling to take a step back, either.

With this man and dog interrupting, it instantly decreased the threatening effect of Pang Zhen’s words sharply, making it seem as if he was joking.

Pang Zhen couldn’t help but humph coldly, and pressed out a hand in the direction of the large black dog and the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire. “Both of you, shut up!”

The large black dog and the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire hurriedly dodged in a flash. They had just advanced into the Medium Saint Tier, and were not capable of resisting a peak stage Saint King yet, especially when this Saint King had simultaneously grasped the Regulations of two Realms, and had stronger battle prowess.

“Hand it over!” Pang Zhen shouted again, and began an offensive at Ling Han.

“You’ve gone too far!” The Blue Feather Saint King and the other elites made their moves. Previously, they had already stood on the same side as Ling Han, and now they would naturally support Ling Han fully as well.

“Just a bunch of ants, you really think that you all can be my equals?” Pang Zhen scoffed. Peng, peng, peng. He threw out a few punches, and forced the Blue Feather Saint King and the others to retreat. Even in a battle of one against nine, he had the upper hand.

It was not that he was more freakishly talented, but rather that the Regulations he had grasped were more complete, so he naturally had an advantage in terms of battle prowess.

The Blue Feather Saint King and the others were shocked. Though Pang Zhen had made a move before, he clearly had not used his full power. So his true strength was actually so impressive.

Pang Zhen took another step forwards, yet saw that supremely graceful Empress was standing in front of him, looking down on him in an incredibly proud manner, and spat out one word. “Scram!”

He humphed. Though the Empress was extremely beautiful, it was destined that he could not bring her back to the Celestial Realm, and could only play around with her here. Now that this thought had risen in his mind, he had lost his patience, and did not bother to use any courting skills on her—this was also due to Ling Han’s appearance, which allowed him to realize that his pursuit of her could not possibly be successful.

He could take this beauty for his own, and enjoy her as much as possible before he broke through to the Severing Mundane Tier. Otherwise, after he became a Severing Mundane Tier, he would not be able to so easily descend into the Ancient Realm anymore. Short of the divine essence of immortality, his lifespan would shorten not too long after, and he would no longer have any hope of reaching immortality in this lifetime.

“Luan Xing, you are not a match for me, stand aside!” he said calmly, his tone filled with incredibly powerful self-confidence.

“You are courting death!” The Empress moved. All her nine doppelgangers appeared, each using different celestial techniques. This was much more awesome than the Immovable Deity Metal Body Mystical Power. Ling Han could only have another four arms, at most, yet she had directly produced another nine bodies, which did not have the slightest difference from the main body.

How could a Celestial King technique not be awesome?

Boom, boom, boom. Various celestial techniques barraged Pang Zhen like a tsunami that was intent on submerging him.

Pang Zhen was stunned by the Empress’s power, but was completely unafraid of battling fiercely with the Empress. He was the big shot among Genesis Tier big shots, so he naturally would not be afraid of a mere Medium Saint.

But even with the advantage of two minor levels, he only had a slight advantage.

Firstly, this was because the Empress had cultivated a Celestial King technique, so her battle prowess far surpassed her peers’, and secondly, she had cultivated to the true pinnacle level in the Eternal River Tier, possessing a whole 10,000,000 stars, and this further increased her ability to overwhelm all her equals.

These two factors added together allowed her to fight Pang Zhen and not be defeated.

But it was only not being defeated.

However, this already caused the eyes of the Blue Feather Saint King and the others to pop out in shock. Previously, they’d only known that the Empress was very strong, capable of being their equal, but had completely not imagined that she had already surpassed them.

...It couldn’t be, right? They were unable to take a single strike from Pang Zhen, yet the Empress could stand firm against him, and was only at a slight disadvantage. How much clearer could this make things for them?

“You are indeed very strong, but definitely not my match!” Pang Zhen said coldly. After all, there was the advantage of two minor levels.

The Empress didn’t bother to reply. Her battle prowess was indeed slightly inferior, but don’t forget that her 10 bodies could distribute the attack power among themselves, and this was equivalent to a further increase of a single star of battle prowess.

She might not be able to win this battle, but it was not definite that she would lose, either.

“Wife, allow me,” Ling Han said with a smile. Whatever had to do with violence and force, just hand it over to him. The Empress only had to stay beautiful and proud.
