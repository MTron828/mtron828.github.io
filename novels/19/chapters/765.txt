Chapter 766: This Emperor Will Kill a Dragon

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xianyu Cheng assumed that such terrifying recovery power definitely needed an enormous price to pay, or else it would be too unreasonable.

But even with Ling Han’s intelligence and wisdom, he’d still spent ten thousand years to comprehend Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll’s first layer and attain the Diamond Body—if it didn’t have freakish recovery power, how could it be worth of requiring such a long comprehension time? How could it be worthy of Black Tower’s level?

He’d have no face to go see others.

“I said that I’ll kill you both today, so I definitely will!” Ling Han deployed the Earth Overturning Seal and the 10,000 Techniques Return to One, finding weak points with the Eye of Truth and adding power with the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven.

He already used three Mystical Powers, and though the 10,000 Techniques Return to One wasn’t one, its power was definitely no inferior to a Mystical Power before the divine level. A three meter long Sword Ray swept out, slashing towards Xianyu Cheng.

“Die! Die! Die!” Xianyu Cheng came crashing down with the true dragon’s shadow.

Peng!

With another great impact, Ling Han was sent flying again, still 3000 meters away and with shattered bones in multiple areas.

However, he revealed a smile, and said, “As expected, although you summoned the true dragon’s shadow, it’s not a real true dragon, after all, with only a shred of martial intent, or else it wouldn’t be so easy for me to recover. Besides... turning my body into lightning can dampen part of the impact.”

Theoretically speaking, after turning into lightning, all physical attacks could be ignored because he would be lightning that couldn’t be harmed by physical force. However, it would be different if martial intent was attached to the attack, and kings that formed Qi would have the qualifications to harm the body of lightning.

Thus, even if the true dragon’s shadow only had a shred of martial intent, it could still pose a threat to Ling Han’s body of lightning, but in addition to the defense of the Diamond Body, it wasn’t enough to kill Ling Han instantly.

Being unable to kill him instantly meant that Diamond Body’s recovery ability could come into effect.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “This is your ultimate move? Nothing impressive!”

Xianyu Cheng’s face twitched, and he intended to retort, but didn’t know what to say.

True dragon’s shadow possessed a shred of the Shattering Void Tier’s might, and ten thousand Ling Hans should be swept away by it theoretically, but now? Although Ling Han was heavily injured after taking each blow, his damned recovery was too fast.

It wasn’t that the true dragon’s shadow wasn’t impressive—it was the recovery power that was too freakish!

I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! I don’t believe that you can keep recovering!

Xianyu Cheng let out a battle cry just like a dragon’s cry, and attacked Ling Han violently with the true dragon’s shadow.

Ling Han had no intention of evading and simply attacked head on. The opponent was only in the Heaven Tier and Ling Han’s attacks were enough to pose a threat to the opponent. Moreover, the fiercer his counterattacks were, the earlier the opponent’s ultimate move would end.

The two firmly believed that the other’s ultimate move couldn’t continue forever, and launched their strongest attacks one after another, trying to make the other reach the limit first.

However, Xianyu Cheng really used his ultimate move, but Ling Han still had some things left up his sleeve.

At least, he still had Black Tower’s power boost which hadn’t been used, or else the battle prowess of the Shattering Void Tier was enough to crush the opponent.

Fight, fight, fight, a state of chaos and darkness.

Xianyu Cheng’s expression was becoming more and more unsightly. How come Ling Han’s recovery power wasn’t reduced the least bit? Impossible, even if Ling Han took a treasured medicine, the effects would definitely be worse and worse each time—even worldly treasures had limits.

What exactly was going on?

Contrarily, his ancestral blood had already been completely burned and would soon dry out—at least several years of recovery would be needed for it to be used again.

Ling Han saw the changes in his expression, and said with a smile, “Old man, at wits’ end?”

“Bullsh*t, a mere human, an ant...! You think I can’t kill you?” Xianyu Cheng obviously wouldn’t admit defeat, feigning contempt instead. He swung the dragon claws, but was already exhausted, so their power dropped drastically.

Ling Han’s battle prowess, however, wasn’t impaired. After he attained the Diamond Body, his recovery power reached a maddening degree—he still had ten drops of the Indestructible True Fluid unused. If Xianyu Cheng were to know it, he would probably lose all hope.

Fight, fight, fight... Xianyu Cheng’s battle prowess started to falter, and although Ling Han also greatly exhausted his Origin Power and physical power, don’t forget that he was still an alchemy emperor who could casually take all sorts of medicinal pills, so his condition was definitely better than Xianyu Cheng’s.

Xianyu Cheng finally beat a retreat. If he kept on fighting, he really might be killed here as well.

In the sky, the true dragon’s shadow behind him suddenly flickered rapidly a few times and disappeared.

His ancestral blood had been completely used, and time was necessary for it to recover.

“Hmph, I’ll let you live for now. Next time, when our family comes, it’ll be your day of doom!” Xianyu Cheng threw down a few words to maintain appearances and was about to take to his heels.

“Fourth Uncle!” Xianyu Dongming, however, was greatly shocked. You’re damn just going to leave me here?

This human was so ruthless... Would he want to eat stewed dragon meat!?

Ling Han sneered, and said, “I’ve already said that you’d die here today, where do you think you’re going?” He shifted his steps to intercept the other party; with the blessing of the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, his speed was even faster than Xianyu Cheng’s.

Being faster by a little was enough.

Xianyu Cheng discovered embarrassingly that he actually couldn’t get away. His expression turned harsh. You won’t let me go, then I’ll fight you to the death.

Ling Han brandished and struck with his sword. It was the Revere Life Sword, which was carved with an exceptional killing formation, and if one really were to be struck, even a ninth-tier rare metal physique would still be wounded.

Xianyu Cheng didn’t dare to fight desperately against the Revere Life Sword; as his fists moved, powerful winds were unleashed, which was still extremely terrifying and full of destructive power. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ling Han just trapped Xianyu Cheng, striking left and right with his sword to exhaust Xianyu Cheng’s power.

Xianyu Cheng was furious and shocked. In terms of battle prowess, Ling Han definitely wasn’t his opponent, with at least a gap of five stars. However, Ling Han was superior with the extreme speed of movement and having terrifying recovery power, which made him unable to leave and unable to exhaust Ling Han.

Could it be that he really would be reduced to a prisoner?

Xianyu Cheng mustered up courage—he was from north sea’s royal family, and if he were to seized by humans, would he still have face to see other people in the future?

... Until this moment, he’d never believed that Ling Han would dare to kill him and Xianyu Dongming. North sea’s royal family was too powerful, powerful to the point where sending any single elite of the Shattering Void Tier was enough to kill everything here completely, so Ling Han wouldn’t dare to murder them.

However, his battle prowess was getting weaker and weaker, and after three more days of fighting, he finally exhausted his power and was seized by Ling Han.

He truly wasn’t resigned to this defeat!

Xianyu Cheng clenched his teeth. If it weren’t for this guy’s terrifying recovery power, he would have killed him several hundred times, but now he was a captive, so how could he be resigned to this defeat?

“Escort him to the east gate, this emperor will kill them personally!” Ling Han said loudly, his voice bright and clear, ringing throughout the entire imperial city.

“Long live the emperor!”

The subjects were all frantic as all of them personally witnessed that His Majesty’s enemy turned into a true dragon! His Majesty could kill dragons, and what did this represent?

Great Ling Empire was invincible!

“You, you dare!” Xianyu Cheng was really scared now. This human really dared to kill him?

“What’s there not to dare?” Ling Han sneered and waved his hand, having people escort Xianyu Cheng and Xianyu Dongming to the east gate.
