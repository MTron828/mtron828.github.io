1331 Heavenly tribulation of Xie Donglai

Xie Donglai’s body became a blur as he raced into the distance.

He was brimming with excitement at this moment, and he couldn’t help but whoop in joy. In his eyes, the entire world was shining with a bright and radiant glow.

He was a genius. He had advanced to the Mountain River Tier in 100 or so years, and then to the Sun Moon Tier in 1000 or so years. However, he had been stuck at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier since 3000 years ago, unable to advance any further.

Although the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier was only a hair away from the Heavenly Body Tier, this hair-thin barrier had prevented heaven knew how many people from advancing.

In fact, it could be said that the gulf between the two cultivation levels was like heaven and earth.

Right now, however, he was finally going to advance to the Heavenly Body Tier.

He would soar into the sky with a single step. From this moment on, he wouldn’t be a mere cultivator anymore. Instead, he would be a legitimate elite!

Upon thinking of his brilliant might as a Heavenly Body Tier elite, and upon thinking of how he would casually crush his enemies under his feet, he couldn’t help but want to laugh out loud. His smile was so wide that it almost reached his ears.

‘Faceless, Ling Han, just you wait!’ he said in his mind.

He accelerated forward, yearning to face and overcome his heavenly tribulation as soon as possible. He couldn’t wait to become a Heavenly Body Tier elite. In fact, he was so excited that he didn’t even realize that he was being tailed by someone.

Ling Han had activated the Star Plucking Step. After fusing the power of lightning into it, his speed was astonishingly quick. Not to mention that Xie Donglai still hadn’t reached the Heavenly Body Tier yet, even if he had, his speed still wouldn’t necessarily be quicker than Ling Han’s.

After all, Ling Han’s power was almost bordering on the Heavenly Body Tier right now.

After an hour or so, Xie Donglai finally came to a stop, and started to face his heavenly tribulation.

In just half a day, he would advance to become a Heavenly Body Tier elite!

He stopped suppressing his cultivation. Dark clouds instantly gathered above him, heavenly tribulation descending at the same time. Meanwhile, his aura continued to rise, instantly reaching the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. It eventually reached a level between the Sun Moon Tier and the Heavenly Body Tier.

The longer he withstood the heavenly tribulation, the more his power would rise. This would continue until he truly reached the Heavenly Body Tier. Correspondingly, the might of heavenly tribulation would also increase with time. It wouldn’t reach the apex of its power right away.

Kuang!

The first bolt of lightning crashed down. Xie Donglai roared and unsheathed a Divine Sword, slashing it toward the bolt of lightning.

Ling Han suddenly revealed himself and charged toward Xie Donglai.

“Xie Donglai, it’s time for you to pay your old debts!” he roared.

With the cover of heavenly tribulation, even Eternal River Tier elites wouldn’t dare to extend their divine sense over. Otherwise, they might be accidentally swept into heavenly tribulation themselves. In any case, not everyone was capable of forcing their divine sense through heavenly tribulation. Even Saints weren’t capable of doing this.

Killing someone while they faced heavenly tribulation would truly be perfect—it would leave no trace of evidence at all. One wouldn’t be able to reconstruct the events, even if they possessed secret techniques of time.

“Ling Han!” Xie Donglai was both furious and delighted. He loathed Ling Han, yet he hadn’t expected that Ling Han would actually dare to charge into his heavenly tribulation. Wasn’t he seeking death? He laughed heartily, and said, “I haven’t gone looking for you yet, yet you’ve already charged here to your own death!”

“Xie Donglai, we’ve battled many times already. Since when have you ever enjoyed the upper hand?” Ling Han asked faintly. He was brimming with confidence.

‘This...!’

Xie Donglai couldn’t help but falter. He was rendered speechless. In the past, his cultivation level had been far above that of Ling Han. However, he couldn’t translate this into an advantage no matter what. In the end, he could only run back to the Xie Clan with his tail between his legs. He had almost been neglected, to the point where he would become an also-ran forever.

However, that was all because of Ling Han’s luck. If he weren’t receiving help from the Purple Moon Divine Maiden, then he was receiving help from Faceless or someone else. This had rendered his crushing advantage in power completely useless.

This time, however, he definitely wouldn’t allow history to repeat itself!

“Ling Han, I’m on the verge of advancing to the Heavenly Body Tier. Before me, you’re nothing but a mere ant!” He roared with laughter as he charged toward Ling Han. If he swept Ling Han into his heavenly tribulation, the brat would be severely wounded even if he weren’t killed.

However, he didn’t expect this to kill Ling Han with his heavenly tribulation. In any case, he didn’t hope to kill Ling Han with his heavenly tribulation, either. That would be far too unsatisfying. Only by killing Ling Han with his own two hands would he be able to vent the anger pent up in his mind.

He simply wanted to torture Ling Han by sweeping him into his heavenly tribulation. This would be a good way to collect some interest.

Ling Han was naturally unafraid, and he continued to charge at Xie Donglai.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow. By doing so, Ling Han had also interfered with Xie Donglai’s heavenly tribulation. Heaven and earth instantly noticed this, and another tribulation cloud formed above Ling Han.

Xie Donglai was sent flying, a look of pure shock and disbelief on his face. He couldn’t believe that the power of his strike was weaker than Ling Han’s.

‘How can this be?’

Although he hadn’t genuinely reached the Heavenly Body Tier yet, he should have still possessed the power to crush cultivators at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. So, how was his power inferior? Unless...

A possibility suddenly sprang into his mind. Fury and envy instantly clawed at his heart.

“Pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier! You actually reached the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier!” He was so jealous that he was almost about to go mad. He had spent 1000 years trying to reach the doorstep of the pinnacle level, yet he hadn’t been able to sense it at all. Afterward, it was the comprehensive loss to Faceless that had steeled his determination to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier as soon as possible. He was yearning to exact revenge.

However, who would have thought that Ling Han would easily reach the cultivation level that he could only dream of?

Only a few years had passed!

“So what if you’ve reached the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier? Once I reach the Heavenly Body Tier, killing you will be as easy as killing an ant!” Xie Donglai was seething with anger. However, what he said was also true. He was a four-star genius, so even if he advanced to become a Heavenly Body Tier elite, his battle prowess would still be able to surpass three stars, right?

What would it matter even if Ling Han were at the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier? There would still be a huge gulf between them.

“Then I won’t allow you to reach the Heavenly Body Tier!” Ling Han said. He roared as he unsheathed the Divine Demon Sword. He would kill Xie Donglai as quickly as he could lest he caused any more trouble.

“Ling Han, you’ve opposed me time and time again,” Xie Donglai shouted. “This time, however, you’re simply seeking death!” As he faced heavenly tribulation, he also launched an attack at Ling Han. The remnant might of his Heavenly Body Tier heavenly tribulation swept toward Ling Han, just a shred of it probably powerful enough to trouble him.

However, he clearly didn’t know that heavenly tribulation was merely nourishment in the eyes of Ling Han—it was something that would aid his comprehension.

If Ling Han were truly struck by a Heavenly Body Tier heavenly tribulation, perhaps his Godly bones would remain unscathed. However, his skin and flesh would definitely be blasted into smithereens. If it were only a remnant shock wave of heavenly tribulation, however, that would be extremely easy to deal with. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Kuang!

Ferocious divine lightning struck Ling Han and Xie Donglai at the same time. One was a Heavenly Body Tier heavenly tribulation, while one was a Sun Moon Tier heavenly tribulation. The divine lightning definitely wouldn’t strike the wrong person.

“Aaah!” Xie Donglai shrieked in agony, blood spurting from his body.

To any prodigy, heavenly tribulation would be immensely terrifying. They would need to use every iota of their strength to oppose it. Yet, what about right now? Xie Donglai had suffered an attack from both his heavenly tribulation and Ling Han. Moreover, Ling Han was at the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, and his astonishing battle prowess was almost no weaker than heavenly tribulation.

How could he withstand this?

If this were all, then so be it. After all, Ling Han was also facing heavenly tribulation and his attack at the same time. However, the problem was... Ling Han was completely unaffected!

He wanted to explode in rage, yet at the same time, he also felt shocked to the extreme. Ling Han’s physique was far too freakish! It was already beyond the realm of his comprehension.

“F*ck!” he cursed.

“F*ck yourself!” Ling Han shouted. He wielded his Divine Demon Sword, releasing a profound might and killing intent.
