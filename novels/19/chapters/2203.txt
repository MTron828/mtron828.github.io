Chapter 2204: Slavery contract

This was the first time for the nine great monarch tiers to flee before the battle even started.

But they still fled very decisively, without the slightest bit of hesitation.

You had to be joking; he had been able to pummel Gu Yushu with a single punch! What kind of concept was that?

Ling Han had to be the same type of super freak as Ji Wuming and Shi Chanzi. To say nothing of the fact that there were only nine of them, even if 90 of them joined forces, they would only be suppressed… unless they could advance into the Immortal Palace Tier.

At present, they were all too strongly suppressed.

Ling Han chuckled, and spread his fingers. Instantly, streaks of sword light shot out, enveloping the area within the nearest 50 km, looking like they were heavenly pillars.

All nine great monarch tiers stopped, not daring to cross over a single step.

They had a feeling that if they were to forcibly barge past the “heavenly pillars,” they would be suffering a heavy blow, and as result… they would be definitely crushed into dust.

Too frightening, such an elite was too terrifying. He was definitely on par with Immortal Palace Tiers, and they did not dare to show the slightest bit of temper at all.

Though monarch tiers were proud, they could also accept facts far sooner than the ordinary man. Very quickly, they turned around, and headed back to the Rain Imperial Pavilion.

“Sir, what do you want to do?” a monarch tier asked.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Could it be that you have not heard what I said? Fine then, I will repeat it once more. I am short of a few lackeys, and judge that you guys are quite suitable, so have decided to give you a chance.”

The nine great monarch tiers all looked furious. They were all monarch tiers, and were people that were destined to eventually become Celestial Kings. How could they become someone else’s lackeys?

“Sir, we have only been tricked, and we have not made a move, either. There is no need for you to be imperious, right?” a monarch tier said. This was the Saintly Origin Academy; who dared to mess around?

Ling Han chuckled. “If it was not for the fact that I am strong enough, would you guys still be saying these words? Since you are already here, it means that you have all intended to deal with me, and have put that intent into action. I cannot tolerate that.”

“Sir, death is better than being insulted. Do you want to force us into a life-and-death struggle?” another monarch tier threatened.

Whoosh!

Ling Han moved, his palm turning into a small mountain that descended down onto that monarch tier.

Without a doubt, so what if he was a monarch tier? In the face of battle prowess that was comparable to peak-stage Fourth Secret, he was only a little rabbit that was completely incapable of resistance.?Boom, that person was instantly suppressed, sprawling out on the ground.

Ling Han looked towards the rest, and asked smilingly, “Anyone else defiant?”

The remaining eight monarch tiers all looked at one another. They were furious, but did not dare to say anything, feeling extremely sullen.

Usually, it would be they that would be looking down on the rest of the common people, but now all of them were standing on the ground, looking upwards at a majestic, supreme monarch tier, which made them feel very displeased.

“Xiao Shu, come, have those companions of yours come and sign a slavery contract as well. It’s the same as yours, all 10,000 years.” Ling Han beckoned Gu Yushu over, and the latter finally climbed to his feet.

This was naturally because Ling Han had been merciful. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be child’s play for an Immortal Palace Tier to kill a Heaven Soul?

However, in this Lishui City, the divine sense of the Celestial Kings was everywhere, and it was equivalent to committing murder right in front of a Celestial King. This was also an impossible matter.

Hence, Ling Han had never planned to kill anyone. He was just going to scam them out of their money, and take in some lackeys.

Gu Yushu’s expression was extremely ugly. He had initially brought people here to get vengeance for himself, but what was the result?

Still, what could he do even if he was defiant?

No Celestial King had spoken up even until now, clearly signifying that the Celestial Kings couldn’t even be bothered to interfere in the minor quarrels of juniors like them! Then, as long as Ling Han did not kill them or cripple their cultivation, the Celestial Kings would probably overlook the matter entirely, and allow it to proceed as it would.

Gu Yushu took out a few pieces of beast hide. This was the hide of Immortal Beasts. Not only was it incredibly sturdy, it could be kept for countless years, which made it very suitable for bearing contracts.

Compelled by Ling Han’s intimidation, the nine great monarch tiers could only sign their respective slavery contracts. If they did not sign, that would definitely not be allowed.

Sign, then. In any case, as long as they could take back their slavery contracts, it would be no loss to them, either.

Ling Han was very satisfied, and stowed all nine slavery contracts away. “If you’re dissatisfied, go ahead and find people to challenge me. I do not mind gathering a few more lackeys.”

The 10 great monarch tiers all wanted to die from their humiliation. They all turned around and ran. As for how the others would be reproaching Gu Yushu, this was not within Ling Han’s range of consideration.

Meanwhile, Liu Jun had not left. Ling Han had grabbed him to concoct some alchemical pills.

For the moment, there should not be anyone else that would come to make trouble for Ling Han. He renovated the pharmacy again, and then grabbed Liu Jun into the Black Tower, the two of them concocting alchemical pills together.

To open a pharmacy, there naturally should be alchemical pills, especially high-grade alchemical pills.

When Liu Jun entered the Black Tower, he had been knocked out first. When he opened his eyes again, he realized that he was already inside the Black Tower, and he couldn’t even think much about the matter before Ling Han shot him a kick. Then, he obediently began to concoct alchemical pills.

Over 1000 years had passed inside the Black Tower, and Ling Han had also gained enough alchemical pills in his possession. Added with those concocted by Liu Jun, Ling Han felt that it would be enough for the pharmacy to be in practice for a while.

He exited the Black Tower. As for Liu Jun, he continued to concoct alchemical pills inside the Black Tower. He did not know about the flow of time inside the Black Tower, and thought that it was only time acceleration effects of 100 times at most. At worst, he only had to work hard for a million years, and he would be able to regain his freedom.

“Ling Han, when are we going to the Saintly Origin Academy?” Hu Niu asked delicately.

She had been learning how to charm men from Bewitching Maiden Rou the last few days, so the way she spoke was also strange.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Niu, you’re not suited for this style, so it’s best not to learn it.”

“Why?” Hu Niu still asked sweetly, and even flashed a coquettish glance at Ling Han.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh even louder, splitting his sides in uproaring laughter.

“Not fun!” Hu Niu pouted her tiny mouth. “Witch Rou lied. She said that it would definitely make you completely besotted, but in the end, you just keep laughing! Humph, just what are you laughing at? What’s so funny?”

Ling Han patted Hu Niu’s cheek. “Little girl, I already told you. You don’t belong to this style.”

Hu Niu was displeased. Why was she unable to seduce Ling Han?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “When Second Brother comes out of seclusion, we will then head to Saintly Origin Academy.”

“Okay.” Hu Niu nodded.

They waited patiently, and Ling Han continued to concoct alchemical pills. He would never be complaining about having too many alchemical pills.

After a year had passed in real time, the Rain Emperor finally came out of seclusion. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He had formed nine divided souls, and his strength had attained a breakthrough, practically having no rival at the Heaven Soul.

Since the Rain Emperor had broken through, Ling Han and the others thus set out towards Saintly Origin Academy immediately. Especially in the case of Ling Han and the Rain Emperor, they were both excited to meet the true top-tier prodigies, such as Ji Wuming and Shi Chanzi.

They weren’t too far off from Saintly Origin Academy. In about a few minutes, they already arrived outside the academy.

If it hadn’t been that close, Liu Jun would not have set his eye on the Rain Imperial Pavilion before. It was precisely because that town was the nearest to the academy, so the customer flow would naturally be the greatest as well.

The Saintly Origin Academy was very big and extremely grand. From the outside, multiple great mountains pierced the clouds, each having their own distinctive traits.

There was a flame mountain covered with fiercely blazing flames, a water mountain entwined with water dragons and covered in ice and snow, a lightning mountain where lightning crisscrossed… There were a total of seven such great mountains, representing the five elements, lightning element, and poison element, respectively. However, there were no mountains that represented time, space, or slaughter, because even Celestial Kings could not relocate such mountain ranges.

No such place even existed in this world.

How were they supposed to go in?
