2911 Pressing a handprint

No refusal was allowed; no argument was allowed.

Xin Qihu brought out his authority as the commander-in-chief, and directly gave Ling Han a mission that could be said to be extremely dangerous.

He looked at Ling Han with a calm smile, a hint of arrogance at the corners of his lips.

This was telling Ling Han that he had clearly and truly done it on purpose. If Ling Han had the ability, he could go bite him.

!!

If he couldn’t, he could only submit and accept.

At this moment, Ling Han genuinely wanted to wash his hands of this matter. F***, he had come to fight against Hysteria’s troops, not to be bullied, and definitely not to be screwed over. However, he quickly suppressed this thought.

Xin Qihu could use his public office to avenge a personal grudge, but Ling Han could not be impulsive and rash.

It could be said that if there was anyone in this world that could truly solve the great problem of Hysteria, it would definitely be him.

Though Ling Han was presently unable to absorb the life essence of Hysteria’s troops that had died in battle, his cultivation level still increased faster than while cultivating in seclusion during the intense battle because he was a battle maniac. Nurturing himself through battle was the fastest way for him to improve himself.

In this place, his cultivation speed was the fastest, and no one knew how much time was left for them. Hysteria’s trump cards came one after another. Even Seventh Tier elites could only barely hold back its main body, and could not free themselves at all. It was needless to say who was better and who was worse.

Ling Han had to advance his cultivation level as soon as possible, and reach the Sixth Tier or even the Seventh Tier. That way, even if the Powers of Dimension in his body hadn’t reached Great Accomplishment level yet, a Seventh Tier him would still be undying and indestructible. At the very least, being a Seventh Tier would give him unlimited possibilities.

Hence, Ling Han swallowed his anger, his eyes making direct contact with Xin Qihu.

This bastard, he called himself the greatest prodigy of all eternity, yet used public office to avenge a private grudge. When Ling Han advanced to the Fourth Tier or Fifth Tier, he would definitely thrash this bastard. So what if Xin Qihu had a Seventh Tier elite backing him? Ling Han would definitely kill him.

“Go on.” Xin Qihu flicked his hand, looking like he was shooing someone away.

Ling Han and the others did not say anything. They merely turned around and left.

Not long after, Lin Youlian walked over.

“Ling Han, do you blame me?” she asked apologetically.

Ling Han shook his head. “This has nothing to do with you.”

However, Lin Youlian said, “In this expedition, my brother warned me to prioritize Xin Qihu in all matters. If he makes a decision, I can’t disobey him.”

Yi, there was such a thing?

Ling Han was surprised. Lin Xiaoyang should be aware of the conflict between him and Xin Qihu, right? Why would he deliberately add a restrictive curse on Lin Youlian to deter her from doing anything?

Had Lin Xiaoyang not foreseen that Xin Qihu would be so short-sighted, using public office to avenge a private grudge, or did he have another motive?

Ling Han thought for a while, and then immediately shook his head. There was definitely no problem with Lin Xiaoyang,

“A mission is a mission, but completing it is another matter,” Lin Youlian said. “No one has made it a rule that a mission must be successful, especially for such a large mission. Do you understand?”

Ling Han nodded. What Lin Youlian meant was that he only needed to go through the motions for this decapitation mission, and penetrating deep into the enemy camp was practically an action of suicide.

However, Ling Han was unafraid because he could traverse the Genesis World. With his present strength, even the Realm Battlefield wouldn’t be able to stop him from traversing freely.

Thus, there was absolutely no problem for him to ensure his own safety. That was also the reason why he had not turned and flipped out on the spot.

Ling Han wanted to see what kind of expression Xin Qihu’s face would show when he returned with the corpses of the leaders of the enemy troops.

Lin Youlian left very quickly. She was one of the commanders-in-chief, and now there were a great many matters that she had to deal with.

“Ling Han!” someone called out from outside his stone house.

Ling Han walked out to take a look, only to see that it was an unfamiliar Fifth Tier elite.

“Nalan Xiong,” this elite introduced himself, a dangerous glint flashing in his eyes.

Realization instantly dawned on Ling Han. This was Nalan De’s older brother. Had he come to avenge his brother’s death?

“You want to register with me and participate in the decapitation mission?” Ling Han was all smiles, “Brother Nalan really has the whole world in your considerations. I am impressed. Come, come, come, let us make history together so that future generations will remember Brother Nalan forever.”

‘F*ck!’

Nalan Xiong was dumbfounded. He had come to watch Ling Han make a fool of himself, and take advantage of the opportunity to ridicule him. That was because whether Ling Han acted on impulse and really went to the enemy camp, or disobeyed orders, both would have terrible consequences for Ling Han.

But Ling Han actually wanted to pull him into the decapitation mission?

‘Creating a history together my a*s! That would be seeking death!’

Furthermore, just listen to what Ling Han said? Nalan Xiong was the only one who would be remembered? In other words, he would die in battle?

‘Why aren’t you the one who will be dying?’

Nalan Xiong had heard of Ling Han’s toxic tongue, but he had not thought that it could be toxic to this extent. Merely a few simple words were enough to make him feel stifled.

“Come, give me your handprint, and you’ll be one of the members of my death squad, no, decapitation mission.” Ling Han retrieved a piece of paper and stretched out his hand to grab Nalan Xiong, making him place his handprint on the paper.

‘F*ck your sister!’

Nalan Xiong hadn’t gotten his breath back from his earlier anger, so he hurriedly dodged, saying, “Ling Han, don’t pester me endlessly.”

“What’s there to be modest about? Being able to contribute to the Genesis World is a great merit, and future generations will definitely remember your sacrifice,” Ling Han said with a smile. He forcefully pulled Nalan Xiong’s hand. With how strong he was, Nalan Xiong was really unable to break free.

Nalan Xiong’s face had already turned green. If this handprint was really placed, then wouldn’t he be unable to explain himself? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Even if he wanted to participate in the decapitation mission, there was actually no need for him to leave a handprint and register himself. Now that they were all Heavenly Venerates, no oath would be able to restrain them.

However, this was embarrassing, after all. In the future, when people spoke of this matter, they would say that Nalan Xiong had even pressed down his handprint yet fled during the battle and whatnot.

No one would care about the truth. They would only comprehend according to their own logic.

Nalan Xiong resisted with all his might, but Ling Han was extraordinarily powerful. Though the former was close to the late stage of the Fifth Tier, he really wasn’t much stronger than Ling Han.

The two of them pulled and struggled with each other, as if they were like street thugs brawling in the street.

Nalan Xiong’s expression became livid. He roared loudly, and a seal lit up. Instantly, his power soared explosively.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and channeled a seal as well. Not only did his power increase greatly, he also easily suppressed Nalan Xiong. His hand that was holding onto Nalan Xiong’s hand forcefully pressed his handprint on the paper.

“Ling Han, have you had enough!!” Nalan Xiong roared in fury.

...

Yet Ling Han said to himself, “Aiyo, there’s no ink on it. Let’s do it again.” He then drew a line on Nalan Xiong’s palm with his finger. Instantly, blood gushed out. “Since there’s so much blood, no point wasting it. Just make a palm print.”

Pa! He forcefully pressed Nalan Xiong’s entire hand onto the paper.

“Damn it!!” Nalan Xiong roared loudly, and power gushed out. Pa, this piece of paper immediately turned into scraps. He finally broke free from Ling Han’s control, his eyes spitting fire as he looked at Ling Han, wanting nothing more than to swallow him whole and skin him alive.

He had come to watch Ling Han make a fool of himself, and take advantage of the opportunity to mock and ridicule him. How had it become him being harshly made fun of by Ling Han?

Ling Han shook his head, and sighed. “You are not even participating in such a great undertaking. Nalan Xiong, I look down on you.”
