Chapter 1494 Escaping From Trouble

Ling Han was unmoving, and he appeared as calm as could be.It was already time for the final battle, yet Ling Han still showed no worry at all.

‘Keep pretending... You’re pretty good at pretending, aren’t you?’

Zhu Xiu’er sneered upon seeing this. Ling Han would enjoy no good result, regardless of whether he submitted to her or not.

If he submitted to her, he would become her slave. However, if he didn’t submit to her, he would forfeit the right to participate in the final of this competition. In the future, he would be disdained by the masses and viewed as a coward who didn’t even dare to fight.

Ling Han had already lost the moment that he sat down.

Meanwhile, the plaza outside was already brimming with people. This was the final battle, and it was destined to be a spectacular show. Everyone wanted to witness this battle with their own eyes. Which of the new disciples would become the true king among kings?

This title wouldn’t be bestowed as a result of some elite’s evaluation, but rather be bestowed as the result of their strength in battle.

However, it was already time for battle, so where was Ling Han?

Gu Daoyi stood atop the battle arena. He possessed a Divine Fetus, and thus there was naturally a sheen of celestial light on his skin. It was as if he didn’t belong to this world, and it was as if he were about to tear a fissure in the sky and drift away with the wind at any moment.

However, he wore a dark expression at this moment. During the battle in the Sunken Abyss Valley, he had failed to win first place after being obstructed by Empress Luan Xing. He had been incredibly disappointed about this. Thus, he was looking forward to defeating Ling Han today so that he could solidify his name as the number one king tier of the younger generation.

Unless he defeated Ling Han today, his title as the number one king tier of the younger generation would be fragile, even with the backing of the nine Saints.

However, Ling Han was actually late!

‘Humph! He isn’t afraid to battle against me, is he?

‘Actually, that might be possible. However, if I don’t fight this battle, I’ll never be able to prove my worth as the number one king tier!

‘What a despicable and shameless person!’

“We’ll wait for one more hour. If Ling Han doesn’t arrive before that, we’ll assume that he’s forfeited the battle,” a teacher announced.

There was a wave of commotion among the spectators. Ling Han was actually cowering from this battle? He was a king tier, so it would be slightly better even if he admitted defeat before everyone. By cowering from this battle, would he still have the face to face others in the future? This would be an unwashable stain on his name!

“What’s happened to Master?” Jiuyao and Ding Ping asked. They naturally didn’t believe that Ling Han would cower from battle. This situation was extremely strange.

“Wei Zhen!” Empress Luan Xing spat. There was a dangerous glint in her eyes.

Ling Han had been led away by Wei Zhen, yet he still hadn’t returned even at this crucial time. Thus, his plight was definitely related to this person.

“Let’s go and look for him!” the Rain Emperor and the Notionless Saint suggested.

“No need!” Empress Luan Xing said with a shake of her head. “Believe in him!”

Ling Han had the Black Tower, so he could at least escape from any life-threatening situations. Moreover, she and the others couldn’t defeat Wei Zhen anyway. If he had truly captured Ling Han, then it would be useless even if they headed over to search for him. Instead of helping, they might even bring more trouble to Ling Han.

Based on her understanding of Ling Han, she was confident that he would definitely make a move right about now.

Long Xiangyue, Second in the World, and the others were all waiting for Ling Han to arrive. Although they didn’t know him well, they knew enough to know that he definitely wasn’t a coward who would shirk from battle.

***

Ling Han suddenly opened his eyes.

Xiu! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He activated the Star Plucking Step and unleashed his full speed. At this moment, he was as quick as lightning.

“Humph, I’ve been waiting for this!” Wei Zhen said with a cold sneer. He made a pressing motion with his hand, suppressing heaven and earth.

Not only was he at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, but he had even reached the peak stage. Even if he wasn’t as powerful as the four big shots such as Ren Feiyun and Qi Tian, he was still more than powerful enough to subdue Ling Han.

Boom!

His palm slammed down, yet his power was confined within an extremely tiny area. Not a single strand of Zhu Xiu’er’s hair was blown up by his attack.

“Huh?” However, Wei Zhen immediately exclaimed in surprise. This was because he realized that his attack hadn’t struck Ling Han at all.

‘Where is he?’

He retracted his palm, only to find that there was nothing but emptiness.

Ling Han obviously hadn’t been obliterated into ashes by him. Instead, he had mysteriously disappeared.

“Spatial God Tool!” he and Zhu Xiu’er exclaimed in unison.

“No!” However, Wei Zhen immediately shook his head, saying, “Spatial God Tools are tangible, and they’ll definitely leave some trace.” He unleashed his divine sense and examined every inch of space around them. He didn’t ignore even the tiniest of dust particles.

However, the Black Tower was billions of times smaller than even the tiniest of dust particles. It was so miniscule that it would be impossible to detect. At the very least, it was too tiny for Wei Zhen to detect.

Ling Han... had disappeared!

However, it was at this moment that Ling Han suddenly appeared again.

Shua!

He dashed forward again.

Wei Zhen hurriedly charged over and launched a strike at him, his speed incredibly quick.

Boom!

His strike landed, yet Ling Han had disappeared again. However, Ling Han immediately appeared in the next instant. After dodging Wei Zhen’s attack, he hurriedly sprinted into a distance like a fleeing rabbit.

“Damn it! How is this possible?!” Wei Zhen was stunned as he chased after Ling Han.

He was certain that Ling Han had definitely entered a Spatial God Tool just then, and not used some kind of secret technique. However, Spatial God Tools could only hold living beings, not become invisible and intangible!

They had to be seeing things!

He launched several strikes in quick succession, yet Ling Han easily evaded all of these strikes. Wei Zhen had no option but to change his tactic. He immediately unleashed his full power and overtook Ling Han. He knew that Ling Han was heading toward the plaza where the final was held, so his plan of attack was extremely simple. He would block Ling Han’s path.

‘Your Spatial God Tool can’t travel through my body, regardless of how powerful it is... right?’

After overtaking Ling Han, he immediately turned around to block him. By doing this, Ling Han would only have two options—either fight him, or turn around to flee.

Shua!

However, a burst of sword light instantly slashed down at him.

Ling Han had unsheathed the broken wooden sword. The demonic patterns on the sword lit up as Ling Han became one with the sword and launched a ferocious attack at him.

Wei Zhen was astonished. However, his astonishment quickly transformed into a cold chuckle.

‘What a funny joke. You’re only at the low extreme, so what does it matter even if you’re a supreme prodigy and a king tier? Can you overcome a gulf of three minor levels?’

He didn’t hesitate at all as he moved to parry. However, his actions were hasty, and he was unable to unleash his full power.

The sword arrived before him.

The broken wooden sword appeared damaged, yet after being imbued with Ling Han’s full power, it instantly tore through Wei Zhen’s defenses as if it were nothing. Even though Ling Han was struck by some of the shock waves, his physique was more than powerful enough to resist them.

Ling Han roared in anger as he slashed the broken wooden sword at Wei Zhen again.

This slash was imbued with the anger that he had held back for an entire day.

Pu!

A gash immediately appeared on Wei Zhen’s hand. However, the overwhelming power of Wei Zhen’s counterattack still sent him flying back.

“Wah!” Ling Han couldn’t help but vomit a large mouthful of blood. Blood was also seeping out from his skin.

Even though he had taken Wei Zhen by surprise, even though he had already activated the 10 killing formations inside his body, even though his physique was nearing the toughness of Level 15 Godly metal, and even though his slash had wounded Wei Zhen, he still couldn’t escape the fate of suffering severe wounds.

“Good one, brat!” Wei Zhen laughed in fury. How many years had it been? When was the last time he had been wounded?

Not only was this brat astonishingly prodigious, but he was more so incredibly audacious. He had even dared to exchange a strike with him head-on! However, the gulf between their cultivation levels was far too large. Although his hand had been wounded, Ling Han had paid an even greater price.

‘Hmm?’

However, Wei Zhen’s expression suddenly changed. He discovered that it wasn’t only blood that was flowing out from his wound. Along with his blood, his Origin Power was also flowing out without any limits. In fact, even his life force was shuddering as if it wanted to flow out!

‘What’s going on?!’

He was startled as he looked down at his hand. What entered his vision was a pitch-black wound that looked like a bottomless abyss.

‘Sh*t!’

Wei Zhen had no time to focus on Ling Han anymore. He immediately crossed his legs and sat down, using his full power to suppress the wound on his hand. If he ignored it, his blood, Origin Power, and life force would all continue to flow out until they were completely exhausted.

Ling Han retracted the broken wooden sword, not using his Indestructible True Fluid as he dashed toward the plaza where the final was being held.

At the same time, a teacher had already walked onto the arena, announcing, “Since Ling Han has forfeited this battle, I hereby announce that the victor of the competition between the new disciples is—”

“Who said I forfeited?”

Shua!

Ling Han dashed onto the battle arena, his fighting spirit burning like wildfire.
