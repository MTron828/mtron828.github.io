3231 Still A Single Punch

“Greetings, Second Elder!” Instantly, all the members of the Hu Clan knelt on the ground.

“Second Brother, don’t be careless. This kid is very strange. His power is at least 500,000 kilograms,” Hu Chaosheng warned.

‘Hmm?’ Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Hu Ronghai couldn’t help but be stunned. A Meridian Opening Tier cultivator with a strength of 500,000kg? What kind of joke was this?

The limit of the Meridian Opening Tier was 50,000 kg. There were indeed freakish people who could break through the limit, but it was only 55,000 to 60,000kg, which was already extremely impressive.

500,000 kilograms of strength? How was that possible!

Could it be that after opening a few Hidden Meridians, one’s power would obtain such a terrifying increase?

F*ck, didn’t that mean that there was no difference between unblocking the Hidden Meridians and advancing into the Blood Transformation Tier?

He naturally did not know that Ling Han had also opened up all the meridians in his body and connected all the major meridians together. Otherwise, the limit of 20 meridians was only 300,000kg in strength.

Furthermore, this was measured by Ling Han’s standards. The breadth of his meridians, the speed at which his mystical power surged, and the purity far exceeded that of others. Thus, for another person who had opened 20 meridians, the limit might be 150,000 kg, or perhaps 250,000kg.

However, would Third Brother spout nonsense on such a matter?

“A Meridian Opening Tier cultivator can defeat a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator. Vice-captain Ling, I’ve really underestimated you!” Hu Ronghai said calmly. If his third brother hadn’t lost his mind, then other than the fact that this young man’s cultivation level was inferior to his own, he was completely capable of standing on equal footing with him, or even in fact surpass him.

“However, don’t forget that this is the Hu Clan!” His tone suddenly became stern.

“Ling Han, did you hear that? This is the Hu Clan!” With two Blood Transformation Tier elites holding the fort, Hu Qiu’s arrogance finally rose. “Just continue being arrogant! Continue acting fierce!”

“Haha, why don’t you dare continue now?”

“So what if I snatch your maid? You’re just the vice-captain of the Xuanqing Banner. Even if I sleep with your mother, your elder sister, and your younger sister, what can you do to me?”

His face was filled with insufferable arrogance. This was a typical second-generation young master that was pampered by an aristocratic family.

Ling Han shook his head, and beckoned to Hu Ronghai. “Come.”

What did this mean?

Of course, Hu Ronghai could not go over. What face would he have then?

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and said, “You guys raised an animal, yet instead of properly disciplining it, you actually want me to kneel down and beg for mercy. Heh heh, what a powerful Hu Clan!”

‘You, an outsider, came to the Hu Residence to make a fuss about the wedding, and you actually dare to teach us a lesson?’

“If you don’t come over, then I’ll go over!” Ling Han let out a long cry, and with a sudden leap, charged towards Hu Ronghai.

He punched out. Boom, a terrifying power shook.

“Brat, the power of the Blood Transformation Tier isn’t just the boiling of blood and Qi!” Hu Ronghai said coldly. Weng, the blood and Qi in his body rose, pitch-black like ink, turning into a pillar.

Second Change Blood Transformation Tier, Condensed Blood Pillar!

Instantly, a terrifying pressure pressed down on Ling Han. This was not in terms of power, but a suppression on the spiritual level.

Weng, this pressure surged towards him, yet did not have the slightest bit of effect.

‘What!’

Hu Ronghai mouthed these words, but it was already too late for him to make a sound, because Ling Han’s punch had already arrived.

Why was this kid immune to his murderous aura?

He didn’t have time to think about it and hurriedly blocked.

BANG!

With just one punch, he was sent flying. He was in a much worse state than Hu Chaosheng. Both his arms were broken and fell weakly.

The entire place was deathly silent.

Why was it that even Second Elder was no match for a single punch from Ling Han?

Hu Qiu’s entire body was trembling. He had just said a bunch of extremely insulting words to Ling Han, but in the blink of an eye, his Second Elder had collapsed.

He felt like he was about to pee his pants.

Hu Ronghai was definitely the most wronged person here.

He had never thought that his murderous aura would actually be completely ineffective against Ling Han.

If there was no effect, then so be it. Both sides exchanged blows. Yes, this brat had unleashed ten overlapping layers of power, which was one layer more than his, and was indeed more impressive than him. However, how tough were the bones of Blood Transformation Tier elites? How could this possibly shatter his bones!

Shattered, not broken. He could feel that the bones in both of his arms were shattered, and they were drooping weakly like they were made of dough.

Could he recover from such a shattered fracture?

He felt too wronged. If he were to directly boil his blood and attack, then with his 400,000kg of raw power, if he were to double it, he would definitely surpass Ling Han.

That’s right, this kid must have cultivated Spiritual power. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to be immune to his murderous aura. His mind would definitely be shaken.

Damn it, how could there be such a freak? Not only was his martial strength heaven-defying, but he had also cultivated Spiritual power?

How are you going to let others live with their inferiority!

Ling Han was also surprised. This punch of his should only be able to defeat his opponent, so why did he cause such terrifying destructive power?

Eh, wasn’t this very similar to the attack he used to kill Zha Deyuan?

He recalled the process of throwing this punch. It seemed to be no different from normal. Why did it have such an effect?

After thinking for a while, his heart suddenly shook. Could it be?

‘Hmm, I’ll get someone to verify it.’

“Everyone, I’m sorry. I was thinking about something, so I was a little distracted.” He smiled at everyone.

Everyone could not help but complain in their hearts. ‘Why didn’t you think so hard that you went berserk and just simply died then?’

This was blatant mockery.

Ling Han looked at Hu Qiu, and calmly said, “Repeat what you said just now.”

Hu Qiu’s entire body trembled. How would he dare?

Was he courting death?

“Speak!” Ling Han raised his voice.

Hu Qiu’s body trembled, and he hurriedly said, “The Hu Clan are b@stards. Every single one of them is a beast. The older ones are old beasts, and the younger ones are little beasts…”

Instantly, the expressions of the Hu clansmen changed. They wished they could kill Hu Qiu.

‘You’re too spineless. You’re so cowardly just because you were frightened by someone. You’re not worthy of being a member of the Hu Clan!’

“Do you deserve to die?” Ling Han interrupted Hu Qiu. Even he found it unbearable to hear. How could there be such a shameless person?

“I do, I deserve to die.” Hu Qiu hurriedly nodded.

If he had known that Ling Han was so powerful, he would never have set his eyes on Huan Xue even if he was beaten to death.

“Then you can go and die.” Ling Han nodded.

Ah?

Hu Qiu’s jaw dropped. The script shouldn’t be like this. I’ve already begged for mercy so hard, and I’ve even in fact scolded my own family members. Why aren’t you letting me live?

“If there’s a next life, be a good person,” Ling Han said calmly. Then, he threw a punch. Peng, Hu Qiu’s entire body instantly spurted out a cloud of blood, and he was deader than dead.

What was even stranger was that Hu Qiu’s chest, which was the point of impact, had completely collapsed. It was not the kind where his bones were broken, but as if there were no bones at all.

Sure enough!

Ling Han nodded.
