Chapter 1379 Saint King Great Herb

This could be considered destiny. It was rare that he would encounter a sword maniac.

Among Ling Han’s six disciples, Kang Xiuyuan and Yun Yongwang both learnt alchemy from him. In terms of cultivation, they merely pursued cultivation levels, while their battle prowess belonged to the category of weaklings among their peers. They had been misled by the bad influence he had been in his last life.

Chen Ruijing wielded a saber, whereas Jiang Yuefeng was a jack of all trades but a master of none, very similar to Ling Han in his last life as well. As for the two disciples he had taken in this lifetime, Ding Ping was more adept at a physical battle, using his fists to solve problems, because of his outstandingly ferocious strength.

Though he had yet to teach Jiuyao much, the latter was outstandingly talented, and could summon Demonic Beasts, so the path he took would definitely not be the path of a swordsman, either.

Thus, Ling Han actually could not find anyone to inherit his Lightning Sword Technique!

Now, looking at how Han Dong was so completely focused on swordsmanship, and how their fates were now intertwined, he decided to teach him a part of the profound meanings of the Lightning Sword Technique.

Of course, aside from Ling Han, it was practically impossible for a second person to completely grasp the Lightning Sword Technique in this world—firstly, they would have to be capable of calmly observing in the midst of a heavenly tribulation, right?

And that one trial would eliminate everyone else.

Ling Han took in a deep breath, and strode into the Grand Sun Palace.

At this moment, if there was anyone who deigned to pay attention, they would discover that though the three words were still as majestic as they had been, they seemed to have lost a certain implicit charm.

‘Middle stage of the low extreme, great!’

Ling Han was extremely pleased. If he had depended on his own effort to cultivate, even if he had endless alchemical pills he could ingest, he would need as many as 100 years to complete accumulating so much, but not even half a day had passed now. If he was still not satisfied with that, then that would really be too demanding.

He couldn’t help but be even more expectant. In the remaining eight palace halls... could he also obtain this kind of gain?

This caused him much excitement, and even his steps sped up slightly.

There were not much furnishings in the palace hall. It was actually designed with the center empty. Rather than calling it a palace hall, it would be more appropriate to call it a large-scale garden as there was a stalk of grass growing right in the center.

It was obviously a stalk of grass, but was as tall as 300 meters. It was completely dark green in color, and a tiny fruit was born on the very top. The fruit was only about the size of a soybean, completely disproportionate with the massive size of the plant itself.

Yet Ling Han immediately looked astonished.

He had now grasped a total of 810,000 basic Godly medicines of the Immortal Realm. Even if there were new varieties, they would have evolved from the 810,000 types of Godly medicines. He could trace the roots and deduce the medicinal effects of the new breed.

And this stalk in front of him was a Level 20 Godly medicine!

Godly medicines that had reached Level 17 could be called Saint Herbs, and Level 20... that would be a Saint King Great Herb!

If one ingested this fruit, would it be capable of allowing a mortal to reach the heavens in one go and directly become a Genesis Tier elite? Though the battle prowess of this kind of Genesis Tier elite would definitely be the lowest among his peers, it was definite that he would still be able to easily suppress all those below the Genesis Tier.

Without speaking of anything else, merely the words ‘Saint King Great Herb’ were enough to cause a stir.

But in these millions of years, this great herb had always been here because, firstly, it had not ripened, and secondly, it definitely had to be too difficult to harvest.

Ling Han saw very clearly. It was not a puppet that was guarding this Saint Herb, but rather a formation.

He could not dispel it; it was too complex. He had a feeling that this was a supreme killing formation. If he attempted to dispel it, he would definitely encounter a merciless attack, and with his present power, it would mean definite death!

He summoned out the Notionless Saint while everyone was not paying attention.

“Brat, let me warn you, if you dare disrupt my cultivation again, I will— yi!” The Notionless Saint was just complaining. This brat was really too unconscientious. He kept throwing him out to block disasters every now and then.

However, when he saw the Saint Herb in front of them, he immediately looked stunned, and exclaimed in shock, “Heavenly Origin Dao Fruit!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ling Han was surprised, and asked, “Senior, do you also recognize this Saint Herb?” Even he had only found out after reading various illustrated handbooks of Godly medicines.

“Nonsense. As a Saint, I naturally am very familiar with all the Saint Herbs in this world,” the Notionless Saint retorted with disdain. He actually dared to doubt the insight of a Saint? That was really underestimating him too much.

Ling Han snickered, and asked, “Then does Senior have a way to dispel this formation? As long as we can transplant it into the Black Tower, we can have as many Saint Herbs as we eat rice grains in future.”

This was naturally an exaggeration. However, it was extremely possible that they could harvest a Saint Herb every few million years, and this was already very, very shocking.

The Notionless Saint did not answer Ling Han, but rather continued to stare at the formation. Not long later, a layer of cold sweat actually gathered on his forehead. He couldn’t help but shiver, and said, “A supreme killing formation! A supreme killing formation!”

“Can we dispel it?” Ling Han hurriedly asked. He also knew that this was a supreme killing formation, but how could it be dispelled?

“It cannot be dispelled!” The Notionless Saint shook his head. “It can only be forcibly barged through, but with the might of this killing formation, perhaps even Saint Kings could be killed!” When he said these words, he was very much at a loss.

This meant that they could only stare at this Great Herb helplessly.

If even Saint Kings could be killed, then those strong enough in this world to forcibly dispel this formation and harvest the Saint Herb would really be numbered.

Not only would they have to become a Saint King, their battle prowess would also have to be outstanding. They might have to be a six-star genius, eight-star genius, or even ten-star genius!

Ling Han thought for a moment. Since he was completely incapable of collecting this Saint Herb at this moment, he had best not confuse himself further on this matter. He should turn his attention onto other areas. With a wave of his hand, he drew the Notionless Saint back into the Black Tower.

This Saint had to be very gloomy. Just think, he had once belonged to the strongest group in this world, yet was now easily summoned and dismissed with a single thought from Ling Han. He was now treated completely like a babysitter.

Ling Han passed this Saint Herb by, and arrived at the second half of the palace hall. There was a passageway ahead of him, and the end would be the second floor of the Medicine King’s Cave.

There were no guards. It was simply an empty pathway, but no matter how many people walked in, they would very soon disappear. It was extremely bizarre.

Ling Han strode forwards. He took care to observe, but without his knowledge, the people in front of him had vanished, and when he took a few more steps ahead, the sound of footsteps behind him had disappeared as well.

He had become all alone.

The scene changed, and he appeared inside a stone chamber. There was a stone table in front of him, and there was only an hourglass on the table. However, the sand within was not flowing.

“Random trial, identifying medicinal ingredients.” A cold voice rang out, containing not even the slightest bit of emotion. “Within the time limit, the more identified, the better the results will be.

“Begin!”

Without giving Ling Han any time to prepare himself, the hourglass began to count down, and an image of a medicinal ingredient appeared in front of Ling Han. If he used his hand to stimulate it, the medicinal ingredient could even be spun left and right, turned up and down, showing all the details.

“Black Sun Tear Sesame.

“Fiery Maple Orchid Leaf.

“Watertooth Grass.”

“...”

“Purple Heaven Ironwood Root.”

Ling Han answered very swiftly. Usually, when the medicinal ingredient turned once, he would immediately call out its name. Thus, there was practically no pause in the images, and they were rapidly changing.

The sand in the hourglass flowed, and completely finished in about an hour later.

“Passed,” the cold voice declared. Pa, a jade scroll suddenly appeared on the stone table, and at the same time, the image of a second hourglass appeared above Ling Han’s head. Furthermore, it was already starting to count down.

Going by the speed that the sand was flowing at, it could last for about 10 days.

10 days!

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile.
