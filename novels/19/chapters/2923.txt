2924 A world-shaking secret

Everyone inhaled sharply at the same time.

Could it be that there was more than one Seventh Tier buried here?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Beams of light continued to shoot out from the ground. One, two, three, fourthere were a total of four beams. Then, four figures walked out of the pillars of light. They were all enshrouded in boundless light, and their appearance could not be seen clearly.

!!

However, every single person was exuding a great aura that could crush the heavens, and even the doppelgangers of those five Seventh Tier elites were no match, appearing to pale in comparison.

Seventh Tier elitesthere were actually five Seventh Tier elites!

Hiss, how were they supposed to suppress this?

To say nothing of the fact that there were only five Seventh Tier doppelgangers, even if Lin Luo, Bai Fan, Lin Luo, and the other Seventh Tiers personally came here, they would not be able to accomplish this at all.

“Old friends, we finally meet again,” the Seventh Tier elite who was the first to emerge exclaimed with emotion.

“I am not the slightest bit happy to see an old shameless rascal like you. I am not the slightest bit happy at all,” a Seventh Tier immediately said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Hehe, how long are you two going to bicker for?” a third Seventh Tier elite said with a smile. He looked at the doppelgangers of Lin Luo and the others. “Friends, may I ask if ‘Extermination’ has already appeared?”

“Extermination”?

Lin Luo and the other Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were all confused. What the heck was that?

“Oh!” The third Seventh Tier elite revealed an expression of realization, though no one could see it. He laughed loudly. “My title is Chong Yan. These four old friends are Big Dipper, Shatter Mountains, Mysterious Feather, and Half Moon.”

He pointed at the four newly emerged Seventh Tiers one by one, paused, and gave everyone a buffer time. Then, he said, “I know what you guys want to ask, and that is the origins of the five of us old geezers.

“Hehe, we do not come from this world or this era.”

Seeing everyone’s confused expression, he continued, “To put it simply, before this world was born, we already existed.”

‘F*ck!’

Hearing these words, everyone felt their scalp go numb with shock. Were these five Seventh Tiers monsters? They were even older than Genesis World itself?

But the problem was: who would be able to cultivate to the Heavenly Venerable Tier without the support of dimensions?

Could it be that these five people were Seventh Tiers from the moment they were born?

“Though there is no accurate accounting, the Genesis World has existed for about 3,000 epochs,” Lin Luo said. “Friend, what you mean is that before the Genesis World appeared, there was another world, and you guys were living in that world?”

“Clever!” the Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper clapped his hands. “The place that you all are standing now is the world that we used to live in.”

These overlapping dimensions were actually another Genesis World?

Heavens!

Hiss, it was no wonder that the dimensions overlapped with each other, which was extremely inconceivable. According to deductions, at least a few hundred Seventh Tier elites would have to act to be able to make two dimensions overlap each other. However, for this kind of practically endless overlapping of dimensions, it was certain that no matter how many Seventh Tier elites there were, they would not be able to accomplish this.

However, the Genesis World itself was like this, so that would explain things.

“Then how did the world of our friends become like this?” Bai Fan asked.

This place was in ruins, completely destroyed and devastated.

Could it be that a conflict had erupted among the Seventh Tiers, causing the whole Genesis World to collapse?

“That’s because of Extermination.” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan sighed. “This is an indescribably powerful being. Not only has it cultivated to the Seventh Tier, it has even manifested into a dimension and started the Realm War, swallowing countless dimensions.”

‘What?!’

Everyone couldn’t help but look at each other. Wasn’t this referring to Hysteria?

“And then?” Lin Luo asked in a very serious manner.

Everyone’s heart clenched. The answer from Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan might be the key to dealing with Hysteria because these five great Heavenly Venerates were still alive, but Extermination was no longer wreaking havoc. Obviously, they had won.

“Afterwards?” Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather shook his head. “Our, um let’s call it Genesis World as well for now, we fought against Extermination together with the Heavenly Venerates of all the dimensions, but still, we could only retreat slowly.”

“The transcendent dimensions were continuously falling. Though we created new transcendent dimensions, Extermination also became stronger and stronger. The speed of our creation was already unable to keep up with the rate at which it was devouring,” Heavenly Venerate Half Moon continued.

“In the end, we were forced to fight a battle to the death. We detonated the cores of all dimensions, and launched the final and strongest attack against Extermination.”

“Though this destroyed Extermination, our world has also completely collapsed, which has also had a massive impact on us,” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said. He stretched out a finger and pointed. “Our world was originally the same as yours, and only became like this after the collapse.”

“According to our deductions, the Genesis World was nurtured by the Void. As expected, after countless epochs, a new Genesis World has appeared again,” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said.

As everyone listened, they all felt their scalp go numb.

As it turned out, they had been born in a new world after the old world had been destroyed, and before that, a being like Hysteria had almost devoured the old Genesis World.

Ling Han thought of that Seventh Tier’s ancient corpse. Could it be that he had been killed by the power of the Genesis World’s collapse?

Otherwise, what other power could kill a Seventh Tier?

Previously, Extermination had been so strong, but hadn’t it also been blown apart?

Lin Luo obviously thought of this as well, and began, “We once excavated an ancient Seventh Tier’s corpse”

No wonder. It was said that Seventh Tier was immortal and indestructible, but with the destruction of the Genesis World as the price, this burst of attack would have already surpassed the limits of Seventh Tier.

“Friends, though we do not have Extermination, we do have Hysteria,” Xin Fu said. He briefly introduced Hysteria to them.

“This is Extermination!” Chong Yan and the other Heavenly Venerates exclaimed simultaneously.

“As expected, Extermination is too strong, and even an explosion of the dimensional core was unable to kill it!” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper said, the boundless light flickering all over his body, and showing the intense fluctuations of his emotions.

“Hysteria is Extermination?” Everyone was stunned. If that was really the case, that would be too terrifying.

Sacrifice the entire Genesis World to unleash the strongest attack, yet that is still unable to kill it! Just look at Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand, who was also a Seventh Tier, yet was deader than dead.

Was Hysteria indestructible?

“No!” Lin Luo said. “If Hysteria is Extermination, then it was also born over 100 epochs ago. Why had it also been so late? It must have also suffered severe damage in the previous world’s destruction. Who knows, there might have only been a tiny bit of remnant soul left behind, and that is why it needed so many years to recover, and only then did it manage to make a comeback.”

...

“That’s right.” Bai Fan, Xin Fu, and the other Seventh Tiers all nodded. Even Chong Yan and the other veteran Seventh Tiers expressed their agreement.

Otherwise, Hysteria wouldn’t have needed to endure for so many years. It could have directly swallowed the Genesis World when it had been first born, and there wouldn’t have been so much trouble now.

“Even so, could it be that it wants to destroy the world again and die with it?”
