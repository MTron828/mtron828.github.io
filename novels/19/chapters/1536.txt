Chapter 1537 The hunt begins

The Star Sand Saint appeared at the first moment, and the instant he saw the visitor, he looked shocked.

This was a supreme elite, the air of Primal Chaos entwined all over his body. Even he could not clearly distinguish his features, and could only judge by his voice that this man should be very, very old. And beside this man, there was another young man, who similarly was a Saint.

However, he was too young. At most, he couldn’t be more than 100,000 years old. In fact, it was possible that he was only 10,000-20,000 years old.

The Star Sand Saint was incredibly surprised; a Saint who was only 10,000-20,000 years old?

Even if he was a prodigy, these 10,000-20,000 years would only be enough for him to attain the Sun Moon Tier, right? But the person in front of him was a Saint. Though he was only supposed to be a Sun Moon Tier, he had already reached the most crucial step into the Saint Tier.

“Greetings, Senior!” The Star Sand Saint bowed towards that supreme elite. This indeed was a Saint King, an existence that even he could only look up to.

This elite was an ancestor of the Hu Clan, a truly mighty figure, and a being that was on the level of the master of the whole Immortal Realm. His name was Hu Luo, and had reached Dao 30 billion years ago. Though he had lived for so many years, he could still live on for another 10 billion years or so, and could see who knew how many elites being replaced by newer generations.

Saint King Hu Luo glanced at the Star Sand Saint. His expression could not be seen, but a person that had come out from a Forbidden Land had to be incredibly prideful, what more when he was a Saint King, a truly invincible existence in the entire Immortal Realm.

He did not speak, and instead turned to look at the young man beside him.

This young Saint broke into a smile, as warm as a spring breeze, but he radiated a bone-deep coldness that was like ice. That was a kind of pride that was not apparent from the surface... In truth, this kind of person was truly the most arrogant. Their condescension of others was bone-deep.

“I am Hu Feng,” he introduced himself. “How should I address you, sir?”

“Mi Yuan,” the Star Sand Saint replied. If this was another setting, he naturally did not have to bother with a Small Saint, but now, this Small Saint was the representative of a Saint King. He had to be polite.

“Lord Mi.” Hu Feng bowed again, and then said, “Recently, a senior from my clan has disappeared. Going by the prediction of my clan ancestor, this grandfather of mine should have died here. Does Lord Mi know who was his murderer?”

The Star Sand Saint couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Though Hu Feng had been polite, every word was sharp. He was asking him if he was the murderer.

Wasn’t that very obvious? In this place, there was no other Great Saint besides you, so who else could kill a Small Saint?

Thankfully, the Star Sand Saint had prepared himself, and replied, “Indeed, I do know. This person’s name is Ling Han.”

“Oh, please clearly talk about the background of this man,” Hu Feng said calmly, but a sliver of killing intent was already seeping from his eyes.

“This person was originally a student of my Academy, and had just broken through to the Eternal River Tier recently—”

“Lord Mi, don’t tell me that that grandfather of mine has been killed by an Eternal River Tier?” Hu Feng interrupted his words, a mocking smile appearing on his face. Even if you wanted to lie, you had to make up a believable excuse, right?

An Eternal River Tier killing a Saint; why weren’t you claiming that pigs could fly while you were at it?

The Star Sand Saint continued, “That is indeed the case, because Ling Han possessed a drop of Saint King blood essence!” He also related the matter of the three Phoenix Kings pulling a war chariot. This was the agreement that had been reached after his discussion with Ling Han because Ling Han was sure that this would cause the Eight Stones Forbidden Land to overlook the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy and concentrate all their attention on him.

Hu Feng was about to continue saying something when Saint King Hu Feng suddenly waved a hand. The air of Primal Chaos on his face even dispersed a little, and he said, “That chariot, as well as those three Phoenix Kings, talk in further detail about them!”

Though he had restrained himself very much, the urgency in his tone could still be heard.

Hu Feng was surprised, but he immediately recalled something. Suddenly, he, too, became excited.

The Star Sand Saint hid nothing, and explained the whole matter.

Hu Luo’s hands formed a strange divine seal. Streaks of divine light glimmered, and multiple seals appeared behind him. His whole person had become abstract. He was clearly standing there, yet it seemed as if he did not exist at all, which was incredibly bizarre.

The Star Sand Saint knew that this was the other merging with the great dao of the heaven and earth.

He was making a prediction!

After a while, Saint King Hu Luo finally stopped. The air of Primal Chaos on his face lessened considerably, and an aged face could be seen. In fact, there were even a few drops of sweat. He nodded at Hu Feng, and said, “The matter should be more or less like that. You must immediately set out and hunt down this despicable boy!”

He transmitted the message through divine sense, so only Hu Feng could hear it. “The treasure left behind by the Heavenly River King has serious implications. If I left the Forbidden Land for too long, it would definitely draw the suspicion of the other Forbidden Lands. Hence, I will delegate this matter to you!”

“Yes, ancestor.” Hu Feng respectfully obeyed.

Saint King Hu Luo bore a deep fondness for this junior. This was the future hope of the Hu Clan. He had entered into the Saint Tier after merely cultivating for 13,000 years, which was the first in the history of the Hu Clan. Thus, it was inevitable that he would be a little bit long-winded. “This boy killed Yingmu, and has thus established a relation of karma with our Hu Clan. With your abilities, it would not be difficult for you to predict the other’s whereabouts.

“I will gift you a drop of blood essence as well, just in case.”

Hu Luo condensed a drop of Saint King blood essence, and handed it to Hu Feng. For him, this was also an extremely great loss; he had to immediately return to the Forbidden Land to rest. Otherwise, it would affect his lifespan. Furthermore, he was about to experience the Immortal Tribulation soon. If he was not in his prime condition, it was highly possible that he could be severed by the heaven and earth.

If it was not due to the fact that the treasure trove of the Heavenly River King was too important, he naturally would not undergo such a massive loss. Unfortunately, he could not personally commence pursuit. What if that drew the suspicion of the other Forbidden Lands? Then it was possible that the Eight Stones Forbidden Land would be like how the Heavenly River King had been, and become the target of their combined forces.

“I understand.” Hu Feng nodded. He, too, formed a seal to predict, and soon focused his gaze on one corner of the galaxy. Suddenly, a golden path stretched out beneath his feet. In merely a single step, he had already traveled a boundless distance.

Saint King Hu Luo looked at the Star Sand Saint, and calmly stated, “Your disciple killed my clansman; what do you think should be done?”

This meant that he was asking for compensation.

The Star Sand Saint hurriedly answered, “This junior is willing to make up for it.”

Saint King Hu Luo nodded. He would only stay for one to two days, and would then have to return to the Forbidden Land. He was not the only person that knew how to make a prediction. If he stayed outside for too long, and another person decided to make a prediction on a whim... That kind of result was something he could not accept. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

His eyes focused on the galaxy, and revealed a strong hint of anticipation. He was filled with confidence in Hu Feng. This junior would definitely settle the matter well.

Ling Han steered the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, travelling through the galaxy, and aiming straight for the Cloud Apex Planet.

But after a mere two days, a golden pathway stretched over from the depths of the universe, and quickly surpassed the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. A figure flashed, and a young man had already appeared on the golden pathway, blocking the course of the Cloud Piercing Shuttle.

“Please stop for a moment. I would like to ask some questions.” This young man wore a warm smile as if he was greeting an old friend.
