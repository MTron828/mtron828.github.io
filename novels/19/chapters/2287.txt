Chapter 2288: Swindling Others

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Who would’ve imagined that three breathtaking monarch tier beauties would actually be won over by an ugly and pig-like demon?

This was simply illogical!

Ling Han tured around to raise his eyebrows at Celestial Maiden Yunhe as if he were telling her to uphold her side of the wager. She now owed him three Celestial medicines.

The others didn’t know about their bet, so they instantly became so infuriated that they wanted to bash him to death. He had already won over three supreme beauties, yet he still wanted to flirt with Celestial Maiden Yunhe?

Meanwhile, as a woman, Celestial Maiden Yunhe refused to believe that female monarch tiers would fall in love at first sight. This was especially so since the protagonist was of the Demon Race. Not only that, but all three of them had fallen for him in unison.

She came to a realization, and she asked, “You were already acquainted, am I right?”

Ling Han roared with laughter. He clapped his hands, and said, “Yes, indeed. How smart of you.”

Even though she was being praised by Ling Han, Celestial Maiden Yunhe didn’t feel a shred of happiness at all. This was because she had still lost three Celestial medicines to Ling Han. No, she had been swindled out of three Celestial medicines. Ling Han had purposefully led her into a trap.

She was extremely angry, yet she couldn’t help but admire Ling Han’s ability. As a demon, he had actually won the hearts of three stunningly beautiful angels. He was truly a god of relationships.

Everyone was still eating, yet it was as if the food was all tasteless. The four stunning beauties had all been won over by Ling Han, and just thinking about this pained their souls.

However, prodigies were prodigies, after all. After finishing their meal, they composed themselves and set off again. Nothing was as important as nurturing their own strength.

Moreover, Hu Niu and the others had already caught the eyes of You Yuan and the others. As such, when they retumed to the academy, You Yuan and the others definitely wouldn’t stand idly by as Ling Han embraced the women left and right.

They continued to advance. At times, they would enter regions that were fluctuating with the Regulation of Light, and they would enter regions that were fluctuating with the Regulation of Darkness at other times. During the latter times, they would try to avoid the areas of concentrated Regulations as

much as possible, seeking areas that were more neutral.

Fortunately, Ling Han’s cultivation of the Regulation of Darkness wasn’t powerful to begin with, so if he actively dispersed it, he wouldn’t be affected by either the Regulations of Light or the Regulation of Darkness. Hu Niu and the others had even lower mastery of the Regulations, so they were naturally

affected even less.

“Even though the two can’t be cultivated in unison, one can take the time to analyze both and use them as a reference,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

Heaven and earth were paramount, and their power was profound. Meanwhile, Regulations were the materialization of heaven and earth’s power. It was tangible, and it was comprehensible. It was no longer mysterious and elusive.

By comprehending both the Regulation of Light and the Regulation of Darkness, perhaps he could discover the secret to the Foreign Realm’s power. Add to this the fact that he had once been the ruler of a realm, and this would benefit him even more. He could transcend the Regulations, and directly reach

the fundamentals.

Why was the core of heaven and earth so important? This was because it could allow one to witness matters transcendent above the Regulations. Thereupon, one could obtain the knowledge to transcend the Regulations.

Three months later, they arrived at the foot of a tall mountain.

“According to the information from my clan, this is most likely the tomb of an ancient elite,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said. She was finally willing to reveal some secrets. Before this, her lips had remained sealed.

“This is an examination given to me by my clan, and they want to see whether I can successfully unearth this ancient tomb or not.” She looked at the others, and continued, “Please help me with your full strength. After opening the ancient tomb, everyone can take a treasure of their choice. If there are

cultivation techniques, everyone can also make a copy for themselves.”

“It’s our honor to help you, celestial maiden.”

“That’s right. No need to mention treasures and whatnot!”

“As long as there are cultivation techniques.”

Everyone was extremely polite. This was mainly because they already had no chance with Hu Niu and the others. Meanwhile, Celestial Maiden Yunhe still hadn’t fallen yet, so they naturally returned their gaze to her.

“Then I’ll take this opportunity to thank everyone first,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said as she curtsied to them. She then led them onto the mountain.

She would frequently stop after walking for a while, and she would close her eyes to mull over something. Only after a moment would she start walking again.

There was definitely an extremely complex map in her mind. Otherwise, there would have been no need to pause so often. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han carefully observed his surroundings, and he discovered that there was indeed something peculiar about this place. The rocks were like pillars, with each of them upright and tall. He hadn’t felt anything at first, but the further they ventured, the thicker the fog became. This seriously affected their

vision.

This was a formation!

“Roar!” There was the howl of a beast, and a snow-white tiger suddenly lunged out from behind a stone pillar. It had a pair of wings, and it was clearly a Holy Beast. There was a snow-white lotus on its forehead, one with seven petals and two leaves.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. Even though there were many monarch tiers among them, those at the Fifth Severance could only rival those at the Yang Soul. After all, there was still a major tier between them. Now, however, this Holy Beast was at the Yin Soul, meaning that it could rival 10

Fifth Severance monarch tiers.

Moreover, this was under the condition that this Holy Beast wasn’t a king tier or an emperor tier. Otherwise, it could easily obliterate them.

“Enter the formation!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe cried. Before coming here, they had already made the necessary preparations. As such, they naturally wouldn’t be sent into disarray by the appearance of a second-leaf seven-petal Holy Beast.

They immediately entered a formation, with seven people in each subgroup. They could combine their power together, and they could unleash a battle prowess greater than if they simply fought together with no formation.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe took the lead as she immediately charged at the tiger.

However, Ling Han squinted his eyes as he observed this. The appearance of this tiger was far too strange. He had a nagging feeling that this wasn’t a real tiger, but instead an illusion created by a formation.

Boom!

Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s attack landed, and the tiger instantly shuddered before vanishing without a trace.

“Huh? Where has that Holy Beast gone?”

“Perhaps it’s mastered some spatial secret technique, allowing it to escape?”

“That’s right. How can a Two Leaves Seventh Lotus Holy Beast be killed so easily?”

They didn’t dare to drop their guard, and they all remained extremely vigilant and careful lest the Holy Beast suddenly appeared and attacked them again.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “No need to be so worried. This is most likely an illusion formation, so that Holy Beast can’t possibly appear again.”

“How conceited,” the others said with a shake of their heads. Which part of that Holy Beast looked fake?

Right at this moment, there was a flash of white as another Holy Beast appeared. It was a snow-white wolf that had a pair of wings on its back. Only its eyes were golden, and its appearance was extremely mighty and domineering. There were seven petals and three leaves on its forehead.

“Not good!” everyone exclaimed. Their expressions changed again. They could rival Two-Leaf Seventh Lotus elites, yet those at the Third Leaf were far too powerful. If they battled head-on, their only fate would be death. As such, only fools would charge into battle.

“Retreat first!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe hurriedly shouted.

Everyone retreated, and only Ling Han remained unmoving.

The white wolf roared as it lunged at Ling Han.

Ling Han stood with his hands clasped behind his back, completely ignoring the Holy Beast.

Whoosh!

The white wolf landed upon him, yet it directly passed through his body. It was as if Ling Han were transparent.

“It’s genuinely an illusion!” everyone exclaimed in astonishment. They then looked at Ling Han in respect and admiration.

They truly hadn’t discovered anything wrong with the white wolf. The gulf between their observation skills was extremely clear.

Ling Han simply wore a faint smile. It was more so a sixth sense that had told him that the Holy Beast was fake. Moreover, he hadn’t possessed this kind of sixth sense before. It had only been nurtured after he had become the ruler of a realm.

This was because the ruler of a realm could transcend the Regulations and directly observe the fundamentals.

However, he naturally wouldn’t explain this. He looked at Celestial Maiden Yunhe, and said, “Come, continue to lead the way.”

Being able to see through these illusions was one matter, and wanting him to shatter this illusion formation was another matter altogether.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe nodded in reply. At the same time, she breathed a sigh of relief in her mind. Fortunately, she had invited Ling Han to come along, or they would have been greatly troubled by these illusions of Holy Beasts, and they might have even chosen to give up and leave.

She analyzed the map in her mind before setting off again...
