2677 Give some face

The large black dog’s goal was very simple, which was to lead He Yufeng away in order to create a chance for Ling Han to escape.

Unfortunately, He Yufeng was not fooled.

His palm strike missed its target, and he quite casually withdrew his hand, his gaze still fixated on Ling Han.

When the large black dog saw this, he immediately ran back, and shouted at the door, “Fish-eyed brat, why don’t you come after Grandpa Dog? You dare not? Come, come, Grandpa Dog will not bully you. How about I let you have the advantage, and I’ll just fight with one front paw and one hind paw?” As he folded one front paw and one hind paw, the large black dog stood on one leg.

This was indeed very mocking, and the corners of He Yufeng’s mouth twitched involuntarily. He couldn’t help but deliver a palm strike at the large black dog.

Boom, the outpouring of power was extremely terrifying.

“Grandpa Dog’s leaving again.” Shua, the large black dog took to his heels at an incomparably fast speed.

Prior to his complete cultivation of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, speed was his forte, and this was his real life-saving skill.

He Yufeng missed again, but before he could speak, the large black dog appeared again.

He stuck out his head at the door. “Did you miss Grandpa Dog? Grandpa Dog is back!”

He Yufeng’s eyes flashed with fury. His insistence on dealing with Ling Han wasn’t only due to the death of his subordinate, but also because he wanted to impose his might, or as the saying went, “to make drastic changes to an organization upon taking charge.” Having just ascended to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, he naturally had to impose his might and announce his rise to all.

The Wang Clan wanted to stop him, and he pushed them down without hesitation. When a large black dog wanted to stop him, he immediately delivered a fatal strike… The problem was, it didn’t go very smoothly.

How could this damn dog move so fast?

He Yufeng decided to ignore him, and despite Ling Han’s cultivation level being the lowest, he had already given him an ultimatum—that either Ling Han would kneel and pledge his allegiance as a servant, or he would be killed. The dignified Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had already spoken, so how could he not keep to his own word?

He stared at Ling Han, killing intent flashing in his eyes.

“Damn fish-eye, what’s so impressive about bullying a brat at the Seventh Heaven? If you’ve got guts, how about having 300 rounds battling with Grandpa Dog?” the large black dog shouted at once.

This time, He Yufeng completely ignored him. He took action and launched a palm strike at Ling Han.

The Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate made his move, and even if Ling Han’s speed was higher than the ordinary Ninth Heaven Celestial King’s, how would he be able to dodge?

Boom, this palm strike appeared in front of Ling Han as soon as it was unleashed. The huge green-colored hand was like a grindstone that could obliterate all Celestial Kings.

Ling Han humphed loudly, and channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. He had already accomplished the complete cultivation of the Indestructible Celestial King Physique, which gave him the confidence to take this blow.

Peng!

As the palm pressed downwards, it immediately caused the entire abode to shake profusely.

A battle between Celestial Kings could destroy this abode, what more when it was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate that had made the move? Fortunately, He Yufeng of course would not destroy his own abode. Afterwards, his left hand immediately followed with a grab, annihilating the resulting shock wave in time, and only made the abode shake.

The dust dissipated, and a silhouette radiating with glittering golden light was seen in front of Ling Han. As the golden light dimmed until it disappeared, the figure of the large black dog was revealed.

He had rushed out in time just now, and blocked He Yufeng’s blow.

How freakish, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could actually block a blow from a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“It hurts, it hurts Grandpa Dog so much!” While everyone was still sighing in amazement, the large black dog flopped onto the ground, screaming in pain, which instantly caused everyone’s newly revised impression of him to once again plunge to the lowest level of despicable.

This was truly a despicable dog; its ways couldn’t be changed.

The large black dog wasn’t as miserable as he acted. He had also cultivated the Indestructible Celestial King Physique, and had initiated the channeling of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. With his cultivation level as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, the power unleashed definitely surpassed that of Ling Han.

At most, this blow would only shake up his internal organs for a bit.

He Yufeng’s expression turned ugly. He just wanted to kill a Seventh Heaven Celestial King… How difficult could it be?

He had just broken through to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and this was precisely a time marked with great enthusiasm. Why did it turn out that so many people wanted to go against him?

Ling Han had to die, he had to die!

He Yufeng humphed. The large black dog could stop him once, but would he be able to stop him a hundred or a thousand times? If there was a person that a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate wanted to kill, could a Ninth Heaven Celestial King stop him from doing so?

“I also want to ask Brother He to give me some face, how about we drop the matter from here onwards?” A pure and sweet voice suddenly sounded, and immediately melted the coldness like the spring breeze in March and made people feel comfortable.

Yet He Yufeng was actually getting even more displeased. He merely wanted to kill a Seventh Heaven Celestial King. Why was it that there would always be people who objected to it?

He turned towards the person who had spoken. His gaze swept over, and his eyes suddenly narrowed slightly.

She was a young girl with an elegant appearance. Although she couldn’t be described as having goddess-like beauty, the sight of her made people feel comfortable, like a stalk of light-colored chrysanthemum, deserving of meticulous appreciation. However, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was that he hadn’t discovered the existence of this woman before this.

He was a dignified Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, with such powerful divine sense; how could he have missed out one person?

“Miss, what is your name?” He Yufeng asked in a deep voice. Although this young girl didn’t reveal any aura, he couldn’t help but feel apprehensive.

The woman smiled gently. “Lin, Lin Piaoxue.”

Lin Piaoxue?

Everyone exchanged looks and shook their head as they had never heard of the name.

The large black dog leaned over, and murmured softly, “Little Han, we don’t have to run, this little girl seems to be very powerful.”

Ling Han nodded. Although the woman’s aura wasn’t prominent, she gave him a feeling of extreme danger.

He Yufeng frowned slightly. This woman only revealed her name, but did not mention anything regarding her background or cultivation level, which was equivalent to not saying anything. He hesitated before asking, “Why does Miss Lin want to protect this person?”

“Oh, my father thinks quite highly of this person, so he asked me to make this trip to bring him home with me, and see how we can assist to increase his cultivation level by a little bit,” Lin Piaoxue said in a very casual manner.

However, when everyone heard this, they were all shocked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han was already at the Seventh Heaven, so how could it be an easy thing “to increase his cultivation level by a little bit”? However, Lin Piaoxue actually said it as if it was a matter as simple as eating a bowl of rice.

‘F***, what does your family do? And who might your father be?

‘She must be bluffing.’

He Yufeng didn’t believe it, either. He said lightly, “And who is your father?”

Lin Piaoxue smiled gently. “Now it is me who asks Brother He to give me some face, it has nothing to do with my father.”

“That would have to depend on whether you have the strength!” He Yufeng finally decided to take action. After having cultivated to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, if he couldn’t do the first thing he said, then it would really make him lose face too much.

Boom, he still stretched out one hand, which transformed into a green-colored grindstone.

Lin Piaoxue wasn’t the large black dog. Naturally, she would not dodge, but extended a delicate finger, and pointed it towards the sky.

A black light flashed, and pa, the grindstone in the sky instantly shattered to pieces.

Boom, with this shot, her aura could no longer be hidden, and surged up violently like a tsunami.

“Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!”

“My goodness, another Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!”

“How come such a character has never been seen in the martial academy?”

“Furthermore, she isn’t a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate who has just broken through, but also possesses a domineering aura of resolution and bloodlust.”

“…She must either have broken through in the Realm Battlefield, or have fought bloody battles there for countless years.”

Everyone was shocked. This was also a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and she was most likely stronger than He Yufeng.

Lin Piaoxue’s face was plastered with a soft smile, and her manner was graceful. “Brother He, can you give me some face?”
