Chapter 3564: The prison is fully opened

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han quickened his pace and returned to the Imperial Capital.

In just a few days, he had returned to the Imperial Capital that he had not seen for so many days. One after another, tall trees spread open their canopy like giant umbrellas, not the slightest bit shorter than those hundred-storey tall buildings.

The Imperial Capital was now lush and verdant. From afar, it looked like a prehistoric civilization, hidden in the greenery.

Ling Han returned to the Foreign Affairs Department. Immediately, someone delivered a summary of the major events that had happened these few days.

Nineteen days ago, the prison was finally completely broken open, and a Spirit Transformation True Lord appeared.

Fifteen days ago, the four great Spirit Transformation True Lords arrived at the Imperial Capital together. The Holy Emperor, Chen Fengyan, appeared, and engaged in a fierce battle with the four Spirit Transformation True Lords. The result was unknown, but after the battle, the four Spirit Transformation True Lords retreated out of the Imperial Capital.

Twelve days ago, the four Spirit Transformation True Lords announced that they would establish their own sects to recruit disciples from all over the world.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel stunned. Previously, he had said that the elites in the prison had not all appeared yet, and with the arrival of cultivators from other planets, there would be endless trouble. He had not thought that he would receive news of the appearance of Spirit Transformation True Lords right after returning to the Imperial Capital.

In the prison, the strongest elite that was being suppressed was Spirit Transformation True Lords, and they also had a powerful backer. It wasn’t convenient to kill them, so they could only be imprisoned.

Ling Han was actually very confused about this. Since the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire had suppressed these people here, why didn’t they reinforce the formation every few years, every few decades, or every few hundred years?

Otherwise, even if those people inside tried their best to break through the formation, it would only be in vain, right?

Looks like he would have to ask the higher-ups of the Azure Dragon Majestic

Empire about this problem.

Forget it, he would not think about this.

Right now, the Foreign Affairs Department’s orders were already ineffective against the forces outside. Although the four Spirit Transformation True Lords hadn’t killed Chen Fengyan, they still acted as if they weren’t afraid of him at all.

This was still very frightening. Chen Fengyan was actually a Spirit Transformation True Lord?

However, this also gave a great many people the courage not to have to depend on this Royal Empire.

Moreover, Chen Fengyan’s rule was extremely strict, and those sects that submitted to him would be subject to extremely great restrictions. For example, when it came to dealing with commoners, it was strictly forbidden to kill the innocent. However, if they submitted to the four Spirit Transformation True Lords, as long as they paid their tribute on time, there would be no other restrictions.

To these cultivators, normal people were only ants. Toward ants, they had to

be cautious?

What kind of Celestial would that be?

Thus, those forces that had yet to pledge allegiance would definitely not choose to join the Dark North Nation. This was equivalent to putting a collar around their own neck.

The work of the Foreign Affairs Department had fallen into a serious stagnation, and no other sect was willing to surrender. They could only manage the forces that they had previously joined.

“Yi, Ling Han, why are you still in Inscription Tier?” Princess Bixiao arrived gracefully. They hadn’t seen each other for so many days, and she had completely stabilized her cultivation level. Her aura was hidden, but the moment it seeped out, it was incredibly terrifying.

She was an elite of Celestial Path, so she naturally could tell Ling Han’s cultivation level with a single glance.

Ling Han hurriedly covered his body, and exclaimed in shock, “Shameless, you actually peeked at me!”

Princess Bixiao couldn’t help but feel speechless. ‘I only saw through to your cultivation level, and I didn’t see through to your body. Is there a need to do this? Moreover, you’re a damn man, so what’s there to be embarrassed about?’ This b@stard always managed to easily make her lose her composure. She sighed, and said, “With the present situation, what plans do you have?” Ling Han broke into a grin. Previously, he had naturally been playing around with this Demon Race princess. He said, “Since His Majesty has not withdrawn his decree, we will make a few more trips, and command those sects to quickly surrender.”

Princess Bixiao couldn’t help but roll her eyes, “I have only just advanced into Celestial Path. Even if I use a top-grade Foundation Building Divine Stone as my core, and my battle prowess surpasses an ordinary foundation of human Dao, I am definitely no match for a foundation of Heavenly Dao that has cultivated to the second level.”

“I told you to go on this trip, so it definitely won’t be to let you go to your death,” Ling Han said.

“Oh?” Princess Bixiao rolled her eyes, clearly not believing him.

Ling Han took out that One Star Warhammer, placed it on the table, and said, “Here, I’ll lend you this hammer for the time being.”

Princess Bixiao’s beautiful eyes involuntarily lit up. This was a One Star Spirit Tool!

She had stepped into Celestial Path, and could unleash the full might of a One Star Spirit Tool. For her battle prowess, this was completely like adding wings to a tiger.

If this battle hammer was a High Grade or even a Peak Grade, then she could even match an elite that had formed the foundation of Heavenly Dao.

“And this as well!” Ling Han drew out another suit of armor. This was the suit of armor that he had snatched from the visitor from another planet. There were a total of two suits, and in any case, he could not wear both suits, so he would temporarily lend it to this princess of the Demon Race.

“Gasp! Battle Armor!” Princess Bixiao exclaimed in astonishment.

The Battle Armor naturally belonged to the category of Spirit Tool as well, but this kind of complete set of Spirit Tool was extremely rare, because more materials were needed, and the difficulty level of laying out formation patterns was also higher. Each set had to resonate with another, unlike singular Spirit Tools, which were relatively much simpler.

In this world, it was extremely, extremely difficult to obtain a Spirit Tool. Naturally, it was even more difficult to obtain a complete suit of Battle Armor, and the rarity level was multiplied by tenfold.

Ordinarily, it was already very impressive to be able to obtain something like an arm guard or a helmet, but a complete set of Battle Armor? Hehe.

“Have you patronized the tomb of an ancient Primitive Age great elite, or gone to rob another planet?” Princess Bixiao joked.

Ling Han laughed. This Demon Race princess had really guessed correctly. He had indeed robbed an outsider from another planet, but he had not gone to any other planet. Instead, it was someone else who had delivered themselves to his doorstep.

“Are you confident now?” he asked.

Princess Bixiao thought for a moment, then said, “I have to first get used to these two Spirit Tools, to see how much they can increase my battle prowess.” She reset the recognition of the Warhammer and Battle Armor with her as Master. Ling Han had withdrawn his divine sense mark beforehand. Then, she jumped into the forest in the distance, and began her great destruction. After a while, a silver-armored female warrior flew back, appearing very majestic.

She had already activated all the veined patterns on the Battle Armor, and they were like raging flames, causing one to feel reverence upon seeing them.

“An extremely powerful Battle Armor!” Princess Bixiao said, “It can increase my power by about tenfold, and the key is defense. Even elites that have formed the foundation of Heavenly Dao won’t be able to wound me.

Ling Han could only feel envious. Who asked him to only be in the Inscription Tier? He was completely unable to unleash the full might of this Battle Armor. It could only double his power, and if the attacks he sustained were too strong, the Battle Armor would not break, but he would suffer shock injuries, and would still be wounded, or even die.

Sigh, the gulf between immortals and mortals was like the gulf between heaven and earth.

“We’ll set out tomorrow!” Princess Bixiao said confidently, “This Battle Armor also has an acceleration formation on it. Even if I encounter a Cauldron Forging Tier elite, I’ll still be able to escape.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. In other words, only those at the Core Formation Tier could threaten Princess Bixiao’s safety.

That good person whose name was still unknown, thank you for travelling millions and millions of kilometres to deliver treasures.

The two of them decided to take a good rest, and set out tomorrow. This time, they definitely had to subdue a few more sects.

When night fell, Ling Han suddenly received a report that the Seventh Imperial Prince was requesting an audience..
