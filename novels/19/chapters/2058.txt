Chapter 2059: Transfer

What was going on? Just now, they had still been battling intensely, yet now the battle had already ended.

Ruan Dongxiang pondered deeply, and his expression involuntarily changed drastically.

It had not been just a while. The power gap between himself and Bewitching Maiden Rou was not very big, so when he had completely suppressed Bewitching Maiden Rou, it had at least been after 1,000-2,000 moves.

They had taken their own sweet time.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “To be a man that bullies women, don’t you feel embarrassed?”

“You, what do you want to do?” Ruan Dongxiang asked in a trembling voice.

“Poke your eyes out!” Bewitching Maiden Rou declared furiously. She stretched out her right hand, and stabbed into Ruan Dongxiang’s eyes.

“Ah!” Ruan Dongxiang wailed in pain. Though she had not blinded him, it was still overwhelmingly painful.

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s fury still did not decrease, with her striking Ruan Dongxiang repeatedly. This guy actually almost killed her, and even dared to think of touching her breasts. He was too despicable.

“What’s the point of speaking such nonsense with him? Just kill him!” Hu Niu exclaimed.

“No, no, no, don’t kill me!” Ruan Dongxiang exclaimed. “I can give you anything. I beg you, don’t kill me!”

“I don’t need anything!” Ling Han shot out a punch.?Bang, Ruan Dongxiang exploded into a shower of blood.

“It’s not a divided soul this time, right?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.

Ling Han sensed for a while, and then nodded. “It’s not a divided soul. It’s the main body.”

He walked back, and took away the Spatial God Tools belonging to the yellow-robed middle-aged man and his companions. When he opened them, aside from ordinary Dragon Crystals, there were also some special Dragon Crystals.

Clearly, they also knew the use of the special Dragon Crystals, and that was why they had demanded that Ling Han and his group leave behind the corpse of that golden lion.

“Looks like a great many people know the use of the special Dragon Crystals.”

Ling Han and his group did not know, because Fu Yue himself did not know. As for Du Shaojun… He probably knew as well. After all, he was a native of Universal Peace Heaven, and he had not told Ling Han, probably not because he did not want to, but rather because he did not know that Ling Han was not knowledgeable about the situation in here.

One asked no questions, whereas the other explained nothing, leading to the present situation.

“Looks like we are heading in the right direction. The special Dragon Crystals can help us find the path that breaks through the great river.”

They continued wandering and hunting wild beasts, collecting more and more special Dragon Crystals.

When they had reached the critical point, they would then be able to piece these Dragon Crystals together. One after another, the veined patterns joined together, actually forming the shape of a doorway. However, because they still lacked a little less than half, this doorway was still far from being completed.

“Is this a transfer portal?” Ling Han and the others all guessed. It actually wasn’t a map!

“Very possibly.”

There was nothing much left to say. They continued to hunt fierce beasts, and several months later, Ling Han and his party finally obtained the final special Dragon Crystal. When Ling Han embedded this Dragon Crystal in the portal,?weng, the Dragon Crystal door suddenly burst out with bright light.

It was the multiple crystals that were shining. All the veined patterns had aligned together, and it was like there was blood flowing in them.

Finally, a revolving halo of light appeared in the initially empty space in the middle of the doorway.

“It is indeed a transfer portal.” Ling Han could sense the strong Regulations of Space.

“Let’s go!”

They did not hesitate at all, and all of them leaped into the doorway. Every time one person entered, the brightness of the doorway of light would dim a bit, and when the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou had all entered, this doorway of light was close to collapse.

It looked like this doorway of light would definitely crumble when Ling Han entered, or maybe after yet another person entered at most.

It could only sustain the entrance of so many people.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t hesitate. With a single step, he entered.?Weng, his figure immediately vanished.

A while after Ling Han entered, this doorway of light trembled lightly.?Pa, pa, pa. It suddenly shattered, and the Dragon Crystals shattered all over the ground. If they were picked up and examined, one would discover that these Dragon Crystals had already turned into dust.

Ling Han felt as if he had entered into a quagmire. The absorption ability of the surroundings was astonishingly strong. He clearly had his eyes wide open, but could not see anything at all. He experienced a feeling of weightlessness and helplessness.

But it was only an instant, and he immediately felt his whole body become light. He was already at the foot of a tall mountain. When he raised his head, he could only see a steep mountain so high that it towered into the clouds, but he could not see all the way to the top.

Divine Dragon Mountain!

Realization immediately dawned on him. Though he had only surveyed it from a very long distance before, unlike now when he had directly arrived at the foot of the mountain, how could he not recognize it after seeing it for so many days?

“What a tall mountain!” Hu Niu said ruefully.

“Is our destination at the mountain’s summit?”

“Let’s go!”

They began climbing. There was a special Regulation of Gravity here that did not permit anyone to fly. And if they climbed, the gravity would also become extremely astonishing when they reached a certain height. It was as if they were carrying a star on their back, and every step forwards was very difficult.

All four of them were panting, and even Ling Han was not having an easy time.

This Regulations of Gravity varied from person to person. The stronger the person, the stronger the pressure he would experience, and no one would have any kind of advantage.

“So tired! So tired!” Hu Niu stuck out her tongue, and simply sprawled out on the ground as she began crawling.

Even if she had grown up into an extremely beautiful woman, there was still not much change in her essence. She was still as much of a glutton and as wacky as she had always been.

The Empress was much more reserved. Though she was also sweating heavily, she did not seem like she was going to stop for a rest at all, and it was even more impossible that she would copy Hu Niu.

Ling Han couldn’t help but ask, “Why don’t you two enter into the Black Tower?”

The Empress shook her head, her eyes firm. This was a test for her, and she had to be the one to complete it. Meanwhile, Hu Niu said, “This is quite fun.”

Bewitching Maiden Rou raised her hand. “I want to go in. I want to go in.”

“You just step aside.” Ling Han rolled his eyes at her.

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but twiddle with her fingers plaintively. This unromantic rude boor was really too despicable.

They climbed for five days, and the scenery at the foot of the mountain was no longer visible at all, leaving behind only white hazy clouds wafting around them, but when they raised their heads, the mountain was still steep and high, and the summit could not be seen.

Just how many days would they have to walk on for?

“Huh?”

Ling Han was suddenly stunned, stopping Hu Niu who had just been about to advance forwards. Naturally, the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou who had been behind also stopped.

Something green had appeared ahead of them.

It was too normal for green to appear in the mountains, but the problem was that this green was capable of movement.

This was… a person!

Ling Han and his group all looked astounded. This was a well-built man, having the head of a dragon and a human body. His whiskers were all green in color, and so he looked like a green vine that was capable of movement from afar.

“Outsiders, please come with me,” this dragon-headed man said.

Ling Han and the others exchanged looks. The wild beasts from before only knew to kill, but this guy was actually so polite that they could not figure him out.

“Come.” The dragon headed man crooked a finger again, then turned, and left.

“Let’s follow!” Ling Han only hesitated slightly, and then immediately came to a decision.

Hu Niu and the Empress naturally would not have any disagreement, and immediately moved to follow.

“Why doesn’t anyone ask for my opinion?” Bewitching Maiden Rou grumbled, and could only follow behind the other three.

As they traveled, the majority of their time was either spent walking on the mountain, or walking around mountain peaks. After walking for about two hours, a small town actually appeared ahead of them. All the houses were built from wood, and it was filled with a primitive vibe.
