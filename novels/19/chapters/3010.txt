3011 Benevolent Heart

On the surface of the lake, the woman in white and her maidservant had no option but to grab the sides of the boat to stabilize themselves. Otherwise, they would definitely fall into the water.

It was as if they were experiencing a tsunami, and there weren’t any thoughts left in their minds. They were simply trying to stop themselves from falling into the lake.

After a long time—perhaps it was an epoch, or perhaps it was an instant—the lake suddenly calmed down.

“That scared me to death!” the woman in azure said as she vigorously patted her chest. She wasn’t afraid of being too forceful and squishing her shapely breasts. She looked at the woman in white, and asked, “Young Mistress, are you okay?”

The woman in white nodded in response. Even though they had experienced a wild storm, her expression still remained calm and collected.

She gazed at the large lake. From a young age, she would always come here every day and boat around the lake for a while. Now, however, the lake suddenly felt unfamiliar.

“Huh?” She suddenly faltered and pointed at someplace in the lake. “Xuanxuan, is that a person over there?”

“Young Mistress, perhaps you’re mistaken? How can there be a person there?” the woman in azure replied with a shake of her head. She was quite a relaxed person, and she was already smiling as she said, “Apart from Young Mistress, the powerful creatures in the Heavenly Treasure Lake won’t allow anyone else to travel over the lake. If anyone dares to, they’ll immediately be torn to shreds!

“A few hundred years ago, the Seventh Elder’s son wanted to secretly enter the lake to obtain some treasures. However, he was chopped into pieces. The Seventh Elder wanted to seek revenge, but the sect leader eventually quashed the matter.

“Those who dare to wander into the Heavenly Treasure Lake will die for nothing!”

The woman in white naturally knew about all this. She pointed at that place again, and said, “Look carefully.”

The woman in azure finally glanced over again. She was given a huge fright, and she directly flipped over from the side of the boat. Thankfully, the woman in white quickly reached over and caught her falling body.

What had she seen?

A man!

A ghost!

There was shock on her face. What in the world was going on? There was actually someone underwater in the middle of the lake? And his eyes were wide open as well? If he wasn’t a ghost, then what else could he be?

One had to realize that those who dared to enter the lake would all end up in pieces. The only exception was the young mistress standing next to her.

However, the two women immediately saw a large number of creatures appearing in the middle of the lake. There were fish spirits, shrimp spirits, crab spirits, and so on. In fact, it seemed like all of the spirits and creatures in the Heavenly Treasure Lake had gathered together.

“I’ll go and save him!” the woman in white said. Before the woman in azure could block her, she immediately dived into the water, and started swimming toward the man.

She knew that she wouldn’t be harmed by the creatures in the lake. However, it was a different story for that man.

It appeared as if he had enraged the entire Heavenly Treasure Lake, and he had surprisingly provoked all of the creatures and caused them to gather together. Even she was feeling slightly anxious.

“Young Mistress!” the woman in azure shouted. This was all she had time to do, and she almost wanted to jump into the lake as well. However, she knew that only her young mistress could travel through the lake without any restrictions. If she dared to enter the lake… she would face certain death.

However, she wasn’t feeling confident this time, because there were far too many spirits and creatures in the water. Just looking at them was enough to make her head go numb.

Ling Han was astonished. He naturally saw the two women in the lake, but at his level, did he need to pay any heed to them?

He didn’t use any of his power, and he was simply moving with the undulations of the lake. As for all the creatures beneath him… This was very simple. He was the reason behind their sentience and ability to cultivate, so which of them didn’t treat him as a god?

Now that he was about to leave, these creatures were naturally gathering here to bid farewell.

However, Ling Han’s aura was far too terrifying, so none of the creatures in the lake dared to say anything. They could only bid farewell to him in silence.

Yet, this woman was actually swimming over to save him?

Ling Han was slightly touched. This woman was truly a kind soul. She was also extremely brave as well, or else how would she have dared to jump into the lake after seeing an army of fish spirits and other spirits? To say nothing of jumping into the lake to save him, most people would have immediately turned around and fled.

The creatures in the lake all wore hostile expressions when they saw the woman in white approach.

They felt an innate sense of friendliness toward this woman, and it was because of this that they had allowed her to play in the lake from a young age. They viewed her as a companion. However, now that Ling Han was here, it was a completely different matter.

This was their ancient ancestor, their origin, their totem. How could they allow him to be desecrated?

The woman in white couldn’t help but feel stunned. She could naturally feel the killing intent of these lake spirits. She was extremely sensitive toward this kind of aura, and her first instinctual thought was to turn around and flee.

However, she glanced at Ling Han and gritted her teeth before continuing to dive down. She grabbed Ling Han’s arm and furiously swam toward the surface of the lake.

The lake spirits wanted to attack, but Ling Han unleashed a powerful aura, suppressing them and making them not dare to move.

Splash!

The woman in white resurfaced, and with a leap, she had already landed on the boat.

“Young Mistress, you scared me to death!” the woman in azure said as she furiously patted her chest. This was truly a worrisome sight. If she continued to abuse her chest, it would eventually transform from two towering mountains into a flat plain.

The woman in white looked into the lake, only to see the lake spirits stop their advance when they were still 90 meters from the surface. They didn’t swim any closer, nor did they scatter. Instead, they all stared at her just like that.

This caused her to shiver in apprehension. She had never seen these lake spirits act like this before.

“Leave,” she said.

“Okay!” the woman in azure hurriedly replied as she rowed the boat.

Only at this moment did the woman in white look toward Ling Han. When she had leaped into the small boat, she had also tossed Ling Han inside.

However, she almost stumbled and tripped when she looked over.

This was because Ling Han was wearing a calm and carefree expression. In fact, there was even a faint smile on his face.

‘You almost died, you know that?!’

She humphed, and said, “You’re not a disciple of our sect!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “No, I’m not.” Scanning the surroundings with his divine sense, he was able to see everything in the Azure Sky Sect, including the movements and speech of everyone.

He instantly understood the situation.

“How impudent! Not only did you barge into our sect, but you’re even coveting our sacred lake!” the woman in white chided.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Then why did you rescue me?”

“Young Mistress has a benevolent heart, and she isn’t willing to even step on an ant. Otherwise, if it had been someone else, you would have already been torn into shreds and eaten,” the woman in azure interjected.

“Oh, then I can jump back into the lake to return this favor,” Ling Han said.

“You’ve gone crazy!” the woman in white exclaimed. However, she immediately regained her composure, and said, “When we get back to shore, immediately leave this place and never return again. Otherwise, you won’t be as lucky as today.”

‘She truly is a benevolent person,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

This was like a thief entering someone’s house and being caught by a pet beast before being able to steal anything. Yet, not only did the owner not turn them in, but she even helped them break free and leave.

Such kind people were definitely a rare breed nowadays—she was definitely one of only a few.

Ling Han cocked his head, and acted as if he were listening to something. After a while, he said, “Then let’s count this as me owing you a favor. You can look for me if you need my help. I’ll naturally help you resolve the problem.”
