Chapter 2391: Breaking the Restrictions

The passageway was dark and eerie.

However, following the sounds of their footsteps, the passageway started to light up section by section.

Above them were pieces of jade-like rock. They could emit light, and quickly illuminated the entire passageway.

The passageway wasn’t long, and a large expanse of space opened up before them after a short while. They were standing in a cave atop a cliff. Before them was a stretch of buildings, situated around 3000 meters below them. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

These buildings were exquisite, yet they also seemed dignified and majestic at the same time. They were all constructed from bricks and tiles, and the columns that stood among them were all engraved with dragons and phoenixes. The surrounding areas were filled with bamboo forests that gently swayed with the wind.

“This is the treasure chamber!” the ancestor of the Kong Clan announced.

“Let’s go!”

They flew down the cliff, yet they discovered that the expanse of buildings was protected by some kind of energy barrier. They couldn’t enter this place directly.

Ling Han could have attempted many different things. For example, he could have hacked at this barrier with his Divine Demon Sword. He could have also asked Wally to analyze this barrier. There were many potential ways to destroy this barrier. However, since the ancestor of the Kong Clan was here, why would he go to so much effort?

“Come on, lead the way.”

The ancestor of the Kong Clan led them before the expanse of buildings. After his fiddling with some unknown thing, they could then proceed into the area unhindered.

“The buildings in front are all ordinary buildings. They’re simply residences,” the ancestor of the Kong Clan said. “Only the seven buildings in the back house treasures, so don’t waste your time here.”

Even though he said this, how could they trust him so easily? They carefully searched all of the buildings. However, just as the ancestor of the Kong Clan had said, these buildings were indeed devoid of treasures.

After carefully searching all of the buildings, they finally arrived before the last seven buildings.

These buildings were clearly larger than the others. Moreover, the seven buildings were laid out in an intriguing manner, with each of them seemingly conforming and resonating with the other. This was a Seven Stars Arrangement, where the central building was even larger and grander. It appeared much like an imperial chamber.

“How do we enter?” Ling Han asked.

“According to our agreement, I’ve already led you people here. Shouldn’t you release me now?” the ancestor of the Kong Clan replied.

“Heh, deciding things for yourself now, are we?” Ling Han patted the old man’s shoulder. Who had agreed to this?

The ancestor of the Kong Clan naturally understood this as well. He started to bargain with them, saying, “Fine, if you want me to undo the restrictions, then unseal my cultivation first.” Right now, he was no different from an ordinary person.

“Sit aside first,” Ling Han said. He naturally wouldn’t concede any ground. He turned to Wally, and asked, “Want some treasures? If you do, then undo the restrictions here.”

“You’re taking advantage of me!” Wally said in protest. He had surprisingly gained some intelligence.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Suit yourself. If I undo the restrictions by myself, you don’t need to think about getting any of the treasures. If you undo it, however, I can share some with you.”

After performing some calculations, Wally nodded in agreement.

The women all shook their heads upon seeing this. In terms of calculation ability, Wally was truly as capable as could be. In terms of worldly wisdom, however, he was just as naive.

If Ling Han undid the restrictions, the treasures would all belong to Ling Han. Then, if Wally undid the restrictions, shouldn’t all of the treasures belong to him?

Yet, he had actually agreed to Ling Han’s proposal. In reality, everything was a trap. However, in Wally’s eyes, it was extremely reasonable that he only received a portion of the treasures since there were so many people here.

They were truly speechless about their husband. He would screw humans over, and he would even screw non-humans over.

Wally walked forward. However, after taking a few steps, the floor suddenly lit up, unleashing a slash at him. This was a devastating attack that was at least at the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier.

Whoosh!

The blade of light slashed forth, yet Wally retreated even quicker.

In some sense, he was also a cultivator of Body Arts. He didn’t draw on the power of Regulations, and he instead drew on the power of heaven and earth to unleash his might. As a result, his explosive power was even greater.

The blade of light flashed past, yet it struck no target.

Astonishment spread across the face of the ancestor of the Kong Clan. The first time he had come here, he had been filled with excitement, yet he had also been lacking in power. Thus, he had suffered extremely grave wounds after being struck by this blade of light.

However, it had also been because of this that he had recognized the importance of this treasure chamber.

Now, however, Wally had actually dodged this attack with such ease. This instantly made him feel displeased.

Wally continued to advance, and the blades of light also slashed forth one after another. However, they all failed to strike him. After a while, Wally came to a stop, not advancing any further. At the same time, light burst from his eyes, and it was very likely that he was performing some furious calculations.

After a long while, he finally opened his eyes, and said, “Follow me. Don’t make any misstep.”

He took the lead, and everyone followed after him. The ancestor of the Kong Clan was still hanging in Ling Han’s grip.

After taking a few steps, astonishment spread across the face of the ancestor of the Kong Clan. This was because Wally had genuinely undone the restrictions of this building!

He was unable to accept this. One had to realize that he had paid a huge price for discovering each step. He had suffered severe internal injuries, and it had taken him tens of thousands of years to recover each time.

There had been many times that he had wanted to give up because this had been a truly torturous task.

However, Wally hadn’t been struck a single time. With just a few attempts, he had already undone the restrictions of this place. How could the ancestor of the Kong Clan not feel frustrated and irritated?

However, how could he know that Wally was actually the culmination of several hundred epochs of knowledge from a higher-level dimension? If he couldn’t break the simple restriction of a Celestial King, what right would the Dark Inverse Realm have to invade the Foreign Realm?

Wally led the way, and it wasn’t long before they made it inside the building.

After entering, what greeted them was row after row of shelves. There were all kinds of things on these shelves, with most of them being alchemical pills. However, many of the shelves were already empty. Their contents had clearly been taken by the ancestor of the Kong Clan.

“Hang on,” Wally said. “There’s a main control hub here, and if I close it, all of the restrictions here will disappear. However, this restriction also has the effect of maintaining the freshness of the items here. After closing it, the things here will slowly decay.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “That’s fine.”

Wally went over to fiddle with the control hub. After a short while, he nodded and said, “It’s done.”

Ling Han stepped forward, and sure enough, there wasn’t any reaction at all. It was as if this were truly an ordinary building.

The most shocked person was naturally the ancestor of the Kong Clan. He had initially planned to bargain with his captors, first regaining his cultivation and then taking advantage of his familiarity with this place to trick them to lead them to their deaths.

To his shock and disbelief, however, Wally’s presence rendered the restrictions here completely useless.

Qing Qing also fluttered her eyelids as she glanced at Wally. It was as if she were curious.

Ling Han and the others swept away all of the treasures. Most of the treasures had already been taken by the ancestor of the Kong Clan, but there were still many things remaining. Most of the remaining treasures were alchemical pills, but there were also some other things such as precious jade that was extremely beneficial to cultivation.

These treasures were all useless to Wally. Thus, Ling Han wrote him another debt slip, promising to pay him back with Divine Metal and other similar items in the future.

Only Wally would agree to such unfair exchanges. However, Wally didn’t feel that this was unfair. He was extremely motivated as he undid the restrictions of the second building.

Ling Han examined the alchemical pills. Sure enough, these were the works of a Five-Star Alchemist. Most of the alchemical pills had reached the Eighth Refinement, and a small number of them had even reached the Ninth Refinement. However, only a single alchemical pill had reached the Tenth Refinement.
