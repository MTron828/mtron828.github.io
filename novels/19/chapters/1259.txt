Chapter 1260 Tables Turned

Xiu!

The streak of light shot toward Ling Han at an incredible speed. After all, this was the attack of an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for Ling Han to withstand such an attack. In fact, even with his powerful physique, his Godly bones would still be shattered. Although Qian Sen’s attack wouldn’t be powerful enough to burn him to ashes, it would definitely be powerful enough to blast a hole in his body. Large swathes of his skin would also be scorched.

However, he was someone who had endured the test of immortal flames. Although he had received help from the Black Tower, that was still incredibly impressive. Thus, it would be impossible to harm him with divine flames, unless his opponent was one major tier above him.

That was right, they had to suppress him in terms of major tier!

That being the case, Ling Han was too lazy to even dodge. He simply raised his right hand and made a pressing motion toward the streak of light. At the same time, he unleashed the sword intent of the Fast Technique, causing the speed of his hand to increase tremendously.

Pu!

The light hit his hand, and the overwhelming power of the collision caused him to immediately slide back. This was the formidable power of a consummate level elite. However, an astonishing radiance burst from his hand, causing Qian Sen’s attack to curve around him. It was unable to scorch his hand.

Peng!

Ling Han continued to slide back at a frightening speed. In fact, his speed was as fast as his full-power sprint. Coincidentally, a disciple of the Blazing Inferno Sect was standing right behind him. This disciple had no time to react before he was hit by Ling Han’s body.

Just how powerful was this collision?

It was as powerful as the full-power attack of an elite at the consummate level with a Level Six God Tool in their hands!

Meanwhile, that disciple was only at the late stage of the low extreme. So, how could they withstand such a collision? Blood and flesh exploded into the surroundings as that disciple was ruthlessly crushed into pieces. He transformed into a vast rain of blood, crushed bones, and broken flesh. He couldn’t be any more dead.

However, this collision also helped Ling Han come to a stop. He flapped his hand and extinguished the flames that were burning on it. He then raised his hand to check for any damage. His palm had already become jet-black, and it was clear that his skin had still received some minor burns.

Sure enough, the large gap between their cultivation levels meant that he was still at a slight disadvantage. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ling Han glanced back with a smile, and said, “I’m so sorry, I don’t have eyes on the back of my head, so I accidentally smashed you to death. However, if you want to blame someone, blame the person who attacked me. After all, I’m also a victim.”

The six remaining members of the Blazing Inferno Sect were all stunned. They were rendered absolutely speechless.

‘Is this person a monster?

‘He received the strike of an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, yet his body actually wasn’t smashed into pieces? And his blood and bones weren’t incinerated, either? He simply dispersed the power of the strike by sliding backward?!’

Perhaps one might suspect that Qian Sen hadn’t used his full power. However, was this possible? Ling Han had collided into their seventh junior brother and smashed him into smithereens! Was this power not tremendous?

Even if Ling Han’s physique were incredibly tough, allowing him to absorb such tremendous power, how did he survive the might of the scorching flames?

That was the might of divine flames! And it had been unleashed by the Level Eight God Tool of a consummate level elite! Such flames could definitely incinerate elites at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, yet Ling Han had merely received minor burns on his hand!

‘How can such a freak exist?’

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, immediately shedding the layer of burnt skin from his hand. A new layer of jade-like skin grew in its place. He had only shed this layer of burnt skin because of Qian Sen’s remnant martial intent. Otherwise, his body would regenerate by itself even if he didn’t channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

He cracked a grin, and said, “I gave you people a chance to do business normally, yet you insisted on becoming thieves. Now... it’s time for you to suffer the consequences!”

Xiu!

He clenched his fists and dashed toward the disciples of the Blazing Inferno Sect.

“Stop!” Qian Sen roared. He hurriedly rushed forward to meet Ling Han’s attacks. This brat was far too freakish, and his battle prowess couldn’t be measured based on his cultivation level. If he were given a free rein to attack, everyone apart from him would be massacred.

To the Blazing Inferno Sect, each and every Sun Moon Tier disciple was incredibly precious!

The six disciples—no, there were only five now—had all been trained by the sect for over 100,000 years. They were immensely talented, and if they came across the right opportunities, it was entirely possible that they could advance to the Heavenly Body Tier in the future.

Of course, it was essential that a flourishing sect had several elites to act as pillars. However, the true core of a sect was their disciples. Otherwise, what was the point of having a Heavenly Body Tier elite and no disciples?

Qian Sen was a consummate level elite, after all, and a mountain-like pressure descended from the sky as he opened his hands. This formidable pressure limited Ling Han’s movements, giving the disciples time to escape his grasp.

“This is a bit troublesome!” Ling Han exclaimed with a shake of his head. It was extremely difficult to kill people under the nose of an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, unless the elite became careless. However, Qian Sen was clearly prepared now, so it would be incredibly difficult for him to kill any more people.

“Brat, I admit you’re fairly powerful,” Qian Sen said. “However, the gulf between you and me is clear for all to see. It’s impossible for you to win! Hand the Realm Spirit Stones over, then sever your own arms. If you do as I say, I can spare your life.”

“Uncle Qian!” Yan Jun and the others exclaimed in astonishment.

This brat had “killed” a disciple of the Blazing Inferno Sect! How could they let him off so lightly?

However, Qian Sen knew that his full-power strike with his Divine Sword had failed to injure Ling Han severely. His defenses were far too freakish. It was only because he had an advantage in terms of power and comprehension of Regulations that he was able to suppress Ling Han. Otherwise, even he would have to turn around and flee.

In any case, it would be mission success as long as he obtained the Realm Spirit Stones. Once Founder Mao broke through to the Heavenly Body Tier, he would have an advantage of one major tier over that brat. Thus, it wouldn’t matter even if that brat advanced to the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. He still wouldn’t be able to escape the fate of being insta-killed.

Different situations required different solutions. Qian Sen understood what was most important.

However, Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You people are so haughty and domineering. You’re clearly trying to rob me, yet you’re making it seem like you’re being benevolent to me. You want me to sever my own arms? Heh, are you f*cking retarded?!”

He was extremely pissed off. He waved his right hand, upon which a flower appeared on the ground. This flower was breathtakingly beautiful, and it radiated with the rhythm of dao. It was like a Godly medicine that had been nurtured by heaven and earth.

However, one would be screwed over if they truly believed that this was a superb Godly medicine.

This was the Misty Soul Capturing Flower, a flower that Ling Han had obtained in the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm. At that time, even he had almost fallen victim to this flower. His soul had been hooked, and he had been attacked by numerous Saintly Scarabs.

During its time in the Black Tower, this “poisonous flower” had grown a little bit more. Its aura was even more in tune with the great dao now, and its ability to deceive people had elevated to another level.

An expression of intoxication spread across Yan Jun’s and the five others’ faces. It was as if they had entered some kind of illusion. Their bodies became relaxed, and the corners of their lips curled up in a smile.

Ling Han immediately launched into action.

Pu, pu, pu, pu!

Apart from Qian Sen, the heads of the five others were all smashed into pieces.

Qian Sen had been stuck at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier for far too long, and this had enabled him to temper his divine sense to an extremely resilient state. When Ling Han’s fist struck over, he instinctively moved aside and evaded the fatal strike. Ling Han’s punch scraped across his face, the breeze it caused ripping off large amounts of flesh and blood. The damage was so severe that even his teeth were revealed.

However, this strike also brought Qian Sen to his senses. He stumbled back in shock, only stopping after retreating hundreds of meters. There was terror on his face as he stared at the Misty Soul Capturing Flower. This peculiar Godly medicine-like flower could actually affect his divine sense! In fact, he had almost died a muddle-headed death!

Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared, and he immediately pursued Qian Sen, saying, “Old geezer, your juniors have all died, so why don’t you stay to accompany them?”
