“Lord is mighty!”

Immediately, some Celestial Kings knelt down and shouted toward the inn.

“Milord, we were also forced,” some Celestial Kings explained.

On the other hand, those Celestial Kings who had cursed earlier were all trembling. Who would have thought that Ling Han and the others would ignore Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame? It wasn’t that they were no match for him, but rather that they simply didn’t care enough.

Just look, Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame definitely wanted to make a move, but in the end, he didn’t even have the chance to enter the inn, and directly knelt down.

Of course, no matter how pathetic Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame was, he wasn’t someone they could discuss openly.

“Scram! Don’t let Grandpa Dog see you again!” A flashy voice came from the inn.

Xiu! The wine cup on Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame’s head was immediately retracted.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame stood up, bowed in the direction of the inn, and turned to leave.

He naturally didn’t have the face to stay here any longer, and he had to thank the other party for sparing his life. How could he dare to have any thoughts of revenge?

The large black dog was very pleased with himself. He was borrowing Ling Han’s might as an intimidation tactic.

Although he was in the Second Tier, and his strength was far above that of Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame, it was impossible for him to suppress the other party with just a wine cup.

This was something that only Ling Han could do.

“Supreme Master!” All the Celestial Kings knelt down again with fanatical expressions.

This was too awesome. If they could become the disciple of such a Heavenly Venerate, their future would be limitless.

Inside the inn.

“Master’s judgment is still accurate. That old fellow Shatter Mountains really didn’t appear,” Ding Ping said.

“Stop sucking up. Are you saying that Grandpa Dog’s judgment is incorrect?” the large black dog said angrily, kicking Ding Ping aside. “Next, Shatter Mountains should appear, right?”

Ling Han shook his head. “Not necessarily.”

“Still not necessarily?” The large black dog’s eyes widened. “How long will Shatter Mountains tolerate his pride being torn apart?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Shatter Mountains probably still doesn’t know about this matter, and this time, the one that returned in defeat is only a First Tier. Therefore, a Third Tier or Fourth Tier might appear next. After that, Shatter Mountains should receive the news.”

“Sigh, so that means we still have to wait a little longer if Grandpa Dog wants to watch a good show?” The large black dog immediately looked disappointed.

“Even if Shatter Mountains was here now, you wouldn’t possibly be able to watch the show from the sidelines, either,” Ling Han said.

When a battle broke out between two people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess, the aftershocks might kill a Sixth Tier, so there was basically no one that could watch.

One day, two days, three days… Time passed quietly, and almost three months later, as Ling Han had expected, another Heavenly Venerate arrived. However, it was not Shatter Mountains, but a Third Tier.

“F*ck, you really hit the nail on the head.” The large black dog was extremely displeased. Previously, he had not refuted Ling Han, but he had still been looking forward to the arrival of Shatter Mountains in his heart.

But in the end? Sigh!

“My name is Three Arrows. May I know who is the friend here?” This Third Tier was very polite, and he bowed in the direction of the inn.

Unfortunately, Ling Han merely sipped his wine, and without instructions from Ling Han, how could Ning Haixin and the others possibly answer?

The large black dog was displeased, and naturally couldn’t be bothered to reply.

Heavenly Venerate Three Arrows waited for a moment, and seeing that no one responded, he couldn’t help but reveal a displeased expression.

He was a Third Tier, and this could already be considered to be in the middle ranks of Heavenly Venerable Tier, but the other party wasn’t even willing to answer him?

This was too pretentious.

“My friend, it’s better to resolve enmity than to keep it alive,” he added. Because he didn’t know the depth of Ling Han and the others, he still maintained his politeness and focused on resolving the matter. “You have to know that Lord Shatter Mountains is a Seventh Tier ultimate elite, which is the most powerful power in the world. He is unrivaled.”

What, Shatter Mountains was a Seventh Tier?

Upon hearing this, all the Celestial Kings kneeling nearby trembled.

Oh no, they were actually still paying respects to Ling Han. Wasn’t this publicly making an enemy out of a Seventh Tier ultimate elite?

Heavenly VenerateThree Arrows paused for a moment. Seeing that there was still no sound coming from the inn, he could only continue, “Right now, Lord Shatter Mountains has yet to receive the news, so if my friend sends the signboard back and offers some compensation, it is not impossible that this matter can be resolved peacefully.”

He stopped and waited for a response from the inn.

However, it was still silent.

Heavenly Venerate Three Arrows was increasingly dissatisfied. He had already said so much, so why didn’t he receive any response?

He was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, Third Tier!

Three Arrows took a step forward. Hong, his aura surged. He would be polite before resorting to force. Since persuasion was ineffective, he could only go to war.

In the inn, Ling Han turned to Ning Haixin, and said, “Haixin, go and make him leave.”

“Yes, Master,” Ning Haixin said respectfully.

“Master, Junior Sister Ning is only a First Tier, so she shouldn’t be a match for that person,” Ding Ping hurriedly said.

“Yeah, you should do it yourself,” the large black dog chimed in.

A First Tier versus a Third Tier; that was simply sending her to her death.

Ning Haixin was not Ling Han, and her ability to fight someone of the same cultivation level could only be considered average.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s fine.”

Ning Haixin moved and appeared outside the inn.

Heavenly Venerate Three Arrows immediately stopped in his tracks. He was filled with fear towards Ling Han and the others, but after he swept his gaze over, he discovered that Ning Haixin was only in the First Tier, and he instantly cursed himself in his heart. Why did he have to make such a fuss?

“Sir, please leave,” Ning Haixin said evenly, neither humble nor haughty.

Heavenly Venerate Three Arrows immediately wanted to fly into a rage. Just a mere First Tier, and she wanted to send him away?

But as he looked at Ning Haixin, his anger slowly dissipated.

“That’s not appropriate, right? I am also here by someone’s request,” Heavenly Venerate Three Arrows said. His tone wasn’t rejecting at all, but rather expressing feelings of conflict.

“Then let me make a request of you as well, leave now,” Ning Haixin said calmly.

Heavenly Venerate Three Arrows hesitated. Logically speaking, he shouldn’t leave just like this. After all, he had accepted the earnest request of another and even been rewarded, but the words of this woman before him were incomparably moving to his heart, causing him to unconsciously want to obey her.

There was a voice in his heart that told him not to obey, but he couldn’t do it.

“Alright.” He nodded and left easily.

‘F*ck, that’s it?’

In the inn, everyone was so shocked that their scalp went numb. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han was very amazing, and could fight someone two cultivation levels above him. He could be called a god of war.

And Ning Haixin?

Her battle prowess could only be described as mediocre, but it was enough to make someone who was two cultivation levels above her obey her orders.

To subdue an enemy without a fight, this was not inferior to Ling Han at all.

“I say, Little Han, this disciple of yours is quite powerful.” The large black dog’s eyes were wide open, and he was still in a daze. “Yes, she’s almost catching up to Grandpa Dog.”

He was flattering himself.

Ling Han smiled slightly. Up until now, he still hadn’t figured out how Ning Haixin’s affinity came about and how it affected people. However, after many years of research, he was still able to teach Ning Haixin to actively channel this ability.

Similar to Ling Han, who could fight someone two cultivation levels higher than him in Heavenly Venerable Tier, Ning Haixin could affect Heavenly Venerates who were two levels higher than herself at most.

Those with that dot of light in their mind seemed to be incomparably extraordinary.
