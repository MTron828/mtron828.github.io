2708 Indestructible Divine Metal Physique

A’mu and the others had all reached their limit.

Originally, Desolate Moon had not been concerned about them at all. That was why he had only sent out a few Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates to besiege them. Killing them sooner or later had been no issue at all. But now that his conspiracy had been ruined by Ling Han, this naturally made him extremely furious. How could he be satisfied without tearing Ling Han to pieces?

With his command, the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates finally unleashed their true battle prowess.

A’mu and the others were forced to retreat. Some were wounded, blood spraying out and shattered bones glistening eerily. Yet those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates did not show any change in expression, and were merely loyally executing the command that they had been issued.

“Ling Han, are you done yet!” A’mu shouted out loudly.

He knew that Ling Han had already been able to kill peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings when he had been only at the Eighth Heaven. Though it was possible by depending on the help of a Heavenly Venerate Tool, it was extremely possible that he could have gained battle prowess of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier now that he had advanced to the Ninth Heaven, being able to defeat Zhuge Xuanming with a single move.

Now, Ling Han would become their only hope.

“Just a while longer.” Ling Han’s hands danced, continuously absorbing the ingredients laid out on the ground. There were still five more to go.

“We can’t hold on for even another instant!” Du Ba roared.

Ling Han sighed, and attached the remaining ingredients to himself. Then, with a move, he threw a punch towards those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Peng!

Not only was his battle prowess at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, he had definitely surpassed these weak versions as well. With a single punch added to the unleashed force from the treasures of A’mu and the others, this instantly became a frightening battle prowess, pushing those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates back again.

“Sword, come!” Ling Han cried lightly, and made a grabbing motion in the direction of the Divine Demon Sword. Xiu! The Divine Demon Sword left Can Yue’s hand on its own, shooting towards Ling Han.

“Haha, let’s battle!”

He moved, brandishing his sword. The Nine Transformations Divine Scroll was already unleashed, causing his attack to become incredibly harsh and powerful.

“Kill him! Kill him!” Desolate Moon screamed from outside. Having his business ruined by Ling Han twice filled him with extreme hatred for the latter.

10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates attacked, their power incomparably heavy.

Yet Ling Han shot out like an arrowhead, meeting them all by himself.

Peng, peng, peng! These attacks all landed on Ling Han, shaking him so badly that his body was trembling.

However, with him as the main force of attack, A’mu and the others finally regained their footing, and managed to maintain their defense.

They were both pleasantly surprised and worried. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Who would have imagined that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would actually be capable of fighting a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and could even surpass the latter in terms of battle prowess at that? They were all super geniuses, but compared with Ling Han, just how large was the gap between them?

But it was clearly impossible that Ling Han was a match for 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates; he was blasted to the point that his body was trembling madly.

Moreover, even if Ling Han could manage to kill these 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, there were still over 90 other Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates standing behind them!

Their only hope was… that Ling Han could last for a while longer, right until the elites from the martial academy arrived.

Peng, peng, peng! Countless attacks landed on Ling Han, but Ling Han did not take even a single step back.

If this was any other time, he would absolutely not be so rash, and take on such attacks head-on. However, he was presently cultivating the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique; it was only that he had not succeeded. Originally, he would have needed time to slowly cultivate it to perfection, but there was no time for that now.

Then he would just have to use the roughest and most direct method.

He would use the attacks of these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates to temper his Indestructible Divine Metal Physique. But the problem now was that with his physique sustaining the attacks of so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, how was he going to survive that?

Very quickly, Ling Han began to throw up blood, his skin cracking, and revealing the white of his bones. He looked extremely terrible.

“Exert more force! Just a bit more!” Desolate Moon howled from outside, his eyes already bloodshot.

“A hideous monster that dares not reveal himself, what are you shouting around for?” Liu Ziyan couldn’t help but rebuke.

Desolate Moon sneered. “Once this brat is dead, you all will have to die with him as well. It would be better for you to think of what to make your last words now!”

“Humph, the martial academy will soon get the news, and there will soon be a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate or even a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate that will arrive. You had best think of how to make your escape.” A’mu and the others were unwilling to show weakness as well.

With Ling Han holding on alone like this, they could also recover some of their vitality, so their confidence naturally returned.

“That is enough time to slaughter all of you,” Desolate Moon declared coldly. It was definite that this mission had failed. He, too, had to think of some way to return to Hysteria’s world, and find a chance for him to start back from the beginning.

He continued to issue commands, and the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates would take turns in the offensive, 10 in a group, continuing to maintain an absolute high pressure on Ling Han. Furthermore, these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates all had no fear of death or injury. Using their injuries to exchange for injuring their enemies, or even taking down their enemy with them… Just how terrifying was that?

Fortunately, Ling Han still had the Divine Demon Sword in hand, and was also helped by the unique terrain here. Otherwise, if over 100 of them attacked him together, even he would very soon be crushed into bits.

‘Faster! Faster!’ Ling Han thought fervently. Under the violent barrage of attacks, his body was also completely “loosened up,” and because he was feeling a strong sense of danger, the rate of his absorption of energy greatly increased.

On the surface of his skin, the five ingredients were rapidly shrinking in size. They were all being absorbed by him.

When these objects had all disappeared, Ling Han released a loud battle cry, and actually surged right into the ranks of those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

‘He’s f*cking crazy!’

A’mu and the others were all dumbfounded. It should be known that the fact that they could last this long was completely because the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had not been able to fully make use of their advantage in numbers, but with Ling Han now jumping headfirst into their ranks, had he become muddleheaded in fever, or was he already just giving up entirely?

Yet Desolate Moon was overjoyed. He hurriedly issued commands, and made adjustments to the military formation of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. He only left behind three Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates to seal off the canyon, while the others were all targeting Ling Han.

The person he hated the most was Ling Han. Furthermore, once he killed Ling Han, wouldn’t the remaining kids be easily dealt with?

“Die!”

Over 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were enough to unleash their might all at once. Pa, pa, pa! The barrage of attacks continued, every single attack fierce and domineering.

Ling Han was hit endlessly. So what if he had the Indestructible Celestial King Physique? Very soon, he had become completely bloody. In fact, not even his shape could be distinguished any longer.

Pure power of Regulation could no longer wound him, but all Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had been tempered by that unique power of the realm. In terms of quality, this was comparable to the fundamental power of the Genesis World, so their destructive power was incredibly frightening.

Hence, when around 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates attacked at the same time, that really was instantly fatal.

Ling Han was beaten horribly, his blood and flesh gone in an instant. His bones were also cracked and broken, as if he was made from paper.

“Hahahaha!” Desolate Moon laughed loudly. He had finally gotten his revenge. Just how many years had he borne this hatred for?

Peng, peng, peng! Broken bones were endlessly flying from Ling Han, and he was very quickly only left with his head.

“The final blow.” A hint of cruelty flashed through Desolate Moon’s eyes. To kill a super freak “personally” gave him great pleasure.

Boom!

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was the first to land a hit. His fist landed on the skull, yet a golden light surged out, turning into a screen that blocked this blow from him.

‘What on earth is going on?

Desolate Moon gaped wide. Could it be that Ling Han could still turn the situation around when he was already in such dire straits?

In front of his eyes that were filled with absolute disbelief, golden light surged continuously from Ling Han’s skull, forming his body, and when the golden light solidified, it formed his bones one after another. They were all formed from incredibly mysterious seals.

Blood and flesh rapidly regrew on Ling Han’s face, and his black hair grew out again, reaching his waist. His hair was still flickering with a crystalline luster.

Ling Han broke into a grin. “Thanks!”

Indestructible Divine Metal Physique, success.
