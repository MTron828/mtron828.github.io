“Alright, I’ll leave this important matter to you.” Meng Dong nodded and handed the thing in his hand to Ba Duo. “This time, the leader will be Ba Duo.”

A smug look appeared on Ba Duo’s face. See, he was the one who was more trusted by the Lord.

Ling Han was slightly surprised because it was obvious from Ba Duo’s expression that he was wholeheartedly working for Hysteria, and even found a sense of honor in it.

He was already a Heavenly Venerate, so how could he have such thoughts?

Heavenly Venerates were high and mighty, and they had already transcended everything. However, Ba Duo was passionate about working for Hysteria, and would even become jealous over this. This was extremely unbelievable.

Yes, it was a little like a few sons fighting for favor as they tried to please their father.

“Alright, I wish you success in advance. I’ll prepare a celebratory feast for you and wait for your return.” Meng Dong smiled.

“Let’s go, prodigy,” Ba Duo said to Ling Han.

Ling Han stepped forwards, and when he was close to Ba Duo, he suddenly threw a punch. Peng! Firstly, Ba Duo had not expected him to suddenly attack. Secondly, Ling Han’s strength was much stronger than his. How could he possibly dodge?

He directly fell to the ground, feeling dizzy and was unable to get up immediately.

Ling Han did not take advantage of the situation to push his advantage. Instead, he calmly said, “Watch your words. If it weren’t for our Lord, I would have already killed you.”

Meng Dong originally wanted to make a move, but seeing that Ling Han didn’t take any further action, and that Ba Duo was only beaten to the ground, he gave up on the idea of making a move. He said, “Ling Han, we’re all on the same side. Don’t hurt the harmony between us.”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “As long as no one is being despicable, I won’t be overbearing, either.”

Ba Duo finally recovered. He got up, and when he heard Ling Han’s words, he was instantly enraged. Wasn’t this just saying right to his nose that he had been asking for a beating?

“Alright, alright!” Meng Le stopped him in time. “Let’s go. Don’t delay our Lord’s important matter.”

The corners of Bardo’s mouth twitched, but he didn’t say anything else. Instead, he turned around and left.

Ling Han followed nonchalantly, and it wasn’t until the two of them had disappeared that Meng Dong finally looked up at the sky, and muttered, “Little Brother, are you guilty or innocent? This time, I should be able to test you.”

Ling Han followed Ba Duo, his pace neither too fast nor too slow.

Actually, if he was allowed to travel freely, he could quickly transmigrate through the Void. This was because the power in his body could reflect the various dimensions and allowed him to leap freely through the Void. This was unlike Ba Duo, who could only reflect the Flaming Frost Realm, and had to advance in only one direction.

The Void was an extremely complicated space, and the shortest distance between two points was definitely not a straight line.

Zhou Heng should be waiting for them in the Flaming Frost Realm, Ling Han thought to himself. Previously, when he had sent Ba Duo flying with a slap, it was not for the simple purpose of venting his anger. Instead, he had seized the opportunity to send out a Power of Dimension, condensing it into a doppelganger that had hidden himself in the ground beneath Ba Duo.

There was a large amount of stone layers here, and they could cut off the divine sense of Heavenly Venerable Tier. As long as this doppelganger did not actively expose himself, Meng Dong and Ba Duo would not be able to notice anything amiss.

After Meng Dong left, the doppelganger immediately went to look for Zhou Heng, and told him the current situation.

With a cultivation level of Sixth Tier, catching up to them was definitely not difficult.

It wasn’t that Ling Han couldn’t deal with Ba Duo, but if he wanted Ba Duo to be knocked out without being able to even react, then he definitely didn’t have the strength to achieve such a feat.

After traveling through the Void for thousands of years, they finally broke through the dimensional barrier and entered their destination, the Flaming Frost Realm.

Hong, Void Energy surged out, but the Power of Dimension immediately repaired itself, cutting off the energy storm from the Void. This created a huge impact, causing Ling Han’s and Ba Duo’s body to tremble, and they felt as if their bodies were being twisted.

Right at this moment, an indescribable power struck Ba Duo, and he fainted before he could even react.

Xiu! A figure flashed, and Zhou Heng appeared.

Ling Han was not surprised at all, because it was precisely his doppelganger that had told Zhou Heng to lay in ambush here.

If it were another Heavenly Venerate, it would definitely be impossible for them to achieve this. Only Ling Han, whose body was imbued with the Powers of Dimension, would be able to accurately calculate their exit location.

Moreover, only an elite like Zhou Heng could do it such that Ba Duo could not even react, because this was not as simple as killing him.

Ling Han searched Ba Duo, retrieved the black sphere, and handed it to Zhou Heng.

His body trembled, and he retracted the Power of Dimension he had sent out.

Zhou Heng took the sphere and sensed it carefully. After a while, he revealed a solemn expression. “There’s indeed the power of Hysteria inside. It has a huge corrosive effect. If it’s really thrown into the dimensional core, it will severely weaken the Flaming Frost Realm.”

“Senior, can you replicate it?” Ling Han asked.

He didn’t want to expose his identity just like that, so the best way was to do a switch and throw the forged item into the dimensional core. This way, he could still stay among Meng Dong and the others and probe the identities of others. At the same time, he wouldn’t be weakening the Flaming Frost Realm and helping them do evil.

Zhou Heng shook his head. “This is a power that is unique to Hysteria. I am helpless too.”

Just as Ling Han was feeling disappointed, Zhou Heng said, “However, I’ll immediately make a trip to the Realm Battlefield and ask Master for help. He should be able to neutralize the corrosive effects within.”

He was a man of action, and immediately rushed to the Realm Battlefield.

Meanwhile, Ling Han sat down on Ba Duo’s body, and used his own power to suppress him. Otherwise, how could it be possible to refrain from injuring Ba Duo and at the same time keep him unconscious?

Fortunately, Zhou Heng returned in just over a month.

He returned the black sphere to Ling Han. “The problem has been resolved.”

Ling Han nodded, and placed the black sphere back in its original spot on Ba Duo. Then, he tore open Space and reentered the Void.

He calculated the position accurately and tore open the Void again. Xiu! The two of them flew out. The Power of Dimension cut off the energy storm from the Void, causing a violent tremor.

Ba Duo immediately woke up. In his mind, it was still a month ago, so he naturally took a step forward and landed steadily on the ground.

Ling Han was one step behind him, and also stepped out.

Ba Duo didn’t have the slightest bit of suspicion. The reason why a Sixth Tier had personally made a move was to ensure that Ba Duo wouldn’t notice anything.

Ba Duo strode forward in large strides, heading toward the core of the dimension. Just over 10 days later, they arrived at their destination.

This was actually still quite a distance away, and it was impossible to truly get close. This was the core of a transcendent dimension, and even a Sixth Tier could be killed by it, let alone a mere Third Tier.

Ba Duo took out the black sphere, glanced at Ling Han, and said, “I’m going to throw it in.”

Ling Han frowned, and said, “Cut the crap. Are you asking for a beating?”

Ba Duo was enraged, but he forcibly suppressed it, and raised his right hand. Xiu, this black ball was thrown toward the dimensional core.

...

Peng!

It was impossible for the black ball to come close to the dimensional core at all, and it was immediately shattered by the tremendous force that surged around the dimensional core. However, a black aura surged from it, and it transformed into countless tentacles.
