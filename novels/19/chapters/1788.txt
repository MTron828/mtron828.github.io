Chapter 1789: Genuine Holy Son

Four Divine Fetuses had actually appeared in this place!

It was extremely inconceivable!

“Holy Son Changfeng!” It was unclear who suddenly called this out; even his voice was trembling.

King tiers should be afraid of nothing, yet now his voice was actually shaking. Just how stunned was he?

“Changfeng? Changfeng? Hiss!” Being thus reminded, the others mulled over the exclamation for a while before expressions of shock appeared.

Luo Changfeng, the Holy Son of Thundercloud Palace, and Thundercloud Palace was... a Celestial King Tier force!

This was not unusual then. To become the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier great sect, if you were not a Divine Fetus, you would not be able to even bring yourself to sit in this position.

Yet they had never imagined that the opening of the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm this time round was capable of attracting the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier sect!

Another person stared at that beauty dressed in a tight-fitting suit of red, and exclaimed in a stammering voice, “Zihe Bingyun!”

Zihe was a clan that had existed for who knew how many years, and the founder of the Zihe Clan was still alive even today. That was a being that was truly immortal, an invincible king of the Celestial Realm!

That was right, the Zihe Clan was also a Celestial King Tier force.

Gods, the heirs of two great Celestial King-level forces had actually arrived at the same time. It was no wonder that a four-star battleship had been mobilized.

...The Celestial Realm did not have any five-star battleships, because no one was capable of building them. Celestial Kings were the strongest, and aside from the Source Power that was produced by the heaven and earth, what else could match them?

These were two true king tiers, not only in terms of strength, but also background.

Luo Changfeng swept an eye over the crowd, and showed a smile, appearing to be very easy-going, and said, “Everyone, Fairy Bingyun and I haven’t disturbed you, have we?”

“No, of course not!” Everyone hurriedly shook their heads.

Even if they had, who would actually dare say it out loud?

“We heard that a Mystery Realm just happened to be opening here, and coincidentally, Fairy Bingyun and I were passing by, so we were thinking, why not we, too, enter to learn from the experience,” Luo Changfeng explained smilingly. He really did not have the airs that a Holy Son should have, but should anyone think that he was a pushover just because of this, they would really be too naive.

And only he could speak so casually about a Mystery Realm. It should be known that the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm was incredibly dangerous, and the slightest bit of carelessness could endanger one’s life, but he actually said that they had just been passing by and dropped over for fun.

Seeing Luo Changfeng being so amiable, everyone’s initial expression of nervousness gradually relaxed, and they began to strike up a conversation with Luo Changfeng respectively. This was the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier sect. If they really garnered his favor, they would really manage to stabilize and strengthen their positions as Holy Sons and heirs.

Luo Changfeng was really easy to deal with. He would always be smiling no matter whom he was talking to. On the other hand, Zihe Bingyun was much more aloof, and would present a cool, indifferent demeanor to whomsoever she was facing, unable to bear sparing even one word. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“And this is Fairy Rou?” Luo Changfeng looked towards Bewitching Maiden Rou. Even if he was the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier great sect, he still showed an expression of being incredibly stunned, and the smile on his face also became more pronounced. “Fairy Rou is indeed as beautiful as a celestial maiden, as beautiful as a peach. I have admired you for a very long time, and now that I have met you, I see that you truly live up to your reputation.”

Bewitching Maiden Rou only offered a reserved smile. Even a small sect had its pride. It was absolutely impossible that she would take the initiative to throw herself into his arms just because of a single word from him.

She had just cultivated charm techniques, and was not really a famed courtesan from the brothel.

It was clear that Luo Changfeng was very interested in Bewitching Maiden Rou. Though he was talking to the rest, at least three words in every 10 words from him were directed towards Bewitching Maiden Rou, and his partiality to her was apparent.

Everyone could understand that. Who did not want to keep such a seductive beauty as their mistress?

But who among those gathered here did not want to court Bewitching Maiden Rou? With their flames of jealousy ignited, distance naturally grew between them and Luo Changfeng. Furthermore, they were all king tiers of the present generation. Usually, it would be others that would be courting their favor, and they were indeed not accustomed to courting the favor of another. Thus, the atmosphere gradually cooled.

Luo Changfeng smiled slightly, and suddenly said, “Since the Mystery Realm has not opened yet, why don’t we spar?”

‘You are using this trick too?’

Everyone had come here for the sake of Bewitching Maiden Rou, wanting to teach Ling Han a lesson under the guise of a spar, but now Luo Changfeng had also suggested having a spar. It was clear he had an ulterior motive, and wanted to show off his skill in front of Bewitching Maiden Rou through a spar.

In terms of background, there was not one person here that could compare to Luo Changfeng, but what counted in a spar was actual strength!

As king tiers, which of them would admit that they were inferior to another?

Immediately, everyone looked eager to give it a try.

Luo Changfeng smiled faintly, and said, “I have just advanced into the third severance. How about this then? Both third severance and fourth severance can challenge me, but those below third severance should just watch.”

“I am Qianzhao Tian, peak stage of the third severance. Please provide guidance, Holy Son!” Qianzhao Tian was the first to issue a challenge. Previously, he had been given a really hard time by the Empress, and was presently in anxious need of redeeming his reputation. Of course, even if he was capable of defeating Luo Changfeng, he would still be merciful, and maintain a situation of neither being superior to the other.

In this way, he would redeem his pride, and Luo Changfeng would not be in an awkward position, either.

Luo Changfeng stood, his hands crossed behind his back, and said, “Make your move then.”

Qianzhao Tian was a little indignant. ‘We are both in the third severance, and you are only in the early stage of the third severance, while I am at the peak stage of the third severance, so don’t you think you are a little too arrogant?’ He gave a soft exclamation, and as he channeled his secret techniques, he opened his mouth and spat out a cluster of stars that formed battle blades that struck out towards Luo Changfeng.

Luo Changfeng’s figure suddenly moved. Everyone could only feel their vision blur for a moment, and saw that Luo Changfeng had already landed a punch on that cluster of stars, directly shattering it. Then, he penetrated the shattered stars deeply, and peng, landed a direct punch on Qianzhao Tian’s face.

This punch was really too fast. Qianzhao Tian was actually completely unprepared, and directly toppled over, his face facing skywards.

Luo Changfeng withdrew his fist, and calmly stated, “Next.”

Incredibly domineering!

With this strike, everyone could feel their scalp go numb from the shock. It should be known that Qianzhao Tian was a young king tier. What kind of concept was this? He should be invincible among his peers, and he should have been able to manage a tie even against other king tiers, or at least the victor should only be decided after a few thousand or tens of thousands of moves later.

But now? Luo Changfeng had defeated him with a single move, even if his cultivation level was lower.

Just how big was the gap of power between them?

How could he be this strong?

The Empress’s delicate brows rose slightly as fighting spirit blazed in her.

This was a supreme king tier that had advanced through striking the heaven and earth, and that was why his battle prowess was so strong such that he was capable of being invincible even with a gap of a minor level! Furthermore, he was a Divine Fetus as well. If he further displayed the might of a Divine Fetus, his battle prowess could increase further.

At this moment, no one dared to accept.

They were both Holy Sons and young king tiers, but the gap in battle prowess was like the difference between heaven and earth.

This was the Holy Son that had been produced from a Celestial King Tier great sect!

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s beautiful eyes shone.

As the saying went, beauties would love valiant men, and in the Celestial Realm, elites would be respected by all, and no one was an exception to the rule.

Bewitching Maiden Rou naturally admired elites as well.

To be honest, one would have to at least defeat her in a battle of equals to win her heart, but it was really, really too difficult to accomplish this.

She herself was a king tier, and was a Divine Fetus at that. Even the likes of Fu Gaoyun and Bei Xuanming could only yield to her superiority in front of her. It was just that the Purity Sect had always had the custom of dealing with matters through words rather than relying on fists. Thus, it was very rare that she had the chance to make a move.

Luo Changfeng was definitely stronger than she was in a battle of equals, and it was not just a bit stronger, either. This naturally caused a ripple to arise in her heart.
