2646 Battling Xiao Yingxiong Again

The person sitting cross-legged on the mountain peak was none other than Xiao Yingxiong!

However, this made sense. He wasn’t blood brothers with Gu Heyi or Miao Hua, and they had only entered the Celestial King Graveyard together in order to hunt and kill Ling Han. Thus, when they came across opportunities, they would naturally do what was in their own interests.

However, Ling Han truly hadn’t imagined that Xiao Yingxiong would actually obtain the inheritance of this place before them! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Shua!

At this moment, Xiao Yingxiong suddenly opened his eyes. Two sword projections instantly flashed across them, and there was more so the brilliance of lightning.

He stood up.

Crackle…

His entire body radiated with the might of lightning, and he wore a haughty expression as he looked at Ling Han, and asked, “Have you come here to seek death?”

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t back down, saying, “I coincidentally want to kill you as well. Who knew that I would find you so easily?”

“Haha! Can you?” Xiao Yingxiong said in disdain.

Ling Han smiled faintly, saying, “Gu Heyi has already been killed by me. You’ll be the second!”

“Hmm?” Xiao Yingxiong was slightly astonished. When he was parting ways with Gu Heyi, the latter had already been at the late stage of the Seventh Heaven. After so long, he would have reached the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven no matter what, right? Yet, he was still killed by Ling Han?

Ling Han’s strength had soared again!

However, a proud expression immediately appeared on Xiao Yingxiong’s face as he said, “Gu Heyi is Gu Heyi, and I am me!” As he said this, he didn’t conceal his strength any longer.

Boom!

A devastating aura surged into the surroundings like crashing waves. At the same time, several ribbons of iridescent light also materialized around his body.

One, two, three, four… seven, eight.

Eight ribbons!

He was clearly an Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

“Hahahaha!” Xiao Yingxiong roared with laughter. “You guys have come too late! Not only have I obtained the inheritance of the sword formation, but I’ve even obtained boundless power. I already advanced to the Eighth Heaven 50,000 years ago!”

An Eighth Heaven supreme monarch star who had stabilized their cultivation definitely possessed astonishing battle prowess. They could reach the middle stage or even late stage of the Ninth Heaven in terms of power.

Ling Han was unafraid. He had already stabilized his cultivation, and his battle prowess certainly wasn’t weak, either.

“Stop speaking nonsense. Come battle!” Ling Han immediately drew his sword, and pointed it at Xiao Yingxiong.

“Haha! I’ve advanced to the Eighth Heaven, and I’ve more so mastered a paramount secret technique. I’ll take this opportunity to use you as a blood sacrifice!” Xiao Yingxiong said with arrogance. He hooked his finger, and said, “Come at me.”

Ling Han didn’t hold back.

Peng!

With a bound, he instantly unleashed a terrifying speed, arriving before Xiao Yingxiong in a flash. He then stabbed with his sword.

Weng!

As he attacked, Ling Han’s cultivation was also revealed, with his Sixth Heaven aura suffusing into the surroundings.

“Oh, Sixth Heaven!” Xiao Yingxiong said in astonishment. He genuinely hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would advance so quickly. In fact, Ling Han’s cultivation speed was far quicker than his. How long had passed? Yet, the gulf between them had already been reduced to two levels.

This wasn’t the Mountain River Tier or Severing Mundane Tier, where ingesting any random Celestial medicine could allow one’s cultivation to soar in leaps and bounds.

It was only because Xiao Yingxiong had obtained great opportunities—the United Origin Manifestation Fruit could allow Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to become Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and this sword mountain had more so accumulated power for heaven knows how many years—that he had advanced from the Sixth Heaven to the Eighth Heaven.

After a brief moment of astonishment, he quickly recovered his fervent killing intent. This young person was even more talented than him, so he definitely couldn’t be left alive. Otherwise, there would eventually come a day when Xiao Yingxiong was surpassed.

Xiao Yingxiong drew his spear, and used it like a staff.

Peng, peng, peng!

As he swung his spear, the Regulations in the surroundings were instantly sent into disarray. This was due to both his own power and the power of the Celestial Tool.

Through what did Celestial Kings display their might?

Regulations!

Now, however, the Regulations had already been sent into chaos, so how could they still be used?

Xiao Yingxiong’s strike directly targeted the foundation, highlighting his experience and tact in battle.

He smiled coldly. With his first strike, he had already gained an upper hand using his superior cultivation level. Afterward, he would follow up with a flurry of relentless attacks and completely shatter Ling Han’s defenses.

Ding!

The Divine Demon Sword struck the spear, causing numerous symbols to pulsate. This was a clash between the Great Dao. Neither of them retreated. They were evenly matched?

Xiao Yingxiong was truly astounded at this moment. Ling Han actually possessed the power to rival him?

How was this possible?

The Regulations had already been scattered by him, so where had Ling Han obtained his power from? One had to realize that without the help of Regulations, Celestial Kings would fall to the level of the Severing Mundane Tier.

Ling Han unleashed his power, shaking his right arm.

Peng!

Xiao Yingxiong was instantly sent flying.

He brandished his sword, saying, “So what if I’m at the Sixth Heaven?”

Xiao Yingxiong was rendered speechless for a moment. He then said, “Now I truly believe that you killed Gu Heyi! Your Body Art is astonishing, and combined with the power of Regulations, your strength is no weaker than mine.”

He was a supreme monarch star, so if he refused to admit even this, he couldn’t have made it to such a lofty height.

“However, I can still kill you!” His eyes gleamed with a divine light, showing off his confidence.

Ling Han roared with laughter. “Don’t say things the wrong way around. I’m the one who’s going to kill you!”

“In your dreams!” Xiao Yingxiong said as he stabbed with his spear.

While in the martial academy, even though there was a notion of strong and weak among Xiao Yingxiong, Gu Heyi, and Miao Hua, the gap between them had been narrow and almost insignificant. After advancing to the Eighth Heaven and stabilizing his cultivation, however, Xiao Yingxiong’s battle prowess was far superior to Gu Heyi’s.

Xiao Yingxiong’s spear stabbed, swept, and pushed, controlling the Regulations in a terrifying display.

Ling Han was at an absolute disadvantage in terms of wielding the Regulations. There was no way for him to make up for the two-level gap between them. However, his Body Art was far too powerful, and it didn’t need to rely on external power. There was no need to borrow power from heaven and earth, and this was genuinely power that he possessed.

He swung his Divine Demon Sword, with his left hand casting the Three Lightning Technique. He launched a barrage of chaotic attacks at Xiao Yingxiong.

“Huh? You also mastered this kind of lightning technique?” Xiao Yingxiong exclaimed in astonishment. He hadn’t obtained similar inheritances before, and it was only after arriving here that he had coincidentally obtained this inheritance.

However, Ling Han had surprisingly mastered similar lightning techniques as well. Even though they were slightly different, it was extremely clear that they were derived from the same origin.

“Haha! I’m going to kill you and then search your soul! I’m going to obtain all of these inheritances!” Xiao Yingxiong said with roaring laughter.

Ling Han chuckled coldly. “Keep dreaming!”

Xiao Yingxiong didn’t reply. Instead, he unleashed the full power of his spear.

Ling Han wasn’t weak, either, with his battle prowess being no inferior to that of Xiao Yingxiong. Moreover, the Divine Demon Sword was also superior to ordinary Celestial Tools.

After several thousand exchanges, there was a clang as an edge of the Celestial Spear was chipped.

Xiao Yingxiong was deeply astonished, and he hurriedly chased after the chipped piece. However, he was blocked by Ling Han and unable to retrieve it.

After a period of struggle, the chipped piece was eventually obtained by Ling Han.

Xiao Yingxiong wore a pained expression. That was Divine Metal!

Even though it was a chipped piece, Divine Metal possessed the ability of regeneration. Thus, with enough time, this piece could eventually fuse back together with the spear. Now that Ling Han had obtained it, however, unless Xiao Yingxiong killed the former, he would be unable to get it back.

Both were Celestial Tools, so how was his inferior to Ling Han’s?

“Perhaps… that sword was forged from Devouring Metal?” he said in deep astonishment. Only Devouring Metal could engulf Divine Metal to raise its level, thereby exceeding the level of Divine Metal and eventually becoming Heavenly Venerable Tier metal.

He wore an expression of extreme envy as he looked at Ling Han.

That was Devouring Metal! Something that could eventually become Heavenly Venerable Tier metal! Yet, it was now in the hands of a Sixth Heaven Celestial King! Just how fortunate was he?

Did this signify the blessing of heaven and earth?

Xiao Yingxiong took a deep breath. What did it matter even if Ling Han were blessed by heaven and earth? Xiao Yingxiong possessed absolute strength, so he would take it for himself!
