Chapter 1946: Our Respects to Senior Uncle

Liu Han was infuriated, and she said, “You’re retrieving an alchemical pill from him, and you’re pretending that you refined it yourself?”

“Stupid girl,” Ling Han said in disdain.

Liu Han raised her brows, and questioned, “What did you say?” Her fury was extremely evident.

“You didn’t hear? Stupid girl, stupid girl, stupid girl!” Ling Han repeated himself three times.

Liu Han exploded in anger, and she could barely contain herself from lunging over to bite Ling Han. From her childhood until now, since when had anyone ever called her a stupid girl? Not only was she a prodigy in cultivation, but she was also breathtakingly beautiful. In fact, she was regarded as the second most beautiful woman in the Wide Prosperity Heaven. As such, it was natural for men to stare at her in awe when they saw her.

‘You blind fool.’

“That’s mine! Mine!” Ran Fei hurriedly shouted. If he didn’t resist, the truth would quickly be revealed.

“Yours?” Ling Han scoffed. “Are you not aware that alchemists have a habit of adding their own symbols into their alchemical pills?” He funneled some Origin Power into the alchemical pill, causing it to light up. One could faintly discern the word “Ling” on the alchemical pill.

Commotion instantly swept through the crowd of onlookers.

This was as clear as could be. This alchemical pill definitely belonged to Ling Han. Otherwise, why would Ran Fei engrave the word “Ling” on an alchemical pill that he had refined? Perhaps he harbored some deep feelings for Ling Han?

Ran Fei was instantly rendered speechless, and his face flushed beet red. It was naturally humiliating to be exposed before so many people.

Liu Han was also rendered speechless. As it turned out, Ling Han had truly been wronged.

“Perhaps Brother Ran accidentally put the wrong alchemical pill away,” Zhu Zijun said. He casually cleared Ran Fei of any wrongdoing.

However, were the onlookers fools? They were all up in arms upon hearing this. Zhu Zijun was far too shameless. He had been trying so hard to defame Ling Han just then, yet he was now trying to rid himself of any responsibility. They had never come across such a shameless person before.

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered dealing with these matters at this moment, so he said, “Who else is an alchemist? Please appraise this alchemical pill for me.”

“Leave it to me,” Liu Jie said with a smile. “Although I’m not an alchemist, I do understand alchemy quite well. At the very least, appraising an alchemical pill won’t be an issue.”

Ling Han glanced at him before nodding, and saying, “Then I’ll leave it to Brother Liu.”

He handed the alchemical pill over. Liu Jie held it in his hands and carefully examined it for a moment before saying, “This is a Jade Cloud Pill, and among two-star alchemical pills, it’s one of the most difficult to refine. The refinement of this pill has probably reached a high grade. In terms of Spirit Refinement... it’s reached the Third Refinement!”

‘What? Third Refinement?!’

Everyone gasped upon hearing this. Even if they didn’t understand the difficulty of refining the Jade Cloud Pill, they were well aware of what three Spirit Refinements signified.

The Fourth Refinement was the limit of most alchemists, and those who reached the Fifth Refinement could be referred to as grandmasters!

This person was far too freakish. In the realm of cultivation, he had reached the position of monarch tier. Meanwhile, in the realm of alchemy, he had also reached the Third Refinement. He was already closing in on the title of grandmaster.

Most importantly, Ling Han was still far too young. By reaching the Third Refinement at such a young age, it was not a pipedream for him to reach the Fifth Refinement.

Yan Wei was stupefied upon hearing this. His opponent had refined a more difficult alchemical pill than him, and he had also done so to a higher grade than him. In addition to this, he had even completed more Spirit Refinements than him. This was an absolute pummeling. With a sliver of hope, he asked, “Then what about the quality of the Spirit Refinements?”

“All three Spirit Refinements can be regarded as perfect. The third Spirit Refinement is slightly inferior, though this doesn’t affect the overall quality of the alchemical pill,” Liu Jie replied. He genuinely wasn’t favoring anyone, and he was speaking the absolute truth.

Yan Wei was rendered speechless.

In fact, even if Ling Han’s three Spirit Refinements had only been of ordinary quality, they would have still been superior because of the quantity. This was an absolute advantage. Yan Wei had only been holding onto a sliver of hope, yet this had also been extinguished now.

Ling Han snapped his fingers, and said, “Mo Shuang, collect the winnings.” This was the reason why he had agreed to this competition. Otherwise, there was no way he would have given such a performance before so many people.

Mo Shuang started to excitedly collect the winnings. He had truly struck a gold mine this time—even though there were also some fortunate people who had wagered for Ling Han, to whom he had to give a share of the winnings.

This caused many people to glare at Ling Han and Mo Shuang in anger. These two people had screwed them over very badly. Ling Han was clearly so talented in alchemy, yet he had still pretended to be a noob. He had treated them as sheep for slaughter.

However, a loss was a loss, and there was nothing they could say. With their position and status, they certainly couldn’t argue about this.

“Now, it’s time to deal with the next matter,” Ling Han said. He looked at Zhu Zijun, and continued, “You people swapped my alchemical pill out. As your senior, it’s my responsibility to discipline you. Otherwise, others will think that the Zi Cheng branch of alchemists has no rules!”

He wore a baleful expression as he said this.

Zi Cheng!

Who was the most renowned alchemist in the Eastern Celestial Realm?

It was none other than Grandmaster Zi Cheng!

Perhaps... Ling Han was Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s disciple? Hang on, was Grandmaster Zhu Feng also Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s disciple?

Because Grandmaster Zhu Feng had been expelled by Grandmaster Zi Cheng, few people knew about his history. Now that everyone heard Ling Han saying this, they finally discovered the relationship between Grandmaster Zhu Feng and Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

Zhu Zijun’s expression instantly changed. Ran Fei and Shi Yong were of a later generation, so they didn’t know about the relationship between Grandmaster Zhu Feng and Grandmaster Zi Cheng. However, Zhu Zijun was well aware of this relationship.

Now that Ling Han had mentioned Grandmaster Zi Cheng, it was clear that he also had a deep relationship with him.

“Absolute nonsense!” Ran Fei and Shi Yong chided in unison. Ran Fei was extremely fervent, especially since he had been pummeled and humiliated in public by Ling Han. He detested Ling Han to the core.

“Oh, really?” Ling Han said calmly. “Then why don’t you go and ask Peng Huanian? I’m curious to see what he’ll say.”

“You still want to take advantage of my master?” Ran Fei jumped up, and said, “You f*cking—”

Pa!

Before Ran Fei could even finish speaking, he was brutally slapped across the face by Zhu Zijun. “Shut up!” Zhu Zijun chided in anger. Ran Fei had no option but to swallow his words.

He couldn’t help but look at Zhu Zijun with an aggrieved expression. Why had he suddenly slapped him?

Zhu Zijun was just about to speak, yet he suddenly sensed a familiar aura. He immediately turned around to glance behind him. Not far away, there were two middle-aged men quickly walking over. One was extremely tall, and one was both short and fat. He looked much like a round ball.

“Uncle Ma, Uncle Chen,” he hurriedly said in greeting after faltering for a brief moment. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

These two middle-aged men were Ma Yong and Chen Dong. Both of them were disciples of Zhu Feng, and they had more so obtained his true inheritance. However, they were still slightly inferior when compared to Peng Huanian. In any case, they were both Three-Star Alchemists.

Ma Yong and Chen Dong only nodded in acknowledgment before quickly finding Ling Han from among the crowd. They hurriedly stepped forward and bowed in respect, saying, “Our respects to Fourth Uncle.”

Fourth Uncle!

Commotion instantly swept through the crowd of onlookers. At this moment, no one would doubt Ling Han anymore. Ling Han was indeed Zhu Feng’s junior brother. Otherwise, it was impossible for both Ma Yong and Chen Dong to go stupid at once.

A grim expression spread across Zhu Zijun and the others’ faces. This confirmation of Ling Han’s identity was not good news for them. It signified that they would be targeted in the future. They were in for a world of hurt.
