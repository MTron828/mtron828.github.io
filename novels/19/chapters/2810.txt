2811 I am Hong Huang

Ling Han turned around to take a look, and saw there was a total of seven people behind him.

‘Huh?

Ling Han’s eyes set on one of them, and a hint of disbelief appeared in his gaze because this should be a man that could not possibly be alive.

…Hong Huang!

Ling Han remembered that he had flipped out at the Two Realm Battlefield of the Celestial Realm, and killed Hong Huang.

After killing Hong Huang, Ling Han then entered into the Foreign Realm, and began his next adventure.

How could a dead man… come back to life?

Could it be that it was only someone who resembled him?

This was not impossible, because with how big the world was, and how many living beings there were, it was not strange to have a similar appearance.

However, this man was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so how had he managed to come here?

There were only two possibilities. Firstly, he might have some kind of rare treasure that could protect him as he made his way here, or secondly, there was an elite that was taking care of him.

Curiosity rose up in Ling Han as he stared at this man that very much resembled Hong Huang.

“Hey, I was talking to you!” a Heavenly Venerate shouted at Ling Han. He was very young, and had advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier not long ago. He lacked the necessary steadiness, and still had the arrogance of youth.

Ling Han glanced at him. “Oh, what do you want to say?”

“Nothing much. It’s just that we were just walking peacefully, yet you suddenly howled out of nowhere, which gave us a shock. Hence… how do you plan on compensating us?” another Heavenly Venerable Tier asked. He was not as dramatic as the first Heavenly Venerate that had spoken, but his arrogance could not be concealed, either.

He was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate who had cultivated countless years more than the first Heavenly Venerate, but Heavenly Venerates were all proud, and his features were filled with an air of superiority that could not be concealed.

Ling Han laughed. “Then how do you guys want me to compensate you?”

“Sing a song or give us a dance,” the first Heavenly Venerate said laughingly. He turned back to look at the others, yet won the smiling nods of quite a number of people.

Heavenly Venerates could not be insulted, but that was the attitude of mortals towards Heavenly Venerates. When a Heavenly Venerate dealt with another Heavenly Venerate, it was completely dependent on who was stronger. The powerful could do whatever they liked, and this was the reality of the world.

“Haha, I have never seen a Heavenly Venerate dance or sing before, so this is a good suggestion.” That Second Tier Heavenly Venerate rubbed his hands and laughed. “Little Jin, that was a good idea.”

The first Heavenly Venerate was proud and self-satisfied, as if he had done something impressive.

Among the seven people, there was only one Heavenly Venerate who bore an aloof expression, incredibly proud, as if there was nothing in this world that could make his expression change. However, he did indeed have the right to be proud because he was the only Third Tier in their group of seven.

“Hey, come and sing?” Heavenly Venerate “Little Jin” shouted at Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head. Was he really a magnet for trouble? This time, he really did not have the slightest intention of trifling with anyone.

“Whose brat are you? Haven’t your elders taught you that you should not cause trouble for yourself?” Ling Han turned to look at that Little Jin, his expression filled with disdain.

Little Jin couldn’t help but feel infuriated. ‘We are both at the First Tier, yet you actually dare lecture me like an aged and experienced elder. Just who do you think you are?’

“How dare you!!” he yelled, and stretched a hand to grab out at Ling Han.

Similarly being a First Tier, he naturally had no fear of Ling Han.

Ling Han gave a casual swipe, and the attack that Little Jin had launched was dispersed. He did not even cast a second look, and set his eyes on the only Ninth Heaven Celestial King in their group. “You look somewhat familiar to me. Tell me, what is your name?”

“Damn you!!” Little Jin flew into a thunderous rage. Ling Han actually dared to treat him so condescendingly.

He roared in fury, and was about to attack again.

Ling Han’s eyes became harsh, and he glared at Little Jin. “Don’t be ungrateful and seek your own death!”

Little Jin felt his whole body grow cold from this glare, all the power inside his body dispersing without a trace. He felt like even his bones had become weak, and almost wanted to flop onto the ground.

Ling Han looked towards that Ninth Heaven Celestial King with a smile, and asked, “What is it? Can’t you talk?”

“Sir, you are too arrogant!” a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate spoke up. The strength of their group was actually extremely high, having one Third Tier, three Second Tiers, and two First Tiers. That Ninth Heaven Celestial King needed not be mentioned; he was purely a minor role.

However, were six Heavenly Venerates not awesome enough? Whatever the case, Ling Han was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han shook his head. “Why is there always someone that wants to interrupt me?”

“I am Lu Xuanting, Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!” that Second Tier Heavenly Venerate said darkly, and revealed his own cultivation level, intending to intimidate Ling Han. A mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate was nothing in front of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Things were different now as compared to the past, when all Heavenly Venerates had to unite together. Instead, they had now formed separate groups working for their own benefits, everyone motivated by their own desires.

…There were indeed more than half of the Heavenly Venerates that had returned to their respective dimensions, and it was possible only 10-20% of them had stayed behind. But how many Heavenly Venerates had there been here? Even if it was only 10-20% of them, that would be a shocking number.

Ling Han gave an oh, and retorted, “So what if you are Second Tier? Is that very amazing?”

A muscle involuntarily jerked in Lu Xuanting’s cheek. Was this person an idiot?

‘A Second Tier is naturally amazing; I can easily crush you!

‘How can you still act so arrogantly?’

“You are truly arrogant!” Lu Xuanting exclaimed menacingly. Initially, they had only wanted to make fun of Ling Han, and had not planned to kill Ling Han. However, Ling Han actually acted so arrogant, which made his killing intent flare.

So what if he killed him? It was not wartime now.

Ling Han nodded. “I am not targeting you guys, but I have always maintained this kind of attitude towards trash.”

When these words fell, it was not only Lu Xuanting’s furious expression that became more pronounced. Even that Third Tier Heavenly Venerate that had maintained an expression of disdain raised a brow, and tossed a glare at Ling Han.

Ling Han really was courting death.

“Since you think that your life is too long, I shall help you end it!” Lu Xuanting moved, pressing his hand down on Ling Han.

His heart was filled with disdain towards Ling Han. He simply threw a straight punch that headed straight for Ling Han’s face.

If a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate did not even have that bit of confidence against a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, then what right would he have to be called a Heavenly Venerate?

Ling Han remained motionless, and it wasn’t right until this punch was close to reaching him that he suddenly shot out his foot in a kick.

Peng! Lu Xuanting was thus sent flying, turning into a tiny black dot in an instant.

...

Uh!

The remaining six people all had gaping mouths, showing expressions of absolute disbelief.

What was going on here? A Second Tier Heavenly Venerate had actually been sent flying with a kick from a First Tier Heavenly Venerate?

What justice was there left in this world? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They were all stunned. Even Lu Xuanting could not withstand a single blow from Ling Han; then it would be the same result if it was any of the other two Second Tiers.

That Third Tier Heavenly Venerate finally set his eyes on Ling Han, and said, “I have underestimated you. As it turns out, you have such great strength. No wonder you are so arrogant!”

Ling Han broke into a smile. “I’m so-so, but it is no problem for me to beat up trash.”

Those six people all looked furious. F***, they had been called trash again.

But Ling Han had not specifically referred to anyone. If they thought this was an insult to them, wasn’t that just inviting more insults?

That Third Tier Heavenly Venerate began proudly, “I am Ping Xinghai—”

However, he had just started talking when Ling Han stretched out his hand, signaling for him to be silent, and causing his words to come to an abrupt stop.

...

‘What is it? Are you scared now?’

Ping Xinghai revealed a hint of arrogance, yet saw that Ling Han had already turned his face towards that Ninth Heaven, and asked, “You still have not answered me. What is your name?”

Instantly, the hint of pride on Ping Xinghai’s face was frozen, and he became extremely embarrassed.

…The other man was not taking him seriously at all!

That Ninth Heaven Celestial King first glanced at Ping Xinghai, then smiled, and answered, “My name is Hong Huang!”
