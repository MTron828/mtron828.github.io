3025 Chapter 3027 The Idiots’ Challenge

What a bunch of idiots!

The large black dog was so angry he wanted to bite someone’s head off. Even though he was very vile and despicable, it seemed as though the rabbit and the old ginseng were not far behind.

“Get lost!” He sent the rock golem flying with a kick.

Fortunately, he didn’t use too much strength. Else, the rock golem would have become a pile of rubble by now.

“Grandpa Dog, you are so cool and awesome. That kick was superb!” The rabbit quickly hugged the large black dog’s thigh and buttered him up.

“Go away. Don’t dirty Grandpa Dog. Let little ginseng be the one to hug his thigh!” The old ginseng excitedly approached.

“Get lost!”

“You’re the one who should get lost!”

The two idiots were at each other’s throats, and had nothing but contempt for one another. It was quite the commotion.

The rock golem made its way back. After having suffered the wrath of the large black dog, it had no choice but to crouch sadly by Ling Han’s feet like a small puppy.

Ling Han shook his head. These three were absolute idiots. Little Qing was better. It flew high in the sky with its wings, and didn’t want to be associated with the three idiots.

“Hehe!” Chen Ruijing, Jiang Yuefeng, and the other disciples chuckled.

Of the eight disciples, only Fu Tianxing was absent. This was because his cultivation level was too high; Ling Han didn’t want him to scare everyone off.

“Halt!” Suddenly, someone stood before them, and called out, “Identify yourselves!”

The person before them was a Celestial King. Even though there was only a single ribbon of iridescent light surrounding him, he was still a Celestial King, someone who could be called an apex existence no matter where he went.

However, he was actually just a guard here. What extravagance!

But further thought would remind one that this was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate’s place of enlightenment. As such, it was not so surprising for a Celestial King to work as a guard.

“We’re here to issue a challenge!” The rabbit immediately hopped out—yes, it indeed hopped out. Even its ears were perked up.

What was going on?

The Celestial King was confused. A rabbit just came, and said that it was here to issue a challenge?

“Hahaha!” He broke out laughing. This was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate’s place of enlightenment. A mere First Heaven Celestial King like you dared to say that you wanted to issue a challenge?

It was hilarious. This was more than just overestimating one’s own strength. It was the pinnacle of folly.

“What’s so funny?!” The old ginseng barked. With a flick of its tendrils, it spat at that Celestial King, and said, “This is your Grandpa Ginseng’s treasured fluid. Be thankful for the blessing, brat!”

Ling Han was speechless. Even after becoming a Celestial King, this old ginseng was still as brash as before.

Even if it were treasured fluid, that Celestial King wouldn’t tolerate such humiliation, let alone that it was just saliva. After all, it wasn’t as if it was bestowed gracefully upon him. It was spat, and thus carried an intent to shame.

That Celestial King quickly dodged to the side. There was no facing such an attack directly.

The old ginseng was ecstatic at the sight. Pu, pu, pu! It constantly spat at the Celestial King, and its saliva rained down like a giant squall.

That Celestial King hastily released a shield of light and blocked all the spit.

However, the old ginseng’s saliva was not just an attempt to gross him out. It also carried a strong corrosion effect, which quickly broke down the shield of light.

That Celestial King was horrified. He never thought that not only was old ginseng a vile character, it also had actual skills.

He had no choice but to take the matter seriously. Drawing upon the boundless Regulations, he went head-on against the old ginseng.

The old ginseng was laughing all the way as it continued to launch its attacks. It was not picky with its methods, and used all sorts of underhanded attacks. For example, it spat its saliva upwards in three directions, while its tendrils attacked downwards in another three directions. It was nothing short of vile and despicable.

It was undoubtedly mentally exhausting to fight against a creature like this. That Celestial King was soon yelling in fury, the veins on his forehead popping wildly.

“You shouldn’t come out to sully our eyes if you’re so ugly. Even if you don’t find it shameful, Grandpa Ginseng feels embarrassed for your mother’s sake!” The old ginseng was greatly influenced by the large black dog. Battle strength was not the only thing that could win fights; it had to have a skill in verbal assault as well.

“Why don’t you let Grandpa Ginseng give you a face wash and fix that ugly mug of yours with its treasured fluid?”

That Celestial King was on the verge of vomiting blood from anger. In his wrath, he utilized the Regulations of heaven and earth and merged it with his own strength to form a halberd. He then hacked away at the old ginseng.

“You ungrateful brat! How dare you try to fight back against your Grandpa Ginseng?” The old ginseng leapt up, and said, “By fixing your face, Grandpa Ginseng becomes the parent of your renewed life. So now it’s like you’re trying to kill your own parent. Karma will come back to bite you!

“Grandpa Ginseng will not acknowledge a son like you anymore!”

That Celestial King was completely enraged by the insults; it was as if he was shooting fire out of his eyes. He yelled and attacked even more vigorously.

While his attacks had become more aggressive with rage, they were no longer as fluid as before.

If the old ginseng had had a lower cultivation level than him, then he would have been able to win through this aggressive barrage of attacks. However, with both parties of equal strength, an attack like this would not net him any advantages. Instead, it gave him many openings and made his attacks easy to counter.

The reason why the old ginseng was so talkative was precisely so that it could throw the enemy off balance and make him reveal an opening. Thus, it naturally wouldn’t miss the opportunity now. Grabbing the opponent’s weakness, it started pounding on him relentlessly.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! Several figures suddenly appeared from the place of enlightenment and descended upon them. Each one of them had the strength of a Celestial King.

They didn’t attack. Instead, they crossed their arms, and coldly watched by the side.

If the guard couldn’t even beat someone like the old ginseng, how could he possibly have the gall to remain in the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment?

Naturally, if the guard were to be defeated, the others would step in, defeat, and kill the old ginseng to restore the place of enlightenment’s reputation.

This was a holy ground. No one had the right to disrespect the prestige of the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment.

After several hundred clashes, that Celestial King was eventually defeated. He took a massive blow to the chest, and was vomiting blood endlessly.

“Sigh, it’s so lonely to be unbeatable!” The old ginseng was completely beside itself with delight. It looked very much like a person right now, with its tendrils wrapping around one another to form arms and legs. At the moment, it tucked its arms behind its back and shook its head.

However, no one was supporting its banter, which made the situation a little awkward.

“Hey, why isn’t anyone clapping?” It asked.

Pa, pa, pa! The large black dog and the rabbit clapped half-heartedly. They were just here to watch the commotion, and didn’t care if things got serious.

The old ginseng was suddenly happy again, puffing its chest out with an arrogant look on its face.

“Get lost, you pathetic weakling,” It waved its hand dismissively at the Celestial King.

That Celestial King had a livid expression on, but when he wanted to stand up for a rematch, someone sent him flying with a kick.

It was a Third Heaven Celestial King. He mocked, “How embarrassing to not even be able to defeat an anomaly.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What’s that brat? Did you grow your mouth on your asshole?” The old ginseng stomped. “Don’t you know how to say nice words? Whom did you call an anomaly? You’re the anomaly here. In fact, your whole face looks like an anomaly.”

That Third Heaven Celestial King was taken aback. However, his surprise was soon replaced by anger.

He had only said one thing, and it was the truth. He thought, ‘You’re just a Celestial medicine that took on a different form, no, you didn’t even take on a different form, just have the vague silhouette of a human being. What are you if not an anomaly?’

“You have a very dirty mouth!” he coldly said, and then struck at the old ginseng with his palm.

Against a Third Heaven Celestial King, the old ginseng would not be able to hold a candle.

“Save me! The son is trying to kill his old man!” The old ginseng immediately took off and ran towards Ling Han.

The Third Heaven Celestial King was furious. The son was killing his old man?

What a vile ginseng. Did it bathe its mouth in a sewer or something?

He grunted angrily and focused Regulations into the form of a sword, and then started slashing at the old ginseng.
