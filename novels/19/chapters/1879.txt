Chapter 1880: Alchemist test

Hadn’t you come here to show support?

The middle-grade trainee couldn’t understand. Why had he now come around to demand that Ling Han concoct the alchemical pill of the highest level of difficulty?

But now that the Lord Holy Son had spoken, did he dare raise any doubt? He did not even dare to ask the reason, and directly said to Ling Han, “Then you just concoct the Green Rainbow Pill.”

‘Who knows, it may be that he is specialized in concocting this one?’

Ling Han nodded indifferently.

They came to an alchemy chamber. Ling Han gave his name, and then entered, beginning his path of ascension in alchemy in the Celestial Realm.

Ou Kan sneered. He wanted to show Ling Han that with his help, it would not be any difficult matter for him to get the position of a low-grade alchemy trainee, or even the highest-grade alchemy trainee, but if he was angered? Humph.

In the alchemy chamber, Ling Han had already begun. He started from separately picking out the medicinal ingredients, extracting essence, opening the cauldron, and starting the fire, all done smoothly.

“Amazing!” The middle-grade trainee couldn’t help but praise. One would know with just a comparison. He at least was inferior to Ling Han in these techniques.

They were pleasing to see. This was practically a feast for the eyes.

Ou Kan was also shocked. As it turned out, Ling Han really knew how to concoct alchemical pills.

At first, he had thought Ling Han had just been infuriated by his actions, and had thus blurted out he wanted to take the alchemist test, but it seemed like that was not the case.

Hiss, could it be that he had not come to buy alchemical pills from the start?

True, Lu Xianming should have a very high opinion of this guy. Then, no matter what alchemical pills Ling Han wanted, Lu Xianming would be able to provide them for him. What need was there for Ling Han to personally come to this place?

But there was no perfect being in this world. Everyone had limited energy. Furthermore, Ling Han was far from reaching the pinnacle of cultivation, so how could he possibly have additional time to spend on alchemy?

How had he gained all these abilities?

‘An all-round prodigy? I don’t believe it!’

However, whether Ou Kan believed it or not, in any case, Ling Han had already entered into a brilliant state. Only after less than half a day, a cauldron of Green Rainbow Pills was successfully concocted.

They naturally were of the highest grade.

“Passed!” The middle-grade trainee’s expression was filled with admiration. It was no wonder that this person could be personally accompanied by Ou Kan. No wonder he could concoct the Green Rainbow Pills which were of the highest difficulty level. He did indeed have that ability.

Ou Kan’s expression was incredibly dark. This was practically a slap to his face!

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Next, I wish to continue testing for a middle-grade trainee.”

The middle-grade trainee was not qualified to hold the position of witness further. He immediately went off to make a report, and then three high-grade trainees came.

“Greetings, Holy Son!” They first paid their respects to Ou Kan.

Ou Kan waved them off. At present, he, too, was slightly curious where Ling Han’s limits were.

“Then concoct the Heaven and Earth Unity Pill,” he spoke up.

The three high-grade trainees froze at the same time. The Heaven and Earth Unity Pill had belonged to the category of high-grade alchemical pills a very, very long time ago. However, afterwards, due to certain reasons, it was again categorized as a middle-grade alchemical pill, but this was enough proof of the difficulty level of this alchemical pill.

Ling Han was testing for a middle-grade trainee, and you directly demanded that he concocted what could practically be considered a high-grade alchemical pill. Wasn’t this just making it difficult for him?

But they did not dare to say anything. The Lord Holy Son had spoken, so who would dare draw calamity onto themselves?

Thus, Ling Han began to concoct the Heaven and Earth Unity Pill.

The moment he began, these three high-grade trainees became enchanted, deeply impressed by Ling Han’s movements.

This really was a rookie? He was practically a veteran alchemist with how amazingly skilled he was.

“Passed!” After assessing Ling Han’s completed pill, the three high-grade trainees all gave it a high grade.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “Let’s continue with the test for a high-grade trainee.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Trainees were trainees. Even if they were of the high grade, they could not possibly alert an alchemist. But the number of witnesses had increased from three to 10.

Ou Kan did not speak further from the sidelines. He had finally seen the facts. Ling Han indeed had great accomplishments in the area of alchemy. ‘Forget it, what does it matter if you get authenticated as a high-grade trainee? In any case, you wouldn’t be able to live for too many days more.’

Alchemist?

What a joke. Even if a high-grade trainee wanted to ascend to this level, without over 100,000,000 years of training, that was absolutely impossible. But looking at Ling Han’s flame of life, he couldn’t be over 10,000 years old, so how could that be possible?

Without Ou Kan exerting pressure from the sidelines, the difficulty level of this test naturally dropped sharply. Ling Han could simply concoct any type of high-grade alchemical pill instead of one specific type.

This naturally was just a matter of course for him. The alchemy chamber also had the effects of speeding up time. After merely one day, a high-grade alchemical pill was completed.

“Passed!” The 10 high-grade trainees had long since been impressed by Ling Han’s skill, and showed expressions of admiration without reservations. Their heated and maddened eyes made even Ling Han feel slightly discomfortable.

“I’ll continue with the test for an alchemist,” Ling Han hurriedly said.

‘Hmm?’

When these words were spoken, a dead silence fell over the area.

‘Test for an alchemist? Hiss, you really are so ambitious!

‘Do you know how many alchemists are there even in Alchemy City?’

138,643.

Though it was over 100,000, how big was Alchemy City? This was a Four-Star City, and the population numbered in the millions and millions. Furthermore, these alchemists did not all originate from Alchemy City, but comprised about half the number in the entire Eastern Celestial Realm.

And even then it was just slightly over 130,000.

From this, it was clear how high the requirements were for becoming an alchemist.

What alchemist did not work earnestly a few hundred million, billion, or tens of billions of years as a high-grade trainee? Some were still holding the title of high-grade trainee even until death. Furthermore, this was the fate of the very large majority.

If that was not the case, how could alchemists possess such a high status?

That which was rare was dear, and it was the same for people.

From a certain aspect, alchemists were even rarer than exquisitely beautiful women.

“What is it? I can’t?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“You can take the test, but you will have to concoct Celestial pills, which need the use of Celestial medicine,” a high-grade trainee said. “The pavilion does not provide any Celestial medicine. You have to prepare your own.”

“No problem,” Ling Han answered.

Seeing how resolute Ling Han was, Ou Kan finally showed a hint of wariness.

Could Ling Han really do it?

No one was an idiot. If they did not have some amount of certainty, who would come to the Alchemist Pavilion and fail, be embarrassed, and lose their wealth in public like this?

But to say Ling Han possessed the abilities of a One-Star Alchemist... How could this be believed?

The 10 high-grade trainees exchanged looks, and one of them said, “Fine. However, the alchemist test requires an alchemist to invigilate.” They were not qualified to authenticate an alchemist.

Ling Han nodded.

The alchemist test would create a big commotion.

Just think about it. How many alchemists were there in the whole Alchemy City? And those that could become alchemists would at least have to be in the Severing Mundane Tier, but throughout such extended passage of time, there were actually only a total number of just over 130,000!

Thus, when it was heard that someone was going to undergo the alchemist test, this naturally created a huge commotion. It was possible that this was the rise of a new star. Perhaps this someone was going to become a giant pillar in the future of Alchemy City. Who knew.

To say nothing of alchemists being alerted, even a great many cultivation clans sent out representatives to observe the event. A new alchemist was worth recruiting.

But when everyone found out that the person that was undergoing the alchemist test was Ling Han, they all had about the same thoughts.

‘You have got to be f**** joking?

‘You are a martial arts prodigy here, the man who has defeated Zhao Qingfeng while you yourself are inferior by one minor level, and now you actually went off to concoct alchemical pills, ignoring your proper occupation? Has your head been kicked by a donkey?

‘It is not that being an alchemist is bad, but you can’t put the cart before the horse.

‘If you have so much energy, why aren’t you spending it on cultivation?

‘F*ck!’
