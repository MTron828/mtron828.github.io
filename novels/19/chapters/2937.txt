“Ling Han!” Before Ling Han had left too long, he saw Bai Mifan running towards him.

Thank you readers!

“Hu, it’s good that you’re fine.” He patted his chest. “How was it? Did Xin Qihu save you?”

Ling Han was surprised. “You asked Xin Qihu for help?”

“I first encountered Xin Qihu and told him about the situation… Could it be that he didn’t go and save you?” Bai Mifan was startled.

Ling Han shook his head. “He came, and so did Wu Haoyang.”

!!

“That’s good.” Bai Mifan nodded.

Ling Han was really quite surprised. He had not expected that Xin Qihu would actually step out to save him, which taught him a good lesson.

…In a different situation, if Xin Qihu was the one being hunted down by Hysteria’s army, would he help?

Ling Han pondered for a moment before nodding slowly.

No matter how great the conflict between him and Xin Qihu was, it was still an internal problem. No matter who won or lost, it would not have any adverse effects on the Flaming Frost Realm. However, no matter what the Hysteria army did, as long as they succeeded, they would definitely hurt the Flaming Frost Realm.

Internal strife was one matter, but there had to be a bottom line.

Alright, Ling Han would accept this favor. If Xin Qihu were to fall into a siege of Hysteria’s army in the future, he would save him.

“Come, let’s continue digging for stones.”

The two of them walked around, looking for veins of ore and digging raw stones, and their yield was very bountiful.

100,000 years passed quickly, and it was time for the two of them to return.

They set out on the path of return, and after asking around, they found out that the three Sixth Tiers of Hysteria troops had not been discovered all this while. Who knew what corner they had hidden themselves in.

These creatures had not been killed, and would still be a hidden danger.

Who knew where they would suddenly appear from and deliver a fatal strike.

They traveled through the Void, and only a dozen over years later, the two of them returned to the Realm Battlefield.

Next, they would be switching with a different batch of people who would be going off to explore the Genesis World of the last era.

The Rain Emperor and Ji Wuming were both in this batch, but the Empress and Hu Niu would have to wait. Lin Youlian had also left, which also meant that there was no one here to protect Ling Han. Xin Qihu could do as he liked.

However, it was useless even if Lin Youlian did not leave. Xin Qihu had obtained great benefits in the Genesis World of the last era, and his strength had directly soared to peak-stage Sixth Tier, already surpassing hers.

Ling Han, on the other hand, was unconcerned. His battle prowess had already soared to the Sixth Tier. In this place where cultivation level was suppressed, he was completely capable of charging in and out of Hysteria’s army. Of course, he could not withstand the combined attacks of tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of Fifth Tiers, either. Aside from the undying and indestructible Seventh Tier, even a Sixth Tier would be crushed into dust.

Right now, Ling Han no longer had to worry about encountering Hysteria in the Void, either. With Sixth-Tier battle prowess, even Hysteria’s doppelganger wouldn’t be able to kill him. At most Hysteria’s doppelganger would only be able to wound him slightly.

Since that was the case, Ling Han also gladly obeyed the command, and dived into Hysteria’s base for a round of killing.

Killing these monsters couldn’t provide life essence, but the Power of Dimension in Ling Han’s body was like a millstone. While dispersing these attacks, it could also transform a portion of the attacking power into his nutrition.

It should be known that the hardest thing about improving Ling Han’s cultivation level was the growth of these infinite Powers of Dimension inside his body. Now, these dimension seeds could absorb their own nutrients. This naturally made Ling Han happy.

He distributed the Great Herbs and Heavenly Venerable Seals that he had obtained from the Genesis World of the last era among the Empress and the others. Of course, there was also a share for Bai Mifan.

Before this area became completely neutral, Hysteria’s army obviously wouldn’t attack. This was also a rare opportunity for them to improve their strength. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Aside from battling, Ling Han also continued to cultivate in seclusion.

Although there were fewer and fewer Heavenly Venerable Seals that he could obtain from the Genesis World of the last era, it still allowed the number of seals he had mastered to reach as many as 300. When he channeled them together, his cultivation speed increased by close to 2000 times.

There was no need to concern himself with the Power of Dimension in his body, so Ling Han’s cultivation progress naturally increased. He had hopes of reaching the peak stage of the Fourth Tier in 200,000,000 – 300,000,000 years.

Meanwhile, the seeds that had already evolved into dimensions in his body were also rapidly growing.

100,000 years later, the second batch of people returned, and the third batch set out. The Empress and Hu Niu were both included in this batch.

Ling Han reminded the two women to be careful, while he continued to battle at Hysteria’s base to improve his Power of Dimension.

Merely after 700,000 years, the dimensions inside Ling Han’s body had completely caught up with his cultivation level.

He was still in the early stage of the Fourth Tier. If there had been a gap of 100 steps between the early stage of the Fourth Tier and the middle stage, he would have taken about two steps by now. However, even though he had only just achieved minimal progress, it increased the upper limit of the number of dimensions he could accommodate to as many as 200.

By now, these dimensions had all reached medium-level, and were close to high-level. If they were released all at once, even only as projections, they would be extremely shocking.

The Empress and Hu Niu had long since returned, and after 1,000,000 years, it was finally Ling Han’s turn to go to the Genesis World of the last era again.

But before they could set out, they had no choice but to postpone their plans.

That was because Hysteria’s army had finally launched an attack. A boundless army charged over, and those densely packed numbers caused one’s scalp to go numb with terror.

Yet Ling Han was not concerned at all. He took the initiative to charge out, and released 20 dimensional projections in a single stroke.

Now, these dimensions were all close to high-level, and even Fifth Tiers would be affected slightly, while Fourth Tiers would be directly smashed to the ground. Ling Han shot out a punch, and over 1,000 Hysteria troops were instantly crushed and killed.

Seeing that he was so violent and powerful, everyone was stunned, but they were also filled with excitement.

With a genius like Ling Han standing guard, what was Hysteria’s army worth?

It was not just Ling Han. Xin Qihu, Wu Haoyang, and Lin Youlian also displayed world-shaking strength.

Though Feng Wuding had been repeatedly robbed by Ling Han, making him look weak, he was in truth a prodigy that was only inferior to Ling Han. The advancement of his cultivation level was frightening as he had already reached the middle stage of the Fourth Tier. Although his battle prowess had yet to reach the Sixth Tier, he could already sweep aside all other Fifth Tier elites.

It had to be admitted that the Genesis World of the last era had really helped them greatly.

In this battle, though the Flaming Frost Realm did not have the advantage of the dimensional suppression, Ling Han, Xin Qihu, and the other prodigies were too awesome. Their presence had the effect of stabilizing the situation, and they actually managed to defend their base successfully.

Though they had paid the price of over 100 Heavenly Venerates dying in battle, and more than 2,000 were severely wounded, a great victory still made everyone feel satisfied, and gave rise to a strong confidence.

Finally, their only path was not just retreat; they could also stand their ground.

After a great victory, everyone hurriedly took advantage of the time to rest and reorganize. Now that they had not given up their base, it also meant that Hysteria’s army could possibly launch an attack not too long after.

Ling Han’s journey could only be postponed indefinitely as well. At present, there was definitely no way he could leave.

As expected, only a few years later, Hysteria’s army attacked again, but was forced back. In the past, there were only Xin Qihu and the other two great elites, but adding Ling Han and Feng Wuding, two people with Sixth-Tier battle prowess, now had a tremendous influence on the battle.
