Chapter 1049: A Tongue like an Arrow

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

One day passed, and the day of Ling Han and Wu Ziren’s battle finally arrived.

This battle was to be held in the Iron Blood Stadium, and battling in this stadium meant that one would be fully responsible for their own life and death. The competitors didn’t need to have mercy in battle, for they wouldn’t be liable to any consequences even if they killed their opponent.

The Iron Blood Stadium was filled to the brim for this battle, with many people standing tiptoe so they could catch a glimpse of the battle.

The Iron Blood Stadium didn’t normally have standing tickets. However, this battle had attracted far too many people, with entrance tickets having already reached a resale value of 50 True Origin Stones each. Even so, countless people still fought over the tickets.

Shui Yanyu accompanied Ling Han to the stadium, and she couldn’t help but feel shocked when she entered the Iron Blood Stadium. Why were there so many people?

She had come to the Iron Blood Stadium before, but she had never seen it packed so full that not even a single needle could be fitted in. The stadium was truly packed to the brim with people.

Fortunately, the Iron Blood Stadium had sent people to wait for Ling Han as he was one of the competitors today. They immediately took him to a special passageway, allowing him and Shui Yanyu to enter stadium smoothly.

There was still some time until the battle, meaning that Ling Han could still rest for a short while.

“Is that Wu Ziren really an assassin from the Dark Night Hall?” Shui Yanyu had only just learned of this from Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “Almost certainly.”

Shui Yanyu frowned slightly, and said, “The Dark Night Hall has already sent two groups of assassins before this, with even Zhou Gaoyang and Yin Yuanxiang failing to kill you. Mind you, they were both at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

“Although it wasn’t you who killed them, the Dark Night Hall knows nothing of this. Thus, they’ve definitely overestimated your battle prowess. Now that they’re sending Wu Ziren to battle you, I can say with certainty that his battle prowess is definitely above that of Zhou Gaoyang and Yin Yuanxiang!”

Shui Yanyu’s analysis made a lot of sense. Those at the Dark Night Hall were assassins, not retards. Why would they send someone weaker than Ling Han when they knew of his battle prowess already?

Ling Han nodded, and said, “That’s why I’m curious. He’s at the same cultivation level as me, so what tier battle prowess can he reach when he unleashes his full strength?”

“You’re ignoring the dangers just to satisfy your own curiosity?” Shui Yanyu was about to explode in anger. Had this man ever considered her feelings when making this decision? Did he know how worried she was?

“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely be fine.” Ling Han gave Shui Yanyu a light hug. In a rare turn of events, he only hugged her, and didn’t perform any other indecent acts.

Shui Yanyu could only sigh softly. She fixed Ling Han’s collar, and said, “Be careful!”

“I will!” Ling Han’s expression became serious, though what he said next was nowhere near serious. “Go home and prepare yourself. Wait for your husband to come back home and love you!”

Shui Yanyu didn’t scold him this time, and she simply rested in his embrace, and said, “Damn pervert, I know that you’re very powerful and far stronger than those at the same age as you. However, the world is a big place, and anything can happen. You definitely can’t become too arrogant.”

“Mm-hm.” Ling Han patted her slender shoulders lightly.

“Blockhead, it’s time for you to enter the— huh?” Li Weiwei ran over hurriedly, yet she immediately covered her eyes with her hands upon seeing the sight before her. “Aiyah! My eyes!”

“What about your eyes?” Ling Han said with a chuckle. He then turned to Shui Yanyu, and softly said, “I’m going now.”

“I’ll wait for you,” Shui Yanyu replied.

Ling Han nodded, and then strode toward the arena.

Li Weiwei ran over to Shui Yanyu, and whispered, “Sister Shui, did you really fall for that blockhead?”

Although she was embarrassed, Shui Yanyu still nodded in confirmation.

Li Weiwei grimaced in surprise. She had only been mucking around, yet she had somehow managed to bring Ling Han and Shui Yanyu together. She was feeling a little anxious, and asked, “But he’s only an emperor from a small world. Although this sounds impressive, he has no genuine background. Will your family agree to this?”

Shui Yanyu was also troubled by this. Ling Han was supremely talented, and was definitely going to become a supreme elite in the future. However, could the Shui Clan wait that long? After all, Zhao Lun wasn’t going to give up on her easily. How would the Shui Clan react once he lost his patience and became hostile?

“We’ll see how it goes,” Shui Yanyu replied reluctantly.

Li Weiwei pulled her up, and said, “Let’s go. It’s time to witness how that blockhead beats Wu Ziren up.”

The two women naturally didn’t take the same path as Ling Han. Instead, they used their relationship with the Left Minister to enter the VIP stands of the Iron Blood Stadium. The view from this stand was extremely good, and it was one of the best locations in the entire Iron Blood Stadium.

Coincidentally, there were a few other familiar faces seated in this VIP stand.

Zhao Lun and Sha Yuan!

“Yanyu, long time no see,” Zhao Lun said. His features were still jade-like, and he still wore that charming smile on his handsome face. As he had advanced to the Sun Moon Tier, his aura had become even mightier than before, making him appear like a true god whom people could only admire and revere.

Reaching the Sun Moon Tier before becoming 1000 years old was incredibly impressive, even in the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. Based on currently available information, only Xu Ran from 30,000 years ago was more impressive than him.

Zhao Lun had the right to be prideful and arrogant. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

There was a hint of disgust on Shui Yanyu’s face, but she still curtseyed and said, “My respects to Heir Zhao!”

Zhao Lun was the only child of Great General Zhao, and he had also reached the Sun Moon Tier and been bestowed a title by the empress, with his name appearing on the empire’s totem. Thus, ordinary people all had to pay their respects when they saw him—this was a custom.

However, Zhao Lun was extremely annoyed by this. The more respectful Shui Yanyu was toward him, the more she was distancing herself from him. He forcefully suppressed the emotions in his mind, and said, “Yanyu, who do you think will win today?”

Before Shui Yanyu could even answer, he said, “I think Wu Ziren will win. In fact, I’ve even placed 100,000 True Origin Stones on his victory. I wagered that he can defeat Ling Han in 10 exchanges!”

“Oh, you’re that confident, Zhao Lun?” Sha Yuan said with a chuckle.

Zhao Lun smiled proudly. He had initially wanted to bet more money, yet he was still a little tight at the hip pocket after having paid a huge sum to the Dark Night Hall. In fact, he had actually borrowed these 100,000 True Origin Stones from his followers and underlings.

Although he was borrowing money, it was actually closer to extortion. This made him feel slightly angry. He, the single child of Great General Zhao, actually had to stoop to the level of extorting money from his underlings? How humiliating was this?

Fortunately, he had full confidence that he was going to win. As such, he would be able to repay his underlings in no time at all.

“Naturally,” Zhao Lun replied. “Ling Han is merely an ant from a small world. What kind of powerful trump cards can he possess? He’s naturally no match for Wu Ziren.”

The people nearby all wore strange smiles when they heard this.

Li Weiwei didn’t hold back, and said, “Zhao Lun, have you forgotten how you were pummeled by Ling Han half a year ago? The wounds on your face have recovered, so you’ve forgotten how you were beaten?” Only a few of the people present dared to ridicule Zhao Lun to his face, and Li Weiwei was one of them.

Zhao Lun involuntarily clenched his fists. The veins on his forehead popped, and the aura that radiated from his body suddenly became especially turbulent, transforming into silhouettes of sabers and spears that were capable of insta-killing any being at the Mountain River Tier.

Yang Luodan interrupted, “Heh, that was because Brother Zhao’s cultivation level was suppressed. It wasn’t a fair battle to begin with! We’re all of the same generation, and the cultivation level of that ant is clearly insufficient. However, he insisted on suppressing Brother Zhao’s cultivation level to the same lowly level as himself. How could Brother Zhao have unleashed his full battle prowess?

“If that ant reaches the same cultivation level as Brother Zhao, he’ll definitely be no match for him!

“Anyhow, Brother Zhao has already reached the Sun Moon Tier, and achieving this feat before 1000 years old is a rare feat even when looking back at the history of our Majestic Empire. It can be said that he’s the number one prodigy of these past 100,000 years!”
