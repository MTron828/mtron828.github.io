3086 Killing ultimate elites like slaughtering chickens

“No…” Extermination screamed as if she had lost both her parents, but also like she had gone mad.

Vengeance against Chong Yan and the others was already her obsession. She didn’t know how many times she had thought about how to kill them one by one, but the immortality and indestructibility of a Seventh Tier wasn’t just for show. It was only now that she finally had the ability to casually slaughter Seventh Tiers.

However, Shatter Mountains had been killed by Ling Han.

This simply made her heart ache!

“You bastard, I’m going to shred your corpse into 10,000 pieces!” Extermination attacked with all her might, intending to blast Ling Han into pieces.

“Hehe.” Ling Han only smiled faintly. Previously, everything had been manipulated by Extermination, and Hysteria—the great demon of two generations, Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and other Seventh Tier ultimate elites could be said to have become her chess pieces, played easily in the palm of her hand.

Now, it was no longer up to her.

Ling Han fixed his gaze on Half Moon, and charged straight at him.

Previously, Half Moon and the other two ultimate elites had already started fleeing. However, they no longer had any fundamental power left to extract and utilize. They could only rely on their own power to display their might. This greatly affected their speed.

In terms of power, who else could compare to Ling Han?

Ling Han had only taken a single step forward, but had already caught up to Half Moon. He reached out to grab him.

“How dare you!!” Extermination let out an enraged roar, and chased after him crazily.

But could she make it in time?

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and Half Moon fell into it.

“Old bastard, do you regret it?”

Half Moon gritted his teeth. He had already seen it before. Shatter Mountains became a dead man after saying that he regretted it. Therefore, he had to grit his teeth and keep his mouth shut no matter what.

“No regrets?” Ling Han exerted strength in his hands, and under the pressure of unparalleled power, Half Moon’s bones made a cracking sound. His face even turned purple-red as he felt extreme pain.

Instead, it was Extermination that stopped. She knew that it was impossible for her to snatch him back from Ling Han’s hands.

So…

She set her eyes on Big Dipper and Mysterious Feather. Although she couldn’t exact a perfect revenge, it was better than not being able to kill even one of them, right?

Xiu, she flew towards Big Dipper.

Big Dipper and Mysterious Feather really didn’t know how to describe their feelings at this moment. As dignified Seventh Tier ultimate elites, they had actually fallen so far from grace—to the point of becoming prey that were hunted by others.

This was truly too tragic. Seventh Tier! They were Seventh Tiers, the greatest in the world.

“Yellow Sand!” Hysteria roared, and moved its tentacles to grab him. It also hated Extermination the most, even if it clearly knew that it was no match for her, but it still came forward to stop her.

“Scram!” Extermination slashed down with her hand, and Hysteria was instantly sent flying, with golden blood flowing as another tentacle was cut off.

However, Hysteria was laughing loudly because Ling Han had already caught up and intercepted Extermination.

Ling Han shook his head inwardly. This Hysteria was really stupid. Even without it trying to hinder her, Ling Han could easily catch up to Extermination because he had obtained 90% of the power of the Void. He was absolutely invincible.

Forget it. He didn’t need to feel sorry for it anyway.

“Do you regret it or not?” Ling Han parried Extermination while still suppressing Half Moon. The terrifying power was simply not something a Seventh-Tier physique could contend against, causing Half Moon to scream incessantly.

He persisted for a long time before finally saying, “I do, I regret it!”

Firstly, he really couldn’t withstand it any longer. He felt like he was better off dead than alive. He might as well pray for a good death to free himself. Secondly, this was indeed the truth. He regretted it. He regretted listening to Extermination’s words. He regretted not going all out and killing Ling Han, who had still been very weak at the time.

“Alright, then die.” Ling Han squeezed hard. Pa, Half Moon also turned into a mist of blood.

“Ling Han!! Ling Han!! Ling Han!!” Extermination roared loudly, her eyes burning with rage, reaching a state of extreme fury.

“What are you screaming for? It’s not your turn yet,” Ling Han said calmly.

He looked at Mysterious Feather and Big Dipper. Who was going to be next?

As his gaze swept over them, Mysterious Feather and the other felt a sense of sorrow and endless despair.

Extermination had also entered a berserk state. She panted heavily with a ferocious expression on her face.

Her eyes suddenly lit up as she stared at Hysteria.

If she killed it and plundered its power, then she would be evenly matched with Ling Han. Now, she would definitely win.

Yes, that was it.

She let out a long howl and charged towards Hysteria.

Ordinary Seventh Tiers were useless as their power was less than one-millionth of hers. What was the use of plundering them?

Ling Han smiled, and his figure darted out. He actually arrived first, grabbing one of Hysteria’s tentacles, and then abruptly flung it out.

Peng!

Hysteria instantly transformed into a streak of light that shot toward the endless Void.

“It’s not your turn yet. Stay in line and wait!” Ling Han said, and turning around, he charged towards Big Dipper.

Big Dipper also stopped running. He knew that Ling Han was already strong enough to instantly obliterate heaven and earth.

“I regret it,” he said directly.

Rather than being ravaged and killed, it was better to seek a good death.

Peng!

Ling Han threw a punch, and blasted Big Dipper into smithereens without showing any mercy.

Since he had betrayed them, he had to be prepared to die.

Ling Han looked at Mysterious Feather again, and his killing intent did not diminish even after killing three ultimate elites. Instead, it became even more intense.

Mysterious Feather also accepted his fate and closed his eyes. “What I regret the most is listening to that b*tch’s words. Also, that I didn’t kill you when I had the chance!”

“Unrepentant!” Ling Han snorted coldly, and threw a punch. Peng, Mysterious Feather was also killed.

At this point, all of the ultimate elites of the Genesis World of the last era had been annihilated.

Oh, actually that wasn’t the case. Strictly speaking, there were also Extermination and Hysteria. They all came from the Genesis World of the last era.

Golden Silk Moth and Ten Thousand Shadows trembled. In front of Ling Han, Seventh Tier elites were like toys, and could be blown to bits simply by a raise of his hand. They hadn’t broken through to Seventh Tier for long, and hadn’t enjoyed much of such prestige yet. They didn’t want to die at all.

Fearful things just had to come. Ling Han had already set his sights on them. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You… what else do you have to say?” Ling Han asked calmly.

What could they say?

What was the use of regretting now? Hadn’t Shatter Mountains and the others all been killed?

Ten Thousand Shadows’ first reaction was to flee. Facing Ling Han, this had already become his normal reaction, but now he was completely unable to move his legs. He only felt that his entire body was powerless, and he was unable to move at all.

Golden Silk Moth gritted his teeth, and knelt down in front of Ling Han. “Greetings, Master!”

Ling Han was stunned, and only then did he remember. Back then, when he was at the Fifth Tier, he had already suppressed Golden Silk Moth, wanting to take in a Seventh Tier as his servant. Later on, Golden Silk Moth had run away, and he thought no more of this matter.

Now that the Golden Silk Moth was calling himself a servant, it was obvious that it wanted to use this to trade for his life.

“I don’t need a useless slave like you!” Ling Han said. Betrayal required a price to be paid, so how could Ling Han be fooled just by him kneeling down and discarding his dignity?

He stretched out his hands and grabbed outward. Golden Silk Moth and Ten Thousand Shadows landed onto his hands.

Seventh Tiers. Hehe. Right now, they were really nothing more than a trash-like existence.

“Since you have nothing to say, go die.” Ling Han’s arms jolted. Peng, peng, the two ultimate elites immediately turned into a rain of blood.
