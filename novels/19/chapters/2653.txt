2654 True hero

Desolate Moon’s eyes roved over Ling Han and Xiao Yingxiong. Black Qi was continuously rising from his face, and turning into snake-like forms, but at the same time, it seemed like tentacles as well, which was extremely disgusting.

He revealed a grin. “I really cannot underestimate your intelligence, to have more or less reconstructed the truth with just a few clues! That’s right. In the past, I was betrayed and besieged, and was ultimately swept away by Lord Hysteria’s troops. Everyone thought that I was dead.

“But I simply did not die. It was Lord Hysteria that gave me a new life, and bestowed on me an even wider world!

“You think that joining Lord Hysteria is a humiliation, a mistake, right? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“You are wrong!

“Lord Hysteria is destined to unite all the dimensions and accommodate all worlds. When we are living in the world Lord Hysteria creates, we will have truly surpassed the heaven and earth and transcended heaven and earth!”

Ling Han scoffed, “You are obviously just a lackey, yet speak so boldly and confidently. I really don’t know how you can be so shameless!”

“Youth, you are now arrogant and overbearing, yet do not know it is the human heart that is the darkest!” Desolate Moon humphed, flames of fury flickering in his eyes. “When these people… are done, I will take them to that person who set me up, and have an accounting of old debts!”

“What are your plans for these Celestial Kings?” Ling Han asked grimly.

There was no need for Desolate Moon to even answer. However, he thought for a while. Ling Han was just a bird trapped in a cage, so what need was there to be concerned about him? Furthermore, Desolate Moon had accomplished such a mighty feat; if he did not share it with someone, he would indeed not feel satisfied.

In any case, the other party had already deduced so much, so it would be fine for them to know some more information.

Desolate Moon smiled, and said, “This so-called black Qi is the spirit shards of Lord Hysteria. To Lord Hysteria, this is basically scraps, but for Celestial Kings like us, it can help us transform and take that most crucial step.”

A look of mania crossed his face. “Just think, thousands upon thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates appearing, just what a grand sight would that be?”

Dimensional power was endless, and a Heavenly Venerate could be easily produced through the use of a Dimension Scroll, so why were there so few Heavenly Venerates? That was because heaven and earth was operating by its own rules. Heavenly Venerable Tier power was definitely not allowed to appear.

But Hysteria was different. It was a dimension, but at the same time, it itself was a being that had its own thoughts. There was absolutely no need for it to be concerned with any rules, because it could create as many Heavenly Venerates as it desired.

In fact, it was stretching out its hand in this direction.

In Hysteria’s world, creating a Heavenly Venerate was only the matter of a single thought, but it was not so simple in other dimensions. One would need the help of others, and also need a very, very long time to attain the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“Even Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could not possibly break out of the Celestial King Graveyard,” Ling Han stated evenly, but these words were a foreshadowing of things to come.

True enough, Desolate Moon continued, “This Ancient Tomb is the large tomb that the Primordial Ancient Heavenly Venerate laid out when he was alive, burying those subordinates that had followed him all the way. Afterwards, he advanced to the Realm Battlefield to participate in the resistance against Lord Hysteria, and he was naturally destroyed and turned into nothing.

“However!” Desolate Moon paused for a while, and then continued, “Lord Hysteria has obtained all the memories that belong to the Primordial Ancient Heavenly Venerate, and thus spent a great amount of effort and energy to forcefully create a passageway here that is connected directly to the outside of this realm!

“Hence, just put away all those worries of yours!

“Brat, don’t have any unrealistic delusions. If you absorb the black Qi voluntarily, you can suffer a little less. Otherwise… I would be very pleased to torture a prodigy!”

Ling Han had asked this question merely to find out if there was any way to leave here. As expected, since Desolate Moon had laid out such a grand conspiracy, he had already organized and planned out for all the minor details.

Once these Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings broke through to become Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, Desolate Moon would take these people and leave. Whether they would be moving separately or attacking in unison, this force would be extremely terrifying.

Most importantly, the Realm Battlefield was already under a great strain, so how many Heavenly Venerates could be dispatched from the front lines to deal with this big problem?

First Tier Heavenly Venerates weren’t enough at all. One would not be able to deal with even so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and once these people set foot in the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, probably even a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate would not be enough, either.

“Sigh, seeing how your gaze wanders, you clearly are unwilling to accept my suggestion.” Desolate Moon shook his head, and then said, “Xiao Yingxiong, go and take down this traitorous subject!”

Xiao Yingxiong had a conflicted expression, but his eyes were very soon covered completely by the black light again. Boom! Countless streaks of black Qi cascaded down from his severed neck, and reformed his torso.

“Die!” Brandishing the Divine Spear, Xiao Yingxiong charged towards Ling Han in attack.

Desolate Moon sighed. If Ling Han and Xiao Yingxiong had come just a little earlier, he could have summoned some Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to help him, but now was the very most crucial moment when these Celestial Kings were attempting to break through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. If they were interrupted, there would be no way to establish communication with Hysteria, who was afar, again. They naturally could not possibly make another attempt to break through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

However, even if Xiao Yingxiong could not deal with Ling Han, if Desolate Moon himself was added into the equation… Would it still not be enough?

Ding, ding, ding, ding! Ling Han and Xiao Yingxiong battled endlessly. The two of them fought from east to west, from south to north. The shock waves of their clashes reverberated, shattering the outer shell of the gigantic eggs inside the palace into smithereens. However, the inside of the eggs was completely undamaged. The Celestial King inside could not be affected at all.

“En?” Desolate Moon frowned, a strange feeling rising up in his heart.

Just at this moment, Xiao Yingxiong released a roar of fury. Boom! A golden light rose from the top of his head, instantly dispersing the black Qi that had formed his body.

“No!” Desolate Moon exclaimed in shock. This indicated that Xiao Yingxiong had escaped his control.

How was this possible?

Once the black Qi entered the body, one would be affected by the black Qi. These were spirit shards of Hysteria, and even if it was just a tiny bit, along with being suppressed by this dimension, it was still extremely easy to influence a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not resolve this, what more a mere Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

But not only had Xiao Yingxiong resolved it, he had accomplished it twice at that!

Was this the willpower of a supreme monarch star?

“Go, I’ll hold him back! You must bring the information back to the martial academy, or I will not spare you even if I die!” Xiao Yingxiong roared loudly, suddenly grabbing out at his forehead. A sphere of glowing white light appeared in his hand, and he tossed it over at Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out a hand and grabbed it. This sphere of light was the complete version of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel rueful. Though Xiao Yingxiong had always been on opposing sides with him, scrambling his brains to try and kill him, at the most crucial moment, he had done something that only a true hero would do.

…When they had previously been fighting, Xiao Yingxiong had been communicating with him through divine sense, and said that he still had a sliver of himself that was conscious. He would deliberately take the fight with Ling Han to the far corner of the palace, and create a chance for Ling Han to escape.

That was because once Desolate Moon’s plans succeeded, tens of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates would enter into the Flaming Frost Realm. The damage caused by that would be too terrifying.

Faced with this conflict of principles, Xiao Yingxiong suppressed his personal grudges, and was wise, generous, and heroic just this once.

He knew that death was fated for him, so he also took out the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, which he threw over to Ling Han. He was not Desolate Moon, so he had no way to make it so Ling Han would completely grasp this Divine Scroll in a single instant. He could only pass on his own memories to Ling Han so that the latter could study them slowly.

Ling Han’s expression was solemn. “Xiao Yingxiong, from this moment onwards, all our personal debts and grudges are resolved. Allow me to call you Brother Xiao!”

“Haha, don’t speak in such a sentimental manner. I told you to scram because no one can humiliate me, Xiao Yingxiong!” Xiao Yingxiong turned his head. Golden energy manifested his body once again. His hand gripped onto the Divine Spear, emanating a heroism of someone that would only forge onwards, with no return.

‘Even if there are millions standing in my way, I will still charge bravely forwards!’
