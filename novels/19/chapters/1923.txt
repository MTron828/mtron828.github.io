Chapter 1924: The Roc shows its might

“Miss, I wish to ask for some guidance from you!” Yan Xianlu’s fighting spirit blazed as hot as fire.

Hu Niu was indeed very strong, and was in fact stronger than even him, but the path of a monarch tier meant that one would have to defeat opponents that could not possibly be defeated the entire way, and finally set foot on the absolute pinnacle.

He knew that there was a gap between him and a few heaven-defying freaks. This Celestial King Achieving Dao stone was his chance to make up for the gap between them. Thus, how could he possibly allow another to have it?

“You try to snatch Niu’s stuff, and still want to fight with Niu?” When Hu Niu became unreasonable, she was also very brutal. She glared harshly at Yan Xianlu, and pointed at him. “Niu wants to beat you up!”

She took the initiative to move. Boom, a pair of wings sprouted from her back. They were made up of seals of great dao, exuding an ancient and noble air.

“Ancestor Roc!” Shan Jitong and Lao Song exclaimed simultaneously.

As it turned out, this young girl was the heir of the line of the Ancestor Roc. Amongst the Ancestral Sources, the Ancestor Roc definitely could be considered of the first ranking. It was no wonder the young girl’s speed was so fast. Otherwise, if it had been any other fifth severance, she would have long since been caught up by these manifestations.

Shua, as Hu Niu’s wings flapped, she had already appeared in front of Yan Xianlu, and shot out a punch.

There was no technique or reason about it. It was like saying, “I am just going to beat you up with a single punch.”

Yan Xianlu showed a sliver of anger. He was a top-tier prodigy, a Divine Fetus that was born on the Celestial Path, and it was suspected that he had been born from heaven and nurtured by earth. Within the same cultivation level, no one was allowed to insult him!

He clearly knew that Hu Niu’s power was fierce and domineering. It was better for him not to face her head-on in a confrontation, but with Hu Niu so simply and directly launching an offensive at him, if he did not dare take her on head-on, it would really be too embarrassing for him.

He could lose, but his will could not. This was the pride that belonged to a monarch tier.

Yet Hu Niu was completely unconcerned. When her fist fell, another seal of great dao lit up, and it was only a single one too. Furthermore, it was not complete, either, becoming the image of a giant fish.

Though it was incomplete, this seal was too frightening. It was as if the heavens had collapsed, the earth itself was trembling, and even a strange scene had risen in the world due to the power of this seal.

This, this, this, this was too terrifying, wasn’t it!

“No, it’s not the Ancestor Roc!” Lao Song swallowed with much difficulty.

“The Roc!” Shan Jitong quipped at the same time, his eyes similarly widened. He was stunned beyond description.

When the world was first created, the earliest batch of living beings had all become Celestial King Tier in level, and they were known as Source Beasts. Some Source Beasts had already died in the endless passage of time, while some had attained an even higher level. There were differences in strength even among Source Beasts.

Ancestor Roc, that was one of the first ranking level, but above the first rank, there was still another level, King Tier!

For example, Ancestor Dragon, Ancestor Phoenix, and the Roc were of King Tier level.

According to legends, there were as many as over 20 types of King Tier Source Beasts, but there were only 10 races that could still appear now, and every single one of these races had world-shaking mighty figures.

Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

There were Nine Heavens in the Celestial King Tier, and every single step forward was as difficult as ascending the heavens. In front a ninth Heaven Celestial King, even an eighth heaven Celestial King was a junior. This kind of overwhelming superiority was like a Dividing Soul Tier towards a Severing Mundane Tier.

Hence, even though Yan Xianlu was the heir of an eighth heaven Celestial King, compared to the other party... he paled in color! And the other two completely did not even have the right to compare to Hu Niu. They were merely heirs from sixth heaven and seventh heaven Celestial King, respectively, and a gulf who knew how vast existed between them.

Peng!

Hu Niu and Yan Xianlu exchanged blows. This was a clash of great dao and Regulations. Two completely different kinds of great dao and Regulations vibrated, forming a frightening shock wave, and then Yan Xianlu stepped back continuously.

This time, he had not been sent flying, but he was not any better, either. He retreated all the way until about 300 meters before he finally managed to stop his retreat.

The Roc, if it was flying, it would be above the Nine Heavens, incredibly agile, and if it was swimming, it would be *********, overwhelmingly powerful without comparison.

This was a Source Beast that contained both absolute power and speed. Otherwise, how could it possibly be ranked in the King Tier?

“Extreme power!” Yan Xianlu stated closely. There was not the slightest despondency in his eyes, only an even higher fighting spirit.

He had been sent into a retreat by the other party, but it was not truly because his battle prowess was no match for hers, but rather that the Regulations that the other had cultivated represented the absolute apex of power. There were only a rare few Source Beasts that could contest with the Roc in terms of force. The Ancestor Dragon was one, and then was there anything else?

However, power was only just a portion of battle prowess. He had a Celestial Dao Physique, and he would not lose!

“Again!” he roared, completely unleashing his power of Divine Fetus. It was as if he had become an embodiment of great dao.

To clash in this heaven and earth, he had the absolute initiative.

Because he practically was the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Whatever movements his opponent made could not be hidden from him, and he himself was more so able to immerse in great dao, so how could you be able to wound him?

Would you be able to damage the Dao of Heaven and Earth? You couldn’t, then how could you deal him any damage?

In the first place, Hu Niu’s violent nature was hard to tame, and now, angered like this, she immediately pounced. She still threw out a simple punch, and it was still an incomplete seal, yet it could suppress the heaven and earth, and was practically invincible.

Peng!

Yan Xianlu was instantly hit, and sent flying like a shooting star.

That was right. He had a Celestial Dao Physique, and when the power of his Divine Fetus activated, he was practically one and the same as the Dao of Heaven and Earth. The moment you moved, he would know, and then he would be able to calmly dodge. In fact, because he was fused within great dao, how could one be able to wound him?

But Hu Niu’s speed was too fast, so fast that it had exceeded Yan Xianlu’s reaction time.

If you wanted to sense great dao, you would need time, right? When this message was sent over, only then would you be able to act accordingly. However, Hu Niu’s speed had surpassed the time this message took to be sent. Thus, Yan Xianlu had just sensed which angle Hu Niu was going to attack from, and he had already been hit solidly with a punch. There was absolutely no time for him to dodge or fuse within great dao at all.

The pinnacle level of speed!

The reason why the Roc could become a Source Beast of King Tier-level was because it did not just possess the pinnacle of one type of Regulations. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Too shoddy, so boring!” Hu Niu clapped her hands. Then, she looked towards Shan Jitong and Lao Song, her ferocious gaze appearing once more.

Shan Jitong and Lao Song hurriedly shook their heads. Even Yan Xianlu had been easily sent flying. They naturally were even less of a match. They had better not trifle with Hu Niu, either.

“You guys are too weak, even more boring,” Hu Niu said, and walked towards the Celestial King Achieving Dao stone.

Both Shan Jitong and Lao Song felt an urge to throw up blood. Though they were indeed a little weak, they were still monarch tiers here, and they did have their pride.

Hu Niu giggled as she walked to the side of the Celestial stone. Stretching out both arms, she wrapped them around the stone, wanting to uproot it by force, and stow it away into her Spatial God Tool or something so she could present it to Ling Han as a gift.

“Yi, so strange, why did something make its way in?” She was surprised. “Oh no, why is the stone stuck on my hands?”

She cried out loudly, not having the slightest bit of reservedness that an exquisite beauty should have. She was still that little girl who was mischievous and liked to create trouble from years ago.

She actually couldn’t fling this stone away!

“Don’t want it, I don’t want it anymore, it really isn’t anything good!” Hu Niu tried earnestly to throw the Celestial stone away, but this thing seemed to have taken root in her body. No matter how hard she tried, she could not throw it down.

Seeing this scene, Yan Xianlu and the others very much wanted to cry. ‘If you don’t want it, we do!’

But the Celestial stone was already beginning to channel. A boundless Source Power of heaven and earth was entering into Hu Niu’s body, improving her physique, and pushing it in a direction that was closer to great dao.

Hu Niu stopped the meaningless struggle, and allowed the Celestial stone to take effect. Her expression was one of struggle, looking extremely disgusted.

‘F***!’
