Chapter 1196: Defeat

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Theoretically speaking, Wu Zhe definitely wouldn’t be able to withstand the combined attacks of the six king tiers, unless he possessed a physique as freakish as Ling Han’s.

However, Wu Zhe retracted his divine chains just before the six attacks hit him. The divine chains wrapped around each other and transformed into an orb that possessed an incredible defensive ability.

Peng, peng, peng!

The attacks landed, yet they were unable to penetrate the ball of divine chains.

Their attacks couldn’t even penetrate the ball of divine chains, so how could they wound Wu Zhe?

“Hehehe, abandon your meaningless resistance! You people are nothing but ants before my absolute power!” Wu Zhe laughed, and continued, “You should feel honored to die by my hands. Remember that I used to be an Eternal River Tier elite. At that time, I was too lazy to even kill Heavenly Body Tier insects. However, you people are going to experience the honor of being killed by me. How glorious is this!”

“Hahaha!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I’ll even possess the ability to kill Saints in the future! So, why don’t you obediently stick your head over and let me hack it off? I’ll allow you to experience an even greater glory!”

“Humph!” Wu Zhe’s expression became cold, and he shouted, “You! Hehe, it appears as if the previous owner of this body detests you immensely. A killing intent has naturally arisen.”

“Oh, I simply gave him a beating,” Ling Han said calmly. “If you want to, I can also give you a beating.”

“What an arrogant brat!” Wu Zhe’s expression darkened.

Although he had been a supreme elite in the past—and it was thus beneath him to argue with a Mountain River Tier cultivator—he was still displeased when being talked back to like that. He truly wanted to slap Ling Han to death.

However, Shen Zhu’er and the others had already launched their second volley of attacks. This forced him to go back on the defensive. After all, he was no longer an Eternal River Tier elite.

Ling Han seized this opportunity to unleash his Ultimate Arrow.

He hadn’t participated in the second volley of attacks. Instead, he had waited until Wu Zhe blocked this volley of attacks and unraveled the divine chains that shielded him.

He was going to take advantage of this instant to kill him!

There was only a single chance. Although his power could recover quickly, that mysterious being wouldn’t fall for the same trick twice. He was too powerful and too smart for that.

“All of you, die!” After blocking the second volley of attacks, the mysterious being unraveled the orb of divine chains, just as Ling Han had expected. Countless divine chains shot toward Ling Han and the others, seeking to penetrate their bodies.

One’s defenses would be at their weakest right after they launched their most powerful attack—this was the same for everyone.

Pu, pu, pu, pu!

Shen Zhu’er and the four other king tiers were all struck by the divine chains. Some were hit in the hands, while others were hit in the legs. Some were hit in the torso. Regardless of where the divine chains hit, they were able to pierce straight through the king tiers. Blood sprayed through the air.

It was at this moment that Ling Han unleashed his Ultimate Arrow.

Pu!

However, he was also struck by the divine chains the instant that he unleashed the arrow. He hadn’t dodged or evaded, so it was only natural that he was struck. Fortunately, his physique was powerful enough. The divine chains had only been able to pierce into his body, and were unable to crush his Godly bones. They hadn’t been able to penetrate all the way through his body, either.

Xiu!

The brilliant arrow—one that carried the hopes of Ling Han—shot toward Wu Zhe.

It was as quick as light, and it was truly an arrow of ultimate speed.

“Aaaah!” Wu Zhe roared in pain. The Ultimate Arrow had hit his left shoulder, and the explosiveness of the arrow had obliterated it completely. His left arm fell to the floor, and a fountain of blood gushed from his shoulder.

This was already the result of him instinctively blocking with his divine chains and slightly altering the path of the arrow. If he hadn’t done so, it would have been his heart that exploded, not his left shoulder.

“Brat, I’m going to kill you!” Wu Zhe roared in fury.

He was both shocked and enraged. He had almost died at the hands of a measly Mountain River Tier cultivator! He was so infuriated that he could barely think straight.

Xiu!

The divine chains whipped back toward Wu Zhe, at the same time bringing Ling Han closer to him. Wu Zhe raised a hand and unleashed another seven divine chains. These divine chains shot toward Ling Han’s hands, feet, chest, and abdomen.

How could Ling Han block these divine chains?

The Ultimate Arrow was indeed mighty, yet it would exhaust his power after a single use. Even though his speed of recovery was quicker now, he would still need an entire 30 minutes to fully recover his power. However, he only had a few seconds right now, and this was barely enough time to recover even a shred of his stamina.

Ling Han was unable to defend against this attack, and he was ruthlessly struck by the seven divine chains.

Pu!

Blood sprayed from his body. However, Wu Zhe was still rendered speechless. Ling Han had been utterly defenseless, yet his divine chains still hadn’t been able to pierce through his body completely. As such, they hadn’t caused any significant damage.

‘F*ck! How can there be such a freak!’ VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Wu Zhe was slightly astonished. If he were at his strongest, he would be able to crush Ling Han with a simple wave of his hand. However, he could only rely on the power of Regulations at this moment. The problem was, his cultivation level was too low. As such, the amount and quality of Regulations that he could wield were also limited. If he tried to summon Regulations above his cultivation level, his body would be obliterated by the Regulations first.

Thus, his divine chains could only cause minor damage to Ling Han, even though they could cause severe damage to Shen Zhu’er and the others.

“Humph! I’ll slowly tear you to pieces then!” Wu Zhe said coldly.

He shook his divine chains, and sent Shen Zhu’er and the four other king tiers flying.

Peng, peng, peng!

They all crashed into the walls of the palace. Meanwhile, Wu Zhe brandished all of his divine chains, planning to launch a thick and furious attack on Ling Han.

If he couldn’t kill him with a single attack, he would grind him to death slowly and steadily, like ants slowly biting an elephant to death.

Ling Han’s physique was indeed as tough as Level Five Godly metal. However, Wu Zhe’s divine chains were like a saw that could slowly cut through Level Five Godly metal. He simply needed a bit of time.

Pu, pu, pu!

Ling Han was struck by the divine chains again. He had barely recovered any of his power at this moment, so he was naturally being belted like a sandbag.

Shen Zhu’er and the others were all gravely wounded, so they wouldn’t be able to help him anytime soon.

The divine chains continued to strike Ling Han, and he quickly transformed into a bloodied figure.

“Hahahaha!” Wu Zhe laughed loudly. This unbridled laugh contained both the emotions of the mysterious being as well as the pleasure of Wu Zhe himself. Ling Han had humiliated him in public before, so how could he not hate him?

Ling Han was being mercilessly beaten, yet he still continued to recover his power. He was waiting for a chance to counterattack.

If there were truly no chance of winning, he wouldn’t insist on continuing this battle, either. He would hide into the Black Tower, and perhaps even chuck Notionless Saint out. Doing so would probably give this mysterious being a huge fright.

Shen Zhu’er and the others naturally didn’t know that Ling Han still had the Black Tower. Upon seeing him being mercilessly beaten, they were certain that there was already no chance for him to turn the tables. Meanwhile, they were all severely wounded, and only barely hanging on to life.

By the looks of it, defeat was inevitable. Apart from waiting for death, what else could they still do?

Although they still had trump cards, this mystery realm forbade power at or above the Sun Moon Tier. Anyhow, faced with the formidable Regulations wielded by this mysterious being, it seemed as if everything that they did was in vain.

If they unleashed their trump cards, they would merely be seeking an earlier death. They would be killed by the restrictions, which was simply an alternate method of death, with an alternate killer.

Was there really no other way?

They were all individuals with steely willpower, and they definitely wouldn’t give up even in the face of despair. Their minds whirred as they analyzed all the possible methods.

“Hehe, Sinking Shade Old Demon, you’ve finally come out after all!” A thunder-like voice suddenly boomed through the surroundings, causing the entire palace to tremor.

‘What?! There’s another person here?’

Ling Han and the others were all filled with renewed hope. In the current situation... a new variable was extremely desirable!
