2981 The Identity of Jue Huo

Ling Han naturally couldn’t ask Shatter Mountains, Chong Yan, and the others, though these five Seventh Tiers knew even better about this matter.

Thus, he settled for the next best thing. He arrived at the Zhou Clan.

Ling Han released his aura slightly, and an incredibly deep aura immediately surged out. Zhou Heng walked out.

Close to two billion years had passed, and Zhou Heng’s strength had improved greatly again. He had just advanced to the Seventh Tier, so there was still room for improvement.

“You’re injured?” Zhou Heng frowned.

Ling Han nodded, and related how he had fought with Shatter Mountains.

Zhou Heng couldn’t help but laugh loudly, saying, “As expected. After advancing to the Fifth Tier, you possess battle prowess that can rival Seventh Tier elites. However, your physique is a shortcoming. You need to be careful, and you can’t be blindly confident.”

Ling Han nodded. “I will keep that in mind.”

“Next, you should be going to the Genesis World of the last era, right?” Zhou Heng asked.

Seeing Ling Han’s surprised expression, Zhou Heng smiled, and continued, “However, you may be disappointed. Those dimensions have actually been explored by the Seventh Tiers, but they stopped at the 33rd dimension. From there onwards, the fundamental particles have been compressed too much, forming a barrier that even a Seventh Tier can’t break through.”

Seventh Tiers were immortal and indestructible, but it did not mean that power could overwhelm everything. They could still be blocked or even suppressed.

“Would a Seventh Tier still be interested in those Great Herbs?” Ling Han asked in confusion.

Zhou Heng shook his head, and said, “Seventh Tiers might not need them. However, how could it be that Seventh Tiers have no descendants? Even for Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the others, wouldn’t they still have to nurture Feng Wuding?”

So that was how it was. Everyone was selfish, and even Seventh Tiers were no exception.

However, when it came to Feng Wuding…

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then has Feng Wuding advanced to the Fifth Tier?”

Zhou Heng nodded happily, “Not only him, but Youlian, Haoyang, and Qihu have also all advanced to the Sixth Tier, possessing Seventh-Tier battle prowess. That brat, Mifan, is slightly inferior, but we are all nurturing him with our full efforts. Probably, he would also be able to advance into Sixth Tier within 10 billion years, and similarly possess Seventh-Tier battle prowess.”

For the Genesis World, this was really a great piece of good news. All of a sudden, so many people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess had appeared.

Merely possessing Seventh-Tier battle prowess was useless. Without an undying and indestructible physique, they would only be a piece of cake in front of Hysteria, and would be killed in a few moves.

Hence, whether it was Ling Han, Feng Wuding, Lin Youlian, Wu Haoyang, or the like, there was still a long way to go.

“What is most important is still you and Feng Wuding,” Zhou Heng said solemnly. “One is the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World from the last era, and the other is the chosen one of the present generation. If the two of you advance to the Seventh Tier, you may be able to completely dispose of Hysteria.”

Ling Han sighed. Zhou Heng and the others hoped that he and Feng Wuding could mature together, join forces against Hysteria, and be broad-minded. However, Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the others wanted to kill Ling Han, making Feng Wuding take the lead. In comparison, it was clear who was superior.

A solemn expression immediately appeared on Zhou Heng’s face, and he said, “You might not believe me even if I told you.”

“Let’s give it a try,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Jue Huo is Hysteria from the last era, the true body of Extermination!” Zhou Heng said word by word.

What?!

Even if Ling Han had excellent control, when he heard these words, he still exclaimed internally, revealing an expression of disbelief.

“Shouldn’t it have been annihilated in the great destruction of the Genesis World from the last era?”

If Extermination’s physical body hadn’t been damaged at that time, why would it have become Hysteria? It could have immediately swept up the winds and clouds again, and Genesis World would have fallen into its hands long ago.

And if Extermination’s physical body was destroyed, how could the current Jue Huo be its true body?

Zhou Heng shook his head, and said, “Chong Yan and the others all insisted that Jue Huo was Extermination, possessing the same appearance and aura. Most importantly, how could a person with Seventh-Tier power possibly appear out of thin air?”

Jue Huo was Extermination. This could explain a great many things.

For example, she also possessed the ability to devour life essence. She wasn’t Hysteria’s subordinate at all, but Hysteria’s true body—the true body from the last era.

“Afterwards, everyone made some deductions, and thought that the destructive attack of the Genesis World at that time had indeed severely wounded Extermination, causing its body to be separated from its spirit. Furthermore, only a sliver of its spirit was left behind, and it was not enough to create waves at all,” Zhou Heng said, relating the deductions of the Seventh Tiers.

“Afterwards, a new Genesis World was formed, but Extermination’s spirit was still hibernating because it was too heavily wounded.

“Until, by chance, a certain dimension actually created a monster, which finally gave Extermination a chance. Her spirit took control, and slowly grew stronger. Finally, this monster became Hysteria, which manifested into a dimension, starting the Realm War.

“Perhaps it may even be the influence of Extermination’s spirit that gave the people of that dimension the idea of creating Hysteria.

“On the other hand, after countless years of slumber, the true body of the Extermination formed a new soul. Because it was created by this physical body, it inevitably possesses the ability of Extermination, and is connected with the present Hysteria.”

Ling Han was surprised. “Then doesn’t that mean that we may have to face two Hysterias?”

One was Hysteria, and the other was Hysteria’s predecessor, Extermination.

Hiss, this trouble…

Zhou Heng pondered for a moment before shaking his head, and saying, “We still don’t know what Extermination wants to do. Back then, she left after failing to obtain the dimensional core. She didn’t appear again.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Han was curious. “Could it be that this Extermination has no interest in manifesting as a dimension anymore… Hold on, what was the Realm War of the Genesis World of the last era like?”

During the Realm War of the Genesis World of the last era, Extermination clearly hadn’t manifested as a dimension. Otherwise, how could she have possessed a physical body?

However, this wasn’t definite. Hysteria had manifested as a dimension, but didn’t it still have its original form? The waving of its tentacles was simply captivating.

The more Ling Han thought about it, the more he felt a headache coming on. He might as well not think about it. Anyways, there was one thing that he was certain of, and that was that Jue Huo was Extermination. There was no doubt about that.

“Then does Senior also want to go to the Genesis World of the last era?” Ling Han asked.

Zhou Heng nodded, and said, “I’m also far from reaching the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. Some Great Herbs are still beneficial to my cultivation. On the other hand, Hysteria will soon digest the Flaming Frost Realm, and the full-scale Realm War will begin soon. This time, it’s devoured another transcendent dimension. Even with the addition of Junior Brother Chu and I, the situation is still extremely dire.”

Ling Han nodded. On the side of the Profound Negative Realm, there seemed to be two more Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, Zhou Heng and Chu Hao. However, Hysteria’s improvement was even greater.

“Then let me have the honor of escorting Senior to the Genesis World of the last era,” Ling Han said.

Zhou Heng nodded happily. He knew that Ling Han possessed the ability to traverse between dimensions.

However, before setting out, he called Chu Hao over, and Ling Han tore open a rip into the Void, leaping all the way to the dimension closest to the Genesis World of the last era. Only then did he enter the Void, heading straight for his target.
