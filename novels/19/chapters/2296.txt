Chapter 2297: Transferring Misfortune

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

The single-horned demon stood up, sweeping its gaze across Ling Han and the others. His voice was calm as he said, “The demon can stay. The rest of you, cut off an arm and p*ss off!”

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others were all enraged. This person was far too arrogant!

“Hmm? Do you people want to die?” A vicious glimmer flashed across the single-horned demon’s eyes. This was a petrifying glimmer, and the angels couldn’t help but feel their chests suddenly tightening. They felt like vomiting blood.

This person was far too powerful. Perhaps he was an Eighth Lotus elite.

“Don’t make me regret this. Hurry up and p*ss off!” the single-horned demon said in a baleful voice.

Ling Han’s expression was solemn. This demon was extremely powerful; he couldn’t be underestimated. He chuckled, and asked, “How have we offended you?”

“As a demon, you’re actually mingling with these ugly angels? You’ve lost all of our face!” the single-horned demon said in an icy voice. “For degenerates like you, I only offer a single punishment.”

He paused for a moment before saying in a voice filled with killing intent, “Death!”

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “But I still haven’t lived enough.”

“You’re seeking death!” the single-horned demon roared as it immediately charged forward. It pressed down with its hand, causing countless meteors to instantly plummet from the sky. This was a petrifying sight.

Ling Han nodded in his mind. This person was indeed powerful. However, he was still far weaker than that holy deer.

He retrieved his Divine Demon Sword to meet this attack.

Whoosh!

A burst of Sword Qi ripped through the sky.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The meteors that were crashing down on Ling Han instantly exploded into pieces. Meanwhile, the remaining meteors all slammed into the earth, causing the ground to continuously quake.

“Hmm?” A look of fervor appeared in the single-horned demon’s eyes as he gazed at the sword in Ling Han’s hands. “Brilliant sword!”

“No matter how brilliant it is, it’s still got nothing to do with you!” Ling Han said with a loud laugh. He charged forward with sword in hand.

“To fall into your hands… What a waste of a treasure,” the single-horned demon said with a sneer. He unleashed projections with his palms, naturally not allowing the Sword Qi or the Divine Demon Sword to strike him. He simply pushed them aside with his attacks.

His cultivation was far superior to Ling Han’s, so he was confident that he could shake Ling Han to death with his attacks. He was convinced that Ling Han couldn’t unleash the full power of the sword.

‘This was indeed a good plan. With such a huge gulf between their cultivation, it was only natural that their battle prowess wasn’t on the same level.

However, he was surprised to discover that Ling Han’s physique far exceeded his cultivation level. As such, the shock waves from his attacks were but a tickle for Ling Han. Only that holy deer had been able to truly threaten Ling Han.

They continued to battle. The single-horned demon’s expression transformed from disdainful to solemn. However, this quickly transformed into a deep frown.

He had never come across a Sixth Lotus cultivator so difficult to kill before!

Was this person truly at the Sixth Lotus? Even among those at the Seventh Lotus, few people were so freakish.

Right at this moment, a dark shadow suddenly fell over them.

Ling Han and the others had already developed a subconscious reaction to this, and they all shouted, “Flee!”

They instantly sprinted away, fleeing faster than hunted rabbits.

Ina stroke of fortune, they could use the people from the Baoyu Clan to attract the attention of this Holy Beast. What good people!

The single-horned demon involuntarily grimaced. Ling Han was actually fleeing just like this? He was fleeing? F*cking fleeing?!

He wanted to give chase, yet the dark shadow from above had already enveloped him. He looked up, only to see a holy deer. It had the lower body of a deer and the upper body of a human. Right now, its arms were spread apart, and it was condensing numerous crackling white lightning orbs in its hands.

Just a single glance at this holy deer sent cold chills down the single-horned demon’s spine.

“Retreat! Hurry up and retreat!” he shouted in panic.

This holy deer was far too powerful. He couldn’t rival it unless he unleashed his trump cards. Even then, however, he would only be able to defend. Trying to achieve victory would be as difficult as trying to ascend the heavens.

This time, the holy deer didn’t pursue Ling Han and the others. Instead, it focused its gaze on the demons from the Baoyu Clan. Perhaps it had grown tired of its old playthings, so it wanted to play with some new toys.

It started its hunt, forcing the single-horned demon to use his trump card. This was a fruit that allowed him to elevate his battle prowess. He could rival the Holy Beast without falling to a disadvantage. However, it was still impossible for him to achieve victory.

Ling Han and the others took advantage of this opportunity to flee. Not long ago, they had already decided to flee toward the Holy Mountain no matter what.

‘An hour passed, and they finally succeeded in making it to the foot of the Holy Mountain. They took their first step to climb the mountain.

After taking this step, the scene before them immediately changed. The dazzling golden mountain surprisingly became dull and desolate. Black air rose from the ground, transforming into all kinds of eerie and uncanny shapes.

“This is the Holy Mountain?” They all shook their heads. This was obviously a dead mountain.

“Let’s go.”

They started to climb the mountain. Following the path described by the tribespeople, they eventually arrived at a valley.

‘They then looked up.

The valley was extremely steep, and it was surrounded by plunging cliffs. The floor of the valley was more so littered with razor-sharp stones. If it were only this, no one would worry too much. The problem was, however, that the gravity in this place was unexpectedly powerful. Even raising their feet

was difficult. Once they fell, death was all but certain.

In any case, why did they need to climb these cliffs?

The answer was simple. If they wanted to transform these rough billets into pieces of precious armor, they needed to place them inside the faces of the cliffs.

Why couldn’t they place them at the foot of the cliffs?

They could indeed do this. However, one couldn’t forget that more than one tribe lived in this region. In order to obtain food, there would often be skirmishes or even full-blown wars among these tribes. Thus, if they placed the billets at the foot of the cliffs, would that not equate to gifting them to

others?

One had to realize that metal ores were an incredibly valuable commodity in this place. In fact, they were even more valuable than food.

As such, they would all try their best to climb the faces of the cliff. They would then dig a hole in which they placed the rough billets. The higher up they dug the hole, the better their billets would be hidden, and the smaller the chance their valuables would be stolen by others.

Ling Han and the others had no interest in the rough billets. Instead, they wanted to witness the secret behind how these billets evolved into precious treasures.

They searched around the valley, trying to discover the reason behind the evolution of the billets.

The tribespeople viewed the Holy Mountain with great respect and reverence, and this was clear from the name that they gave it. Thus, they naturally didn’t dare to damage its environment. However, Ling Han and the others were different. They dug one meter deep, and if they needed to, they would even

flatten this entire valley.

However, the gravity here was far too powerful, so much so that even standing upright was a tiring task. This was not to mention the arduous task of wandering around and digging, Moreover, due to the powerful force of gravity, the body of the mountain was also extremely compact and solid. It would

take them a great deal of time to carve off a single piece of stone.

Perhaps they could indeed flatten this mountain. However, doing so would require 10,000 or even 100,000 years.

More importantly, did they have so much time?

Here, they would experience hunger, and they would also be restricted by age. At most, they could only live for 1000 years. That being the case, could they waste so much time here?

‘Then what could they do?

If they didn’t solve the secret of this valley, they naturally wouldn’t be able to find the path to leave. At that time, they would truly die of old age in this place.

Ling Han retrieved his Divine Demon Sword, and slashed at the mountain face. This was an eventual Celestial Tool, the sharpest and sturdiest thing in the world.

The effects were evident. It wasn’t long before he dug a hole that was large enough to fit a person.

He entered this hole, and the others hurriedly followed after him. Perhaps this would be their road to survival.

In this place, they all became like ordinary mortal beings. They were no longer tireless celestials. After digging for half a day, Ling Han’s arms became extremely sore. He passed the Divine Demon Sword to Hu Niu.

Hu Niu was only able to dig for six hours before handing the sword to the Empress. The Empress was similarly only able to dig for six hours before handing the sword to Bewitching Maiden Rou. Bewitching Maiden Rou was far inferior to them, and she was only able to dig for two hours..
