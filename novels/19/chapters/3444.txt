Chapter 3445: How are you worthy of being my equal

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hong Tianbu was only 25 or 26 years old, similar to him, but in terms of cultivation level, he had already surpassed him greatly.

From this aspect, even if Hong Tianbu didn’t suppress his cultivation level, the two of them could still be considered to have a fair battle.

Who asked your natural talent to be inferior, and your cultivation speed to be slow? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

But what basis did the other have for advancing so rapidly?

If he had been in a prison where there were no Treasured Trees, Strange Herbs, or Mysterious Herbs, it would indeed have a great impact. However, because of the environment of heaven and earth, there were similarly not many Treasured Fruits, Strange Herbs, and Mysterious Herbs in the outside world. What right did this guy have to surpass him?

How could such a freak appear in a place where cultivation was lagging behind?

Luo Jintang took a deep breath, suppressed the distracting thoughts in his mind, and said, “Please.”

Hong Tianbu smiled faintly, took a step, and tapped out a finger at Luo Jintang’s forehead.

Luo Jintang couldn’t help but look furious. ‘You’re underestimating me too much, aren’t you?’

With a soft exclamation, a golden bell had already appeared on his body. It was covered with many characters, but did not have that half of an ancient character.

With a tap of Hong Tianbu’s finger, pa, the golden bell immediately shattered.

What!

Luo Jintang said this soundlessly, his eyes filled with shock. This was too exaggerated, wasn’t it?

He retreated in shock, and Hong Tianbu didn’t follow up on his attack. Instead, he said calmly, “Use your strongest technique. Otherwise, you won’t be able to block three moves from me.”

This confidence, this domineering attitude!

Everyone’s blood was instantly ignited, and they were all excited, shouting in unison.

Aside from the Holy Emperor, they also had Holy Emperor, as well as Ling Han!

Luo Jintang had no choice but to yield. The other had broken through his golden bell defense with a light tap. This was who knew how much stronger than the Ninth Prince. He had not used any Mystical Power, it was only a tap.

He immediately went all out. His blood and Qi was already boiling, and the golden bell reappeared. Half an ancient character appeared, as if it had traversed time and space. There was a supreme will circulating.

Only then did Hong Tianbu’s expression become solemn. However, he was still brimming with confidence. His hands were clasped behind his back, and it was as if he were a senior giving guidance to a junior.

Luo Jintang arrived with the golden bell in tow. With a sudden shout, the golden bell actually flew up from above his head, and then enveloped Hong Tianjin.

Yi, it could do that?

Wasn’t that used for defense? Why did it seem like it had become a weapon now?

The golden bell descended down on Hong Tianbu’s head, and the ancient character exuded an aura that could suppress eternity.

The speed of this attack was not very fast, but even if anyone had ten times the speed of sound, they would not be able to escape. The reason was because the half of an ancient character was on it, so no one would be able to think of dodging at all.

Hong Tianbu smiled, and said, “If this senior truly attacked me, then my only fate would be to be crushed. However, you’re only an Inscription Tier elite, so how powerful can the borrowed power be? Enlightenment Tier, right? I was able to defeat all Enlightenment Tier elites in Inscription Tier, so in front of me, what’s this worth?”

He delivered a palm strike, and a ball of flames flickered in the palm of his hand. His move was extraordinarily fast, and before anyone could see clearly, his palm had already pressed down on the golden bell.

With a pa, the golden bell was broken.

Hiss, even with the addition of half an ancient character, it was still like this. Hong Tianbu’s battle prowess was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Ling Han channeled his eye technique and caught some clues. A look of shock appeared on his face, and he looked at Second Baby in slight disbelief.

Second Baby nodded, and said, “That is indeed an eye!”

“Yi, that person has an eye on his hand?”

“Could it be the Shatter Clan?”

“The arms of the Shatter Clan are long and reach the ground. They don’t look like this.”

“That’s the Azure Eye Tribe?”

“Though the eyes of the Azure Eye Tribe can grow in various parts of the body, their entire body is blue, and only their eyes are green. That’s not it either.”

The Calabash Brothers began their discussion, but did not come to a unified conclusion.

Second Baby shook his head, “That is the eye of a Primordial Beast!”

“What?!” the six toddlers exclaimed in unison. Disbelief was written all over their faces, and they naturally ignored Sixth Baby.

Eldest Baby shook her head, and said, “Primordial Beasts are so high and noble. Even if they die, they’ll either go to the tomb among the stars, or self-combust their own corpses. They definitely can’t be left for future generations.”

Second Baby added, “I also saw a sword mark on that eye. It’s a very deep wound!”

“Second, what you mean is that there was a Primordial Beast that had been wounded by an elite, and one of its eyes had been sliced off?” Fourth Baby exclaimed in shock.

“There shouldn’t be many in the entire universe that can wound a Primordial Beast, right?” Fifth Baby also shouted.

Second Baby nodded, “If that was not the case, how could this Enlightenment Tier cultivator possibly control the eye of a Primordial Beast? Naturally, it was because the eye was injured that he was allowed to merge.”

While the kids were talking, Hong Tianbu had already launched a counterattack. Without the blessing of the ancient character, Luo Jintang’s strength was just barely comparable to the early stage of the Enlightenment Tier. He was completely no match for Hong Tianbu. In just a few moves, he was defeated.

There was no excuse at all.

‘Tve lost.” Luo Jintang sighed. “I’ve long heard that there are two prodigies in the Imperial Capital. Brother Hong is a freakish genius who can suppress the heavens. Before the battle, I didn’t believe it, but after this battle, I’m convinced.”

Hong Tianbu smiled faintly, his eyes drifting towards Ling Han, “Twin prodigies? Hehe, who bestowed the title? Who has the right to be my equal?”

He suddenly turned to Ling Han and said, “Ling Han, do you think you can stand side by side with me?”

His voice was loud and clear. It clearly wasn’t very loud, but it reverberated in everyone’s hearts.

This was an indescribable domineering aura. Are you worthy of being my equal?

It should be known that Ling Han had previously defeated prodigies from the Demon Race repeatedly. His talent and abilities had already been publicly acknowledged, and that was why he was known as the Twin Prodigies of the Imperial City. In the past, he had only been known as the second Hong Tianbu.

And now, Hong Tianbu was questioning him in public. Was Ling Han worthy of being his equal?

How should he answer this question?

If the answer was yes, then how was Ling Han supposed to respond to Hong Tianbu’s challenge? No matter how strong he was, how could he be a match for an Enlightenment Tier elite?

Asking Hong Tianbu to seal his cultivation level?

What a joke. You are already on the same level as me, and you still want me to suppress my cultivation level?

However, no matter what the reason was, he would still have to publicly admit that he was inferior to Hong Tianbu. In that case, no matter how great Ling Han’s achievements were in the future, this scene today would be remembered by everyone. If someone dug out the facts, they would say that it was Hong Tianbu that was stronger.

This was forcing him to admit his inferiority.

Ling Han smiled faintly. Hong Tianbu was indeed Hong Tianbu. He was clearly using his superior strength to bully the weak, yet covered it up with an air of magnanimity, and no one could find any fault with him.

With a leap, he strode towards Hong Tianbu and stopped 30 meters in front of him.

The mountain winds blew past, and the hems of their clothes fluttered at the same time, elegant and swift.

“Indeed, the title of Twin Prodigies is not appropriate.” Ling Han nodded.

When everyone heard this, they all thought that Ling Han had admitted defeat, and couldn’t help but shake their heads internally.

“It can’t be blamed on him. Hong Tianbu has already advanced into Enlightenment Tier, and Ling Han is definitely no match for him. This is called self-preservation.”

“That’s right. If we take a step back, we’ll have a wide world ahead of us. As long as the mountain is left, there is no worry about burning no firewood.” “The saying is worry about having no firewood to burn, idiot!”

Many people agreed with Ling Han’s temporary tolerance. As a man, he naturally had to know when to yield and when not to yield.

However, Ling Han’s next words almost caused everyone to stumble.

“How can you be worthy of standing side by side with me!”
