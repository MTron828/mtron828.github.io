2818 Mysterious Beauty

Ling Han suddenly looked at the other person in the palace.

This huge, overwhelming, and indescribable aura came from this woman.

…She had passed the test, and her consciousness had returned to her body.

Boom, the aura vibrated for a brief moment, and then completely returned to the woman’s body, without leaking even a tiny bit of it.

Although it was unleashed for just a split second before being drawn back again, Ling Han was extremely shocked. He already had a glimpse of the powerful nature of this woman.

A Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate!

No wonder she was able to break through the barricade set up by those three Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates outside. Being similarly at the Fourth Tier, if she was determined to break through, how could she be stopped by them? Moreover, Ling Han had a feeling that this woman’s strength was far superior to an ordinary Fourth Tier’s.

Weng, the woman opened her eyes, and the originally dark palace suddenly lit up.

Partly because her eyes were too bright, and partly because of her beauty. From the moment she opened her eyes, it made her bloom like a flower, and she couldn’t be more beautiful.

Ling Han was also slightly distracted by it, but he quickly calmed down. It wasn’t like he hadn’t seen beautiful women before, and now his only thought was to improve his strength and cultivation.

If one had beautiful wives, a loving son, and a loving daughter, what more could one ask for?

The woman’s gaze swept across the room, and she couldn’t help revealing a surprised expression, as she really didn’t expect that there was a living person inside.

“Are you the one who entered here 10,000 years ago?” she asked. Her voice was soft, serene, and indescribably sweet.

Ling Han shook his head. “Correction, that happened 20,000 years ago.”

The woman was taken aback for a moment, and then immediately came to her senses, judging from the changes in her body language. She couldn’t help her pretty expression changing slightly; that was to say, in the last 10,000 years, she had been so defenseless in front of Ling Han?

Did this guy do anything to her?

Seeing this, Ling Han quickly waved his hand. “Don’t get me wrong. If I had touched even a single strand of your hair, you could have felt it even if your mind had wandered to another world.”

The woman nodded slowly. Indeed, despite the fact that her consciousness had wandered away, her divine sense would definitely return at first instance should her body be in any danger. It was just that this test would end in failure.

However, she still cast several glances towards Ling Han. This guy actually did not have any ideas towards her for the last 10,000 years, which was truly amazing.

She had full confidence in her charm; what man wouldn’t be tempted?

Just this weird guy.

“Since you’ve already woken up, why didn’t you leave?” the woman asked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han shrugged and lifted both his hands. “It can’t be helped, as I don’t know how to get out of here.” This was of course a lie; he hadn’t even started looking for a way to leave this place.

The woman’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly. “It was said that there was an inheritance from the ancient Heavenly Venerate located here. Since you have arrived here one step ahead of me, I presume that you have obtained it?”

“It wasn’t me!” Ling Han quickly shifted the blame completely. He couldn’t possibly admit it. The other party was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate. If she knew that he had obtained the inheritance of the Heavenly Venerate, then wouldn’t he be skinned alive?

Of course, Ling Han was able to traverse between dimensions, so he wasn’t too worried. However, he didn’t want to take the risk of running into Hysteria unless it was absolutely necessary.

The woman seemed to have seen through Ling Han’s thoughts, and said, “Don’t worry, even if you have obtained the inheritance, I will not seize it by force.”

For real? How generous. Being a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, she had the strength to seize it by force.

Of course Ling Han wouldn’t ask this question. He merely chuckled, and pretended not to have heard her.

The woman didn’t expose his lie. She merely searched around in the palace, and when she found that there was indeed no inheritance, she began to look for the exit.

It didn’t take long before she found it.

This was a one-way exit. When the two walked in, shua, they nevertheless appeared on the plain outside.

With a wave of her hand, the woman left gracefully.

Ling Han was shocked. The other party really just left like that?

Hadn’t she already guessed that he had obtained the inheritance, yet she was still being so generous?

Inconceivable.

Ling Han couldn’t help but raise his voice, and asked, “Who are you?”

It was a pity that even when he shouted, his voice couldn’t catch up with a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and the woman disappeared into the distance in an instant.

So intelligent, so forthright, and so powerful. Who exactly was she?

Ling Han shook his head, and chose to walk in the opposite direction from that stunningly beautiful woman.

He changed his appearance and aura again. After all, he had tricked a lot of people previously, and he felt guilty.

He was walking, and almost a day later he saw another huge tomb, which was still the same as the previous one, looking like a big bowl turned upside down.

Ling Han quickly found the entrance, and after entering it, there was another plaza, which made him feel that he hadn’t changed venues at all.

There were still many people in the plaza; most of them gathered around the entrance of the palace and lined up there.

Ling Han walked over, looked for someone, and asked about the situation here with a smile.

This was the Vermilion Bird Palace.

Like the White Tiger Palace, there had originally been several Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates standing guard here to prevent others from entering. However, as time went by, more and more strong elites came, which broke this balance of power

However, like in the White Tiger Palace, there was no one here who could pass the test. Therefore, after a long time, those Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates also didn’t want to expend such efforts, so everyone was allowed entry, while they went on to other palaces in search of another opportunity.

There was also a test here, and the difficulty was similarly exceedingly high, and there was also an upper limit on the number of people that could be accommodated. Therefore, after the current number of people was full, other people wouldn’t be able to enter, so they could only line up outside.

Ling Han took a look. There were not many people in line, only a dozen or so.

All right, he’d line up. He had always been a very rule-abiding person.

Ling Han walked over, planning to get in line.

“Hey, this person.. is so outrageously brazen!”

“Nothing more than a First Tier.”

...

“Where did he get such courage?”

Seeing Ling Han coming over in large strides, the surrounding people all gasped in amazement.

Of course, Ling Han didn’t care. He walked straight to the end of the line, and stood still about nine meters away from the person in front of him.

He could not get too close, otherwise he would be mistaken for hostile by others.

“Hmm?” Unexpectedly, the person in front of him had other thoughts as he turned around and made a disdainful face at Ling Han.

Ling Han instantly became unhappy. ‘So what if you are a Third Tier, do you think that I am afraid of you?

‘What’s your problem? Do I owe you anything?’

He also revealed a disdainful expression. F*ck, who didn’t know how to show that?

That Third Tier couldn’t help sneering, and said sternly, “You, a mere First Tier, are really too bold. You really don’t know what’s good for you!”

“Squinted eyes, can you speak properly? If you can’t speak properly, let me educate you.” Ling Han countered with a tit-for-tat reply; how could he be willing to suffer such maltreatment.

“Haha!” That Third Tier snickered, but his gaze was incomparably chilly. “Whose descendant are you? Don’t you know that such arrogance will cause trouble for your clan?”

...

He didn’t make a move, but asked this question because he was obviously fearful of Ling Han’s background. After all, while most of the Heavenly Venerates have returned to their own dimensions, the high-level Heavenly Venerates basically stayed back.

What if there was a Fifth Tier or Sixth Tier elite backing Ling Han? He surely didn’t want to be hunted down all over the world by such an elite.

Ling Han chuckled. “I’ll return the same words to you.”

That Third Tier had stopped laughing because the dozen or so Third Tier elites in front of them were all smiling, obviously enjoying the sight of him being mocked.

“You’re seeking death!”
