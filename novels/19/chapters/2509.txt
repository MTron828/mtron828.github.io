Ling Han looked up, only to see two men standing next to his table. They were both very young, yet they had already reached the Ascending Origin Tier. They were fairly powerful.

One of them wore a sword on his waist, and he smiled as he said, “The tavern is full, so is it okay if we sit here? As repayment, we’ll bring you to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy for a look. How does that sound?”

Before Ling Han could even reply, the two of them had already taken a seat. They then started to indulge in loud and empty talk, acting very familiar with Ling Han.

One of them was called Xu Qiang, and the other was called Tang Chi. They were both planning to go to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy to become followers of the disciples there. Even though they would only be underlings, which of the disciples of the academy wasn’t a supreme prodigy of a realm? Thus, becoming their followers would also bring huge benefits.

Of course, becoming their followers was also extremely difficult and competitive.

“Brother Ling, your cultivation is far too weak. None of the disciples will be willing to take you as their follower,” Tang Chi said with a serious expression. He thought that Ling Han was the same as them.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m not planning to become anyone’s follower.”

This was the truth. He had never considered becoming a follower of anyone. Instead, he wanted to become a proper disciple.

However, Xu Qiang and Tang Chi naturally wouldn’t think this. Instead, they thought that Ling Han was a self-aware person who knew that he was too weak to become a follower.

Anyhow, they were friendly and honest people. After several cups of alcohol, they patted their chests and promised that they would definitely allow Ling Han to see the world.

“Brother, whether or not you can become a follower is only a small matter. A marketplace has already formed here, and there are strange and bizarre things being sold every day,” Xu Qiang said. “If you’re fortunate enough to uncover a gem, you’ll have struck it rich!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Oh, then I need to have a look.”

“Definitely! You have to realize that even the disciples of the academy go to the marketplace from time to time. If we’re fortunate enough, we might even be fancied by one of them. At that time, won’t we be soaring into the sky?” Tang Chi said in excitement.

......

After finishing their meal, they immediately set off for the marketplace.

It wasn’t long before they arrived. Sure enough, this place was a sea of people.

In fact, this place was simply an expanse of empty land. However, many stands and booths had been set up, and they were more so lined up in a neat and orderly manner. Each row of stands measured hundreds of meters in length, and there were at least several hundred rows in total. Just how many stands and how many people were there?

Each stand was crowded with several people looking through the goods.

Exchanges here were largely completed using Star Stones. However, if one didn’t have enough Star Stones, they could also use other items to pay. Of course, this was as long as both sides agreed.

With Ling Han’s current?cultivation1, he could strike down a celestial body with a single punch. Thus, he still had some Star Stones, although not very many. However, while refining the Divine Metal in the volcano, he had picked up some fire-element crystals that were extremely valuable to cultivators who practiced the Great Dao of Fire.

He wandered around with Tang Chi and Xu Qiang, looking through the stands. Tang Chi and Xu Qiang had already bought some items, yet Ling Han was still empty-handed.

This wasn’t because the items here were inferior in quality. Rather, it was because Ling Han’s cultivation level was far too high. Thus, he naturally didn’t care much for ordinary treasures. Only things such as Divine Metal could attract his attention.

There were Celestial medicines being sold here, yet not a single one had reached the Celestial King Tier. After all, who would sell such a valuable item here?

Ling Han was slightly disappointed. However, he immediately accepted this fact. If a valuable item were so easy to find, would it still be left to him to buy?

With this in mind, he immediately felt at ease.

However, after walking around for 10 days, he was still completely empty-handed.

Right at this moment, commotion suddenly erupted in the distance.

“What is it? What’s going on?” Tang Chi asked in curiosity. He stood on his tippy-toes to peer into the distance.

Only after a while did they learn that a disciple of the academy had come. It was because of this that commotion had erupted. Many people had rushed over to chum up to them, trying to win their approval and become their follower.

“It’s Doka,” Tang Chi said. “I think he came over from the Shattered Army Realm 9,000,000 years ago. He’s a monarch tier, and I heard that he advanced to the Second Heaven not long ago.”

“It’s a Celestial King! Tsk, tsk.” Xu Qiang wore an expression of envy. Both he and Tang Chi were only king tiers, so it would be incredibly difficult for them to become Celestial Kings.

Moreover, if it weren’t for the fact that this was a transcendent dimension, it would be completely impossible for king tiers to become Celestial Kings based on their own effort alone.

As Doka walked around, he continued to cause commotion among those in the surroundings. They all expressed their eagerness, and some stand owners even allowed him to choose some of their items for free. However, Doka didn’t take any of their goods.

He was a Celestial King, so very few things could grab his attention.

Ling Han retracted his gaze. There was no need for him to care about a measly monarch tier.

He continued to scan the goods. After arriving at the next stand, he rested his gaze on a cauldron.

This cauldron was extremely old and damaged, and it was more so covered in dust. If it were tossed on the street, it was very likely that no one would pick it up.

Ling Han didn’t notice anything strange about this cauldron. Instead, he was simply surprised that it had been put here for sale. It wasn’t genuinely a broken cauldron, was it?

He picked it up and examined it carefully.

The stand owner was a middle-aged man, and he simply glanced at Ling Han without stopping him. He said, “I discovered this cauldron in an ancient tomb. It’s extremely sturdy.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then can I give it a hard smack?”

“Sure,” the middle-aged man said with a nod. “Smack it as hard as you want. If you truly manage to break it, I won’t ask for compensation.”

“Alright then,” Ling Han said with a nod. He then smacked the cauldron. There was a dull thud, yet the cauldron didn’t vibrate at all.

‘Interesting!’

Ling Han could sense that this cauldron hadn’t been forged from Divine Metal. After all, Divine Metal possessed a peculiar aura that was similar to that of a Celestial King. However, this cauldron seemed dull and lifeless, completely lacking the lively and noble aura of Divine Metal.

Regardless, just its sturdiness alone was a sign of its extraordinary nature.

‘Can I use this as a pill refinement cauldron?’

Ling Han mulled over this. Pill refinement cauldrons needed to be sturdy and immune to fire.

Just as he was about to speak, commotion suddenly erupted again in front of them.

“They’ve started fighting!” Tang Chi exclaimed in excitement. “It’s Doka and Yang Zhixuan. It seems like they both set their sights on an ancient item, yet neither side was willing to yield to the other. In the end, they started fighting.”

“Gasp! Yang Zhixuan!” Xu Qiang said with a sharp inhale.

“Yang Zhixuan? Is he also a disciple?” Ling Han asked casually.

“No, no, no, he’s not a disciple. He’s only a follower!” Tang Chi replied with a shake of his head. He wore a solemn expression.

‘Only a follower? What’s so impressive about that?’

“He’s the follower of Lord Heavenborn!” Xu Qiang added. Both his tone and expression were filled with respect and apprehension.

Ling Han’s heart involuntarily jolted. Heavenborn!

“Yang Zhixuan is a Celestial King himself, and he’s more so a Second Heaven Celestial King. No matter where he is, will he not be a renowned individual? However, he was still willing to become Lord Heavenborn’s follower,” Tang Chi said, chiming in where Xu Qiang left off.

“You definitely can’t underestimate Yang Zhixuan. Of course, Lord Heavenborn is naturally even more terrifying than him. He was actually able to obtain a Celestial King as a loyal follower!” Xi Qiang said in admiration.

Indeed, Celestial Kings would be mighty elites no matter where they went. Yet, this person was actually willing to become someone’s follower. This was definitely a huge piece of news that further highlighted the freakish power of Heavenborn.

“I’m heading over to spectate the battle,” the stand owner said, snatching the cauldron back from Ling Han. He then placed all of his items into a Spatial God Tool before immediately squeezing his way forward.

Since this was the case, Ling Han also went over with the others to catch a glimpse of the battle.
