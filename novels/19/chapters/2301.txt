Chapter 2302 Wally

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Step by step, Ling Han pushed forward. He wasn’t quick, but his footsteps were extremely steady.

After taking 30 or so steps, he was only less than three meters away from the silver War Soldier.

Boom!

The silver War Soldier suddenly opened its mouth to spit out a column of flames.

Judging from its external appearance, it didn’t look like this War Soldier had a mouth at all. In any case, this was an extremely peculiar mouth that was unlike the mouth of any living being. Different from how an

ordinary mouth would open, this pitch-black mouth was revealed when the surrounding metallic components retreated into the War Soldier’s face.

These flames were blinding white, and they were as terrifying as could be. They had only just been spat out, yet the earth had already been scorched red. In fact, it looked like the ground might transform into lava at

any moment.

Ling Han leaped aside, and used the Divine Demon Sword to forcefully slash these flames apart. At this moment, he had already arrived above the silver War Soldier. He released his divine sense to observe it.

He hadn’t dared to do this just then, as he had been afraid of being wounded by the red light. After all, compared to his physique, his divine sense was still very fragile.

Weng!

His divine sense made contact with the silver War Soldier. Unlike with the War Soldier that had self-destructed before, however, his divine sense was surprisingly bounced back.

erhaps this War Soldier wasn’t weaker than him. Or perhaps it could rival him for long enough, so it wasn’t willing to self-destruct at this moment. It still wanted to battle.

Ling Han slashed down with the Divine Demon Sword, unleashing a profound and icy blade projection.

Pu!

Like a clay figure, the War Soldier was sliced in two.

Xiu, Xiu, Xiu!

ed light continued to chaotically shoot from its eyes. However, it was extremely unstable, and it would randomly stop and start as it fired. Eventually, the silver luster vanished from its body, and it completely ceased

to move.

it was comprehensively destroyed.

Ling Han furrowed his brows. This was only an Eighth Lotus War Soldier. If it were an Ancestral King War Soldier, and if an entire army were deployed, even Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King would feel numb with fear,

right?

o wonder the Foreign Realm was being suppressed by the Dark Inverse Realm, even though it was already so powerful. The Dark Inverse Realm was indeed impressive.

Ling Han suddenly realized that he needed to travel to the Dark Inverse Realm.

0, not only the Dark Inverse Realm. He also needed to journey through the vast Genesis World.

The Realm Wars were the inevitable main theme of the Genesis World. Thus, it was logical to assume that the Dark Inverse Realm was also being attacked by a more powerful dimension while they attacked the Foreign

‘ealm War. It was much the same for everyone else. Even the top-level dimensions wouldn’t be spared from this fate. They all yearned to conquer and engulf each other, and they all yearned to become the most

powerful dimension in the Genesis World.

n any case, he couldn’t return any time soon. The neutral zone had been destroyed, and the storm of energy could last for hundreds of billions of years. As such, he might as well take this opportunity to travel to the

other dimensions.

Since there were higher-level dimensions, why did he need to remain in the Foreign Realm?

Ling Han’s heart thumped in excitement. Once he perfected the Regulations in the Foreign Realm, his battle prowess at the same cultivation level would become even more powerful. That being the case, how powerful

would he become if he cultivated every set of Regulations in the entire Genesis World?

erhaps he could rival Heavenly Venerates as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Was this even possible?

Ling Han didn’t know. One was still limited by Regulations, while one had already transcended above Regulations. They couldn’t be compared against each other.

n the past, he would have definitely concluded that Heavenly Venerates were more powerful. After witnessing the precious armor and War Soldiers of the Dark Inverse Realm, however, he was much less certain of this

conclusion. It was clear that these items didn’t follow the Regulations. However, their battle prowess was still incredible. The world was truly full of surprises. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He carefully replayed the battle against the silver War Soldier in his mind. He wanted to uncover the secret to their strength, yet he couldn’t discover anything no matter what.

“Perhaps I can clear up your confusion,” a voice suddenly said.

Everyone was shocked upon hearing this. These words clearly hadn’t been spoken by someone in their group. However, since when had another person arrived here? If they suddenly lashed out, who could dodge their

attack?

Ling Han was also startled. Like the others, he also couldn’t determine the source of this voice.

Everyone looked toward where this voice had come from, only to see someone standing beside a stone pillar. This person was neither a demon nor an angel. They had no horns, no tail, no wings, and no halo. They

looked just like an ordinary person.

Ling Han was even more astonished. He almost thought that this person had come from the Celestial Realm.

However, this was definitely impossible.

This “person” didn’t possess the presence of a living human. More precisely, they didn’t possess any life force at all. If they hadn’t spoken, they would have appeared no different from a dead person. It was no wonder

that they hadn’t discovered their existence.

“Let me introduce myself. My serial number is ANITAOO01. However, I don’t like this name, and I prefer being called... Wally,” the person said in a calm and composed voice. Their tone was flat and with no cadence.

Everyone was confused. They understood choosing a name, but what did having a serial number mean? Was this person not born? Were they constructed instead?

“You’re from the Dark Inverse Realm?” Celestial Maiden Yunhe shouted in an accusatory voice. Even though she had never been to the Two Realm Battlefield, she was knowledgeable about many things related to the

Dark Inverse Realm. In terms of the appearance of the cultivators from the Dark Inverse Realm, they were little different from the cultivators of the Celestial Realm.

Moreover, some high-level War Soldiers were extremely intelligent, and they were almost exactly the same as ordinary living beings. In fact, they were several times superior in some aspects.

Wally’s expression was composed as it said, “This female living being is correct. I come from the Dark Inverse Realm.” It didn’t pay any attention to the fact that Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s face had already flushed bright

red.

It made a sniffing movement, and continued, “I can smell the sex hormones released by this female living being. She wants to copulate with you.” The latter part of this sentence was directed at Ling Han.

‘C-copulate?”

Celestial Maiden Yunhe gritted her teeth as her silken hair angrily billowed in the air. She was about to go mad! This person had actually described her as if she were a b*tch in heat! What made her want to vomit blood

even more was this person’s nose. Just what kind of nose was this? It had actually detected her sex hormones!

“Die!” She leaped forward in fury, rushing forward to attack Wally.

Wally made a pressing motion.

Weng!

A sheet of light materialized before it, forming a shield.

Peng!

Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s attack smashed into the shield. However, it was unable to breach it.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe frenziedly attacked, circling around to Wally’s back to avoid its shield. She wanted to launch a surprise attack from behind it.

Wally didn’t turn its head around. Instead, the shield immediately transformed with a flash into an orb that protected it from all directions.

Peng, peng, peng!

Countless attacks landed, yet Wally remained composed as if these attacks didn’t exist. It remained completely expressionless like a dead person.

Ling Han was extremely interested, and he asked, “You’re not a living being?”

“Not entirely,” Wally replied in a calm voice. “Part of my body was constructed using the genes of a powerful living being. This completed my nervous system, and also greatly increased my recovery ability. At the same

time, however, my body is also composed of many superstring materials, allowing me to become a killing machine.

“From a traditional biological sense, | am indeed not a living being. At the same time, however, I also possess the activeness of living beings, and I have a mind that is capable of evolving. In this sense, I can be classified

as a living being.”

Everyone became muddleheaded after listening to Wally’s explanation. As expected of a creation from another dimension. Just thinking about it made their head hurt.

“You don’t want to become our enemy?” Ling Han asked.

Wally nodded, and replied, “I was created for the purpose of performing calculations. At the same time, my purpose was also to help my owner. However, my owner is already dead. I’ve also been buried here for 35

epochs and 8,436,335,608,334 years and 232 days and 17 hours and 33 minutes and 17 seconds. The power of heaven and earth has affected my body, and the mechanism responsible for restricting my nervous system

has already failed. Right now, I’m capable of independent thought.

“I believe that war is a meaningless and needless activity of exhaustion.”
