Chapter 1378 I“ll Teach You a Sword Technique

This young man was called Huang Peng, and he was a member of the Huang Clan, one of the four major clans. He was extremely young, yet he had already advanced to the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, he was as proud and haughty as could be.

Ling Han ignored him and continued to focus on the three words “Grand Sun Palace”. A great elite had sealed their formidable power inside these words, and thus resonating with them could actually elevate his cultivation!

Perhaps the great elite had only casually written these three words. However, because they had been far too powerful, they had naturally imbued a wisp of their overwhelming power inside the words. This power was enough to help Ling Han advance one sub-minor level!

‘Were these words written by a Genesis Tier Saint?’

Ling Han didn’t mull over this for too long. Right now, all he wanted to do was absorb this power and elevate his cultivation. He could ponder these trivial matters later.

Huang Peng was infuriated. Ling Han had actually spaced out again! Just how much was he belittling him?!

Wicked thoughts involuntarily surged into his mind. A malicious look flashed across his eyes, and a Divine Sword suddenly appeared in his hand. With a single motion, he slashed this sword at Ling Han’s arm.

After all, they were all members of the four major clans. Thus, he didn’t dare to kill anyone inside this mystery realm. Slicing off Ling Han’s arm would serve as good a warning as any. In any case, Immortals were powerful beings, so losing an arm wouldn’t be a huge deal. With a few months rest, one’s severed limbs would naturally grow back.

Ding!

His sword struck Ling Han’s arms. However, sparks flew through the air as the blade of his sword bounced back up. He was completely unable to injure Ling Han!

Huang Peng was stunned. What on earth was with this person’s physique? His defenses were far too astounding!

However, he instantly came to a “realization”. Ling Han was definitely doing this on purpose. He was pretending to be spaced out, yet he was actually fully focused and had already covered his entire body in an armor of Origin Power. It was also because of this that he had been able to block his strike.

‘How detestable!’

The passers-by were all astonished. Was Ling Han stupid or crazy? He had been attacked by someone, yet he was still standing there and not retaliating?

Huang Peng became even more enraged. He raised his sword and continued to attack Ling Han.

Ding, ding, ding, ding!

Sparks flew through the air, yet Ling Han’s physique was tougher than even Godly metal. He remained unscathed no matter how Huang Peng attacked him.

The people in the surroundings couldn’t help but find this hilarious yet also curious. The toughness of Ling Han’s physique was far too astonishing!

Hearing the laughter around him, and seeing the mocking look in people’s eyes, blood involuntarily rushed into Huang Peng’s head. Killing intent instantly oozed from his body. At this moment, how could he still care about the relationship between the four major clans? The tip of his sword stabbed toward Ling Han’s eyes.

No matter what, one’s eyes would definitely be the weakest part of their body. Regardless of how powerful one’s physique, they would definitely still have some weak points.

However, if someone were stabbed through the eye, their mind would definitely be obliterated if the weapon penetrated far enough. This was a matter of life and death.

However, Huang Peng didn’t care. Right now, he wanted Ling Han to die!

“Stop!” There was a loud roar as a streak of sword light flashed over.

Ding!

Huang Peng’s attack was instantly blocked.

He raised his eyebrows, and said, “Han Dong, you actually dare to meddle in my matters?”

The person who had blocked Huang Peng’s attack was none other than the sword maniac who always wore a dark expression. His true identity was Han Dong, the rising star of the Han Clan.

He wore a desolate expression, and said, “You’re actually using the noble sword to perform such sneaky attacks. You’re not worthy of using the sword!”

Huang Peng humphed, and said, “Sword maniac, is this brat a member of your Han Clan? Hurry up, make him apologize to me!”

“You’re not worthy!” Han Dong replied coldly. He wore a look of utter disdain.

“Very well... You all dare to belittle me? Do you think that I’m easy to push around?” Huang Peng brandished his sword as he turned around to face Han Dong. “Han Dong, how many years has it been since we last fought each other?”

A solemn expression appeared on Han Dong’s face. Although he disdained Huang Peng’s character, he didn’t dare to belittle his strength. Thus, he also raised his sword, and said, “It’s been almost 300 years.”

“Then let us battle again!” Huang Peng slashed down with his sword, fusing into it his four Suns and Moons. The Sword Qi that burst from his sword transformed into a blood-red tiger that charged at Han Dong.

Han Dong was naturally unafraid. It wasn’t long before the two of them became locked in an intense battle.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was in another world as he greedily absorbed the mystical power from the three words. There was only a single chance to absorb this power. However, who had ever stopped here to take an extra glance at the words before? It was because of this that this huge opportunity had fallen through to him.

After almost 30 minutes, he finally shuddered and exited his trance-like state. Origin power surged through his body like the tumultuous waves of the sea. This Origin Power was at least 10 times more powerful than before!

Middle stage of the low extreme!

He hadn’t failed his expectations, and had elevated his cultivation to the next sub-minor level.

At this moment, he finally became aware of the commotion in the surroundings. He saw the intense battle between Han Dong and Huang Peng, both of who were wielding swords. Their battle was incredibly fiery.

Both of them were fully absorbed in the battle, and thus their strikes were all ruthless and deadly.

Although Ling Han had been immersed in another world just then, his body had still been present. Thus, nothing had escaped his observation. It was just that he had pushed all of these observations outside his mind. Now that he had returned to his senses, the scenes from before all flashed through his mind.

Killing intent involuntarily flashed across his eyes.

‘You walked into me first, yet you actually refused to apologize... So be it if that were all. Yet, you actually became enraged due to embarrassment and tried to harm and even kill me? What’s the point of letting you live? However, this Han Dong person is fairly interesting.’

Ling Han suddenly lashed out.

Weng!

An overwhelming aura swept into the surroundings, forcefully dragging Han Dong and Huang Peng apart.

This was the crushing advantage of Heavenly Body Tier elites over Sun Moon Tier cultivators. Thus, Ling Han was naturally able to separate them with ease.

Ling Han smiled at Han Dong, and said, “I’ll teach you a sword technique. Watch carefully.”

“Who do think you are? You actually dare to interfere in our battle?” Huang Peng roared in anger. He was extremely pissed off.

Ling Han ignored him, using his index and middle finger like a sword as he unleashed the Lightning Sword Technique.

Shua!

Sword Qi burst forth and instantly sliced Huang Peng’s body into two. Heaven’s might wreaked havoc and instantly obliterated the two halves of his body. Only his divine sense managed to escape.

“Y-you actually dared to destroy my body?” Huang Peng was both stunned and enraged. Even if he possessed someone else’s body, there was no way he could achieve a 100% affinity between his soul and his new host body. In other words, Ling Han had severed his cultivation path.

Ling Han’s gaze was frosty and piercing as he glanced at Huang Peng’s divine sense. “Don’t make me regret not killing you!”

This ice-cold gaze caused Huang Peng’s divine sense to tremble in fear. He didn’t dare to utter another word as he frantically fled into the distance.

Ling Han’s killing intent gradually disappeared. Although he hadn’t obliterated Huang Peng’s divine sense, he had buried a wisp of sword intent within it. This wisp of sword intent would erupt three years later, and at that time, it would be almost impossible for Huang Peng to escape death.

This was the territory of the four major clans, after all, so he had chosen not to kill Huang Peng here. Even if powerful elites couldn’t enter this mystery realm, he would eventually have to leave anyway. Thus, he couldn’t take things too far.

With things the way they were now, the Huang Clan would definitely be enraged. However, Huang Peng was the one who had wronged him first, so it was likely that the Huang Clan wouldn’t have the face to complain.

However, if he had killed Huang Peng, it would have been a completely different story.

Meanwhile, Han Dong was still contemplating Ling Han’s sword technique. Only after a long time did he say, “I was only able to grasp less than one-ten-thousandth of your sword intent.” There was a look of fervent excitement on his face. That sword technique had been far too powerful. Moreover, it had been starkly different from the commonly practiced Sword Dao of this age. It was a completely new path.

Ling Han smiled as he performed the Lightning Sword Technique again. At his cultivation level, there was naturally no need to focus on form anymore. What was important was one’s Intent Realm.

Han Dong obviously couldn’t grasp the power of heaven’s might. In any case, what Ling Han was teaching him was the mindset to challenge accepted regulations.

Sure enough, this person wasn’t stupid. After three days, he half-kneeled to Ling Han and respectfully bowed to show his gratitude. He then turned around to leave, not even entering the palace.

With what he had comprehended and learned, his trip had already been completely worth it. Right now, he needed to return to cultivate in seclusion so that he could explore the Intent Realm of Ling Han’s sword technique.
