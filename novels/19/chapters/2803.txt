2804 Junior Sister

Ling Han stated calmly, “He Yufeng, if we’re being honest, was it I who had started this?”

He Yufeng did not answer, and merely said, “If you can, just kill me. What’s the point of hesitation?”

As a Heavenly Venerate, he still had that amount of backbone.

Ling Han shook his head. “Since that is the case, I will send you on your way.”

!!

He laid down his palm, and He Yufeng was instantly smashed into bits of blood. The strength of Second Tier could not withstand even a single blow.

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation’s eyes narrowed again. It should be known that Ling Han was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

A First Tier was actually so powerful, possessing the strength of a Third Tier, no, a peak-stage Third Tier?

Hiss, she had been mistaken. She had truly been mistaken.

At first, she had thought that Ling Han was not worthy of Hu Niu, but from the look of things now, as long as Ling Han could maintain this kind of growth and continue, would there be anyone that could match him in this world when he reached the Fifth Tier or Sixth Tier?

Of course, the path of a Heavenly Venerate was extremely difficult to walk. The extreme majority of Heavenly Venerates would only be able to take one step forwards in a whole epoch. How could it be so easy for Ling Han to be completely invincible? It was possible that he would die long before his time while he was still maturing.

Ling Han withdrew his hand, and nodded towards the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation. “Senior, come in and take a seat. Allow me to serve you some tea as courtesy.”

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation agreed. She was extremely interested in Ling Han, and wanted to know how he had been cultivating to become this strong.

Everyone entered Ling City together. Those who had previously abandoned the city, too, wanted to follow them in, but they were coldly refused entrance.

Ling Han did not demand that they help, but these people had forgotten Ling Han’s previous kindness, and fled when Ling Han was in “danger,” and wanted to come back to worship him now that the danger was over. How could these broken bridges be mended?

Though Ling Han was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation did not dare to underestimate this young man. Just look, He Liqun’s body was still warm. She had no wish to follow in his footsteps… though she suspected that it was possible that Ling Han should not have this kind of trump card any more.

But suspicion was suspicion. How could it be that she would use her own life to bring this matter to a test? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation abandoned her airs. As one who had cultivated to the Fourth Tier, she had astonishing experiences. No matter where the conversation headed, she could talk eloquently about the topic, as if she had invested boundless energy in it.

She stayed a few days at Ling City, and then left alone.

Hu Niu had already reached the Second Tier, and there was not much she could provide guidance for this disciple of hers any more. Whatever height Hu Niu could reach in the future would have to depend on Hu Niu herself.

Though an epoch had passed, Hu Niu’s personality had not changed in the slightest. When she found out that Ling Han and the Empress already had a daughter, she was extremely jealous, bawling every day. Then, she would cling to Ling Han in various ways, wanting Ling Han to give her a little baby as well.

TIme passed swiftly, and a good number of years passed. The news of the death of He Liqun and his son also spread out gradually, intimidating quite a number of people who bore ambitious ideas.

Originally, now that the war had ended, and the previous rules prohibiting infighting naturally no longer existed, quite a number of people coveted that Heavenly Venerable Seal that Ling Han had obtained at Black Waterfall Mountain.

However, they had not moved as fast as He Liqun, and that was why they had been one step behind. Still, there was an advantage to being late. Just look, they were all feeling very fortunate. If they had been in the lead, the ones killed would not have been He Liqun and his son, but rather them instead.

The question was: did Ling Han still have this kind of trump card?

No one dared to easily test this out. They had all cultivated to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, so who would not cherish their own life? Moreover, Ling Han’s battle prowess had reached peak-stage Third Tier. At least Fourth-Tier battle prowess had to be mobilized to force out his trump card.

Battle prowess at the Fourth Tier?

How many such elites were there? Which one of them was not the overlord of their territory? Would they be willing to work for others and test Ling Han?

Hence, Ling Han had clearly revealed his whereabouts, yet no one went to Ling City to cause him any trouble.

However, Ling Han knew that this was only temporary. Heavenly Venerable Seals were too valuable, and there would definitely be some who could not keep from making a move. The only question was who would be the first to make the move.

Another year passed, and an uninvited visitor arrived in Ling City.

“Junior Sister, I’m here to see you.” A voice rang out boomingly, causing the whole Ling City to tremble.

Junior Sister? What junior sister?

The Empress was the first to leap out. She stood in midair, and asked, “Who is it?”

“I am Zhang Kailun. Dare I ask if my junior sister, Hu Niu, is here?” a man asked. He had an extremely sturdy build and a very strong aura.

The Empress’s eyes widened slightly. The pressure that this man gave her was close to what Ling Han exuded, so his battle prowess should be about the same, which was at the Third Tier. She nodded. “Hu Niu is indeed here.”

Zhang Kailun was very polite, and said, “Then please help me to inform her.”

“Big Rock, what are you looking for Niu for?” Hu Niu appeared, but she was draped over Ling Han’s back. At present, the little girl was clinging to Ling Han, trying to make up for their epoch-long separation.

When Zhang Kailun saw this, his expression instantly changed drastically.

He liked this junior sister, and ever since the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation had brought Hu Niu back, and he had first set eyes on her, he had already fallen in love with this quirky, mischievous little junior sister. But he had concentrated on cultivation, and was not good at expressing himself. In any case, the lifespan of Heavenly Venerates was unlimited, so he was not in a rush, either.

He had not thought that this period of seclusion would be slightly longer, and the moment he came out of seclusion, he heard the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation tell him that Hu Niu was not coming back, as she was going to spend wonderful days with her little lover.

Thus, he immediately charged over, wanting to save his junior sister from Ling Han’s “evil grasp.”

“Junior Sister, how could you act like this?” Zhang Kailun immediately rebuked, jealousy written all over his face, as if he had witnessed his wife cheating on him.

Ling Han was not happy now. Was there any need for his wife to be ordered around by others?

He immediately spread out his hands, and said, “I say, are you in any position to rebuke her?”

“Humph, and who are you?” Zhang Kailun demanded condescendingly. Though the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation had expressed a very high opinion of Ling Han in her words, Zhang Kailun definitely would not believe that a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could possess Third-Tier battle prowess.

This had to be because the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation doted on Hu Niu too much, and had exaggerated the matter.

“Go, go, go. Don’t worry unnecessarily.” Ling Han waved a hand dismissively.

“A mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate actually dares to act insolent in front of me?” Zhang Kailun was also feeling slight disbelief. He had never seen such an arrogant First Tier Heavenly Venerate. Could it be that Ling Han did not know that he was a Third Tier? Furthermore, he had already cultivated to peak-stage Third Tier, and was only just a little bit away from attaining Fourth Tier!

Zhang Kailun thought for a while, and then “understood.” As he thought, Ling Han should indeed have some talent, and that was why he had developed such a condescending, arrogant personality.

Humph, in that case, there was more reason for him to interfere now. How could he easily leave his junior sister to such a pompous, grandiose man?

“Looks like I need to teach you a good lesson about the need to maintain an attitude of absolute respect towards elites!” he declared proudly, and stretched out his hand towards Ling Han. Power condensed, turning into a greenish black giant hand that moved to enshroud Ling Han.

“Big Rock, Niu is going to beat you until you burst!” Hu Niu was the first to flip out, and leaped up from Ling Han’s back. A silvery radiance was wrapped around her fist as she moved to retaliate against that greenish black giant hand.

“Junior Sister!” Zhang Kailun exclaimed, and hurriedly withdrew his giant hand. He was worried that he would accidentally wound Hu Niu.

In this manner, his attack dispersed on its own.

...

“Big Rock, scram. Niu hates you.” Hu Niu waved her hand, looking like she was swatting away a fly.
