Chapter 2098: Anyone saying malicious words will die

Ling Han continuously barraged that Yin Soul Jade, and was rebounded time after time. Yet, he was still relentless.

This Yin Soul Jade was the largest that Ling Han had seen, and it was indeed said that the larger the Yin Soul Jade, the better its effects would be.

Moreover, this Yin Soul Jade was also in the deepest depths of the pool. He was sure that this was the king of all the Yin Soul Jades here.

He would either give up altogether, or demand the best.

Ling Han’s heart was set on this Yin Soul Jade. He swore that he would not give up unless he managed to capture it.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

With every crash, he was like a fish that had no measure of its own abilities crashing into a solid embankment. There was absolutely no possibility for him to destroy the embankment. Instead, it would only badly bruise him, but to Ling Han, if he could not break it with one crash, then he would slam against it a second time, and then a third time. As long as he did not give up, the embankment would ultimately be destroyed by his barrage.

Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, half a year had passed, and in another blink, 10 years had passed.

30 years, 50 years, 100 years!

By the side of the pool, some people had long since obtained their Yin Soul Jade, and completed their breakthrough, leaving happily. There were also people who had stayed here for an unknown number of years. They had no choice but to leave for the moment, because they still had people they were concerned about, and could not stay here endlessly.

However, stimulating the Yin Soul Jade was a very time-consuming matter in the first place. Ordinarily, it would take 100 years at minimum, all the way to the maximum of 1,000 years—if you still could not stimulate the Yin Soul Jade after a millennium, you had best try with another one. Otherwise, it would definitely be hopeless.

Whether it was Ling Han, the Empress, Hu Niu, or Bewitching Maiden Rou, none of them had stimulated their Yin Soul Jade yet, and they were sitting as still as statues.

200 years, 500 years, 800 years!

New people came in, and when they saw that there were actually four people sitting near the pool, their eyes bulged in shock, especially on seeing Ling Han, who was seated right next to the pool. He only had to stretch out his hand, and he would be able to touch the water. This was practically something that only a Celestial King could accomplish.

1,000 years!

Xiu, a streak of light suddenly swept out of the pool. That was a piece of jade, and it shot rapidly towards Bewitching Maiden Rou. With a?pa, it crashed into her forehead, yet strangely did not cause any damage. Instead, like a buffalo made of mud entering water, it quickly phased inside.

It was only the blink of an eye, and this piece of jade had disappeared from sight.

“She has obtained a Yin Soul Jade!”

“A Yin Soul Jade obtained at the 84-meter point would definitely be incredibly powerful when it fuses into her divided soul.”

“Even Tian He has only obtained his Yin Soul Jade at the 90-meter point, and he has practically defeated even all Earth Souls in the 30 great cities in the vicinity of our Capital Star City. This woman… would definitely be even stronger.”

“Could it be that she can match even an opponent at Heaven Soul’s early stage?”

“We can only wait and see.”

Under the envious and jealous eyes of the others, Bewitching Maiden Rou began to harmonize with her Yin Soul Jade, attempting the breakthrough to Yin Soul.

“However, why isn’t there any sign at all from the other three?”

“It has already been 1,000 years, which is more or less the maximum.”

“They must have overestimated themselves, and wanted to stimulate a Yin Soul Jade that exceeds their standards. The natural result is that they could not possibly succeed.”

“That’s right. Did they think that just taking a few more steps forwards would definitely allow them to stimulate the best Yin Soul Jade? How naive. While we can choose the jade, so would the jade choose the person.”

Those short-sighted people began to make their cynical remarks again. However, Ling Han and the others had indeed used more than 1,000 years’ time, which the others could say nothing about. These three people had probably already switched to a new target, or it would only be pointless effort.

1,500 years, 2,000 years!

“Why haven’t the three of them succeeded yet?”

“That’s right, this kind of prodigy should have been able to very easily stimulate a Yin Soul Jade.”

“Hehe, could it be that you guys don’t know? A great many prodigies would be outstandingly talented at the beginning, but very quickly, they would disappear among the crowd. As I look at it, these three people are perfect examples of that.”

“At present, we are inferior to them, but when we advance to Heaven Soul, or even advance to Immortal Palace Tier, these three people may still be in Yang Soul. Then we would be able to suppress them single-handedly.”

These people became more and more unscrupulous. Only idiots and mediocre people would produce zero results after a few millennia. Normal people would definitely be able to obtain the Yin Soul Jade in around 1,000 years’ time.

“Those two women are really not bad. When I become a Heaven Soul… Hehehe!”

“Hahaha!”

“Hehehe!”

Not only were they disparaging Ling Han and the others, they had even dared to have evil designs on the Empress and Hu Niu, looking at the two women with perverse looks.

Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

Human figures flew like they were made of straw. Bewitching Maiden Rou stopped, but blazing killing intent swept over her brow. It was she who had moved just now, sending those who had dared to speak such filthy words flying.

“You…” Those that had been sent flying all got back to their feet, looking at Bewitching Maiden Rou with furious eyes, and seemed like they would gang up on her.

However, Bewitching Maiden Rou smiled beautifully. “Everyone, how about taking a dip in the pool?”

These words were very alluring, and would cause anyone’s heart to beat faster.

Those people looked conflicted, but very quickly, their expressions became captivated and slightly vacant. They really set off and headed towards the Jade Pool.

What kind of place was the Jade Pool?

It was a place where the coldness seeped directly into the bones. That was where the highest Regulations of Water existed, something equivalent to the presence of a Celestial King. Even an Ascending Origin Tier would not dare to touch the pool waters directly, and within Dividing Soul Tier, an emperor tier of Yang Soul would only be able to get about 90 meters from the pool, while even a monarch tier would be able to approach around 30 meters or so.

As for the others, it would already be very impressive if they managed to make it to around 150 meters.

There wasn’t even a king tier among these people, and they naturally were incredibly ordinary. They had not walked forwards for very long when ice began to collect on their bodies, and mucus started involuntarily flowing from their noses. However, it had just barely flowed out when it became icicles that hang from their noses. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Everyone’s faces were as white as paper. This kind of extraordinary coldness possessed the ability to kill.

Not too long later, a person stopped, and he had stopped for eternity, turned into an ice statue where he was standing. If no one interfered, he would stand there for eternity, serving as a warning for future generations.

…Without enough strength, don’t even think of approaching the Jade Pool.

Where there was a first person, there would be a second, and then a third. More and more people had turned into ice statues.

“W-witch!” The others were shocked at this scene.

If these people had frozen to death, having been tossed into the pool by Bewitching Maiden Rou, they would only sigh at the strength of Bewitching Maiden Rou’s battle prowess. However, she was an emperor tier, after all, and a prodigy among emperor tiers at that. Thus, it would not be anything remarkable for her to possess such strength,

However, she had only smiled beautifully, and these people still smiled as they walked onwards even when they were clearly aware that only death lay ahead of them. Just what kind of terrifying ability was that?

If she demanded that they kill their lover, children, parents, and friends, would they also execute her order? When they regained consciousness, what kind of agony would they be in then?

What a terrifying witch! She was too frightening!

Bewitching Maiden Rou merely swept an eye over the masses, and did not speak, but what she wanted to express was fully expressed.

No one can speak badly about our Ling Clan, and whoever does will die!

Overbearing?

She was overbearing, but so what? If you were not satisfied, come fight her then.

When this stand of power was established, everyone could not be any more well-behaved. To say nothing of king tiers, even when emperor tiers came, there was practically no possibility that they could match Bewitching Maiden Rou—she had advanced into Yin Soul by now, and her battle prowess could defeat all Earth Souls, and even in the case of Heaven Souls, she could put up a fight.

3,000 years, 4,000 years, 5,000 years!

Xiu, xiu, two streaks of light shot out of the pool at practically the same time. It was another two Yin Soul Jades, and they flew towards the Empress and Hu Niu, respectively.
