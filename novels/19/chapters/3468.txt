Chapter 3469: Chessboard

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

With Ling Han’s rate of cultivation, he would probably be able to break through again in less than ten days.

This was so fast!

Wasn’t it that the higher one’s cultivation level, the slower one’s rate of cultivation would be?

Ling Han thought about what the Calabash Brothers had said in the past, and couldn’t help but feel a thought well up in his mind. Probably, only if he advanced into the Celestial Path, would he be considered to have truly begun the path of martial arts.

Just like in the Genesis World, how long would it take to advance from Body Refining Tier to Shattering Void Tier? In the Lower Realm, how long would it take to advance to Shattering Void Tier? And in the Immortal Realm, how much would it take? In fact, in the Celestial Realm, some people would directly skip this process at birth.

For example, the Calabash Brothers were born without any shackles. As long as they grew, their cultivation level would naturally increase. Furthermore, they were the kind of being that had broken through the limits, so their level of being was naturally superior to others.

Thus, the fact that he was now cultivating faster wasn’t because he was too heaven-defying, but rather that in the real world of martial arts, this stage was completely the beginning of a journey, so it was normal for his cultivation speed to be faster.

Wasn’t it said that having a Treasured Fruit could allow one to reach the heavens in a single step, directly reach the level of Inscription, Enlightenment, or even find Mystery Realm Tier?

This was proof enough.

Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared. In this way, he would be able to reach Mystery Realm Tier in the shortest time possible, catching up to the standards of the current younger generation, and after stepping on the Celestial Path, it would no longer be possible for him to advance so rapidly. Evenan Innate Divine Physique would not be able to ignore the existence of the barrier of cultivation level.

For example, the Demon Race. After advancing into Celestial Path, they would not have much of an advantage over humans.

Ling Han released the babies. He had prepared very well for this trip. At least, he had brought enough food with him. Not only did he have the Essence Nurturing Gourd, but he had also seized a considerable number of Spatial Spirit Tools, which he had filled completely with food.

Thus, there was absolutely no need to worry that they would starve to death if they stayed here for too long.

The eight of them continued onwards, and entered into the forest.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han was surprised. He discovered that there were signs of people walking ahead of him.

It was not a wild beast, but rather humans.

There was actually someone that had managed to get ahead of him?

Ling Han was slightly disbelieving. Previously, he was far in the lead, and though he had spent some time plucking the Treasured Fruit of Life, there shouldn’t be such a big gap, right?

If someone was always in front of him, why didn’t they pluck the Treasured Fruit of Life?

It can’t be that he considered it not worth his while; it was the Treasured Fruit of Life, after all!

Forget it, he’d just leave.

Ling Han raised his guard, and passed through this dense forest. A small platform suddenly appeared in front of him, and behind the platform, the mountain rapidly became steeper, and the path was extremely narrow, only allowing one person to walk.

The platform was covered with stone statues. Some looked like humans, some looked like horses, and some looked like carts. They were divided into red and black.

Yi, wasn’t this like a game of go?

Ling Han saw that the platform was divided into small squares, and the pieces were arranged according to a pattern. They were definitely pieces. Furthermore, the game had just begun, and both sides had a piece that had crossed the boundary.

Outside the game, there were a great many people watching. They were all on the side that was close to him, while there was no one on the other side.

Ling Han looked again, yet was slightly shocked. That was because there was a person standing on one side of the General and Commander positions, and on the other side was something that was enshrouded by a ball of light. It was completely indistinguishable what it looked like.

Formation Spirit?

Ling Han speculated in his mind. He then took a few steps forward to observe the situation.

“You’re really lucky!” That was a young man. He acted very familiar with Ling Han, and patted Ling Han’s shoulder, “We were trapped for a very, very long time in that garden previously. Afterwards, for some reason, those flowers actually stopped blooming, and only then did we successfully pass.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Er, you don’t know, but when those flowers bloom, they can immediately knock one unconscious…”

This person was a bit of a chatterbox. He had clearly asked him what was going on with the chess game, yet he had drawn the topic back to the garden from before.

Ling Han didn’t interrupt him, because this also solved a question in his mind.

No wonder so many people had raced ahead of him. He should be the first to barge through that garden, and after that, there would be no further effect on him.

Why?

Was it to deliberately waiting for someone?

This wasn’t impossible. After all, there were very few people who had cultivated eye techniques, so this stage could make the person who came first lose a great advantage in time.

Initially, Ling Han had been racing ahead, but after resting for a night in the forest, and spending another three hours to break through, there was nothing strange about him being surpassed.

Then could he be considered have contributed to the success of others?

Thinking of those nine Treasured Fruits of Life, Ling Han suddenly realized that they could be considered a reward.

“Cough, cough!” Ling Han reminded. ‘You should get to the point, why are you still talking about other nonsense?’

“Ah—” Just at this moment, a terrible scream was heard. Ling Han looked over, and saw that in the game of go, the victor had already been decided. At first, this was nothing, but this “general” was about to die from being stepped on by a “horse”. With a stomp from the stone horse, that person was forcibly stomped into a meat patty.

F***, so ruthless?

“Hey, hey, hey, did you see that? This chess game is extremely vicious!” the young man said. “If you lose, you’ll lose your life.”

Ling Han nodded. ‘You’re spouting a lot of nonsense. I’ve already seen it with my eyes, so there’s no need for you to say anything else.’

Once this person died, the pieces quickly returned to their original positions, as if they had a life of their own.

This was a formation, Ling Han immediately thought.

“Brother, this stage’s test is truly freakish. Disregarding abilities, it’s actually a chess tournament.” The young man was about to go crazy.

“Can’t we barge in forcefully?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“That would definitely be courting death,” the young man hurriedly said. “You came late, so you didn’t see it. Previously, there were indeed people who barged in forcefully, and some even teamed up, but in the end, they were all wiped out in an instant.”

“Hiss, those chariots, horses, and soldiers, all of them are boundlessly terrifying. They definitely have Celestial Path-level abilities. No matter how many of us there are, we would not be able to match them.”

Ling Han nodded, and said with a smile, “Then from now onwards, you have to work hard on your chess skills. This is not a very difficult task.”

“Sigh, aren’t I just learning now!” the young man said with a bitter expression.

“Has anyone passed?” Ling Han asked again.

“Not even one.” The young man sighed, “The chess skills of the other side are astonishingly high. Some people thought they had seen through the other side’s tricks, but in the end, when they went up to fight, they were crushed into dust.”

Ling Han nodded, thanked that person, and began to circle around this “chessboard”.

He was a Formation Master, and to ask him to set up such a chess game, where he could play against another, to be honest, he couldn’t do it.

But what if he directly destroyed the formation of the chess game?

He observed, and did not step out to challenge them at the first instant.

However, no one else stepped forward. It was clear that there were far too many precedents. No one wanted to lose their lives in vain.

“Haha, bunch of trash, just watch me!” A green-robed man stood up. He strode forwards, and walked to the position of general. Instantly, light and shadow appeared on the general’s seat opposite him, representing the beginning of the chess game.

“Who is that person?” Someone was curious.. Could it be that this guy could not see that those who had entered the arena earlier had all died?
