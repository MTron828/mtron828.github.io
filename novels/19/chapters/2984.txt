2985 Facing a Seventh Tier Elite

Advancing from the Sixth Tier to the Seventh Tier was a completely different concept from the Seventh-Tier battle prowess that Ling Han, Xin Qihu, and the others possessed. The reason for this was simple—genuine Seventh Tier elites could wield six different types of fundamental particles, and this allowed their bodies to become indestructible. This would be their greatest advantage.

After all, how could one fight against an indestructible and undying opponent?

When Ling Han saw Golden Silk Moth, Golden Silk Moth also saw him. Killing intent instantly spread across his face.

At that time, Golden Silk Moth, Ten Thousand Shadows, and Yue Borong had all advocated the disposal of Ling Han. In the end, however, Yue Borong was killed by Ling Han, while Ten Thousand Shadows had also been forced to flee in disarray when fighting over a shard of dimension core with him. The person who had fared the best was probably Golden Silk Moth.

Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, so they didn’t need to fear anyone.

“Brat, I didn’t expect to see you here,” Golden Silk Moth said in a baleful voice. “However, what a great opportunity this is for me to dispose of you, a traitor.”

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “So what if you’re a Seventh Tier elite? Is it really that amazing?”

“Hmph! If you don’t reach the Seventh Tier, how would you know just how powerful a Seventh Tier elite is?” Golden Silk Moth sneered with an expression of contempt. “Don’t think that you can rival a Seventh Tier elite just because you possess battle prowess at the Seventh Tier. This is nothing but a foolish fantasy!

“Standing at my lofty height, your existence is but like that of a mere ant!

“This omnipotent sensation… It’s something that you won’t be able to understand.

“Moreover, you won’t ever have the chance to experience it, either.”

As he said this, it was as if he were treating himself as a deity who sat atop an altar. Meanwhile, it was as if Ling Han were a peasant who could only kneel and kowtow to him.

He was truly lost in a feeling of superiority.

Ling Han shook his head, and asked, “Any more last words?”

‘Last words?

‘This brat treated my words as last words? Gasp! What a toxic tongue!’

Golden Silk Moth’s expression instantly became cold. As a paramount Seventh Tier elite who stood at the top of the world, he was someone who couldn’t be blasphemed against. Others had to debase themselves and treat him with utmost respect and reverence.

Yet, this brat actually dared to belittle him and ridicule him?

“Brat, you’re about to die, yet you still insist on being so stubborn?” Golden Silk Moth said in a calm voice. Seventh Tier elites naturally wouldn’t lose control over their own emotions. “I initially wanted to give you a quick and painless death, but you’re begging for more suffering and pain.”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “I do indeed know the strength of Seventh Tier elites now. Your nonsense is so loud and obnoxious that it reverberates throughout the heavens. In this sense, I am indeed inferior to you. How admirable!”

He bowed as he said this.

‘This!’

He was finally unable to contain his anger any longer, and he ferociously charged at Ling Han. His aura was devastating, and the six types of fundamental particles transformed into a spear in his hand that thrust at Ling Han.

Seventh Tier elites were far too powerful, so much so that they were unable to use ordinary weapons. In fact, even Heavenly Venerate Tools were unable to withstand the magnificent might of Seventh Tier elites. They would immediately shatter if they were used.

However, this didn’t matter. The six types of fundamental particles could gather together to form the most terrifying weapon in the world.

Boom!

The attack of the Seventh Tier elite was filled with might and dominance.

Ling Han balled his hands into fists, and instantly activated all of his seventh-grade seals at once, causing his power to increase 2000-fold.

Weng!

Tens of thousands of dimensions materialized in the air. He then threw a punch.

Peng!

Golden Silk Moth was sent flying back at a speed even quicker than his advance. He immediately became a small speck in the distance.

However, Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, with their physiques also being invincible. Even though Ling Han’s punch was supremely powerful, it still failed to cause any damage to Golden Silk Moth. However, Golden Silk Moth’s jaw still dropped open, with shock spreading across his face.

As a mighty Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, he had actually been sent flying by a single punch?

If news of this spread, would he still have the face to see anyone?

Indeed, he had only just advanced to the Seventh Tier. However, this still wasn’t reason enough!

This was embarrassing… This was far too embarrassing!

Golden Silk Moth hurriedly gathered his strength, and transformed the six types of fundamental particles into a gigantic palm. He slammed the palm into the ground in an attempt to halt his momentum, yet he was unable to stop himself no matter what. A deep pit was dug into the earth, and if water were to be poured inside, it would instantly transform into a large sea.

Golden Silk Moth finally came to a rest after sliding tens of thousands of kilometers back. He couldn’t help but feel astounded.

Ling Han’s strength was simply inconceivable.

One had to realize that the higher one’s cultivation level, the more difficult it would be for one to challenge those at higher cultivation levels. Moreover, Seventh Tier elites stood at the pinnacle of the world, so, theoretically speaking, they should have been invincible. Now, however, he was actually being suppressed by a Fifth Tier elite?

If it weren’t for his indestructible Seventh Tier physique, he would have most likely been crushed to death by this punch.

With this in mind, Golden Silk Moth couldn’t help but reach up and touch his face. After advancing to the Seventh Tier and being tempered by the six types of fundamental powers, one’s physique would become indestructible. Not even the Genesis World exploding would be able to wound them. Thus, there wasn’t a single mark left on his face. However, what astonished him was the fact that his mind shuddered a little.

Weren’t Seventh Tier elites indestructible and undying? If that was the case, then why did his mind shudder a little? Even though it was barely noticeable, what would happen if Ling Han were more powerful? Would he feel a piercing pain instead? In fact, after reaching a certain limit, would his mind directly explode from the shock?

This wasn’t impossible. After all, this was how Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand from the Genesis World of the last era had died. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The problem was: could Ling Han become this powerful one day? So powerful that his attacks could rival the collapse of the Genesis World?

Golden Silk Moth couldn’t be certain. He could only hope that his physique and mind still had yet to reach their full strength because he had only just advanced to the Seventh Tier. He could only hope that experienced Seventh Tier elites wouldn’t suffer the same outcome if they were to face Ling Han’s strike.

Whoosh!

With a flash, Ling Han had already caught up to him. He immediately threw another punch.

However, Ling Han held back this time, and he only channeled a single sixth-grade seal.

“Brat, you dare to underestimate me?!” Golden Silk Moth roared. He felt like he was being brutally humiliated, and he immediately channeled a second-grade seal as he charged at Ling Han.

They were both at the Seventh Tier, yet the gulf between Golden Silk Moth and Shatter Mountains was truly immense.

Not only was Golden Silk Moth far weaker, but even the quality of his Heavenly Venerable Seals was far inferior.

However, this was inevitable. After all, Golden Silk Moth had been a Sixth Tier elite before, so the most powerful seals that he had been able to deduce were second-grade seals. How could he possibly compare to Shatter Mountains, a freak who had lived across two Genesis Worlds?

Peng!

They exchanged another blow, and Golden Silk Moth was sent flying again. This time, however, Ling Han’s punch was nowhere near as powerful as before, and this allowed Golden Silk Moth to quickly grind to a halt.

However, his face was still filled with rage and shock.

Ling Han had only channeled a single sixth-grade seal, yet he had still been able to completely suppress him. Just how embarrassing was this?

Golden Silk Moth had spoken with such arrogance and haughtiness just then, threatening Ling Han with an entire epoch of suffering and pain. Now, however?

He was the one being pummeled.

How could this gulf between expectation and reality not cause him to feel dejected and indignant?

Ling Han didn’t seize this opportunity to press his advantage. Instead, he proudly hovered above Golden Silk Moth, and said calmly, “Seventh Tier? Heh…”

He spoke only a few words, yet the disdain and contempt that these words carried cut bone-deep.

Golden Silk Moth’s face twitched when he heard this. He felt like he was being humiliated again and again. He unleashed a deafening roar, and a boundless golden light erupted from his fists.
