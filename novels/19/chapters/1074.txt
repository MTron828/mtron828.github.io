Chapter 1075: One who Rendered Meritorious Service Should Not Be Treated Unfairly

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Things had taken a new turn.

Who would have imagined that the empress would suddenly intervene?

Such a trivial matter that merely involved a minor ninth-rank military officer actually caused the empress to personally issue an imperial decree to be read at this point in time. Furthermore, a super elite the likes of Qu Qiuxue was dispatched.

A great many sensed even more than that. The empress was definitely not just rewarding Ling Han.

“Ling Han, receive the decree!” Qu Qiuxue handed the decree over to Ling Han.

“Yes!” Ling Han respectfully accepted the decree, yet was mocking her internally. ‘Couldn’t you have f****** come earlier? You had to wait until such a crucial point, and almost caused him to be tortured.’

Qu Qiuxue turned around, and declared, “Her Imperial Majesty has said that those who rendered meritorious service should not be treated unfairly, and we should not allow our loyal subjects to be bitterly disappointed!”

Those who rendered meritorious service?

Ling Han had rendered a meritorious service? What outstanding merit had he actually rendered?

Zhao Lun was suddenly shocked. When Ling Han had returned to the base camp, he immediately persuaded the Ninth King to go back to the Imperial Capital. At the time, he only thought Ling Han was a coward—after all, there were several hundred Sun Moon Tier elites on the opposite bank. Without an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier standing guard, who would be unafraid?

But now that he thought of it, Ling Han had to have found out some incredible secret.

Could it be that the fact the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire retreated was also linked to Ling Han?

Involuntarily, his face turned livid. At first, he had thought he had made a great achievement. Who would have thought that he had completely misunderstood it and made a mistake?

Why! Why!! Why was it that whenever he tangled with Ling Han, it was always the latter who had the upper hand?!

Zhao Lun was so confused he wanted to pull out his own hair. Whichever aspect it was, wasn’t he superior to Ling Han a few hundredfold? So why was it that he was always losing to Ling Han?

Qu Qiuxue’s killing intent soared, her eyes sweeping over the 30 witnesses, causing these people to shudder in fear.

Loyal subjects should not be bitterly disappointed. This... what did that mean?

Pa!

Qu Qiuxue moved, her palm pressing down on empty air. Immediately, one man’s head was crushed, and blood spurted out in all directions.

This was the Ministry of War!

To publicly commit murder in the Ministry of War, how overbearing was that?

Of course, only Qu Qiuxue would dare do something like that. She represented the imperial decree of the empress. Putting aside the fact that she had only killed these people without any official rank to speak of, so what if they did have official rank?

“No, don’t kill me!”

“It’s Zhao—”

“It’s Sha—”

These people were just about to confess that it was Zhao Lun and Sha Yuan behind them, but Qu Qiuxue did not give them this chance. Her palm struck out once more, and the heads of these 20-odd people were instantly crushed. Bright crimson blood and white brain matter splattered all over the ground.

It was bloody, cruel, and forceful. This was a suppression.

Everyone else was shaking in fear. This was the empress expressing her stand on this matter.

Don’t think that just because the empress resided deep in the palace, she knew nothing, and could easily be fooled by her subjects! On the contrary, the empress perceived even the finest details, and there was nothing that could be hidden from her.

Obviously, Her Imperial Majesty was unimpressed by the web of relations that the Great Generals had interwoven among themselves. This was the Empress’s Majestic Empire, and not the backyard of any Great Generals!

However, the empress had obviously left some face for Great General Zhao and Great General Sha. Though these “witnesses” had been executed, she did not let Zhao Lun or Sha Yuan be implicated in the matter. Otherwise, if she really wanted to pursue this matter, these two people would really be in for some serious punishment.

Moreover, it was also very interesting that the empress had appointed Ling Han as a seventh-rank military officer, because Zhao Lun was also a seventh-rank military officer. In the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, the two of them were completely equal in rank now.

Qu Qiuxue withdrew her hand, and calmly said, “I have to return now. I shall not further disturb your public trial; you may continue with it!”

As she said so, she walked off.

“We see the Chief Commander off!” The masses once again knelt.

Qu Qiuxue had left for quite a while, and the air unique to an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier finally disappeared. Everyone seemed to have gone through a major illness, their expressions extremely unsightly.

Just now, Qu Qiuxue had deliberately released the air of the Heavenly Body Tier. The intimidation from that was naturally frightening. If she had intended to kill them, everyone here would be killed in an instant, their spirits directly crushed under her pressure.

“Are we continuing the trial?” Gu Tianchu asked, his voice trembling.

What else was there to investigate!

Her Imperial Majesty had already issued an imperial decree to promote Ling Han, and they were to still continue the trial? F***, wasn’t that putting their own heads on a tray? Were they tired of living to actually choose to go against the empress’s will?

“After strict investigation, we have confirmed that the previous witnesses were all framing Ling Han. The matter of defection and treason is completely false!” Kong Chenghe felt like he had swallowed a few hundred flies, but had no choice but to announce the verdict. “Ling Han is acquitted and released; this matter is never to be mentioned again in future! Whoever dares to discuss the matter of Ling Han’s defection will be dealt with under the crime of having slandered a meritorious official of the empire!”

After saying so, the three men left as if they were fleeing from something.

They really could not bear to stay any longer. They felt as if their faces would twitch every single time Ling Han’s eyes swept over them; it was incredibly uncomfortable!

Everyone left bit by bit. Very quickly, every detail of this public trial spread throughout the whole Imperial Capital.

Naturally, no one dared to once again mention the matter of Ling Han’s defection.

Even the empress had declared her position in this matter, and who would dare go against her judgement?

In the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, the empress was a true god. She was the heaven and earth. Her every word and her every opinion were worth more than anything.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was finally able to return to the Great Ling Empire.

Previously, he had already planned to do so. However, the sudden invasion of the Golden Lion Nation had interrupted his plans, and with such a delay, more than two months had passed.

The things that should be prepared he had long prepared. He had also refined more alchemical pills which he left in the pharmacy. Money should still be earned.

“I will go with you.” Shui Yanyu knew that he had long since planned to return.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “You are my wife, and indeed, you should meet those brothers of mine... furthermore, after we return to the Great Ling Empire, it should be time for us to have our wedding night so you can bear me a few children.”

“Go to hell!” Shui Yanyu feigned anger, rolling her eyes at him.

Ling Han laughed loudly. On the second day, he left the Imperial Capital with Shui Yanyu, and set out towards the Great Ling Empire.

They had the Cloud Piercing Shuttle with them. Unless an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier made a move to snipe them out of the skies, it would definitely be impossible to catch them. Of course, when they returned to the Great Ling Empire, it would also be considerably dangerous. There were no elites standing guard, so even if Ling Han was a seventh-rank military officer of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, it was useless. Who would care?

However, after being away for so long, Ling Han was definitely going to return at least once. Previously, he had been unable to leave because of his status as a hostage. Now that he had the chance, he definitely had to return to the Great Ling Empire.

Only if the Great Ling Empire really prospered and flourished would he be able to leave with a light heart, and find his parents, son, and female friends.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle streaked through the air like it was a bolt of lightning. Very soon, even the eyes of the Mountain River Tier could no longer see it. Even if elites of the Sun Moon Tier pursued it with full effort, they could only feel powerless and too lacking to catch up.

Half a month later, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle brought the couple to the Great Ling Empire. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Finally, he had returned!

Ling Han let out a deeply moved sigh. Although he was now already an Immortal, he was still more accustomed to his original world.

Weng!

The great formation of the Imperial Capital activated, and targeted the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. However, it was only a formation technique of Shattering Void Tier-level, so even with a boost from power of the nation, it could not possibly become any sort of obstruction to the Cloud Piercing Shuttle.

It only trembled slightly, and the Cloud Piercing Shuttle had burst through the obstruction of the formation technique, descending down on the Imperial Palace.

“Who goes there!” Abruptly, everyone in the Imperial Palace was stirred up.
