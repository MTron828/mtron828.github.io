Chapter 42: Schemes

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

After stepping out of the Ling Clan Residence, Ma Lang said to himself in a voice only he himself could hear, “That brat is in Element Gathering Tier, and moreover, he’s only sixteen years old!

A tiny little Gray Cloud Town, and there is actually a martial artist that entered into Element Gathering Tier below twenty years old! He either ate some kind of Divine Fruit, or obtained some kind of secret treasure. I’ll have to go and ask around.”

To know about a person, it would actually be the fastest to find out from his enemy, because it was possible that your enemy may know more about you than you know about yourself.

Ma Lang brought his people to the Cheng Clan Residence, and half an hour later, his face was all smiles, excitement filling his eyes.

“Two months ago, that brat had still been a publicly acclaimed trash, yet all of a sudden, he erupted. According to news from the Ling Clan, that brat had only been maintaining a low profile in the past, but however low-key he had been, how could it have been to the point that his betrothed would break the betrothal contract with him?

Heng, the people of Gray Cloud Town cannot see clearly because they are closely involved! This brat had obviously gotten his hands on some kind of ultimate treasure, and that’s why his cultivation has advanced so much in such a short period of time!

How else would it have been possible for a trash with a Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base to suddenly experience such an eruption in his cultivation that he has reached Element Gathering Tier?

And, it was even to the point that even Ninth Elder has been bluffed by this brat!

Even such a trash could get from the second layer of Body Refining Tier and into Element Gathering Tier within a short two months’ time, then if I managed to make use of it….”

Ma Lang’s heartbeat uncontrollably and rapidly increased. He was considered a genius existence within this generation of Stone Wolf Sect. At the same time, he was also a disciple of Seventh Elder, and based on power, was ranked within the top three disciples of Stone Wolf Sect. The Elders within the Sect had all placed heavy hopes on his shoulders because he had a hope of breaking through to Gushing Spring Tier.

But if he progressed at a normal rate, that would only be possible at least twenty years later.

“Once I get my hands on that treasure, within three years, no, maybe even one year, I’d be able to break through to Gushing Spring Tier. After all, I possess an Earth Grade medium level Spirit Base. My natural talent overwhelms that trash by who knows how many times!

However, the Ling Clan’s power is not weak either. I cannot act impulsively. Otherwise, if the Ling Clan is driven to desperate action, they may even choose to destroy the treasure rather than hand it over to me. In that case, I will not be able to obtain that treasure then.

Plus, if I create too much noise here, it might attract the attention of the stronger members of the Sect. Then there would be no chance for me to get that treasure.

Additionally, that brat seems to have some kind of relationship with Ninth Elder. Although there is a big gap between the status of Ninth Elder and Master, if he steps out, I still can’t openly disobey him.

So, this matter must be done subtly…

…That’s right, I have quite a good relationship with Little Poison Lord, Yu Zheng. This person is skilled in the use of poisons, and has the nickname of “Shadowless Poisonous Hands”. If I make him give me a hand, I’d definitely be able to easily take Ling Han down. After I force him to hand over the secret treasure he has, I’ll have Yu Zheng executed and announce to the public that he is the murderer of Hang Zhan.

As for the other members of the Ling Clan… I’ll have them all killed just in case, to avoid any possible information leaks.

I’ll immediately have someone send a letter to Little Poison Lord. I will remain here and pretend to befriend that brat while simultaneously inquiring about the origins of that secret treasure.

Less than a month, and this secret treasure will belong to me!”

After Ma Lang arrived in Gray Cloud Town, he continued to hang around, and every few days, he would go to the Ling Clan Residence to have a drink and chat with Ling Han, as if he had hit it off with Ling Han at first sight. But on the other hand, the guy was extremely greedy, and kept finding excuses to get offerings from all the other minor clans.

Intimidated by the might of Stone Wolf Sect, as well as scared off by the law reinforcement team he had brought with him, he managed to succeed every time.

It was almost a month since he first came, and there were angry complaints from all the clans of Gray Cloud Town. They wanted nothing more than to chase away this bloodsucker from their town.

Yet Ling Han acted as if nothing was happening. He persisted in working hard at cultivating every day as he wanted to reach the peak period of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier as soon as possible, so that he’d have enough assurance to enter into Seven Wind Mountains to search for the Earth Dragon Grass and return safely.

During this month of hard work, he had almost reached the peak period of this layer. His Five Elements Origin Nuclei were also nearing their ultimate form. The speed of rotation could no longer be increased, not even by a little bit. Otherwise, he would immediately throw up blood.

However, this rotation speed was still much faster than it had been in his last life as the five nuclei had reached a perfect balance, and thus increased his capacity by quite a large amount.

He had also concocted many different alchemical pills within this time period, including some medium-level Return Origin Pills, as well as some antidote pills. This was the preparation work for dealing with the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. He obtained the ingredients for these pills from Heaven’s Medicine Pavilion. In exchange, he handed over some completed pills as payment, causing Zhu He Xin to be incomparably excited as these pills were concocted by a Grandmaster, and thus had much research value.

‘My current power level is equivalent to a normal martial artist in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier,’ Ling Han thought, an expression of admiration appearing on his face. Immortal Grade Spirit Base is Immortal Grade Spirit Base alright. The owner had already obtained an absolutely advantageous position when fighting with an opponent of the same cultivation level. There was practically no chance of defeat.

‘To take one month to fully cultivate a layer… this is much slower than what I had expected. However, it’s still much faster than Yu Tong. Still, when compared with Body Refining Tier, the natural advantage of Immortal Grade Spirit Base has decreased by a lot.’

‘If I take alchemical pills as well, then the rate can still be increased slightly,” Ling Han thought.

However, Gray Cloud Town was too small, so pills that could help a martial artist in Element Gathering Tier speed up his cultivation rate were very rarely sold there. Even the ingredients for such pills were rare.

“Kou, kou, kou,” a knock sounded on the door. Liu Yu Tong entered and said, “Ma Lang is here again.”

Ling Han revealed a disdainful smile, and said, “He must be thinking that I’ve obtained some kind of secret treasure, and that’s why my cultivation progress is so rapid. He has tried to sniff out information from me quite a few times.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Do you need me to send him away?” Liu Yu Tong asked.

She was in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier and, furthermore, was close to reaching the peak period of the ninth layer. It would be as easy as turning over her hand to deal with a martial artist in the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier.

“No need, it seems like his patience is close to being completely exhausted. It’s about time for him to lay his cards on the table,” Ling Han shook his head. His eyes were bright. Ma Lang was in the peak period of the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and this would be a good opportunity for him to test out his own battle prowess.

He walked towards the Main Hall with Liu Yu Tong in tow. Ling Dong Xing was already seated within the Main Hall. Both Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson were present too, though they were standing at one side, big smiles on their faces. Who knows what kind of poisonous thoughts they were entertaining.

‘It is about time to completely dispose of Ling Zhong Kuan and his group,’ Ling Han thought.

However, aside from Ma Lang, there was another young man dressed all in black. He looked like a living dead, for there was absolutely no expression on his face.

“Brother Ling, we haven’t met for a few days, how have you been?” Ma Lang stood, his eyes circling around Liu Yu Tong’s beautiful, shapely figure, revealing some heat.

Such an exceptional beauty caused even his heart to skip a beat. He swore that after he had killed Ling Han and obtained the secret treasure the latter had, he would definitely get his hands on this rare woman.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I am very well.”

While Ling Dong Xing commanded someone to serve tea, Ma Lang enthusiastically offered Ling Han an invitation to visit Stone Wolf Sect for fun.

As Ling Han raised the tea cup, and lifted the cover of the cup, his expression instantly changed slightly.

There was poison in the cup!

He was an alchemist, and alchemists always have a very deep understanding of poisons and venoms as some alchemical pills required certain poisonous ingredients in their concoction, fighting fire with fire.

“Pa!”

He waved out a palm, and his Origin Power created a tremor that instantly shattered the teacup Ling Dong Xing had raised to his lips, the tea within it splattering in all directions.

“Han’er!” Ling Dong Xing was shocked. He had no idea what his son was doing.

“There’s poison in the tea!” Ling Han said.

“What?” A severe expression flashed in Ling Dong Xing’s eyes. His first reaction was not to doubt his son’s judgement, but to turn his glare towards Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson. The only one present who had the motive as well as the ability to poison their tea would definitely be Ling Zhong Kuan.
