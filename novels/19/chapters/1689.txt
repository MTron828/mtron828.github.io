Chapter 1690: The plot of a vile character

Ding Xiaochen had a second mission.

If he was unable to convince the others, he would take the job of a planted agent and stab the others in the back.

...I was your teammate, so would you keep your guard up against me?

Ding Xiaochen stared at Ling Han’s back, his eyes menacing. This man caused him utter humiliation, and had to be gotten rid of. Otherwise, he would become a thorn in his heart, and that was going to be fatal when he broke through to the Severing Mundane Tier. Not only would it affect his breakthrough, it could even cause him to be wounded by the great dao.

Breaking through was an incredibly dangerous thing in the first place, so how could he survive it if his Dao Heart was not stable?

Now that everyone was battling fiercely, how could Ling Han have possibly imagined that his teammate would turn around and attack him?

Oh, he would get his revenge later? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Sorry, this was a battle royale, and we hadn’t broken in our cooperation for many days, so wouldn’t it be a very normal thing to happen if our cooperation didn’t work that well? Worse came to worst, he would just have to get some punishment, but that was fine. With the interference of the Ding Clan, the matter would definitely be turned into a small problem, and a small problem was no problem at all.

He hadn’t done it on purpose, after all, right?

Ding Xiaochen summoned the green wooden saber, and as a murderous aura surged, the image of a man-eating tree appeared. This was a spiritual body, but its might was not weak in the slightest. He activated it to the fullest, and when the might of the Divine Saber had been maximized, he suddenly struck, delivering a slash at a member of the White Tiger Team.

That person understood his intentions, and immediately jumped towards Ling Han. In this way, this strike from Ding Xiaochen would be openly directed at Ling Han’s back.

When the saber light was about to reach Ling Han, only then did Ding Xiaochen loudly call out, “Watch out!”

‘Watch out your sister!’

Seeing this scene, the Vermilion Bird Army and Azure Dragon Army around them almost hurled out curses. ‘Your acting is really too fake, isn’t it? This strike is clearly heading for Ling Han directly, and you actually pretend to call out “watch out”.’

They were really treating others like fools.

With that little bit of distance, how was Ling Han supposed to dodge?

Nobody saw that a cold smirk turned up the corners of Ling Han’s lips. He had already expected that Ding Xiaochen would betray them. Otherwise, why would Ding Xiaochen have insisted on joining them when participating in this kind of tournament did not have the slightest benefit, and they would only be defeated terribly?

However, with how strong Ling Han’s present abilities were, even if he had not anticipated it in advance, it was still all right. Don’t assume that he was fighting against seven people all on his own, and bore the majority of the fire power of the White Tiger Team with difficulty; in truth, he was still very much at ease, and had not completely displayed his full battle prowess yet.

Hu, a saber strike slashed over, and the blade of the saber had yet to reach him when that tree spirit first entwined around Ling Han, wanting to devour his body and spirit. If Ling Han’s spirit had been possessed, he would definitely be incapable of avoiding the upcoming strike.

This was a top grade God Tool, what Saint King would be able to hold up against it?

...You had used your bare fists to shatter God Tools, and that possibly had been that you had channeled some kind of cultivation technique to protect your fist, but if your spirit was possessed, how would you be able to channel any kind of cultivation technique?

A vengeful smile appeared on Ding Xiaochen’s lips. With this strike, even if Ling Han did not die, he would be severely wounded.

The strike had arrived.

Ling Han suddenly turned around. Clang, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of the green wooden saber. A mocking smirk appeared on his lips, and he suddenly gave a shove. Ka, ka, ka. The sound of bones shattering rang out, and Ding Xiaochen’s two arms and the bones in them had all been shattered forcefully, completely unable to resist the powerful strength that Ling Han had exerted.

At this instant, Ding Xiaochen’s expression was very expressive; not only was his face filled with agony, it was also covered with shock.

In his eyes, this was something that should not have happened.

Ling Han wasn’t defeated even like this?

Pu!

The green wooden saber crashed backwards, the blunt hilt slammed onto his chest, and the sound of bones breaking rang out once more. The defense of the skin of a Saint King was rendered completely useless, and the saber’s hilt directly penetrated his flesh and blood into his chest, creating a massive bloody hole.

A vicious glint flashed in Ling Han’s eyes, yet he did not follow it up with another strike. He calmly asked, “If you hurt others, it will eventually come back to you. Aren’t you worried that if you do too many shameful deeds, ghosts will come knocking at your door at midnight?”

Pa, Ding Xiaochen flopped onto the ground, his head covered with cold sweat and face as pale as paper. HIs heart had been burst by the green wooden saber, and large amounts of divine blood were gushing out. This caused tremendous damage to his life force, and directly affected his time of breaking through to the Severing Mundane Tier.

But if Ling Han had followed up with another punch, he presently would not have just been injured, but rather would have died.

“How dare you, murderer!” Ding Hu immediately leaped to his feet, and was about to make a move to attack Ling Han.

“Brother Ding Hu, what need is there to be angry?” the Severing Mundane Tier from the Long Clan, Long Chengren, asked calmly, but his palm had already stretched out, closing off the path of Ding Hu’s move.

The Severing Mundane Ancestor from the Duan Clan, Duan Wen, also stood up. He crossed his arms over his chest with a smile, and said, “This is a competition, so death and injury is inevitable. Furthermore, this is only a minor injury.”

Minor injury? Even his heart had been burst, and this was still a minor injury?

What did the heart mean for a cultivator? It was the place where blood essence was stored, and that was why there was something called heart’s blood.

And now that his heart had burst, his blood essence would definitely have emptied out completely, which would also cause severe damage to his life force.

Ding Hu’s expression was livid, but with two great Severing Mundane Ancestors clearly expressing that they would make trouble for him if he dared to move, he had no choice but to suppress his fury.

If there was only one, he would not be afraid, but with two Severing Mundane Tiers, hoho.

He sat back down heavily, lowering his eyes. Those were capable of murder. If he swept his eyes over any Genesis Tier, they would only be rended into pieces.

The others had also broken out in a commotion. They had not thought that there would be such a dramatic turn of events. They all thought that even if Ling Han did not die, he would be severely wounded with this strike, but it was only a blink of an eye, and the one who was heavily injured had turned into Ding Xiaochen.

“If you’re injured, then obediently rest on the sidelines!” Ling Han shot out a kick. Peng, Ding Xiaochen was immediately kicked out. He had turned into a ball, and rolled over a dozen times before finally stopping.

Ding Xiaochen was really pitiful. He had been heavily injured in the first place, and with another blow like this, he was angry, humiliated, and pained all at the same time. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and directly passed out.

Ling Han looked towards the 10 members of the White Tiger Team that were already dumbfounded, broke into a grin, and asked, “Why are you all being so nice? Not fighting anymore?”

‘Being nice your sister! Who wants to be nice to you! We were all scared by you, all right?

‘Are you f****** really a Saint King? Are you f****** really a rookie soldier? Why do you seem to be a few hundred times stronger than even veteran soldiers?’

Taking advantage of this opening when they were all dumbfounded, Mao Shuyu, Wei Bo, and the others took the chance to attack. Peng, peng, peng. They instantly defeated three of them, and the remaining seven had lost their courage completely. As long as Ling Han was still standing there, who could match him?

The White Tiger Team admitted defeat.

At first, the conclusion of this battle was assumed to be completely assured, and it was going to be absolutely one-sided. In truth, it had indeed been completely assured, and was absolutely one-sided, but the position of victor and loser were exchanged.

The reserve troops had actually defeated the official troops!

Everyone’s eyes were focused on Ling Han. It was this man that had single-handedly created this miracle.

Ding Hu’s expression was dark, and his hands were balled tightly into fists. One could see there were veins popping on his forehead, and grinding sounds could be heard from his knuckles because of how tightly his hands were clenched.

At this moment, his killing intent towards Ling Han had surged to the top.

“We won!” Mao Shuyu immediately cheered. Among the few of them, it was her personality that was the most hot-tempered and vibrant, unlike the composed Wei Bo and the others. However, this was an unexpected victory, and even Wei Bo and the others broke into slight smiles.

The few team members that had wanted to surrender even before fighting all bore expressions of embarrassment, but they could not hide their exuberant joy. As long as they had Ling Han’s fierce power on their side, it was completely no issue for them to represent Dark Moon City in the upcoming tournament.
