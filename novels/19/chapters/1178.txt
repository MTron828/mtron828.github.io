Chapter 1179: Berserk Blood Spirit Pill

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘What?!’

Everyone rushed over to look. Sure enough, there was no alchemical pill in the vial. The only thing remaining was a layer of dust on the bottom.

“No way... This can’t be!”

“What about the other pills?”

They started going through the cabinets and checking the other vials. However, without any exception, all of the pills had turned into dust—they had been sitting here for far too long. They became more and more disappointed with each vial that they checked. In fact, they felt as if their hearts were about to shatter.

The pills here were all at least Level Five Divine Pills, and each of them would have commanded an insane price if auctioned. With the large number of pills in this place, the sum of their worth would have been unfathomable. However, they had barely begun to dream about their riches before they were given a rude awakening.

The pills had all disintegrated into dust!

How could they not go crazy?

Ling Han didn’t find this surprising. Time was the greatest enemy of all existence. So what if these were Divine Pills? They still couldn’t escape the test of time. Of course, the higher the level of a pill, the longer it would be able to last. If a pill reached level 10 or above, perhaps it would even develop a spirit and become an intelligent life form!

It would then be a so-called pill spirit, a supreme treasure of the world. Once a Divine Pill gained life, its medicinal effects wouldn’t decrease anymore. Instead, it would absorb the essence of heaven and earth and wound up with even stronger medicinal effects!

However, a pill had to be level 10 or above in order for it to develop a spirit. Not only that, but it would also need to endure a profound amount of time. Even with these two conditions satisfied, there was still no guarantee that a pill would be able to form a spirit and gain life.

Anyhow, who would be willing to refine a Divine Pill and just let it sit there?

“Judging by these pills, this alchemist was below level nine,” Ling Han murmured to himself. “Thus, the pills that he refined are all between level five and level eight. However, pill recipes at this level are the most useful to me.

“I can only refine Level Five Divine Pills right now, but it won’t be long before I break through to the Sun Moon Tier. At that time, even refining Level Eight Divine Pills won’t be too difficult.

“Let’s look around. There should be some pill recipes in this room.”

Sure enough, he found an entire shelf of pill recipes after searching around for a while!

Each pill recipe was recorded in a book. However, their age meant that they were extremely frail. In fact, they would turn into dust at the slightest of touches. Thus, Ling Han placed the shelf—along with its contents—in the Black Tower. That way, they wouldn’t be able to crumble even if they wanted to.

He immediately made two copies of each of the pill recipes. He then retrieved the originals and copies, and said, “Leader Meng, according to our earlier agreement, each of us is allowed to make a copy of the pill recipes. I’ve already made the copies, and the originals are also here. Pick whichever ones you want.”

“When did you make the copies?” Meng Wei asked. She was still sifting through the vials of alchemical pills, stubbornly trying to find a vial that was fortunate enough to have “survived”.

“Heh, just pick,” Ling Han said. He obviously wouldn’t tell her that he had entered the Black Tower and made the copies in the blink of an eye. Moreover, he had made two copies, not one.

Meng Wei carefully compared the two versions. After confirming that not a single character was different, she nodded, and said, “Cooperating with handsome guys indeed gives one peace of mind. Oi, oi, oi, our cooperation is about to end, so why don’t we have a one-night stand before we each go our own ways? I’ve been holding back for so many days, and I’m already itching to go!”

“Beat it!” Ling Han said as he put one of the copies away. However, he left the original pill recipes for her—these would disintegrate upon being touched anyway.

Meng Wei wore a puzzled expression, and murmured, “Have I become less charming? That’s impossible! My breasts haven’t become smaller, and my waist hasn’t become thicker. My bottom is also as shapely as before. So, why can’t I win this handsome guy over? Could it be... that he doesn’t like women...? Gasp!”

“I can hear you!” Ling Han said in an irritated voice.

“Leader! Leader!” someone shouted. Their voice was filled with excitement.

“What’s wrong?” Meng Wei asked. “It’s not like the sky has collapsed or anything. Even if it has, don’t we still have this handsome guy to hold it up for us?”

“There’s a vial of pills that haven’t disintegrated yet!” the person shouted.

“What?!” Meng Wei jumped up and immediately dashed over.

Even Ling Han followed behind her curiously.

Most of the pills had already turned into dust, yet there was one vial whose contents hadn’t. Even those who didn’t understand alchemy could guess that there was something extraordinary about this vial of pills. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to last until now.

“Berserk Blood Spirit Pill?” Meng Wei accepted the vial of pills and read its label. “What kind of pill is this?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone shook their heads. None of them had ever heard of this pill before.

“Heh, this is a rare Sun Moon Tier pill. It can help those at the Sun Moon Tier raise their cultivation level by one sub-minor level. In other words, it can save them tens of thousands of years of time.” A voice suddenly traveled over, explaining the use of this pill.

“Who is it?” They all turned around to look at the door.

“I’m Ji Zhengping,” the person standing at the door said. However, due to the darkness of the room, and due to the fact that light was coming down from behind him, they could only make out his silhouette. Even so, they could still tell that he was a very slim person.

The person paused for a moment before saying, “Hand the Divine Pill over, and I can spare your lives.”

“What if we don’t?” Meng Wei asked.

“If you don’t?” Ji Zhengping chuckled and spread his right hand open. There was an egg-sized object in his hand, and he said, “This is a Viper Poison Explosive Pill. It will explode immediately once thrown, and it will also release a terrifying poison—believe me, no one below the Sun Moon Tier will be able to survive. Humans won’t, and Demonic Beasts won’t, either. If you inhale even a wisp, you’ll die of the poison in half a breath’s time. There’s no exception to this.”

Meng Wei and the others were all deeply astonished. This person wasn’t lying. Viper Poison Explosive Pills were indeed as devastating as he said. However, it was questionable whether he was really holding a Viper Poison Explosive Pill.

“I’ll give you guys 15 minutes to decide. If you still refuse to hand the pill over, I’ll have no option but to throw this Viper Poison Explosive Pill into the room.” Ji Zhengping chuckled before continuing, “I truly despise killing people, so it’s best that you guys don’t force me to!”

No one knew whether he was telling the truth or not. However, if he were genuinely telling the truth, then that was far too terrifying!

Meng Wei and the others didn’t dare to act rashly. As mercenaries, they always walked on the tightrope between life and death. However, it was also because of this that they cherished their lives even more.

If they stayed alive, everything would be possible. If they died, however, everything would become void.

Ling Han furrowed his brows in thought. He couldn’t determine whether Ji Zhengping was bluffing or whether he actually possessed a weapon of great devastation. He wasn’t afraid, but what about Meng Wei and the others?

‘If that’s the case...’

He stealthily hid in the darkness before retrieving his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

He didn’t need the Ultimate Arrow. With his current power, even an ordinary arrow would be able to insta-kill a cultivator at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

There was a smug smile on Ji Zhengping’s face. He was able to control this situation all by himself, and this made him feel very good about himself. However, his hair suddenly stood on ends as a sense of foreboding gripped at his heart.

‘Danger!’

He had no time to think, and he frantically scrambled back in retreat.

Xiu!

A cold flash streaked through the air. It was insanely quick, and it ruthlessly penetrated his left shoulder. The powerful force of the strike sent him flying backward.
