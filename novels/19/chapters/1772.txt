Chapter 1773: Fighting Over Spots

Everyone looked toward Fu Gaoyun eagerly in expectation.

The Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm wasn’t fully controlled by the Fu Clan. Instead, it was jointly controlled by the four nearby three-star forces. At the same time, some of the further three-star forces would also stick their noses into this matter. However, they were only allowed to send smaller teams of people.

Moreover, the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm also had a restriction: only those at the Severing Mundane Tier could enter.

It wasn’t that those at the Dividing Soul Tier and Immortal Palace Tier couldn’t enter. Rather, it was just that they couldn’t venture too deep into the mystery realm. As such, it would be a massive waste of the “Blood Dragon Armors”.

To youths, entering the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm signified a potentially huge turning point in their lives. If they were fortunate enough to come across a Celestial King Tier celestial technique and swallow a few celestial pills... they would become as freakish as could be!

Fu Gaoyun was one of the four potential successors of the Fu Clan, so he was able to give out 10 spots.

One of the spots would definitely be reserved for himself, so there were only nine spots remaining.

“Young Master Yun, I’m willing to follow you! I’m willing to wade through fire and water to serve you!” someone immediately shouted.

Their expression of loyalty was as fake as could be. Under their pretense, they were essentially asking for a spot to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

“Young Master Yun, I’m willing to be your loyal servant!”

“Young Master Yun!”

“Young Master Yun!”

Many people started to call out, and they all expressed their willingness to serve Fu Gaoyun. However, there were also those who were relatively more reserved. For example, Cheng Zhong. He was a prodigy of the Cheng Clan, so he would receive a spot from his clan even if he didn’t receive one from Fu Gaoyun.

As one of the five most powerful subordinate forces of the Fu Clan, the Cheng Clan could naturally receive a portion of the spots to enter the mystery realm. However, this portion was naturally far smaller than what the Fu Clan received.

Anyhow, since Cheng Zhong had decided to support Fu Gaoyun, he would definitely feel resentment toward Fu Gaoyun if he didn’t end up giving him a spot. At that time, it was extremely likely that he would leave to support another potential successor.

Everything depended on how Fu Gaoyun allocated the spots. This was a test of his leadership skills, and this was something that each clan leader needed to learn about. He definitely couldn’t satisfy everyone, so this was a huge test regarding how he would make his choices, as well as how he would console those who weren’t selected.

Ling Han didn’t speak. He knew about the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, so he decided to obtain a few more Blood Dragon Stones for Fu Gaoyun if he ended up giving him a spot. Such would be his repayment.

Even if he didn’t obtain enough Blood Dragon Stones, he would still have things like the Reincarnation Tea to use as a substitute. He would definitely repay Fu Gaoyun if he received a spot.

Anyhow, Ling Han’s biggest value was his potential. He had the potential to become a Celestial King Tier elite, and he also had the potential to become a five-star alchemist. Everything came down to Fu Gaoyun’s judgment, as well as his determination to gamble.

Moreover, since Fu Gaoyun had announced this to everyone, he had naturally considered all of the possibilities already. He slowly opened his mouth to assign the nine spots.

Sure enough, Cheng Zhong received one of the spots. A person called Li Xuan also received a spot. After them, Ling Han and the Empress also received a spot each. As for the final five spots, Fu Gaoyun put them up for anyone to receive. They would hold a small competition, and those who achieved victory would receive these spots.

Through this method, those who lost wouldn’t have anyone to complain to. After all, this was the cultivation world where might made right. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After the competition, those who won naturally felt nothing but joy. However, those who lost felt extremely dissatisfied with Ling Han and the Empress receiving two of the spots.

What right did they have?

They had only just arrived, and they didn’t have any powerful background, either. Yet, they had received two of the spots just like that. Who could accept this? However, they didn’t dare to express their dissatisfaction before Fu Gaoyun. Thus, they all buried this emotion into the bottom of their hearts. They definitely couldn’t swallow this bitter pill.

When the gathering ended, Ling Han and the Empress went to their residence in the academy. This was a large residence. In fact, it was essentially a huge courtyard. There were even hundreds of servants, and all of them were at least at the Heavenly Body Tier. This was incredibly extravagant.

Fu Gaoyun was very understanding, and he didn’t organize three separate residences for Ling Han and his two wives. Instead, he put them all in the same residence.

Right after settling in, Ling Han was informed by a servant that someone had come to visit. Ling Han pondered for a moment before telling the servant to invite the guest in.

This was a man in azure robes. His name was Zhao Pang, and Ling Han had seen him during the gathering just then. He was at the peak stage of the first severance, and he hadn’t managed to win a spot during the competition just then.

Zhao Mingpang walked into the hall before glancing at Ling Han, and disdainfully saying, “You’re Ling Han, right? Visit Young Master Yun tomorrow and tell him that you don’t want to go to the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. Instead, transfer the spot to me. However, I won’t take your spot for nothing. Here!”

He tossed a spatial ring at Ling Han, saying, “There are 10,000 Star Stones inside. It’s more than enough to compensate you.”

Truth be told, 10,000 Star Stones was indeed a huge sum of money. However, it was completely worthless when compared to a spot to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

Moreover, they had already advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier, and obtained a limitless lifespan, so would it be difficult to earn some Star Stones?

Ling Han chuckled as he accepted the spatial ring.

An understanding expression spread across Zhao Pang’s face. This was just as he had expected.

In his eyes, Ling Han didn’t have any background at all. Instead, he was only here because Fu Gaoyun held him in high regard. As such, he didn’t have any confidence at all. After giving him a fright, he would definitely become as obedient as could be.

Sure enough, Ling Han yielded before he could even voice his threats.

‘What an absolute coward!’

“I’ll happily accept this welcome gift. Now, piss off!” Ling Han waved his hand to dismiss Zhao Pang.

‘W-what?’

Zhao Pang faltered upon hearing this. He thought that he had heard wrong, and he asked, “What did you say?”

“Piss off, you understand?” Ling Han smiled, and continued, “Here, I’ll teach you. First, place your hands on the ground. After that, place your head on the ground. With that done, you can push with your legs and succeed in rolling forward. With your intelligence, it shouldn’t be too hard to learn this.”

Zhao Pang instantly exploded in rage.

‘Are you treating me as a retard? You think I don’t know how to roll and piss off?’

He was furious, and he immediately pointed at Ling Han, shouting, “Don’t push me!”

“I’m allowing you to piss off by yourself now. However, if you insist on receiving my help, you’re the one who’s going to end up suffering,” Ling Han said in a calm voice as he took a sip of tea.

Zhao Pang laughed in fury. This person was far too audacious! Not only was he refusing to cooperate with him, but he had even stolen his Star Stones!

Where had his courage come from?

“Ling Han, you’re far too overconfident,” he said with a cold chuckle. “I’ll give you one final chance. Do as I say. Otherwise... your fate will be incredibly miserable.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Same back to you. Don’t bring trouble upon yourself.”

“Impudence!!” Zhao Pang roared. He immediately lashed out, unable to contain his anger anymore.

If Ling Han were replaced with the Empress, Zhao Pang definitely wouldn’t dare to attack her, regardless of how furious he was. After all, she had easily defeated Jin Zhiyu, a second severance elite, in a single strike. Thus, defeating him, a first severance elite, would be as easy as pie.

However, could Ling Han also be that freakish?

Ling Han sighed upon seeing this. There were always those who insisted on receiving a beating before they finally learned to become obedient. That being the case, he could only trouble himself to teach them some life lessons.

Pa!

He casually reached over and grabbed Zhao Pang’s neck. He then lifted him up as if he were a baby chick.

“Come, I’ll help you piss off!” Ling Han said as he tossed Zhao Pang into the distance.

Pa!

Zhao Pang was instantly thrown into the distance, with his momentum causing him to involuntarily roll forward.

Zhao Pang rolled all the way to the entrance of the courtyard, and only then did he coincidentally come to a stop.

He was both furious and humiliated, and he roared, “W-where are my Star Stones?”

‘Since you’re not cooperating with me, you’ve got to return my Star Stones, right?’
