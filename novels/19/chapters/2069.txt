Chapter 2070: Gouchen Bloodline

Ling Han’s Great Clash of Source Powers was an area-of-effect attack. Regardless of how many people charged at him, each one of them would have to face the power of this attack. Thus, if one Dividing Soul Tier cultivator couldn’t withstand his attack, then eight Dividing Soul Tier cultivators couldn’t face it, either.

He charged over with ferocity, and his formidable physique allowed him to ignore all attacks. He quickly arrived beside Ji Wuming.

“Same rules as before!” Ji Wuming said with a grin.

Ling Han nodded in reply. Their cooperation had been great last time, and this time they hoped to achieve even better results. No matter what it took, they had to slay Tian Qingyue and the other monarch tiers, no?

Battle, battle, battle!

The surroundings instantly became chaotic as Ling Han, Ji Wuming, and the four monarch tiers clashed. Meanwhile, the other cultivators were all fighting against the black figures. Of course, these black figures also attacked Ling Han and the others. They wouldn’t ignore them simply because they were battling against each other.

This didn’t affect Ling Han and Ji Wuming at all.

After all, these were merely attacks at Earth Soul. Even if Ling Han lay down to accept their attacks, they wouldn’t be able to kill him even if they attacked him for an entire epoch. Under his protection, Ji Wuming naturally didn’t need to worry about his defenses. He could simply attack at will.

However, Tian Qingyue and the others weren’t so relaxed.

Even if Earth Soul cultivators were unable to rival them, the four still had to divide some attention to defend against them. Regardless of whether it was a punch or a palm strike, they had to do something about these black figures. This caused them to suffer a disadvantage.

It could be said that this was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

The four monarch tiers started to flee in disarray. With them gone, however, how could the Heaven Soul cultivators block the might of a Celestial Tool? Many died, and many fled.

Meanwhile, the black figures continued to mercilessly massacre the battling cultivators. The number of survivors became fewer and fewer.

“I’ll obliterate your a*s!” Hu Niu roared as she brandished her iron staff, and charged at the survivors.

She was extremely cunning, and she only targeted those she could suppress. She thrust her staff forward, immediately eliciting a harrowing wail. A man was brutally flicked up, and the tip of the staff had already pierced into his bottom. Sanguine red blood dripped to the ground.

“So fun!” Hu Niu exclaimed as she brandished her staff. The staff and man swept around in a flurry.

Peng, peng, peng!

She activated her Roc bloodline, causing the projection of a gigantic Roc to materialize behind her. This allowed her to gain terrifying power.

One had to realize that even though she wasn’t as freakish as Ji Wuming, she still had some power of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. It was just that this power was engraved in her divine sense through the form of a Celestial King Engraving. She needed to become familiar with this engraving if she wanted to channel its power.

Anyhow, her battle prowess was incredible, especially after she activated her Roc bloodline.

“Die!” she roared in ferocity.

The Empress’ expression was also ice-cold as she summoned her divided soul and her 18 clones. All 20 of the Empresses were breathtakingly beautiful. However, when they attacked, they didn’t show any mercy at all. She started to massacre her enemies, and those under Heaven Soul were all killed in a flash.

Only Bewitching Maiden Rou was far weaker than them. She struggled even against the black figures, so how could she have the spare time to deal with anyone else? She could only support Hu Niu and the Empress with her gaze.

Elsewhere, Ling Han and Ji Wuming also started to hunt their opponents. This was a sealed canyon, and before the time limit of 10 days was up, no one could hope to exit. Moreover, this was the first time that any of them had entered, so it was only natural that no one had laid any traps.

“Hu Niu, Luan Xing!” Ling Han called. He drew the two women into the Black Tower. He then looked at the pitiful Bewitching Maiden Rou, and also drew her into the Black Tower with a wave of his right hand.

They were going to hunt their enemies, so the first thing to do was to ensure that they had no weaknesses. If the three women remained, what would he do if they were captured as hostages?

Ling Han and Ji Wuming activated their movement techniques as they pursued Xia Houtong. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Those hunted by me, Ji Wuming… Can they hope to escape?” Ji Wuming said with a cold chuckle as he gave chase. He retrieved that small bow.

Celestial Tool, Minor Heavens Complete Bow!

He didn’t notch an arrow, and he simply drew the bow. The Minor Heavens Complete Bow instantly expanded several fold, becoming as tall as a person. A streak of light materialized on the bow, condensing into an arrow of light.

“Go!” Ji Wuming roared.

Whoosh!

The arrow immediately pierced forth, shooting toward Xia Houtong.

If he had been able to unleash the full might of this Celestial Tool, Xia Houtong would have definitely been killed even if he had been 10,000 times more powerful. However, even until now, Ji Wuming was still unable to unleash the full might of Celestial Tools. This arrow merely carried the might of Divine Metal.

Even so, this arrow of light was still absolutely terrifying. It transformed into a streak of light as it raced toward Xia Houtong.

‘It’s too fast!’

Xia Houtong roared in fury, yet it was already too late for him to dodge. He had two choices—either parry the arrow, or face it head-on.

However, he definitely didn’t dare to face this arrow head-on. Even though he hadn’t turned around yet, he could already feel an ice-cold aura that caused him to involuntarily tremble. If he were struck by this arrow, he would definitely be killed in an instant.

He hurriedly turned around to throw a punch. His fist was enveloped in a thick layer of light, and there were also countless symbols that continued to pulsate and flash.

Peng!

His fist struck the arrow. At this instant, the great dao collided, and sparks chaotically flew.

One could clearly see the devastating power of the arrow. It annihilated the layer of light enveloping Xia Houtong’s fist, and it was as if his defenses were completely useless.

However, Xia Houtong was a paramount monarch tier, after all. If he hadn’t been confident, would he have thrown this punch?

When the arrow was just about to strike his fist, it suddenly disintegrated into sparks of light before vanishing without a trace.

To block the attack of a Celestial Tool, even an incompletely awakened Celestial Tool… Xia Houtong’s strength was indeed astonishing.

However, this was still completely useless.

Ji Wuming calmly drew his bow again.

Whoosh!

Another arrow of light whizzed forth.

Would Xia Houtong block this attack?

He had no choice but to do so.

However, so what if he could block this attack? Ji Wuming would simply draw his bow again.

Arrow after arrow, Ji Wuming’s attacks were relentless and fierce. Meanwhile, Ling Han had already caught up.

“Do you insist on killing me?” Xia Houtong roared in a shrill voice.

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle and say, “I’m pretty sure that it was you people who insisted on killing us. Why are you suddenly complaining now?”

“Humph! You’re underestimating me!” Xia Houtong said with killing intent.

Boom!

A powerful aura suddenly erupted from him, and the projection of a ferocious beast rose from within him.

Weng!

There were seven symbols of the great dao on this ferocious beast, yet each of these symbols was damaged and incomplete. Even so, this beast still radiated with a primordial and dignified aura. It was as if this were a Source Beast that had come from mythical times.

The head of this ferocious beast was like a deer, with a pair of horns protruding from its forehead. Its body was filled with scales, and it also had the tail of a cow.

“Huh? Gouchen[1]!” Ji Wuming exclaimed in surprise.

Ling Han instantly replied with an “oh” upon hearing this. This was an ancient Source Beast, and it was one of the most powerful Source Beasts as well. Xia Houtong possessed the bloodline of the Gouchen, and he was more so unleashing its full power at this moment. Thus, it was no wonder that his aura had suddenly risen by an explosive amount.

However, activating this power definitely required a huge sacrifice. Otherwise, Xia Houtong would have definitely activated it before.

This power was most likely similar to the Divine Fetus of Fire. It could only last for a short time, and one would immediately become frail after its effects expired.

“That’s right! My ancestor is the ancient Source Beast, the Gouchen!” Xia Houtong said with pride. Black scales started to materialize on his face, neck, and hands.

At this moment, Xia Houtong didn’t seem like a human at all. Instead, he looked like a genuine ancient Immortal Beast.

“It’s a shame that you don’t know… The Gouchen was slain by me!” Ji Wuming said in a calm voice.
