Chapter 2540: Truth and falsehood

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han and the others strode onwards, and as they progressed, their surroundings became brighter.

It was not the kind of brightness that came with daytime, but rather one that made it seem like they were strolling among the stars. In the distance, there would be stars twinkling, emanating a weak starlight.

Though it was weak, it was enough to illuminate the space because there were a great many of them.

They wanted to walk to either side, but discovered that they were still within a single passage, and could not walk in separate directions. That starlight was all merely an illusion.

They raised their heads, and there were stars. Looking down, there were still stars. It was extremely easy to lose their sense of direction in this place. If it were not for the fact that they would meet a wall on either side, they might really not know where they were supposed to go after spending a period of time walking.

No one spoke. All of them were very cautious. Though there wasn’t any danger now, who would believe that there was no killing intent inside an ancient site?

Even the Imperial Void Celestial King did not dare to be careless. Though he stood at the pinnacle of the Celestial King Tier, and could be ranked in the top three in the Celestial Realm, this was the Flaming Frost Realm. There was definitely no small number of Celestial Kings that could be his equal or even surpass him.

Moreover, it was said that He Feng had already been qualified to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier all those years ago, so he definitely had to have been stronger than him.

Now, while this ancient site’s Celestial King had indeed died, the traps that he had left behind definitely could not be underestimated, either. As the saying went, be careful and you can live long. He would rather accept a false alarm than suffer a serious setback as a result of a careless mistake.

Similarly, the large black dog maintained a state of readiness to move at any moment. His battle prowess was inferior to the Imperial Void Celestial King’s, but he was more sensitive to danger. This was an ability that he had developed from being a thief. This damn dog furrowed his brow, and murmured softly, “Grandpa Dog has a feeling of foreboding.”

“Don’t jinx us!” Ling Han shook his head, but his concentration was also on high alert.

The large black dog said that he felt that there was something off, and that definitely was not because he was a coward. It definitely had to be because he sensed something.

“Wally, we’ll leave it to you.” Both Ling Han and the large black dog pushed Wally ahead of them. This guy was the product created after several hundred epochs of accumulation of a whole dimension. Though he was not proficient in battle, he was practically immortal.

That was because he could fuse and recover just like Divine Metal, though he was far from being as hard and sturdy as Divine Metal.

Hence, he was a very good meat shield.

Wally was confused. “Why are you two hiding behind me? I am not made for battle.”

Ling Han and the large black dog both grinned, and made no reply.

As they continued onwards, a great beast suddenly raced towards them from ahead.

At first, none of them took it to heart, and thought that this, too, was an illusion. That was because this great beast was racing towards them from a boundless distance ahead of them. But as it came nearer and nearer, everyone was stunned.

This great beast was completely wrapped in starlight, and exuded an intense light. The air of violence was practically right in their faces, yet it did not seem false.

The great beast looked like a tiger, but its body was covered with glowing little bumps, looking extremely disgusting. It carried a murderous aura, and pounced towards them.

Everyone couldn’t help but move to block this incoming assault, but after an exchange, they realized that this was indeed an illusion. It was only a light effect, but it was extremely realistic.

They couldn’t help but laugh at themselves. They were a group of Celestial Kings, and all of them were supreme monarch stars at that, yet they were actually deceived by an illusion.

In just a short while, another great beast pounced towards them from the distance in the stars. It launched an attack at them, but it was still just an illusion, and also brought them a false alarm.

The third great beast appeared right on the heels of the second.

Everyone had gotten an empty scare twice in a row, so they were slightly off-guard, but when this great beast pounced towards them, their expressions changed slightly.

This time, it was real!

“Humph!” The Imperial Void Celestial King humphed, two gusts of air that turned into an endless ripple bursting from his nostrils. With a?boom, this great beast was shattered.

“Truth and falsehood, it is really hard to grasp,” Luo Yangqiu said.

“However, the battle prowess is only that,” Miao Hua said proudly.

“We cannot be careless. Who knows, there may be even stronger creatures,” Gu Heyi warned.

They advanced, and the great beasts appeared continuously.

There were real beasts, and there were false ones as well. The Imperial Void Celestial King did not interfere every time. He was not the bodyguard for these people, so he naturally did not have this kind of duty. However, they were also strong enough, and the great beasts here only had the battle prowess of a Fifth Heaven Celestial King. They were very strong, but this was still not enough to pose too great a threat to them.

Of course, the fact that they were real at some times and fake at others still caused their minds to become tense subconsciously. That was because even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would not dare to allow Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings to attack them fiercely while they themselves were completely unguarded.

…Aside from Wally and Heavenborn, if Ling Han could improve the level of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he, too, would have this kind of ability.

After traveling for three days, even the Imperial Void Celestial King showed a sliver of weariness. This was not because their Source Power had been greatly exhausted, but rather due to emotional anxiety.

Just how long would this situation continue?

They could only defend themselves, and could not actively attack. This was a situation that prodigies like them had never encountered, which made them extremely displeased, and also affected their emotions.

However, there seemed to be no end to this passageway. Another few days later, there was still not the slightest sign that they were about to walk out of the passage.

Was this a labyrinth?

Ling Han and the large black dog both looked towards Wally. In terms of analysis and calculation, there was no one who could claim first place if he claimed he was second.

Wally looked at them in confusion, his expression completely dazed. ‘Why are you guys looking at me like that?’ Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Have we walked around in circles?” Ling Han asked. At certain times, Wally was extremely dumb.

Wally immediately answered, “So far, we have walked over a total of 13 nodal joints in space, and according to my deductions, the chances that we have walked in circles is 31%, but whether we have or have not still requires further observation to determine.”

“Is there any way to find the right path?” Ling Han asked.

“More observation is necessary.” Wally still repeated the same words.

Then there was nothing that could be done. They could only walk around further.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and asked, “Is there any way to determine whether those great beasts are real or fake in advance?”

“Yes.” Wally nodded.

“…Why didn’t you say so earlier?” Ling Han sighed.

“You people never asked.” Wally’s expression was completely innocent. “Moreover, I thought that you all were deliberately training yourselves in a certain area.”

“Forget it. Just tell me how to tell if these great beasts are real or fake.” Ling Han decided not to argue with him for now.

Wally did not speak, but rather released a halo of green light from his body.?Weng, this light radiated in all directions as a circular wave. A great beast just so happened to assault them. The wave swept over it, and nothing happened.

“This is fake,” Wally said.

True enough, the great beast pounced on them, but immediately disappeared thereafter.

Everyone was surprised, and looked towards Wally.

The reason why they had initially agreed to have Wally come with them was because of Ling Han’s strong insistence. Otherwise, what was the point of someone who was not a supreme monarch star coming?

However, now that Wally had shown his skill, this immediately garnered him a new respect from them.

“What ability is this?” Everyone was curious.

Wally was calm and unperturbed, explaining, “The way you all determine the strength of a living being is through their aura. As for whether it is a living being, you judge based on their flame of life. However, all this can be faked. I am different. What I use is the wave of life, which can determine if it is a living creature more accurately, and can judge its strength as well.”

Everyone didn’t really quite understand. ‘What do you mean by “you all”? Could it be that you are different from us?’

“You are a War Soldier, correct?” Liu Yufei asked suddenly.
