Chapter 1142: Jealousy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the Majestic Heaven Sect, every seed was definitely outstandingly famous.

About 10,000 normal disciples would be taken in at the same time, and there would only be a 1,000 key disciples. As for seeds? There would only be 100 at most!

And that would still have to depend on the year. Sometimes, there were even only over a dozen.

There had never been an incident wherein a Heavenly Body Tier elite had been nurtured from normal and key disciples, but among the genius seeds... there were such examples, and furthermore, the ratio was even as high as one in every 10!

Don’t underestimate this ratio.

It should be known that there would only be one in every 10 Shattering Void Tier cultivators that could break through to the Mountain River Tier, and from the Mountain River Tier onwards, innumerable people would be stuck at every minor level. Upon further calculation, from the Mountain River Tier to the Heavenly Body Tier, there was a total of six minor levels and two major tiers in between.

Hence, in billions and billions of Mountain River Tier cultivators, perhaps only one would be capable of reaching the Heavenly Body Tier.

And going by that theory, about 10% of the seed disciples would be able to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier, so how terrifying was this ratio?

But this was very normal because the genius seeds were the most prodigious geniuses of each planet in the first place. Wasn’t the high ratio of breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier a very normal thing, then?

Ling Han was actually a seed!

Everyone was shocked, but at the same time, they felt involuntarily amused. Previously, Bi Hua had said Ling Han had an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities, and assumed the air of a senior brother, but in the end? Ling Han was the real senior brother disciple here!

Bi Hua naturally heard these words loud and clear. His expression had already turned the color of maroon; this was really too humiliating.

He glared at Ling Han, but dared not bear any thoughts of vengeance in his heart.

To avenge himself facing a seed-level genius?

He would have to be tired of living to do that.

Covering his head and face, Bi Hua retreated to one side. He did not dare to fight with Ling Han anymore. A seed was a seed; their battle prowess was too powerful.

Ling Han looked at Shui Yanyu with a grin, and asked, “Girl, I’ve saved you, so shouldn’t you repay me with yourself?”

Everyone looked at each other, not knowing what kind of expression they should put on.

In broad daylight, you immediately started to take liberties with a woman at the slightest chance; was that really appropriate?

Even if you were a seed, you still couldn’t be that arrogant!

This was the Majestic Heaven Sect, and if even the safety of the disciples in the sect could not be ensured, then what further purpose was there for its continued existence?

“Thank you!” Shui Yanyu replied coldly.

Bi Hua did not leave, because he wanted to see Ling Han deflated in front of Shui Yanyu. True enough, this woman would not give face even to a seed. Elation involuntarily rose up in his heart. Seeing something that he could not obtain for himself, he naturally hoped that others would similarly not be capable of obtaining it.

“What if I insist?” Ling Han stepped in front of Shui Yanyu, stretching his arms open, looking completely like a bully stealing away a bride for himself.

“The sect has its rules!” Shui Yanyu uttered icily. She did not believe Ling Han would do so, and the great elites in the sect wouldn’t allow him to do as he liked.

Ling Han snickered, and said, “You are my wife; it is destined!” He used his own voice to speak out these words.

Abruptly, Shui Yanyu started. A sliver of pleasant surprise appeared on her beautiful face, but at the same time, there was also caution. After all, she could not confirm the identity of a person just based on voice alone.

“Come, give me a hug!” Ling Han said, and without asking for Shui Yanyu’s agreement, directly wrapped her inside his arms.

F***, he really succeeded?

Everyone took a sharp breath. They felt that this seed-level genius was really too perverted to actually take liberties with a junior sister in front of all their eyes. Wasn’t that seeking his own death? No matter how much of a genius you were, if you publicly trampled over the rules of the sect, who would be able to cover for you?

With this embrace, Shui Yanyu naturally smelt a familiar scent immediately.

It was him!

She couldn’t help but become excited, and involuntarily stretched out her arms to embrace Ling Han back.

Pu!

Everyone spluttered. What was going on here? She was hooked so quickly?

They did not know that Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were already a couple, and thought that Shui Yanyu had been moved with this embrace from Ling Han. Naturally, all of them felt regret—if they had known, they would have used force against this seductive beauty. Just see how easily she had been hooked!

Bi Hua even spat out a mouthful of blood.

He felt that a great injustice had been done to him. So it turned out that this woman liked a man that was forceful!

Previously, he had pursued Shui Yanyu relentlessly without any success, and now, one forceful embrace from Ling Han, and Shui Yanyu had practically turned into a pool of water. How could he not be greatly angered by this? He only felt that he was the greatest idiot in the entire world.

As they had been separated for two years, Shui Yanyu’s passion burned like fire, and she took the initiative to kiss Ling Han.

Ling Han was naturally not about to disappoint a beauty, and kissed her heavily.

“Wa!” A great commotion rose up in their surroundings, everyone cursing this adulterous **. Naturally, they were the sour grapes. They were really too envious.

A frightening aura swept over, causing an endless coldness to rise up from within the depths of their souls.

Pa, pa, pa, pa. Aside from Ling Han, everyone collapsed onto the ground at the same time, and Shui Yanyu, too, dropped bonelessly into Ling Han’s arms, her delicate body trembling.

Ling Han turned around in shock, and saw that Hu Feiyun was presently looking at him and Shui Yanyu darkly. That endless majestic presence was precisely exuded from her body.

But at this moment, Ling Han thought that this was not that muddle-headed girl.

It was Empress Luan Xing!

Precisely, in the Heavenly Sea Mystery Realm, Ling Han had already seen Empress Luan Xing appear through Hu Feiyun in a very strange method, and now, she had appeared again!

‘But there was no danger now, so why had you come out?

‘Hold on, could it be... because of jealousy?’

Ling Han felt that this was inconceivable, but aside from this reason, was there any second possibility?

He laid Shui Yanyu down, and hurriedly rushed towards Hu Feiyun. He grabbed her wrist in a single move, and declared, “Come with me!”

Hu Feiyun’s, no, the Empress Luan Xing’s eyes widened, and she seemed to be about to stretch out her imposing aura to send Ling Han flying. However, for some unknown reason, her heart softened, and she allowed him to take her away.

The two of them soon arrived at White Frost Peak, and entered into Ling Han’s palace.

“What exactly is wrong with you?” Ling Han asked.

Empress Luan Xing humphed, and said, “What right do you have to ask me questions?”

“Just now, you almost killed me. Could it be that I can’t ask why?” Ling Han uttered angrily. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Actually, Empress Luan Xing didn’t know herself why she had come out. It was completely a moment of impulse, which she involuntarily put into action. However, she was naturally not going to admit it. She declared, “I will kill whoever I want to, with or without a reason!”

She was really a tsundere!

“You have to give me an honest explanation today. What relation is there between you and the Ninth King? Why can you appear in her body?” Ling Han said in a justified manner.

“Do you think I will tell this secret to an irrelevant person?” Empress Luan Xing smirked, though she felt like going crazy in her heart. He was merely in the Mountain River Tier, and could actually bargain in front of her??

When was it that Heavenly Body Tier had become so cheap?

Ling Han stared at her for a moment, and then said, “All right, I can tell you some of my secrets, and you, too, must not hide anything from me!”

Empress Luan Xing really wanted to ask him who did he think he was, and what basis did he have to make such a request of her, but every aspect of her time with Ling Han these two years rose up in her mind, especially the last bit, when she pounced on him. That scene caused her to blush heavily and her heart to throb madly, and involuntarily, her imposing manner in front of Ling Han softened slightly.

“Don’t resist my divine sense, I will bring you into my Spatial God Tool.”
