3149 Basics of Formations

Yi?

Ling Han nodded earnestly, “M-hm.”

Lian Xuerong shook her head, “Do you know how many cultivators there are in the Dark North Nation?”

“No,” Ling Han answered very decisively.

“Although there are no exact numbers, there should be no less than 100,000 people of Six Meridians and above,” Lian Xuerong said. She paused, then asked, “And in the case of Formation Masters, how many are there?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I don’t know.” Ling Han still shook his head.

“Not counting apprentices, there are only a mere hundred people that are truly qualified to be called Formation Masters!”

Ling Han understood what Lian Xuerong’s words meant. That was, Formation Masters were extremely rare, and there were extremely high requirements to become one. It was not something that could be achieved just by anyone studying formations.

However, what she didn’t know was that after absorbing all the essence of the Divine Stone, he was born with outstanding talent in formations and alchemy, and heaven-defying luck and affinity.

He merely smiled, “I only want to try and see if I have the talent in this area.”

Lian Xuerong was slightly displeased. To be so biting off more than one can chew, and be so impractical, how could one possibly walk further on the path of martial arts? Do you think you are that Young Master Wuque, who had fluttering white robes and was renowned throughout the world? Capable of easily cultivating both martial arts and formations.

When she thought of that flawlessly perfect man, she couldn’t help but blush, her eyes a little dazed.

Among all the women in the world, who did not think of him as their dream lover?

She hurriedly came back to her senses. She was the Banner Lord of Xuanqing Banner, so how could she lose her composure in front of her subordinates?

“You wait for a while.” Lian Xuerong returned to the battle ship, and very soon came out again. She tossed another book to Ling Han, “This is a chapter of basics about formations. Take it and comprehend it on your own. Additionally, three days later, I will test your grasp of formations. If you can’t satisfy me, humph!”

She waved her hand and left.

Ling Han chuckled. All right, then let’s take a look at the cultivation technique created by the nation leader of Dark North Nation.

He first looked at the Xuanhuang Technique, and read it word by word. Occasionally, he would let out an ‘oh’.

Very quickly, he closed the book, and closed his eyes to recall. It had to be admitted that this nation leader was really a prodigy of martial arts — the prerequisite of that was that this cultivation technique was really created by him.

It couldn’t compare to Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique. However, compared to using the Four Directional Fists to cultivate, this was still several times better.

Early in the morning of the second day, Ling Han used this cultivation technique to cultivate. He discovered that compared with Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, this was only one-tenth of the efficiency. Moreover, there were many impurities in the power refined through this technique, and compared with the power in his body, the difference was clear.

Ling Han nodded, stopped cultivating this cultivation technique, and began using the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique again. According to his estimation, without any special help, he would need around a hundred days to be able to step into Ten Meridians.

This wasn’t slow at all, but Ling Han hoped that it could be faster, because he wanted to release the empress and the others as soon as possible. He believed that this was related to his strength. Once he became stronger, the empress and the others would naturally be able to come out.

Half an hour later, Ling Han took out the basics of formations and began to study it.

This was really the basics, starting from explaining what formations were.

What were formations?

Extracting and turning around the power of heaven and earth to confuse, destroy enemies, and refine pills.

Thus, Formation Masters also had a branch called Formation Alchemists. They specialized in alchemy, and formations was only supplementary to their main specialization.

“Aside from the most basic formations such as Three Elements Formation and the like, the creation of other formation foundations requires learning formation patterns as well as powerful spiritual power as a medium to communicate with heaven and earth.”

“Spiritual power? In the Genesis World, my divine sense is extremely strong, but now… where do I find spiritual power?”

“In other words, if I want to learn formations, I have to first learn how to strengthen my spiritual power, or how to instill spiritual power into formation patterns.”

“I wonder if there is such a cultivation technique in the Dark North Nation.”

“I’ll start learning from the most basic formation patterns first.”

“3600 basic formation patterns, 1800 medium level formation patterns, 108 high level formation patterns, and 36 extremely effective formation patterns. However, only 744 basic formation patterns are used here.”

“The combination of different formation patterns can have different effects.”

“I wonder what level the formation patterns on the formation foundations dug out in the Ancient Dao Sect’s Ancient Formation are.”

“I’ve already had Huan Xue bring it over. I’ll study it when the time comes.”

He began to learn formation patterns, and instantly fell into a state of neglecting food and rest. He even forgot to eat and sleep, and the most important thing of the morning, cultivation.

These formation patterns were incredibly complex. They were obviously only basic formation patterns, but their complexity made Ling Han feel as if he was cultivating an incredibly profound martial arts technique. Moreover, there seemed to be a mystical power in the world that was causing trouble. Every time he memorized a formation pattern, it would immediately begin to fade, as if it was about to be erased from his memory.

This caused his progress to become incredibly slow. He couldn’t even remember them, so how could he talk about creating formation foundations?

“Ling Han! Ling Han!” Ling Han was interrupted by a fierce knock on the door. He was now on the battle ship, and had a single room that belonged to him. He came back to his senses, and suddenly felt both hungry and thirsty.

“The Banner Lord wants to see you,” the person outside said.

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. Could it be that three days had already passed?

No wonder he felt so thirsty.

He went out to meet Lian Xuerong.

“How’s the study of the cultivation technique going?” Lian Xuerong asked.

“I’ve learnt it.” Ling Han nodded.

Lian Xuerong was drinking tea, and when she heard this, almost spat it out.

What kind of joke was this? He had learnt this cultivation technique in three days?

Keep bragging.

“All right, I’ll test you.” She began to test Ling Han, but as questions were thrown out and perfectly answered, she couldn’t help but reveal a shocked expression.

There really were prodigies in the world. For example, the incomparably talented Young Master Wuque from the Dark North Nation. It was said that he would be able to learn anything at first glance, and others could only admire him.

Was this young man in front of her also such a prodigy?

“Go on, work hard on cultivation, and don’t neglect it!” she said. Because she was too stunned, she had forgotten to ask Ling Han how he was doing in formations, but as she saw it, it was already remarkable for Ling Han to be able to fully comprehend this cultivation technique in three days, so how could he possibly have the time to spend on formations?

Even if she asked, it would be pointless.

Two days later, Ling Han dived into the pool again and plucked the Volcanic Fruit.

This was already completely mature.

A Volcanic Fruit could instantly turn a Nine Meridians martial artist into a Ten Meridians martial artist.

Ling Han couldn’t wait. He was filled with longing for Ten Meridians. When he released his power, his battle prowess would instantly advance to a new height. It wasn’t impossible for him to battle even a Twelve Meridians.

He sat down in a cross-legged position, and began to gnaw on the Volcanic Fruit.

En, it was very fragrant. Though it was not very sweet, it was not too bad, at least.

Ling Han made his evaluation, and it was practically in an instant that power surged within his body.
