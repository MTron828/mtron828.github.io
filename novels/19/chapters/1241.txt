Chapter 1242: Treasure Map

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Don’t kill me!”

The three looters were so terrified that tears started to stream down their faces. With the threat of death looming over them, their cowardly instincts instantly kicked in—they were only begging for their own lives, and they clearly didn’t give a rat’s arse about their companions.

“Are your lives worth anything?” Ling Han said indifferently.

“Master, let Little Asura deal with them!” There was a ball of fire in the Asura Demon Emperor’s chest. He had almost been killed by them just then, so he naturally wanted to kill them with his own hands now.

Killing intent surged from his body. In any case, he was a demon from the Netherworld, so killing people didn’t make him feel guilty or traumatized at all.

“No! Don’t kill me!” the three looters shouted in panic.

“Spare me! I have an ancient map that reveals the location of an ancient treasure!” one of the looters said.

“What?!” the other two looters exclaimed in astonishment.

“Didn’t you tell us that the treasure map was already lost?”

“So, it turns out that you pocketed it for yourself!”

There was fury on their faces as they chided and condemned each other.

They were gripped with internal conflict.

The Asura Demon Emperor was especially observant, and he knew that Ling Han’s interest had been piqued. He immediately turned to the looters, and shouted, “What treasure map? Hurry up and hand it over!”

“Will you spare me if I hand it over?” the owner of the treasure map asked cautiously.

Pa!

The Asura Demon Emperor instantly smashed the head of another looter in pieces, and threatened, “Do you have the right to negotiate with me?”

The person’s face instantly turned green with fright, and he hurriedly exclaimed, “Don’t kill me! I’ll take you over to retrieve the treasure map straight away!”

“It’s not on you?” the Asura Demon Emperor asked.

The person frantically shook his head, and replied, “No!”

Although the looters were companions, none of them trusted each other. So, how could he keep the treasure map in his personal Spatial Spirit Tool?

They could loot others, and others could naturally loot them as well. Thus, they definitely wouldn’t keep valuable items on themselves. Otherwise, how could they negotiate with others? If they kept everything on themselves, they would be done for once their Spatial Spirit Tool was taken.

The Asura Demon Emperor glanced at Ling Han, and saw that he didn’t mind. He instantly became more daring, and he lashed out at the other looter.

Pa!

The other looter’s head was also smashed into pieces. Blood and gore splattered all over the remaining looter’s face, causing him to almost wet his pants in terror.

Although they were vicious when killing others, their knees would immediately go weak when they ended up on the receiving end.

The Asura Demon Emperor guarded the looter, and Ling Han walked behind them. The looter led them to a small valley, where he removed a boulder to reveal a ring that was stuck in a gap underneath it.

If the looter hadn’t retrieved it for them, it would have been almost impossible for Ling Han and the Asura Demon Emperor to find.

The Asura Demon Emperor snatched the ring, and respectfully handed it to Ling Han. There was an obsequious look on his face.

Ling Han accepted the ring, and scanned it with his divine sense. He “saw” that it was quite full, with True Origin Stones, a few cultivation techniques, and a few pieces of Godly metal. Finally, there was a map.

He took the map out, and asked, “Where’s this treasure map from?”

“I don’t know. I only found it after robbing a group of people,” the looter said. “Young Master, can I leave now?”

“Leave your mom!” The Asura Demon Emperor instantly launched a fist at the looter.

Pa!

The last looter was also killed.

Ling Han didn’t feel a shred of sympathy. These people specially targeted the cultivators here, and their actions were truly abhorrent and reprehensible. They should have been fighting against external enemies, yet they lingered behind the front lines and targeted their allies. Everything they did was deserving of contempt.

“This place... Where is it?” Ling Han looked at the red circle in the center region of the map. This red circle probably marked the location of the treasure. However, the entire terrain on the map seemed extremely unfamiliar.

‘Hang on, I have another treasure map on me. I obtained it in the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realm.’

Ling Han recalled that the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realm had been constructed by the 12 generals under the Heavenly River King. After receiving the inheritance of a palace, one would receive a set of coordinates that corresponded to some place in the Immortal Realm. The Heavenly River King’s supreme inheritances were hidden at these locations.

Ling Han had stayed put on the Joint Peace Planet before, so he naturally hadn’t been able to search for these coordinates. Now that he had come to the Cloud Apex Planet, he finally had the opportunity to search for it.

‘Anyhow, who on earth is the Heavenly River King?

‘The secret techniques that I obtained in that mystery realm are all supreme techniques, be it the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art or the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow. They’re all first-rate secret techniques, at least for now. Judging by this fact, the Heavenly River King’s inheritance is at least at the Heavenly Body Tier.

‘Oh, that’s right. I also obtained an egg in that mystery realm.’

With a thought, an egg immediately appeared before Ling Han.

He had obtained it in the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realm. Afterward, he had left it in the Black Tower. However, it hadn’t grown or changed a single bit, so he had almost forgotten about its existence.

‘I can feel vitality coming from it, so it can still be hatched.

‘However, how much longer is it going to take? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

‘This is the descendant of an Azure Flame Vulture, so theoretically speaking, it shouldn’t take so long to hatch. Could it be because I left it in the Black Tower? After all, the Black Tower lacks the Regulations of heaven and earth, so it can’t be regarded as a legitimate world even though it can hold living beings.

‘Moreover, I left it under the Reincarnation Tree, and it seems like this did something mysterious to the egg.

‘Will the hatched Azure Flame Vulture... still be an Azure Flame Vulture?

‘Should I just eat it instead?’

This thought flashed past Ling Han’s mind. In the end, however, he decided to keep the egg. Perhaps it would hatch if he took it out and let it enjoy the sun more often.

He left the egg resting there, and he sat on a boulder himself.

‘Elites at the Sun Moon Tier are probably strong enough to shatter the barriers to small worlds. However, it’ll still be extremely difficult for them to enter these small worlds due to the Regulations of heaven and earth. They’ll have to either suppress or sever their cultivation.

‘Of course, the people from the Celestial Realm don’t need to do this. After reaching a certain tier, one can ignore the Regulations of the small worlds.

‘Huh? Could it be... that the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire is from the Celestial Realm?’

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire had told him to obtain True Dragon’s Horns and Heavenly Phoenix’s Feathers, and both were from Saint-level beasts. Moreover, judging by his tone, it seemed as if he viewed these beings with disdain. This would all make sense if he were a great elite from the Celestial Realm.

‘F*ck! What kind of place is the Lower Realm? Why did it attract so many freaks?’

Ling Han felt a slight headache. The Asura Demon Emperor had told him that the Lower Realm had already ascended to the Immortal Realm once. However, for some reason, it had fallen down to become a small world again. It was because of this that Ling Han had been able to open the sky for a second time.

‘Perhaps I’ll only have the right to figure this out when I enter the Celestial Realm.

‘Right now, there’s one thing that I can definitely confirm. Even Genesis Tier Saints can’t hack a piece of land from the Immortal Realm and transform it into a small world. Only those who have grasped both the power of construction and power of destruction can do this.

‘I obtained the Black Tower, and it seems like I inherited a great danger along with it.’

Ling Han shook his head and cleared his mind. He planned to put the egg away and return to his original spot, where he would continue to observe the Purple Moon Army.

Shua!

Right at this moment, a sword light suddenly slashed at him. It possessed a devastating might, and it was as if the sky were about to collapse.
