Chapter 2400: Forcing abdication

Grandmaster Zi Cheng frowned slightly. In the past, there had also been visitors from the Ancient Alchemy Tower, claiming they wanted to improve the Eastern Celestial Realm’s skill in alchemy, but in truth, it was just an attempt to seize power, and turn Alchemy City into their private possession.

And here was another?

However, he immediately broke into a smile. Others might not be aware, but he was very clear that his disciple was already a Ninth Refinement Supreme Grandmaster. Aside from Five-Star Grandmasters, who else could suppress Ling Han?

An attempt to seize power in cultivation had to be based on true battle prowess, while trying to seize power over alchemy would be based on skill in alchemy.

Ling Han was already invincible, so whom could he fear?

With this in mind, he did not show any temper. Instead, he revealed a smile, appearing very calm and steady.

Though Grandmaster Zi Cheng had not stepped out, there were naturally those who wanted to curry favor with him that would speak up. “Friend Xie, our chairperson has just returned, and has just become a Four-Star Grandmaster. Why don’t you join us for a celebratory cup of wine?”

A hint of disdain appeared in Xie Yangbing’s expression, “It is precisely because I have heard that the great Alchemy City is actually in the hands of a little brat, and so have come to see whether this person has the character for it.”

These words had gone too far, and a number of people immediately stood up, glaring at him angrily.

…If they did not show their loyalty now, what would they be waiting for?

Xie Yangbing was completely disdainful, and instead revealed his badge.

Instantly, a ring of shocked exclamations rang out.

Four-Star Grandmaster!

It was really unexpected that such a young man would actually be a Four-Star Grandmaster.

Looking at Ling Han, he was also unreasonably young, his flame of life having only been burning for several million years—with time acceleration effects, the flame of life would not be sped up.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel rueful. The present world truly belonged to the youth.

And with such a show, at least half of those that had previously voluntarily stood up sat back down quietly, and it was not that the other half did not want to sit back down, but rather they could not bring themselves to, because others were looking at them. They had to find a suitable chance too, right?

“Chairperson Ling!” Xie Yangbing saw everyone’s embarrassing actions, and merely crooked his lips, revealing a hint of disdain. He turned to Ling Han. “I heard that you are constantly absent from Alchemy City. What right do you have to lead this sacred land of alchemy of the Eastern Celestial Realm then?”

Everyone was surprised. Xie Yangbing was trying to force an abdication in full public now. His purpose was clear, and that was to eject Ling Han from his seat so that he himself could replace him.

This was really ruthless. He was just a single person, and he wanted to conquer the holy land of alchemy of the Eastern Celestial Realm on his own.

However, he was a Four-Star Grandmaster, and with the background of the Ancient Alchemy Tower added into the equation, he did indeed have the right to act so arrogantly.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “I heard that your father is constantly away from home. Would your mother feel lonely and cold?”

Instantly, Xie Yangbing’s expression twisted in fury. ‘My father is not home; what business is that of yours? You actually dare imply that my mother is having an illicit affair? Damn it, damn you.’

Yet everyone broke into laughter. This was very simple. Since Xie Yangbing did not want others to interfere in his own family business, what right did he have to interfere in the affairs of others? Was there any need for an outsider to criticize or give orders about Alchemy City? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Moreover, though Ling Han was absent, there was still Grandmaster Zi Cheng who was helping him take care of matters, and everything was organized and systematic.

‘Xie Yangbing, you are really just being a busybody!’

“Ling Han, you have gone too far!” Xie Yangbing calmed down. He could not just go with Ling Han’s flow, and lose control of himself.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Because you came, we treated you as a guest, and did not chase you out. However, if you are so determined to speak poorly, I shall oblige you!” He paused, and then called out. “Come, please expel this Bigmouth Xie from here.”

Pu!

Hearing the nickname that Ling Han had given him, quite a number of people spluttered in laughter.

Two guards walked towards Xie Yangbing, and when they were close enough, they said, “Young Master Xie, this way please.”

“Who dares!” A cold, eerie voice rang out, and an elder had suddenly appeared behind Xie Yangbing. His hair was white, but his features were young, his face rosy, and complexion shockingly smooth and bright.

He waved his hand slightly.?Peng, peng, those two guards were instantly sent flying. Thankfully, he observed propriety, and merely sent them backwards, and did not wound the two of them.

With such an aggressive move, everyone stood up once more, looking at him angrily.

“Hehe.” The elder smirked coldly.?Boom, his incredibly frightening aura surged out madly.

“Ascending Origin Tier, consummate level!” When they sensed this aura, everyone’s expressions changed.

This was too terrifying. He was a consummate level Ascending Origin Tier, invincible against anyone beneath the Celestial King Tier.

Though there were many hidden talents in Alchemy City, they definitely did not have any Celestial Kings, and while there was indeed a considerable number of Ascending Origin Tiers, the number that had reached the consummate level could be counted on a single hand.

“How do I address you, sir?” An elder stood up. He was the clan leader of a noble clan of the Alchemy City, the Liu Clan, with cultivation level of consummate level Ascending Origin Tier.

“Qian Wuyi,” the first elder replied proudly. “What is it? Are you planning to step out?”

The clan leader of the Liu Clan smirked coldly. The cultivation and alchemy fields of Alchemy City shared both honor and shame. Hence, he stepped out at the first instant. He shook his head. “I just wish to protect the order of Alchemy City; I forbid anyone from being insolent here!”

When he said the word “insolent,” he had already charged out, surging towards Qian Wuyi.

“Trash of Eastern Celestial Realm!” Qian Wuyi smirked coldly. His figure advanced suddenly as he sent out a palm strike.?Peng, the terrifying aura shook the heavens and earth.

The two elites immediately brought their battle into the skies.?Boom, boom, boom, light exploded, illuminating the skies.

Everyone could not see clearly. They could only see endless light flashing in the skies, while their ears heard enormous blasts, but they had completely no idea how the battle was progressing, and who had the upper hand.

They were really too far from this level.

The Empress only glanced, and then said, “He’s going to lose.”

Ling Han nodded. He knew that the Empress was talking about the clan leader of the Liu Clan. Though that person was also a consummate level Ascending Origin Tier, his aptitude was ordinary, but Qian Wuyi was a king tier.

A king tier could be invincible against an opponent of the same cultivation level, and though Ascending Origin Tier was not that impressive, in circumstances where both fighters were of the same cultivation level, the king tier would definitely have a tremendous advantage.

As expected, it was only about 100 moves, and a figure was seen falling from the skies. With a thud, he landed heavily on the ground, creating a deep hole from the impact.

Who was it?

There was no need to check, because Qian Wuyi had already shot down from the skies, landing steadily on the ground. Then the person who had been struck down definitely had to be the clan leader of the Liu Clan.

“You can’t even last a single blow!” Qian Wuyi scoffed.

He had blocked about 100 strikes, and it naturally was not that he could not last a single blow. But Qian Wuyi was the victor. Was there any significance in refuting this point?

Dead silence fell. Though this was Alchemy City, they similarly respected elites.

Qian Wuyi naturally was this kind of elite.

This was very domineering. One used his strength as a suppression tactic, while the other exhibited unmatched standards in alchemy, and added with the fame of the Ancient Alchemy Tower, it was indeed possible that the master of Alchemy City could be replaced overnight.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s expression involuntarily changed. He indeed had confidence in Ling Han’s strength in alchemy, but someone was already hostile right on their doorstep, so it was natural that he could not just sit by idly and watch.

“Master!” Yet Ling Han placed a hand on his shoulder. “Let me.”

How could this kind of trifling matter need to trouble his master?

Ling Han stated evenly, “Xie Yangbing, what do you want to do?”

“Compete with me in alchemy, and if you lose, scram!” Xie Yangbing declared very arrogantly. Qian Wuyi was a consummate level Ascending Origin Tier king tier who could suppress every single elite here all by himself, and added with his skill in alchemy, the two of them could easily occupy this sacred land of alchemy of the Eastern Celestial Realm.
