Chapter 2250: Return

“Your guess is correct. I indeed want to screw you guys over. In fact, it would be best if I could kill all of you, from top to bottom,” Ling Han said with a smile. “However, there’s no need for you to worry, because you won’t live to see that day.”

He casually snapped his fingers.

Pa!

The gigantic insect body of Yamu instantly erupted, signifying her death. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Hmm, a small harvest.” With a single thought from him, numerous Spatial God Tools instantly materialized before him.

They had all been left behind by the Foreign Realm cultivators who had been killed. Initially, they had been scattered around the realm. However, this realm was like an extension of Ling Han’s body, so it was naturally an easy task for him to collect these Spatial God Tools.

“If I want to trick and kill the elites of the Foreign Realm, the first thing I need to do is to get them to enter this realm.”

Ling Han continued to murmur to himself, saying, “As such, I need to elevate the upper limit of the Regulations of this heaven and earth. That way, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings will also be able to enter.

“At that time, I can kill to my heart’s content.”

He immediately acted on his plan, elevating the Regulations of this heaven and earth. He was the ruler of this heaven and earth now, so he was naturally transcendent above its regulations. In other words, he could implement any Regulation that he wanted.

However, he quickly realized that while it was a simple task to elevate the Regulations to the Ascending Origin Tier, trying to elevate them to the Celestial King Tier was far more difficult.

This heaven and earth was indeed on the level of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. However, its Regulations were far inferior to this level.

He unleashed his full power, yet he could only raise the Regulations to the Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

However, if he personally sustained the realm, anyone would be able to ignore the suppression of the Regulations and enter. Even Heavenly Venerates could enter without triggering a backlash.

No wonder the Heavenly Venerates from the Foreign Realm hadn’t directly destroyed this realm. As it turned out, they wanted someone from their side to obtain control over it. Otherwise, if they destroyed it, it would destabilize the connection point between the two realms. In turn, this would delay the moment of their full-scale invasion.

“In this case, I can only trap and kill 14th Lotus elites at a maximum?” Ling Han was slightly unhappy about this. However, he immediately chuckled at his own ambition. “Just what cultivation level am I at? Is killing 14th Lotus elites not enough?

“This is still an unfathomable achievement!”

Celestial Kings above the Fifth Heaven wouldn’t be able to enter at all. If they forced their way in, they would be making enemies of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate level heaven and earth. In other words, they would be trying to strike a rock with an egg—they would be seeking death.

‘Even though I have no intentions of refining the Origin Magic Cube, controlling the workings of this heaven and earth is a rare opportunity and experience. It can help me comprehend the essence of heaven and earth, thereby allowing me to surpass the limitations of the Regulations,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

With a single thought, he appeared on the outskirts of this heaven and earth. If he took another step forward, he would arrive in the territory of the Celestial Realm.

‘Once I return to the Celestial Realm, I will have lost all respect and fear toward the Regulations and heaven and earth. After all, I’ve also experienced the sensation of being a ruler over heaven and earth, even though this realm is far inferior to the Celestial Realm.

‘However, on a fundamental level, it’s still the same thing. I’m… not resigned to being suppressed by heaven and earth!’

There was an unstoppable urge in Ling Han’s mind. Not only did he want to become a Heavenly Venerate, but becoming the Heavenly Venerate still wasn’t his final goal.

He wanted to become the ruler of heaven and earth, not just someone who was transcendent above the Regulations.

“The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the others are definitely involved in the death of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. If I want them to pay a price, simply becoming a Heavenly Venerate isn’t enough.”

He continued forward, and he couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. After leaving the neutral zone, his strength returned to normal, and he had to travel using his own powers. This was unlike the neutral zone, where he could teleport anywhere he wanted with a single thought.

He arrived beneath the Clear Heaven Pass. Here, there was a Transfer Formation that could teleport him into the Clear Heaven Pass.

Weng!

Light undulated, and his body vanished. He had already entered the Clear Heaven Pass.

He then arrived at the 17th camp of Unit D, where he first reported his return to Nie Heshan. He had vanished for over 1,000 years, so he naturally needed to report in to his superior. In fact, he might even receive punishment from the military.

“Where did you go all these years?” Nie Heshan asked with a displeased expression.

Because of Ling Han, he had even been scolded by the Eternity Celestial King. However, whom could he explain this to? Ling Han had his own feet, and he naturally couldn’t chain him down, either.

Ling Han had naturally prepared an excuse beforehand, and he said, “I came across a rare opportunity, so I’ve been cultivating in seclusion this entire time.”

Nie Heshan frowned, and said, “Do you know just how incorrect your decision was? Do you think your cultivation speed is quick? Let me tell you, Ji Wuming, Hong Huang, and the others have already reached the Fifth Secret!”

‘F*ck! Already?’

However, after pondering over it for a brief moment, it indeed made sense. It had already been an entire 1,400 years, and with the acceleration of time, Ji Wuming and the others had actually experienced an astonishingly long time in cultivation. Moreover, they had received an exorbitant amount of cultivation resources, and they even had the guidance of a Celestial King. As such, it was only natural that their cultivation advanced at an astounding pace.

One had to realize that they were all Monarch Stars. For example, Ji Wuming was the reincarnation of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so to say nothing of the First Secret, Ling Han could have accepted it even if he had reached the Eleventh Secret.

Ling Han simply nodded in reply. In any case, he couldn’t tell the truth, so he could only obediently accept this scolding.

“The Eternity Celestial King had wanted to guide you, allowing you to walk a different path. It was because of this intention that he sent you over here to undergo some comprehensions first. After staying here for 200 years, the Eternity Celestial King planned to take you away to cultivate. Unexpectedly, however, you hid somewhere to cultivate in seclusion.”

Nie Heshan shook his head, continuing, “Ah, you… You’re far too foolish. Aren’t you abandoning something important to take something unimportant?”

Ling Han simply smiled in reply. He naturally couldn’t say that he had obtained the core of a realm. If he refined it, he could more so become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King without any effort. At that time, he could enjoy the same standing as the Eternity Celestial King.

What important thing? What unimportant thing? He was extremely clear about his own decisions.

“Your friends and wives have already been picked up by the Eternity Celestial King as well. They have their own fates and opportunities, so you need not worry about them.” Nie Heshan quickly changed the topic, and he started to console Ling Han instead. After saying a few more sentences, he realized that this was pointless, so he dismissed Ling Han.

News about the events inside the neutral zone quickly spread out. Along with it, the name of the mysterious “Chicken Slayer” elite also spread throughout the Clear Heaven Pass.

This person was far too powerful! They had sent an eighth secret Monarch Star flying with a single punch, and they were even more powerful than Ailean. Could the Clear Heaven Pass find a second person like this?

Perhaps only Xing Chenyue could rival this person’s power.

At the same time, the huge transformation of the neutral zone was also discovered by everyone. Not only could Immortal Palace Tier elites enter, but even Ascending Origin Tier elites and Celestial Kings could enter now. This transformation left them feeling extremely uneasy. Perhaps a full-scale battle was going to erupt at any moment.

The Foreign Realm also responded quickly, sending another request for the Immortal Palace Tier elites of both realms to spar. This also came with a condition, whereby every victory for the Celestial Realm would delay the invasion from the Foreign Realm by 10,000 years.

Many people were enticed by this offer.

Winning a single battle could win 10,000 years of peace. This signified that the Celestial Realm would have more time to cultivate and recover. At the same time, they would also have more time to nurture the next generation of prodigies, such that they could better defend against the next invasion from the Foreign Realm.

This was especially the case since the Celestial Realm had many Immortal Palace Tier Monarch Stars who had the right to participate in this battle. These Monarch Stars had a chance at victory.

However, this naturally wasn’t a decision for ordinary people. Instead, it was a decision for the Celestial Kings. In fact, only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could participate in the discussion about whether they accepted this offer or not.

Seven days passed, and a decision was passed down—battle!

There was only a single word, yet this roused the fighting spirit of everyone in the Clear Heaven Pass.
