Chapter 2532: Discussion

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Wally had also gone to the Flaming Frost Realm with Zhou Heng, and Ling Han found this out from the message that Hu Niu, the Rain Emperor, and the others had left behind.

The Empress spread out her hands, indicating that she did not know.

With how proud she was, how could it be that she would concern herself with knowing the whereabouts of others?

Ling Han was speechless. This was definitely his wife, as true as she could be.

He studied the Crimson Bright Fire Pill himself. If he could concoct it, it would be too helpful to their group.

A day passed, and quite a lot of interesting topics emerged immediately in the martial academy.

For example, a powerful man named Li Si thrashed Xiao Yingxiong madly in the Nine Deaths Formation, and it was done twice at that.

Or for example, how Goddess Luan Xing was suddenly courted, and this guy that was so lucky that he had drawn the jealousy of countless people, with countless people cursing him with straw dolls… was still that Li Si.

Another example was how it was unknown why the trend of homosexuality had suddenly arisen in the martial academy, and the first pair to come out of the closet was actually the young master of the Zhuo Clan and Wu Shi. What was even more ridiculous, these two people were actually caught having s*x out in the open.

And even more, more ridiculous was that the two of them had not actually done this once. They had just been exposed, and in the blink of an eye, they were again caught having s*x in the carriage.

…It was one thing for you to have carriage s*x in your own abode, but the carriage was actually parked by the roadside. Everyone who passed by could see the rhythmical shaking of the carriage, as well as hear those bursts of “moans.”

Shameless, too shameless.

Of course, Zhuo Kai’s matter was just a joke, but this kind of gossip had the greatest potential of spreading. In just a single day, this news had spread throughout the entire martial academy, and who knew if it would spread to Zhuo Bing, who was still far in the Realm Battlefield. Who knew if this news would directly kill the old geezer with fury.

Ling Han just happened to be working hard on studying the Crimson Bright Fire Pill, but the Empress called him over merely a day later.

There was a guy, no, a dog who had come to pay him a visit.

The large black dog sat in the great hall like a human being, his paw holding a teacup, looking deep and putting on pretense of mystery.

“Little Han, come help Grandpa Dog massage my leg.” The large black dog did not even have to turn around. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so his divine sense was naturally strong.

Ling Han was surprised. “How did you recognize me?”

He had cultivated the Heaven Deceiving Technique, and even Heavenborn had not discovered anything strange about him.

“Tsk!” The large black dog’s expression was filled with disdain. “Don’t I know you well enough? The moment I heard about Zhuo Kai’s matter yesterday, Grandpa Dog immediately figured out that someone had messed around with this unlucky boy.

“Aside from me, I believe that only you, who have gained my true inheritance, would think of such a way to mess around with someone, little bastard.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. This large black dog himself was the ancestor of messing around with people. His recognizing others was actually through recognizing their way of messing around.

“It’s great that you are here. In the future, when I mess around with anyone, you can help cover for me,” he said laughingly.

“No problem.” The large black dog patted his chest, looking very loyal.

Ling Han said calmly, “I heard that the ancestor of the Zhuo Clan is a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate—”

“Er, Grandpa Dog suddenly feels a bit of a stomachache. I seem to have eaten some expired beef skewers yesterday. I’m going to find that guy and get revenge; he actually dared to sell this kind of things to Grandpa Dog!” The large black dog immediately slid down onto the ground, and then looked like he was about to run outside.

This damn dog, he really was the type to bully the weak, but tremble before the strong. There was no cure for him.

Ling Han hurriedly stopped him. “Can’t you have a bit of backbone in you?”

“Pei, what is backbone worth? Is it edible?” The large black dog was completely shameless, but then again, it had never felt ashamed, either.

Ling Han sighed. “Zhuo Bing is in the Realm Battlefield, and there is no way he can return in the short term.”

“Yi, why does Grandpa Dog’s stomach not hurt all of a sudden?” The large black dog rubbed his belly. “As expected of Grandpa Dog, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. In the future, I am a being destined to become a Heavenly Venerate; my physique is really good.”

Ling Han gave him the middle finger, and then said seriously, “The Tower of Three Realms has now fallen into Heavenborn’s hands. We have to think of some way to get it back.”

This was the last inheritance from the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and definitely could not be allowed to fall into the hands of another.

The large black dog also became serious, and said, “Though I can suppress that brat, firstly, the martial academy has its rules, so it would not be appropriate for me to move publicly. Secondly, that brat is a manifestation of Divine Metal. Even Grandpa Dog cannot penetrate his defense. If we wanted to forcefully snatch back the Tower of Three Realms, it would be difficult!”

Ling Han also knew this. He slowly nodded, and then said, “However, Heavenborn must definitely be dealt with. Furthermore, I have battled with him on the Celestial Path. At the last crucial moment, it was the lingering intent of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable that appeared and distracted him, which allowed us to successfully escape.”

“Lord Yuan Sheng!” The large black dog was instantly excited. “Let’s go. Grandpa Dog will immediately go and slaughter that brat, and save Lord Yuan Sheng!”

Seeing how excited it was, Ling Han nodded internally. At least on the issue of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, the large black dog was still extremely loyal, and did not shame its virtue as a dog.

“Woof, your beady eyes are blinking like mad; are you cursing Grandpa Dog inside your head?” The large black dog was extremely sensitive.

Ling Han put on a serious face. “I was complimenting you.”

Then, he pondered slightly. “Heavenborn… is the manifestation of the Celestial Realm, and it can be said that there is no way that anyone beneath Heavenly Venerable Tier could do anything against him.”

In terms of Regulations, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were the pinnacle. Though Heavenly Venerable Tier was created through the back door by the heaven and earth, if the heaven and earth could really do as they willed like this, would Heavenly Venerates still emerge?

The power of heaven and earth was boundless, but was restricted through Regulations. This was the law of how the Genesis World worked, and it could not be gone against.

Thus, Heavenborn was indeed very freakish, but there was definitely no way he could be freakish to an unlimited extent.

“Could it be that I can only deal with him after becoming a Heavenly Venerate?” The large black dog was slightly irritable. Though both he and Ling Han had the potential to become a Heavenly Venerate, and this chance was even higher in the Flaming Frost Realm, that would definitely be a matter of countless years later.

…To become a Heavenly Venerate, it was only a small token to spend a few epochs to accumulate enough comprehension and strengthen foundations.

If he had to wait this long, the large black dog would not be able to bear it.

Ling Han was also thinking deeply, and he said, “To deal with Heavenborn, the first thing we have to do is deal with his physique. But aside from Heavenly Venerable Tier, what else could do anything against Divine Metal?”

He looked at the large black dog, and the large black dog was also looking at him. The man and dog exclaimed at practically the same time, “A Heavenly Venerate Tool!”

Divine Metal was on the same level as Celestial King Tier, so only something above the level of Celestial King Tier could damage Divine Metal.

Ling Han took out the Divine Demon Sword. “Then the first thing we have to do is boost this Divine Sword to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

“Hiss, that would require a shocking amount of Divine Metal,” the large black dog said through clenched teeth.

Ling Han cracked a grin. “That would have to depend on you.”

“Why does it have to be me? It is clear that the one benefiting is you, brat. Unless you give this sword to me!” the large black dog declared shamelessly.

Ling Han said, “Firstly, you are a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and possess great power. There are only a limited number that can contend with you in this world. Secondly, you are a dog, and have a good sense of smell. With such a strong nose, it would naturally be easy to find Divine—”

“Woof, I’ll bite you to death!” The large black dog was furious, and immediately pounced out.

Naturally, Ling Han could not possibly be a match for a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. He hurriedly called a ceasefire, and then continued, “You should know where Wally is staying at, right? I need to find him for something… Oh, right, how is your understanding of the fundamental power of the Genesis World?”

The large black dog’s expression turned gloomy. “It’s difficult, too difficult!”

The first step of Heavenly Venerable Tier began from the unique power of a dimension, but Wally’s model was meant for six great fundamental powers, and directly began from the second step. Thus, the large black dog, who was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, was completely baffled.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
