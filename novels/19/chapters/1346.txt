Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Earth Dragon Sect was clearly prepared for this, and what greeted Ling Han and the others behind the main gate was a dense mob of people.

An elder stepped forward, and roared, “Ling Han, you’ve taken things too far!” A black mist rose from his body, forming into numerous Earth Dragon-shaped tendrils. These tendrils were packed together extremely closely, and the sight of them was simply repulsive.

“What, so you people refining Realm Pills wasn’t taking things too far?” Feng Po Yun asked with a humph. Even his hair was standing on ends, revealing his fury at this moment.

The speed of his cultivation was relatively quick. However, due to the constraints of time, he had only just reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, even with the alchemical pills provided by Ling Han.

The elder completely ignored Feng Po Yun’s comments. Not to mention that he hadn’t reached the Sun Moon Tier yet, as long as he was under the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, the elder wouldn’t be afraid of him at all. After all, they were on completely different levels.

“Humph! Do you have the right to speak before me?” the elder asked in contempt.

Ling Han also humphed, and asked, “Well, do you have the right to act senior and haughty before me?”

Boom!

He unleashed his aura at the elder who had spoken.

Pa!

The elder’s body instantly went limp, and he couldn’t help but fall to his knees. However, he was a stubborn individual, and he forcefully twisted his body so that he would end up falling into a sitting position.

Although this was still embarrassing, it was already many times better than kneeling before his enemies.

“You’re really Ling Han?” a young man in the dense mob of people asked. His face was filled with astonishment.

“Oh, it’s Brother Nalan.” Ling Han nodded slightly as he glanced at the young man.

This young man was none other than Nalan Tu, the king tier who had enjoyed an equal standing with him 10,000 years ago. However, he was evidently less talented that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, the Sword Emperor, and the others. In fact, he was even less talented than Jiang Yuefeng, Chen Ruijing, and the others. Right now, he still hadn’t advanced to the Sun Moon Tier yet. He was only at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

After such a long time, the gulf in talent between the prodigies had finally become evident.

Nalan Tu smiled bitterly, and said, “Who would’ve thought that you would become so powerful? Back in the day... Heh, I could suppress you with a single strike.”

Ling Han’s expression darkened. ‘A real man doesn’t boast about his past achievements, okay? Also, can you not reopen old wounds? So what if I was weak back then? I had another identity, okay? I was the Alchemy Emperor! Which of you hadn’t come over to beg me to refine pills?’

Another elder stepped forward, and coldly said, “Ling Han, I suggest you go back to wherever you came from. The Earth Dragon Sect isn’t a place for you to act wantonly!”

Ling Han was slightly astonished. The Earth Dragon Sect would have definitely received news of the other four sects being forcefully disbanded, so how were these people still so calm and confident? It was as if they had a strong grip on the situation.

Where was their confidence coming from?

“Oh, you people have someone to lean on?” he asked with a smile.

“Wait patiently; you’ll find out soon,” the second elder said.

Ling Han ignored him, and continued, “As with the four other sects, I’ll give you people a chance. The prime culprits who made the decision to refine the Realm Pills must die. Those above the Immortal level can all cripple their own cultivation. From today onward, disband the Earth Dragon Sect. If you do so, I can spare the lives of the others.

“I’ll give you half a day’s time.”

After saying this, Ling Han and the others sat down in front of the main gate of the Earth Dragon Sect. They then retrieved some ingredients from the Black Tower and started to enjoy a hearty barbeque.

Meanwhile, the old ginseng dashed into the Earth Dragon Sect, saying, “Grandpa Ginseng is missing a few maids to massage his legs for him! Your opportunity has come! If you inhale a few breaths next to Grandpa Ginseng, I guarantee you’ll feel 100 times more invigorated, and I guarantee your cultivation will advance at a rapid speed! If you manage to satisfy Grandpa Ginseng, I might even shoot you a load of my essence! You’ll love it to death!”

His debauched utterances drew angry glares from the female disciples of the sect. They all felt that this old ginseng was shameless and degenerate.

Time slowly trickled by. Meanwhile, even though Ling Han was enjoying a barbeque with the others, he still released his divine sense to observe the entire Earth Dragon Sect. However, he didn’t detect any Heavenly Body Tier being.

Could the Earth Dragon Sect have enlisted the help of an Eternal River Tier elite? Ling Han refused to believe this.

‘Hmm?’

After four hours or so, Ling Han suddenly discovered a warship sailing toward them. This warship was extremely large, yet it was also extremely quick.

He activated the Eye of Truth as he gazed into the distant sky. What he saw was a gigantic warship around 30 kilometers long appearing over the horizon. It was like a large cloud, and it only took an instant for it to grow from the size of a dot to the size of a fist. This was a clear sign of just how quick it was.

Such a large warship could already be treated as a starship. However, this was clearly a warship—there was a flag on its bow, and this flag was decorated with a roaring tiger as well as a large “Zhao”. The flag fluttered in the wind, exuding an indescribable might and intimidation.

This overwhelming pressure was because of the large “Zhao” on the flag—this was definitely written by a supreme elite, and it was definitely imbued with their martial intent. The pressure that radiated from it was powerful enough to crush the bones of a Heavenly Body Tier elite.

Ling Han was astonished. Had the Earth Dragon Sect really managed to enlist the help of an Eternal River Tier elite?

However, what could they offer to lure an Eternal River Tier elite and earn their help?

It wasn’t long before the gigantic warship arrived close enough for everyone to see. Joy and delight instantly lit the faces of the members of the Earth Dragon Sect. Meanwhile, the expressions of Feng Po Yun and the others became much more stern.

Right now, the Earth Dragon Sect should have already known that Ling Han had advanced to the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, the helper that they had enlisted was definitely at or above the Heavenly Body Tier as well.

The warship stopped, and a carriage immediately flew down. This carriage was pulled by two white horses which had wings and a single horn on their head. These horses appeared extremely mighty, and both measured at least 30 meters in height.

“Ethereal Dragon Horses!” someone exclaimed in surprise. They had recognized the breed of these two majestic horses.

Ethereal Dragon Horses were incredibly rare Demonic Beasts. After reaching adulthood, they could even advance to the Heavenly Body Tier.

Gasp! This person was using Ethereal Dragon Horses to draw their carriage! This was insane!

Ling Han raised his eyebrows slightly, yet he wasn’t shocked. After all, he had already seen a half-intelligent mount that was forged from Saintly Material before, and that person’s chariot had also been forged from Saintly Material. Compared to that, what were mere Heavenly Body Tier Ethereal Dragon Horses worth?

The carriage quickly descended from the sky. This carriage was also extravagant, with all kinds of Level 10 materials draping over its exterior. There were 10,000-year-old Purple Pearls, Thousand Shadow Spider Webs, Lack Beast Horns, and other luxurious items.

The disciples of the Earth Dragon Sect had never seen such extravagance and might before. They couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. Enlisting the help of this person was definitely the right move!

The carriage stopped, and the two Ethereal Dragon Horses dragged their hooves over the ground. They wore expressions of condescending haughtiness.

Ling Han involuntarily rubbed his hands together. There was quite a large amount of rare Godly metal hanging from the carriage—just what he needed to feed his Divine Demon Sword!

He was definitely going to plunder all that Godly metal.

Creak...

The carriage door opened, and a beautiful woman stepped out. Then another, and another, and another... They walked out one after another, and in the end, a total of 12 beautiful women had walked out. They then kneeled down and used their bodies to form a staircase.

Only then did a man walk out from the carriage. He stepped on the backs of the beautiful women as he walked down to the ground.

“Motherf*cker!” The old ginseng was instantly triggered, and he shouted, “Even Grandpa Ginseng doesn’t have so many beautiful women to attend to him. This brat is far too arrogant! Little Han, help Grandpa Ginseng pummel him!”
