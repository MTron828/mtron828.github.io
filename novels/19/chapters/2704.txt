2705 Rescue

This was also because these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates lacked intelligence, or they would not have clashed head-on with Ling Han, but chosen to adopt a moving-about strategy as well as mutually supported each other. While the strength of such 10 people might still not suppress Ling Han, it would at least allow them to stay undefeated.

But now, 10 great Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were slain as easily as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, and the only price was the mouthful of blood Ling Han spat out.

“Brother Ling… you really are extraordinary!” Previously, Du Shiyi had always called Ling Han by his name as he himself was at the Ninth Heaven, while Ling Han was only at the Eighth Heaven. However, since Han was similarly at the Ninth Heaven now, Du Shiyi had completely acknowledged Ling Han as an existence of the same level.

Moreover, Ling Han’s strength far exceeded his own—even though helped by the Divine Demon Sword, Ling Han’s strength could not be denied.

Ling Han chuckled, and put away the Divine Demon Sword.

“Brother Du, what’s going on?” Ling Han asked.

Du Shiyi’s expression became solemn. “A’mu and the others are still trapped in the mountain, we have to hurry and rescue them!”

He paused, and then smacked his forehead. “My head’s all muddled because of the urgency. Let me start from the beginning.”

The matter was very simple. More than 200,000 years ago, the three of them came here for a training trip, attempting to find an opportunity for breakthrough. After tens of thousands of years of bloody battles, they had gotten some inspiration, but there were still some deficiencies.

During this period, they had also met some people, who fought with them together in battles.

That was until 100,000 years ago, when they accidentally discovered an ancient cave, and took the risk to venture inside. Unfortunately, the outcome was that not only did they not find any natural treasures, they poked a hornet’s nest.

…Inside, there were countless Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates in seclusion, and under the order of a mysterious person, many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were awakened, and proceeded to completely besiege them.

Fortunately, Du Shiyi and the others had made a lot of preparations before they had come here to train. They even possessed Heavenly-Venerable-Tier defensive treasures, but still couldn’t kill their opponents to escape from the siege. This hardship lasted for 100,000 years, and they had almost exhausted the Heavenly-Venerable-Tier treasures.

They had no choice but to forcefully break through the encirclement.

It was obviously unrealistic for everyone to escape together. Since Du Shiyi was the fastest, the others covered for him so he could break through the siege, hoping that he could escape to the Martial Academy, and bring the powerful Heavenly Venerate here to flatten this place and rescue them while they were at it.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Where is the exact location?”

Du Shiyi pressed a finger onto Ling Han, and transmitted to him the entire route which he had taken to escape.

Ling Han thought for a while. “Brother Du, you should rush back to the Martial Academy to report the news. I’ll think of a way to rescue A’mu and the others. No matter how bad is the situation, I will delay them for a while until the arrival of reinforcements.”

Ling Han didn’t commit to taking care of everything, because he knew better—if Desolate Moon were to bring out all the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, there ought to be tens of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates hidden in the volcano.

With so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates attacking together, even a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate might not be able to handle it.

Ling Han couldn’t be sure, because he had no idea how powerful the battle prowess of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate could be.

“Brother Ling…” Du Shiyi objected instinctively. How could he let Ling Han fall into danger? “You should go to the Martial Academy to report the news, and I will go back and fight side by side with A’mu and the others.”

“Which one of us is stronger?” Ling Han said with a smile.

Du Shi opened his mouth, but was at a loss for words. After a while, he nodded.

“Brother Ling, you must be cautious, don’t put yourself in danger. I will definitely come back as soon as possible,” he said with a serious expression.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded.

Du Shiyi glanced at Ling Han again, took a deep breath, and set out.

It wasn’t appropriate to remain in this place for a long time, as it was already extremely dangerous in the first place. Should there be another wave of pursuers, he would definitely be finished.

Ling Han went back first to meet up with the large black dog and Wally.

“What, you are going to save those people?” The large black dog jumped up immediately after hearing this. “Brat, don’t think that you can run amok fearlessly just because you are impressive, awesome, and strong! That’s tens of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates! If everyone throws a punch, you will probably be beaten flat even if you have successfully cultivated the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique.”

Tens of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, this was something that was impossible to appear in the Celestial Realm, and the large black dog could not imagine how powerful this force would be.

Ling Han smiled. “Don’t worry, I won’t act recklessly. I will play it by ear.”

The large black dog tried to persuade him again, but Ling Han just wouldn’t listen.

“Damn dog, I heard from Du Shiyi that there might be Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone in that cave!”

The large black dog immediately stopped persuading. Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone was the key to whether they could achieve cultivation of the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique, so he really had no way to refuse.

“You and Wally leave first,” Ling Han said.

Even if he didn’t mention it, the large black dog didn’t plan on staying here, and this was the case for Wally as well. The latter had always positioned himself as one meant for an analytical type of battle, and when it came to activities such as combat, he had never wanted to participate in them.

Ling Han set off and walked towards the depths of the volcano.

With the guidance of Du Shiyi’s route, he naturally didn’t have to take any deviating paths. It only took a day when he came to the place, and saw a hole in the mountain wall where lava was flowing down, covering most of it. If one did not observe carefully, one would definitely not be able to find it.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, strode in, and the lava hit his body, all of it blocked by the golden seals, unable to touch his body.

Inside this cave, there was crimson magma flowing everywhere, and filled with supreme Regulations of Fire, there wasn’t even any breathable air. Although Ling Han no longer needed to breathe air, due to habit, he still felt a little uncomfortable. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There was no need to worry about the issue of lighting. The flowing of magma in this place illuminated the surroundings brightly.

Ling Han strode forward. The cave was eerily quiet, with only the sound of magma flowing, which was very faint.

There were many protruding stones on the wall of the cave, some of which were very sharp, with magma attached to them. If one was to get scratched by these, it was likely to pierce the body, and supreme Regulations of Fire would be injected, which would instantly put to death even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

It wasn’t only on the wall of the cave, but also on the ground, which was even more terrifying. If one was to step on them, the whole person might just be reduced to ashes in an instant.

Ling Han didn’t dare to be arrogant. After all, he had yet to achieve cultivation of the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique, and even if his body was to be like Divine Metal, it might also be burned and melted away. This was originally a place where Divine Metal could be melted.

He moved forward cautiously, and suddenly came to a wide clearing after walking for a while.

Once again, he saw a familiar scene. On the spacious flat ground, there lay a number of “giant eggs” surrounded by rays of black light. This place was actually extremely hot, but seeing these gigantic eggs actually caused a cold chill to rise up in one’s body.

As expected, Desolate Moon actually brought those Celestial Kings here, and continued to communicate with Hysteria, whose whereabouts were still unknown, while transmitting great power.

A’mu and others were not found here.

Looking at these giant eggs, Ling Han thought of a risky idea.

…With the power of the Divine Demon Sword, could it cut open the “giant egg” and send the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate inside it to hell?

Now that these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate were in a state of “seclusion,” and lacked the ability to fight back, even hundreds of millions of them would just be like trash, let alone tens of thousands.

With this thought in mind, he could bear it no longer.

He took out the Divine Demon Sword, came up to a giant egg, and slashed it with the sword without hesitation.

Pu!

Previously, he had not been able to break this giant egg no matter what he tried, yet now it had been sliced up so easily with a strike of the Divine Demon Sword.
