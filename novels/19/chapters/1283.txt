1284 We“ll Battle Another Day

The thought process of the members of the Five Sects was extremely simple. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was only at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, so they would definitely be able to contain her—if not suppress her—if enough of them charged over.

However, their understanding of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was restricted to what they knew about her several thousand years ago.

At that time, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had chosen to go into seclusion after deciding that she had already repaid the Cloud Phoenix Sect. Back then, she had only been at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

Many years had now passed, and the Five Sects all knew that she had already advanced to the consummate level. However, they speculated that she was at most at the early stage or middle stage. After all, the higher one’s cultivation, the harder it would be to advance.

In reality, however, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had already reached the peak stage of the consummate level. Not only that, but she was even a four-star genius!

Even ordinary cultivators at the peak stage of the consummate level wouldn’t be able to withstand a single strike of hers, so how could cultivators below the peak stage stand up to her?

Wails of agony reverberated around the areas that had been engulfed by the flaming phoenix. The members of the Five Sects clasped their heads as they fled, and even a few elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier stumbled back in retreat, not daring to face her attacks head-on.

‘What can we do?

‘We can’t even deal with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, so how are we going to capture Ling Han?’

“Why are the reinforcements still not here?” an elder asked angrily.

This was a nonsensical question.

Right now, numerous members of the Five Sects were scattered all over the Two Realm Battlefield, searching for Ling Han. It would definitely take longer than two days to notify all of them. After they were notified, they would still need to hurry back.

Anyhow, they were unable to capture Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden even with such a huge advantage in numbers. Thus, the elder was naturally beside himself with fury.

However, Zhang Heng suddenly stopped attacking, and asked, “Is this your full strength?”

“No,” Ling Han replied with a shake of his head. He still hadn’t taken full advantage of his powerful physique yet, nor had he used his freakish recovery ability. Moreover, he still had the Misty Soul Capturing Flower—although it would most likely be useless against Zhang Heng.

In any case, he still had many more trump cards. At least he still hadn’t started to ingest alchemical pills yet.

Zhang Heng looked up at the sky. He was indeed enjoying an advantage at this moment. However, he was unable to suppress Ling Han no matter what he did. His opponent was astonishingly resilient, and he could easily take everything that he threw at him.

He nodded, and said, “From today onward, I’ll travel the world in search of a Sword Dao that truly belongs to me. The day that I achieve Great Accomplishment is the day that I’ll come back to challenge you. I hope you’re still alive at that time!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Fine! If you don’t find me here, you can go to the Great Ling Empire of the Joint Peace Planet. That’s my territory.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” Zhang Heng said with a nod. He sheathed his sword before turning around and leaving. He appeared especially relaxed and carefree.

“Zhang Heng!” the higher-ups of the Five Sects roared in fury. Why was there another traitor among them? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You people should thank him for keeping your inheritances alive! After all... all of you will be killed by me!”

“Brat, you’re merely riding on the coattail of a woman! What is there to be smug about?” one of the mighty figures roared. He wanted to provoke Ling Han and anger him into asking the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden to stand aside.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “If you want, you can also ride on the coattail of a woman. I don’t mind at all!”

‘F*ck!’

The members of the Five Sects all seethed with anger. The key point was that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had been one of them before! Yet, she had now defected to Ling Han. How could they not grit their teeth in anger?

Ling Han’s expression suddenly became cold, and he said, “I’ve come to collect some interest today!”

If these people had cultivated normally, how could they have reached the Sun Moon Tier at such a young age? They had definitely ingested Realm Pills!

He would kill them without mercy!

Ling Han charged over, snapping his fingers as he did so.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Bursts of Sword Qi rained down on his enemies.

“Aaah!” Swathes of disciples instantly collapsed to the ground. Many of them weren’t at the consummate level yet, so how could they withstand such a devastating attack? They were dead before they had even hit the ground.

The elders were enraged. They tried to rush toward Ling Han to protect their disciples, yet the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden beat her wings and flew over, sending searing flames through the air. The elders had no choice but to stop and battle her with their full strength.

After a few seconds, the disciples of the Five Sects all became corpses on the ground. The elders were the only remaining survivors.

Ling Han stopped attacking. Although the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had already split with the Five Sects, it was clear that she still hadn’t steeled her heart to kill them. Ling Han didn’t want to pressure her into killing them, either. However, he wasn’t strong enough to kill these elders himself, so he naturally stopped attacking.

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said as he wrapped his arm around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s willowy waist. She shuddered slightly, and a deep blush appeared on her beautiful face.

“Hiss!” The little beast in her lap bared its teeth at Ling Han as if it were feeling threatened. This man was trying to steal its woman!

“What are hissing for?!” Ling Han flicked the little beast’s head, causing it to clasp its head and groan in pain.

“Don’t bully him!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said unhappily.

‘Fine, my yearning of 10,000 years is no match for a little beast’s acting cute for a few hours. What a failure!’

Ling Han glared at the little beast, and thought, ‘When I reunite with Rabbit and the old ginseng, I’ve got to persuade them to kill this little beast. We’ll enjoy a delicious Netherworld beast meal!’

This little beast actually dared to target his wife!

Ling Han’s glare caused a cold chill to shoot up the little beast’s spine. It couldn’t help but shudder.

Meanwhile, the elders from the Five Sects were seething with rage. ‘So be it if you two have turned the tables. However, is there really any need for you to act all lovey-dovey in front of us? Just how little do you think of us?’

However, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was indeed like a lofty mountain that couldn’t be overcome. If they wanted to resist her, they would need a genuine great elite. The few of them... were far from enough.

They could only look on wide-eyed as Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden disappeared into the distance. Without enough elites, there was no way they could contain the two of them.

However, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden waved goodbye to Ling Han after accompanying him a short while. She had used up all of her holidays, and thus she had to return to the army encampment. She was a soldier, after all, so her freedom to come and leave would naturally be restricted.

She would obviously regain her freedom if she left the army, but the threat of the Xie Clan meant that the Purple Moon Army was probably the safest place for her to be. Otherwise, she could only stay in Ling Han’s Black Tower. However, this would similarly restrict her freedom.

The little beast was naturally taken away by the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Anyhow, even if she had been willing to give it to Ling Han, it was very likely that the little beast wouldn’t have dared to follow him. He was someone who might kill and make it into a stew at any time.

Ling Han continued to wander around. He had received the blessing of heaven and earth after opening the sky, and this blessing was finally displaying its usefulness at this moment. He was able to find Realm Spirit Stone after Realm Spirit Stone. Moreover, there was a certain pattern to his discoveries: it would be extremely easy for him to find Realm Spirit Stones in areas where the Regulations of the Immortal Realm were dominant. On the contrary, he hadn’t found a single Realm Spirit Stone in the areas where the Regulations of the Netherworld were dominant.

This made a lot of sense. The blessing of heaven and earth that he had received had come from the Immortal Realm. In other words, it had nothing to do with the Netherworld. Thus, in areas where the Regulations of the Netherworld were dominant, his luck was no different from other ordinary people’s.

After discovering this, Ling Han tried his best to search through the areas where the Regulations of the Immortal Realm were dominant. Sure enough, he was able to find more and more Realm Spirit Stones. In just a month, he had already managed to find nine Realm Spirit Stones. Although they were only as large as a pinky, the fact that he had found so many was still astounding.

After some days, he finally reunited with Rabbit and the old ginseng. While they were strolling through the battlefield, the earth suddenly started to tremor as if some mountain had collapsed.

“F*ck! It’s the Netherworld army!”

An army appeared before them, and it consisted of at least 10,000 soldiers, the weakest of them at the Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, there were at least 100 Heavenly Body Tier elites.

‘Is the Netherworld seeking an all-out war?’
