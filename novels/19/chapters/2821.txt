“Humph!” Zhuang Feirui reached out, and tried to grab the stunning beauty.

Peng!

The stunning beauty gave a light wave of her hand, yet it caused a surge of incomparably terrifying power, and Zhuang Feirui was sent flying and became a small dot in an instant, vanishing from sight.

Everyone gaped and was speechless, as if they had seen a ghost.

!!

This had to be fake, right?

Zhuang Feirui was already so powerful, having suppressed seven Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates solely with his own strength. However, when faced with this stunning beauty, he wasn’t her match at all.

This woman… What kind of monster was she?

Ling Han was also taken aback. He had known that this woman had been extremely strong, but he had never imagined her to be this strong.

Although she has achieved such a feat, this stunning beauty didn’t seem to care, as if she was just brushing off some dust. Instead, she glanced around, and her gaze locked on Ling Han very quickly.

Ling Han suddenly felt like he was a mouse being watched by a cat, which caused him to feel a cold chill running through his body.

This woman was indeed too strong.

“Why sneak around?” the woman said, and made a gesture of invitation towards the revolving doorway of light.

Ling Han was surprised. ‘Aren’t you afraid that I’ll get my hands on the Heavenly Venerable Seal first before you do?’

However, when the other party had already invited him in such a manner, how could he bring himself to back down?

He took large strides and walked towards the doorway of light.

Zhuang Feirui flew back from a distance. Immediately, he gritted his teeth, and said, “Ling Han…!” He was a Fourth Tier, and he could see through Ling Han’s disguise at a glance.

He wanted to make a move, but when the stunning beauty turned her gaze towards him, it caused him to come to a halt.

The opponent was at the peak of the Fourth Tier, and was even more freakish than him. There was no telling how many Powers of Dimensions she had condensed; it was definitely not something he could match.

If he was to step forward to battle, he would be bringing humiliation upon himself.

Damn it, there was a Heavenly Venerable Seal this man possessed, which Zhuang Feirui absolutely had to get his hands on. Moreover, Ling Han also caused his reputation to hit rock bottom. If he couldn’t kill Ling Han, it would be a stigma that would follow him for life.

Ling Han walked over with a smile, and said, “Miss, do you intend to compete with me?”

Unexpectedly, the stunning beauty actually nodded. “That’s right.”

“Okay,” Ling Han boldly agreed. A woman like herself actually possessed such a gallant spirit; she obviously could have driven him away, or at least grabbed the first opportunity, but instead gave him a chance to compete fairly.

If Ling Han hadn’t even dared to accept the challenge, then he would have been a man in vain.

The two stepped forward together. Xiu, they entered the doorway of light.

As soon as this stunning beauty left, everyone finally came back to their senses, and relaxed themselves after being in the midst of that extremely oppressive aura.

“This woman… Who was she really?” someone murmured.

“She’s extremely formidable indeed, being able to send even a first-rate prodigy such as Zhuang Feirui flying with a single palm strike.”

“Is there really such a person in the world?”

The oppressive atmosphere gradually disappeared, and everyone was full of curiosity about who such a powerful woman was.

“Do you really want to know who she is?” someone suddenly said leisurely.

Immediately, everyone’s gaze turned in the direction of the voice. Even Zhuang Feirui was no exception, as he really wanted to know the identity of this woman.

“She is Lin Youlian!”

Gasp!

Everyone gasped. If Zhuang Feirui was only the number one prodigy of his era, then Lin Youlian was the greatest prodigy of all time. Only Xin Qihu could rival her. Of course, there was another Wu Haoyang after him.

In comparison, Zhuang Feirui was absolutely nothing.

“Lin Youlian!”

“I didn’t expect that not only is her strength earth-shattering, even her appearance is so beautiful as well.”

“If I could take her as my wife…” Someone began to let their imagination run wild.

“The greatest prodigy of all eternity. She truly lives up to the name!”

Even Zhuang Feirui had nothing further to say. Lin Youlian wasn’t merely of a slightly higher level than him, but also far superseded him in terms of natural talent for cultivation. What else could he do besides resigning himself to the situation when faced with such an existence?

Who would be capable of having such a beautiful prodigy in his embrace?

Zhuang Feirui stepped out and entered the doorway of light without hesitation.

His natural talent and strength were indeed not as good as Lin Youlian’s, but great opportunities weren’t something one could definitely obtain by being strong.

***

Ling Han found himself in a plain again, but the stunning beauty was nowhere to be seen.

This was within the spiritual world, so it was normal not to have the existence of the other party. The bodies of both parties should be in the hall right now.

There was a flag in the plain, with only one word written on it: defend.

Ling Han knew that this was Black Tortoise Palace, so the test had to be related to defense.

What could it be?

‘Hmm?’

A feeling of danger suddenly tugged at his heart. All of a sudden, he looked up and saw a large stretch of meteors falling from the sky, smashing towards him.

It was really a massive stretch, covering the entire area. There was nowhere to hide. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Han hastened to use the Fists of Fury, blasting towards the sky.

...

Peng, peng, peng, the meteors were shattered into pieces. These pieces were shattered before they fell onto him.

The first round of attacks had been perfectly resolved.

However, right on the heels of the earlier attack, another large wave of meteors came crashing down, this time with even more force.

Ling Han thought of the test at Vermillion Bird Hall. He knew that these attacks would increase in level gradually, in search of his limit, and then would start bombarding wildly within the scope of his limit—this was the real test.

He easily resolved this wave, but after several waves of meteors falling, he was also being pushed to his limit.

At this time, even if he blasted with Fists of Fury, there was no way for him to completely resolve the situation. Furthermore, there were great numbers of meteors crashing down violently, which forced him to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to take the attack head-on.

This was the main idea of Black Tortoise Palace’s test: to take on a beating!

Hong, long, long, more meteors fell, turning into an endless catastrophe.

Ling Han had noble ideals, and he didn’t believe that he couldn’t stop it.

‘Come!’

Meteors turned into a rain of meteors, coming wave after wave, and requiring him to go all out in resistance.

...

In the face of such an attack, Ling Han was not qualified to fight back, so he could only channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. However, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was only created by a First Tier, and had huge limitations. Then again, what could be better than the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll as far as defense was concerned?

While taking on the beating, Ling Han was also comprehending and improving the deficiencies in the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to adapt it to his current battle prowess.

Hong, long, long, the meteor rain seemed to never stop, one wave after another intending to blast Ling Han to pieces.

This was the most annoying part. If one could know how many waves one would need to bear to end it, then at least there would still be hope, but what about now? It could be over right after the next wave, or it could be that one would have to bear tens of thousands of waves more, which was enough to make someone with a strong willpower give up.

Ling Han gritted his teeth and continued to persevere. This wasn’t a battle, but rather taking a beating, which wasn’t in line with his path of cultivation, but for the sake of the Heavenly Venerable Seal and all the more to test his resilience, he was unwilling to back down.

As time passed, Ling Han continued to deepen his study of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, but this Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll wasn’t created by him, and it was improving far from as quickly as Fists of Fury.

This time, what Ling Han really depended on was his willpower. He kept roaring as meteors hit him one after another. It really hurt.

1,000 years, 10,000 years, 100,000 years!

It was not until 300,000 years had passed that Ling Han suddenly felt his whole body relax, and then found himself appearing in another place.

He had passed the test!

At the same time, a strong aura immediately arose from his surroundings, just like a violent storm.

Lin Youlian had also passed the test.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be filled with admiration. Such a stunning beauty could also withstand the bombardment of 300,000 years; her willpower was truly amazing.
