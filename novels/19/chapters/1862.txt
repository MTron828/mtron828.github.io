Chapter 1863: Using strength to deliver a slap in the face

But with this explanation from Cheng Fengyun, the people around all nodded.

That was right. Previously, Shantian Wu had been too arrogant, and that was why he had been targeted. He had been ganged up on by the joined forces of over 100 people, and was instantly cleared off the stage. And now, though there were only over 60 people left here, Ling Han was only one person too.

One against 60, how was he supposed to fight?

True enough, when they discovered how strong Ling Han was, the people around him all set their eyes on him, all of them like vicious wolves. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Only after working together to get rid of the strongest would relatively weaker people like them have a chance to stand out.

‘Since you have cropped up, we’ll beat you up first.’

The over 60 people all surrounded him. The majority had drawn their weapons, and Regulations flickered, connecting with great dao. Multiple pillars of light shot into the skies, presenting an astonishing sight.

A pack of wolves could devour a tiger; even if the tiger was fierce, so what?

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “Watch your feet.”

F***, why was it this phrase again?

The middle-aged man that had not walked too far couldn’t help but feel as if he had stepped on empty space, and almost stumbled onto the ground. This phrase had already become a nightmare for him.

“Charge!” The over 60 people made their move. Some shot down from the skies, while some swept outwards. Some even tunneled into the ground, unleashing their attacks from beneath the ground. It was a three-dimensional coverage of 360 degrees, without any gaps at all.

Who could block this kind of attack?

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and pressed down lightly. Pa, pa, pa, pa. Everyone felt their body become heavy, and involuntarily fell on the ground. Then, they couldn’t move, and those that had tunneled underground were forcefully seized out of the ground, and similarly affixed on the ground.

Then, the weapons in their hands all fell, landing on their respective feet.

“Ah!” A series of painful cries rang out. There was definitely not a single exception among the 60-odd people. Even if they did not have a weapon in hand, an ice spike would still poke out of the ground, and bore a hole open in their foot.

Previously, though it had been a comical farce, it had not drawn the attention of so many people. After all, there were too many battles that were being simultaneously held, and everyone’s eyes had too many things to see. This place was only slightly amusing, and was not especially exciting.

But the unfolding of this scene finally drew the attention of a great many people.

Everyone’s eyes were focused on Ling Han. It was as if he was exuding a glow that exclaimed how awesome he was all of a sudden.

Meanwhile, a dead silence had fallen on the area Cheng Fengyun was in. A considerable number suppressed their amusement with much difficulty.

You just said that he was showing off too much, and would be in big trouble when he was being targeted by the masses, but he immediately used his strength to deliver a slap straight to your face.

Just see, he had gained a great victory amidst cheerful talk and laughter.

Cheng Fengyun’s expression was incredibly embarrassed. This slap to his face had come too fast, making him feel ashamed and unable to show his face. However, he immediately humphed, and said, “Even if he can emerge victorious from this set, he couldn’t possibly go too far, either. This time, who knows how many top-grade prodigies have come for the sake of the Dao Regulating Pill. Even if he can pass this round, he will not be able to pass the next.”

He paused for a while, and then continued, “To say the least, even if he really enters into the finals... heh, there is still Lord Zhao Qingfeng. In this world, who could be a worthy match for Lord Zhao Qingfeng?”

A great many people did not know who Zhao Qingfeng was, but felt that Cheng Fengyun’s words were logical. Merely emerging victorious from this set really did not mean much.

Ling Han was strong, but there were too many elites here.

A great many sets had actually long since ended their battles, and those victors gazed at Ling Han with eyes filled with challenge, and then withdrew their gazes.

For king tiers, it was naturally only a matter of course for them to emerge victorious from this kind of small set, and Ling Han had actually spent such a long time to end the battle; it was imaginable how “weak” he was.

He was not worthy of their notice!

Ling Han naturally would not take the thoughts of others to heart. When a recorder had taken note of his index number, he clapped his hands and left. The next battle would be held tomorrow.

Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden descended from the spectators’ seats, and joined Ling Han. The two of them walked out of the arena together.

However, they had just exited when they saw Shantian Wu was presently standing guard at the doors, sticking out his head and looking around.

When he discovered Ling Han, Shantian Wu immediately leaped up, and pointed at Ling Han. “Guys, thrash him!”

He hated Ling Han very much. Thus, after he had been disqualified, he waited at the exit. No matter what, he was going to teach Ling Han a harsh lesson.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. This guy actually delivered himself up to be beaten. Not bad, he was quite enlightened.

“Brat, you can actually still laugh?” Shantian Wu did not see how Ling Han had shown his might. Otherwise, if he had known that the 60-odd people had all been defeated by Ling Han in an instant, then what were over the dozen of them worth? They weren’t even enough to be considered as an appetizer for Ling Han.

“Why wouldn’t I be able to laugh?” Ling Han asked.

“You will know why immediately!” Shantian Wu smirked coldly, and waved his hand. “Thrash him as hard as you can. Thrash him so hard that even his mother would not be able to recognize him!”

“Yes, Young Master!” The more than dozen people all charged over.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Watch your feet.”

Those people naturally did not know this amusing joke, and though they did feel curious, they did not take it to heart, and still charged towards Ling Han.

“Ah!” However, in a mere instant, they all screamed out in pain. That was because the weapons in their hands had all landed on their feet for some reason. One of them was wielding a battle ax, and the landing of this strike had chopped off his entire instep.

Shantian Wu couldn’t help but take two steps back, an expression of horror appearing on his face. This scene had scared him out of his wits.

“I already told you guys to watch your feet.” Ling Han smiled slightly. “Come, all of you go and thrash that ugly guy so hard that even his own mother wouldn’t be able to recognize him!”

Those people all exchanged looks. That was their young master; would they dare to make a move on him?

Ling Han slowly said, “You guys want to watch your feet again?” The might of a king tier spread out, causing them to shiver and tremble in fear.

The group of over a dozen people felt their hearts clench, and immediately turned around, setting their eyes on Shantian Wu.

“You people, what do you all want to do!?” Shantian Wu’s face had turned green from fright. Why were these people’s eyes so vicious?

Ling Han coughed lightly, and the over a dozen people immediately pounced towards Shantian Wu. With a large commotion, they all gave him a severe thrashing.

Though Shantian Wu had some strength, he was still some distance away from the level of prodigy. Being able to charge up to the Severing Mundane Tier was just barely achieved through his clan having sacrificed innumerable resources. How could he possibly match the ganging up of over a dozen elites that were the same level as he? He was immediately beaten so harshly that he did not even look human anymore.

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden exchanged a smile, and strode off. This was only a minor episode.

The night passed, and they had come once more to the arena to begin the second day of the tournament.

However, they were stopped before even managing to enter this time.

It was Shantian Wu again.

His head was wrapped in bandages, so his entire head appeared very swollen. After all, he had been beaten by over a dozen people for very long, especially on his head, and even if there were miraculous medicines to treat him, his head would still be incredibly swollen. It was impossible that the swelling would go down in a short period of time.

“Brother, that’s him!” This time, Shantian Wu had not brought too many people. Instead, there was only a young man that had features similar to his.

This man’s name was Shantian Jiu, and he was the older brother of Shantian Wu.

Shantian Jiu slanted a sideways glance at Ling Han, a sinister smile curling up his lips as he said, “Break your arms and your legs. Otherwise, even in Alchemy City, there is no way you can live for more than three days!”
