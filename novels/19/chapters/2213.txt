Chapter 2214: Who had helped?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Seventh Refinement was relatively rare even among Four-Star Grandmasters.

However, for a Four-Star Grandmaster to concoct a Three-Star alchemical pill, and had cast Seventh Refinement on it at that, that person was too idle, wasn’t he?

“I concocted it,” Ling Han said smilingly. He had done him a huge favor, so he did not mind revealing some of his trump cards to the other party.

Shi Chanzi was even more astonished.

If Ling Han was only a Four-Star Grandmaster—or even a Five-Star Alchemist—he would not have taken it to heart too much. After all, he was a supreme monarch tier, and would definitely be capable of becoming a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future. In that case, was there any need for him to be concerned about a Five-Star Alchemist Grandmaster?

But Ling Han had another identity. He, too, was a supreme monarch tier that had attained Dividing Nine Souls.

That was terrifying—the world actually had such a prodigy!

“Han Lin, I have underestimated you,” Shi Chanzi stated calmly.

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “How is Hong Huang’s battle prowess?”

“Very strong!” Shi Chanzi looked solemn, and then smiled. “However, he has also been blasted by my Eternity Tap, so his injuries are definitely not lighter than mine.”

This smile was filled with confidence and pride.

It looked like this monk had not yet been freed from human desires and passions, and was still filled with ambition and competitiveness.

Eternity Tap?

Ling Han suddenly recalled that when he had joined forces with Ji Wuming previously against Yulan Fenghua, Ji Wuming had used a secret technique that caused Yulan Fenghua’s expression to change drastically, and he also exclaimed the words “Eternity Tap.”

Could it be that Ji Wuming had some relation with Shi Chanzi?

He was struck with a brain wave, and said, “It was Ji Wuming who asked you to help!”

He said these words with a tone of certainty.

Shi Chanzi faltered slightly, and then smiled. “I never thought you would have guessed it so quickly.”

Thoughts flew in Ling Han’s mind. Ji Wuming was a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but his identity before reincarnation had been guessed by Shu Yarong and Tang Minglong, yet Ling Han did ot have the slightest idea.

…This extremely violent and murderous guy, Ji Wuming, was actually a member of the Buddhist Sect!

Hold on, there were only a total of three Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings that had emerged from the Buddhist Sect, but two of them had been overseeing the Buddhist Sect all this while, and only the founder of the Buddhist Sect, the Ninth Heaven Celestial King, was rumored to have vanished. However, no one knew if he had actually died, or was presently cultivating in seclusion somewhere.

Now, he should be able to confirm: Ji Wuming was the reincarnation of the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha!

No wonder. Now that the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha had spoken, Shi Chanzi would naturally do as he commanded. This was a command from his ancestor.

“Hehe, with this Time Immemorial Pill, the recovery time for my injuries would be sped up by about a month or so, estimated,” Shi Chanzi laughed loudly. “Then, I will go and find Hong Huang for another spar, and drive him crazy.”

Their strength was equal, and previously neither side had won. However much time Shi Chanzi needed to recover, Hong Huang would probably need around the same amount of time.

Yet now that Shi Chanzi had a Seventh Refinement Time Immemorial Pill, his recovery time would be greatly expedited. When he sought out Hong Huang for another battle, should the latter accept or refuse the challenge?

If he accepted, he would definitely be defeated in battle. If he refused, Shi Chanzi would mock him.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile as well. Hong Huang had bullied him, and he was still unable to avenge himself at present, so he was glad to have Shi Chanzi use this kind of method to cause Hong Huang some displeasure. Furthermore, there was also some of Ling Han’s contribution to it, so it could be considered that he had avenged himself slightly.

Ji Wuming was really an interesting character. He clearly would be able to match Hong Huang himself, yet chose to delegate the task to Shi Chanzi. Was this deliberately done so that Ling Han would not have to be grateful to him?

Ling Han shook his head. Ultimately, a great battle would break out between himself and Ji Wuming, and he had a feeling that if a new Heavenly Venerate could emerge in this heaven and earth, then it would definitely be either himself or Ji Wuming.

No matter how strong Shi Chanzi, Hong Huang, and Jia Lan, whom he had not met, were, there was ultimately something they lacked, and Ling Han did not think that they could rise up above the rest.

Ling Han took the chance to ask Shi Chanzi about some matters of the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha, but Shi Chanzi behaved with great propriety. He was very upfront with whatever he should say, but he did not spit out a single word about whatever he shouldn’t.

After a long while, Ling Han’s understanding of the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha was still stuck on the level of legends that were known to outsiders.

He knew that Shi Chanzi would definitely not speak, and thus thanked him, and left the latter’s abode.

At present, six supreme monarch tiers had appeared in the academy, but there was no doubt that Ling Han and the Rain Emperor were the weakest. They had not yet crossed over into the Immortal Palace Tier, and were completely unqualified to stand off against Ji Wuming and the others.

“I should go and break through to the Immortal Palace Tier,” Ling Han murmured. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Like the Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier, breaking through to the Immortal Palace Tier would also require going to a specific location, but what was different was that breaking through to the Heaven Soul, Earth Soul, Yin Soul, and Yang Soul would require going to different places for all of them, and breaking through to the Severing Mundane Tier required going only once, and while Immortal Palace Tier was the same like Dividing Soul Tier, wherein one would have to go to an Immortal Palace Tier Mystery Realm every time they broke through to the next cultivation level, they could repeatedly go to the same location to completely construct all five Mystery Realms.

Thinking of this problem, Ling Han couldn’t help but ask Small Tower, “Is there some cultivation level above Fifth Secret of Immortal Palace Tier, like Fifth Severance or Dividing Nine Souls?”

“Hehe, and I thought you wouldn’t ask.” Small Tower laughed.

It seemed like this guy was treating him with disdain again.

Ling Han shook his head. “I knew that you would speak sharply. Did you think that you would hurt me with just a minor blow?”

Small Tower did not speak flippantly again, and said, “The Mystery Realms in the human body are not just limited to the five organs; there is a sixth organ.”

Ling Han faltered, and then gaped slightly. “What you mean is that there is a total of 11 minor levels in this cultivation level?” Dividing Soul Tier was already mad enough. One could only reach consummate level after cultivating nine minor levels, but the Immortal Palace Tier was even crazier as there was a total of 11.

“If your maths was passable, that would be right.” Small Tower did not forget to continue treating Ling Han with disdain. “However, there is no restriction of Immortal Palace Tier Mystery Realms, like you would have to go here for this cultivation level, and go there for that cultivation level, and there is no time limit to the time they are opened.”

It paused, and then continued, “You have the 10,000 times acceleration effects of the Black Tower, so it would not be very difficult for you to cultivate all 11 Mystery Realms fully… in probably just several billion years.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but be speechless. Several billion years? That was too long, wasn’t it?

Thankfully, the 10,000x acceleration effect of the Black Tower was indeed strong enough. After conversion, he would only need several tens of thousands of years in real time.

Counting off on his fingers, if even Immortal Palace Tier would need several tens of thousands of years, then how long would Ascending Origin Tier take? And there was also the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier—how many years more would he need to be qualified to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier? The invasion of the Foreign Realm was close at hand, or the heaven and earth would not have been so urgent, either. DId he have that much time?

Even so, there was no way that Ling Han would settle the matter just by cultivating five Mystery Realms.

Only if he had cultivated every single cultivation level to perfection would he have hope of breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Even if he was slightly remiss, it would be imperfect. Otherwise, Ji Wuming would not have needed to reincarnate and cultivate again right from the beginning.

“All right, I’ll study first how the first Mystery Realm is to be built.”

Immortal Palace Tier meant to construct Mystery Realms in one’s own body, but how was a Mystery Realm to be constructed? They would have to go to a natural Mystery Realm and be enlightened, drawing on the power within to complete the construction.

Hu Yan, for example, had drawn on the Inextinguishable Burning Flame to refine his Heart into the first Mystery Realm inside the human body.

Ling Han’s situation was more special. There were too many Regulations that he had cultivated. Thus, he had to think about which Mystery Realm he should go to refine his own first Mystery Realm. Was every cultivation level the same or different?

“The best option is to use the Regulations of Time to temper. In that case, after building five Mystery Realms, your physique would also evolve into the Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique.” Small Tower paused, and then continued, “Then after refining the sixth organ, your physique would be improved further, becoming the Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique..”
