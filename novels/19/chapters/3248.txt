3249 Arriving at the Capital
Gu Xiangming was arrogant and conceited, but he wasn’t a fool. There was no way he would commit murder in front of Feng Ruoxian.

Moreover, he did not know the relationship between Ling Han and Feng Ruoxian. Even if he wanted to deal with Ling Han, he would have to find another opportunity.

“Brother Ling, don’t you need to pack up?” Feng Ruoxian looked at Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “We can set off at any time.”

He had almost used up all his jade seeds. The most valuable items in his possession were the broken sword, the jade-colored toad, and three formation foundations from the Ancient Dao Sect. These things could be easily packed.

“Alright.” Feng Ruoxian nodded and said to Gu Xiangming, “Captain Gu, let’s go.”

Gu Xiangming took another look at Ling Han, and then said, “Alright, Miss Ruoxian, please follow me.”

They filed out of the hotel. After leaving the hotel, there was a luxury car waiting for them at the door. This was arranged by Yu Yi.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at a huge plaza where more than ten warships were parked.

“Miss Ruoxian, over here.” Gu Xiangming pointed at a small warship in front of them. It was only 30 meters long and about 9 meters tall. There was a flag at the bow of the ship. This was the royal symbol of the Dark North Nation.

This flag was equivalent to a pass. No one would dare to stop them no matter where they went. Of course, if anyone dared to impersonate them, their heads would definitely be lost.

When they arrived at the warship, someone immediately put down the ladder. They boarded the ship, and Gu Xiangming arranged a place for them to stay.

Although the warship was not big, it was no problem for the few of them to stay in it. Furthermore, the room was very luxurious, as expected of a product of the royal family.

Gu Xiangming did not make things difficult for Ling Han on the issue of arranging rooms, and assigned him an especially poor room. He seemed to disdain using such a small trick to bully him, which prevented a conflict.

Otherwise, Ling Han would definitely disembark from the ship. What need was there for him to board this warship?

He really wanted to go to the Imperial Capital because the resources of the entire country were gathered in the Imperial Capital. As a High Level alchemist, he would definitely be able to showcase what he had learned in the Imperial Capital—to put it more realistically, he would be making a lot of money.

Soon, the warship took off and flew towards the capital.

Although the warship was small, it was extremely fast. There were also many formations on it, such as a concealment formation. It could not be seen from 9 meters away, preventing them from encountering powerful birds of prey in the air.

Even if they encountered one, the warship had also prepared a strengthened version of the Electromagnetic Cannon. Although it could not be charged and could only fire a few shots, it was enough to kill powerful Demonic Beasts of Extreme Bone Tier.

Thus, they did not encounter any Demonic Beasts along the way, and it took them 20 days to reach the Imperial Capital.

The warship’s speed was extremely fast.

Looking down from the sky, the Imperial Capital was like a sprawled out dragon. It was long and narrow. There was no need to get close. Just looking from the sky, one could tell that there were too many buildings shrouded in formations than could be counted.

If one landed rashly, they would definitely be destroyed by the formations.

In the Imperial Capital, where the dragon soared, the current Emperor had the ability to sweep through the world and no one could oppose him[1].

The warship landed and stopped at the Royal Harbor. There were warships of all sizes here, and the largest one was simply a giant. It was about 3,000 feet long, and one could almost not see the end of it.

The group disembarked from the warship. After walking out of the port, Gu Xiangming was about to bring Feng Ruoxian to the Imperial Palace. His Majesty was currently in seclusion, and the council head, Yang Bai, was in charge of the Zhenghe Hall, dealing with military affairs, with the princes assisting him.

Ling Han did not want to go to the Imperial Palace, so he said, “Butler Mu, Miss Feng, let’s part here.”

“Eh, aren’t you coming with us?” Feng Ruoxian asked.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “No, if it is fated, then we’ll meet again.”

After saving Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian, he had long repaid Butler Mu’s favor. Since Feng Ruoxian had safely arrived in the capital and he had also gotten a free ride, it was naturally time to say goodbye.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“If you encounter anything you can’t resolve, feel free to look for me,” Butler Mu said seriously. He naturally knew that he owed Ling Han even more.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Sure.”

He waved his hand and left with Sun Jianfang and Huan Xue.

Gu Xiangming saw this and sneered.

This kid was afraid of him, so he quickly slipped away. Unfortunately, this kid underestimated his strength. What would be so difficult about finding someone in the capital?

This was because he was the captain of the Imperial Guards. If he asked, it would be a serious matter that involved the royal family. Who would dare to not work hard to investigate?
Brat, you should hide first. I’ll settle the score with you later.

He did not stop them, and allowed Ling Han and the others to leave.

Ling Han didn’t bother to choose a specific direction. After walking for a while, he raised his head and discovered a hotel in front of him, so he said, “Sect Master Sun, let’s stay here for a few days first, then consider what we should do next.”

“Alright.” Sun Jianfang nodded.

They checked into a hotel, and the identity issue was easily resolved. This was because their information had long been recorded into the optical computer. They would not become unregistered just because they had ran out of Huju City.

After settling down, Ling Han began to think about what he should do next.

In general, it was very simple, and that was to increase his strength.

Only when he had sufficient strength would he not need to be concerned about the opinions of others. Furthermore, only then would he be able to release the empress and the others so he could reunite with his family and friends.

However, in terms of improving his strength, this goal was too vague. He had to be more specific and realistic.

“First of all, money is unavoidable for cultivation. I need to earn money.”

“Secondly, actually, this is the most important thing. I have to break through to the Blood Transformation Tier, or else everything will be for naught.”

“However, it’s been more than a month. Why haven’t I grasped the opportunity to break through?”

Ling Han was a little depressed. Logically speaking, with his talent, he shouldn’t have encountered any difficulties in the elementary levels of martial arts.

“Am I being too hasty?”

He asked Sun Jianfang for advice on how he had broken through to Blood Transformation Tier.

Sun Jianfang did not hide anything, but this kind of experience could only be used as a reference, and could not be used as a model. Thus, Ling Han still did not receive any substantial enlightenment.

He continued to immerse himself in his comprehension. He did not believe that he would be stuck at this level for too long.

Two days later, news of the beast tide in Huju City also spread throughout the capital. This was a major event. A large city in the empire had actually been overrun by Demonic Beasts, and they had even in fact dispatched General Hengtian to quell the chaos.

There were only four generals in the Majestic Empire, and each of them had outstanding strength. They were the kind that could slaughter a large city by themselves.

Therefore, this time, because it actually alarmed General Hengtian, it could be seen how serious the situation was.

Feng Zisheng’s name was also mentioned. He had sacrificed himself for the sake of justice. He was a classic hero that the Dark North Nation needed. Naturally, it was necessary to publicize his heroic deeds. There was even news that the royal family intended for a certain prince to marry Feng Ruoxian.

Ling Han was not interested in this. He wanted to know how many people had escaped from the city.

Very quickly, there was follow-up news. There had been quite a number of survivors. For example, the prodigy of martial arts, Tuoba Tianhuang, was escorted out by four Blood Transformation Tier elites of the Tuoba Clan. Because of this, the clan also lost two Blood Transformation Tier elites.

As well as the formations prodigy… Yan Jun!
