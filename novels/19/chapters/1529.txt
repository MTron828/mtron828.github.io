Chapter 1530 Sudden Arrival of a Sain

An intense battle broke out between the Empress and Cai Miao, and this battle was quickly taken into the sky.

Although there were the formations of Saints here, a battle between two Eternal River Tier elites—especially two whose battle prowess had reached the consummate level—would definitely be able to destroy all of these formations. Of course, if these formations hadn’t existed, then everything in the surroundings would have already been obliterated. In fact, this expanse of land would have become part of the sea.

Such a tremendous battle naturally attracted the attention of many people. The disciples all walked out from their residences and gazed up at the sky.

However, what they saw instantly caused cold sweat to form on their foreheads.

‘Incredible! This battle is far too incredible! Who is this? She’s actually able to rival a big shot?

‘Yu Susu?

‘No!’

Someone recognized the Empress, and they quietly revealed her identity. This information quickly spread among the disciples.

She was a newly recruited disciple!

The old disciples all became numb with shock upon hearing this.

What kind of freaks had the academy recruited this time? Gu Daoyi had possessed a Divine Fetus, and he had more so been regarded as the greatest prodigy of all eternity. In fact, he had even become a disciple of the Great Saint. After him, there was also Ling Han, a new disciple who was renowned as a troublemaker. He was someone who even dared to talk back to the Saint Missus.

At the same time, Ling Han also possessed astonishing strength. During the competition between new disciples, he had even managed to defeat Gu Daoyi. Moreover, many old disciples had also experienced defeat at his hands. It was rumored that even elites at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier mightn’t be able to suppress him.

However, regardless of their achievements, there was an indestructible bottom line in the minds of the old disciples: the big shots couldn’t be defeated.

Regardless of how freakish the new disciples were, they would have no option but to bow their heads before the four big shots. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Now, however, this final bottom line had also been obliterated.

Empress Luan Xing was battling against a big shot, and she was only at a very minor disadvantage.

‘How is this possible?!’

“It’s that brick!”

“That’s right! Through my careful observations, I’ve noticed that her brick possesses an incredibly powerful defensive ability. It’s as if it can absorb all attacks. Otherwise, that woman definitely couldn’t rival a big shot.”

“Even if that’s the case, she still possesses astonishing battle prowess. After all, she’s only at a minor disadvantage!”

“She’s also breathtakingly beautiful!”

“Heavens! How can there be such a stunningly beautiful person in the world! She’s so noble, and she’s so proud! In fact, even her angry expression is beautiful and intoxicating.”

Before this, the Empress had only revealed her appearance during the competition between the new disciples. As such, none of the old disciples had ever witnessed her appearance before. Now that they witnessed it, they were all stunned by her beauty. Moreover, they naturally shifted to supporting her instead of Cai Miao.

Of course, this was only in terms of the male students. Contrary to them, the female students were all wild with jealousy—they strongly desired for Cai Miao to ruin her beauty. However, the cultivation world was dominated by men, and the eighth campus was no exception to this phenomenon. There were only 30 or so female disciples in the entire eighth campus. Thus, they naturally couldn’t turn the tide of popular opinion.

Everyone was shouting in support of the Empress, not considering the fact that Cai Miao might settle matters with them one by one after this.

“Humph!” Zhu Xiu’er was enraged, and she humphed coldly as she unleashed her might as the Saint Missus. “Silence! Anyone who dares to utter another word will be expelled!”

To most people, the title of Saint Missus was still filled with might and power. Thus, the onlookers quickly shut their mouths. However, they still silently cheered for the Empress in their minds. The Saint Missus couldn’t forbid them from doing this, could she?

Meanwhile, Ling Han waved his hand at Mi Xueming, and said, “Come, Junior Brother Mi, let’s have a chat.”

This... This was blatant provocation!

An expression of wild fury spread across Zhu Xiu’er’s face. ‘You’re looking down on me far too much!’

However, she was truly helpless against Ling Han. After all, there were only so many people who could suppress him.

Could it be that she had to seek help from the Tranquil Heart Saint?

However, if he had wanted to greet her, he would have done so a long time ago. With the divine sense of a Saint, how could he have not detected her arrival? The fact that he hadn’t come over to greet her signified that he wanted to avoid her. Since this was the case, would she be able to find him?

Zhu Xiu’er felt extremely stifled. With her lofty status, she was actually unable to deal with a measly disciple of the academy?

Weng!

A saintly might rippled into the surroundings as the Tranquil Heart Saint unexpectedly appeared before the disciples.

Zhu Xiu’er couldn’t help but chuckle coldly, and say, “Tranquil Heart, how arrogant of you! I’ve been here for so long, yet you’re only coming here to greet me now?!”

The Tranquil Heart Saint ignored her accusations, frowning slightly as he gazed up at the sky.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. The Tranquil Heart Saint wasn’t faking his expression. However, what could cause a Saint to frown?

Weng!

A thick golden path suddenly descended from the sky, exuding a saintly might as it did so.

Another Saint had arrived!

In the blink of an eye, a figure walked out from among the dazzling golden path. It looked as if he were walking slowly, yet each stride of his could actually cover hundreds of millions of kilometers. Before the disciples knew it, he had already arrived inside the academy.

This was a tall and slim middle-aged man. His skin was pale, and there was the symbol of a rock between his brows.

“How should I address you, fellow cultivator?” the Tranquil Heart Saint asked. His tone was extremely solemn. Saints were the most powerful beings of the world. Even if this person were only a Small Saint, he would still possess the ability to kill everyone present if he went wild. Of course, this was apart from the 10 Saints.

However, the wife and son of the Star Sand Saint were present, so the Tranquil Heart Saint naturally didn’t dare to be careless.

The middle-aged man glanced at the Tranquil Heart Saint before replying, “I’m Hu Yingmu.”

“Fellow Cultivator Hu!” The Tranquil Heart Saint clasped his hands in greeting. “I’m Tranquil Heart. Dare I ask why you’ve suddenly come here?”

Hu Yingmu calmly glanced at him again, and said, “Several young members of the Hu Clan were killed, and through my deduction, I’ve concluded that their deaths are related to this place.”

He was here to seek revenge?

The Tranquil Heart Saint’s expression darkened, and he said, “Then you must investigate carefully! After all, a case involving human lives should be treated with utmost care!”

Hu Yingmu was unfazed by the Tranquil Heart Saint’s words. He swept his gaze over every single disciple. Under his gaze, the disciples all felt as if they were naked, with not a single secret able to remain hidden.

Only when the Tranquil Heart Saint humphed did he retract his gaze. “I’ve already discovered an ancient chariot on a nearby planet. That’s definitely not a chariot that you people can possess. From my deductions, someone here coincidentally came across the disciples of my Hu Clan after they obtained some treasures. They then attacked my disciples and ended up killing them.”

He paused for a moment before continuing, “My request is simple. Hand over the treasures and the culprit!”

The Tranquil Heart Saint chuckled coldly. ‘You’re acting far too arrogant! You suddenly arrived here, and now you’re asking for this and that? Do you think this is your territory? You’re only a Small Saint, yet there are 10 Saints guarding this planet! In fact, there’s even a Great Saint! There’s no room for you to act all smug and arrogant!’

“I have no obligation to satisfy your request!” the Tranquil Heart Saint said. He resolutely refuted Hu Yingmu’s request.

Hu Yingmu was just about to get angry, yet he suddenly saw Empress Luan Xing and Cai Miao descend from the sky at this moment. In fact, he had only managed to descend here because he had discovered the empress’ battle against Cai Miao. After all, they were extremely powerful Eternal River Tier elites.

He had been unfazed before, yet his eyes instantly lit up when he saw Empress Luan Xing.

The Empress’ beauty was definitely enough to capture the hearts of all men. Even Saints were no exception to this.

Saints were also human, just that they were slightly more powerful.

In any case, Hu Yingmu hadn’t cultivated so earnestly for some noble and lofty aim. Indeed, every single cultivator yearned to become a Genesis Tier Saint. However, this wasn’t their ultimate goal, and there was naturally a reason behind their desire.

Some people simply wanted to become more powerful, while others wanted to obtain a longer lifespan. Meanwhile, there were also those who desired to obtain more power, those who wanted freedom, and those who wanted beautiful women.

Hu Yingmu wasn’t that interested in women, but the Empress’ beauty was enough to capture his interest and shatter his self-control.

Moreover, as a Saint, he would naturally take whatever he wanted. He didn’t need to be afraid of anything or anyone.

As such, he reached over and wantonly grabbed at Empress Luan Xing.
