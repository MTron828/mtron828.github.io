3033 Shatter Mountains Arrives

With this as a reference, Ling Han might be able to discover more people with light spots.

The problem was that Ning Haixin had been extremely ordinary in the beginning. If not for Ling Han appearing, perhaps she would have died of depression long ago. How could she have had the chance to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier?

Furthermore, Celestial Kings and Ascending Origin Tiers could stand against someone two cultivation levels higher than them. This wasn’t too rare. There were plenty of prodigies who could do this.

Ling Han could only choose among Heavenly Venerates, but so far, there was only him and… Eh, Feng Wuding!

Feng Wuding was also like this?

Unfortunately, he was already dead, and his spirit had been shattered. It was useless even if Ling Han dug out his grave.

Ling Han felt that it was a pity. If he could obtain even more secret codes of life, his strength would definitely advance further.

This was because while the strength and level of a dimension were important, they also depended on the living beings in it. Why was it that the living beings of a certain dimension had to be destroyed first in a Realm War?

That was the logic.

‘Forget it, I’ll think of something in the future.’

Ling Han thought that perhaps his divine sense would become even stronger when he advanced to the Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier. With a single sweep, he would be able to encompass all the living beings in the entire dimension, easily accomplishing a full scan.

Next, Shatter Mountains should personally take action, right?

Ling Han sent Ning Haixin, the large black dog, and the others off, and waited alone for the arrival of Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

This time, he was going to have a good fight with Shatter Mountains. With the explosive power of his sixth-grade seals, he could suppress the other party for at least two hours.

Although it was a very short period of time, and it was impossible to kill him in such a short time, it was still a very satisfying thing.

He would collect some interest first. One day, he would suppress all five of those old thieves.

This time, it took a little too long. Only after a full 30 years did a powerful aura assail Ling Han. Peng, the entire inn instantly exploded and turned into ashes.

Even if Ling Han had already made his move, there was still no way to stop this. The power of the Seventh Tier was too strong.

Fortunately, the people in the inn had long since been driven out by Ling Han, and this did not cause any casualties among innocents.

Ling Han stood proudly in the sky, and calmly said, “Shatter Mountains, old thief, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

“As expected, it’s you, Junior!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains also stood in the sky, emitting an aura of dominance over the world, and causing even the heavens to lower their heads.

He looked at Ling Han levelly, and his heart was actually filled with emotion. This young man had only cultivated for a few years, and was already about to be on equal footing with him. This filled him with jealousy.

“You dare to cause trouble in my place of enlightenment? Looks like you’re tired of living!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Instead of working in the Realm Battlefield, why have you five old geezers run out to establish a place of enlightenment?”

“What does it have to do with you?” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said. He didn’t make a move, because he knew that he wouldn’t be able to do anything to Ling Han’s defense without Hysteria’s “help.” How could an existence like him do anything that would have no effect?

“There is no harm in telling me, right?” Ling Han said. “Could it be that you’re afraid?”

“What a joke, to think that you are trying to goad me, how naive!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains sneered.

Ling Han looked at Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, and pondered for a moment before saying, “Back when the Genesis World was destroyed, it was clearly a mysterious force that sealed those marks of life into your bodies. Why did you hide this matter?”

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ expression clearly changed, and his eyes exploded with blazing brilliance. “How did you know?”

“If you tell me what I want to know, I’ll tell you what you want to know,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains pondered for a moment, but immediately laughed coldly. “Since you don’t know the situation clearly, there’s nothing that I need to know, either. So what if you know some minor details? It doesn’t matter at all.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han was astonished. Where did this old thief get such confidence from?

‘Alright then, since you don’t want to say it, let’s fight!’

“Old thief, I’ve tolerated you for a long time. This time, I’ve specially come to beat you up!” Ling Han suddenly charged out.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains waved his sleeves in a flourish. “I don’t have time to waste with you!”

However, just as he was about to tear open a rip into space and leave, he realized that something was wrong. He had just torn open a rip into space, but now he had entered the Void.

Of course, this was Ling Han’s doing. If he did not send the other party into the Void, then after the battle began, the damage they would cause would be too terrifying, and it would cause huge damage to the Profound Negative Realm.

Although Ling Han had not gone to the Realm Battlefield, it was also impossible for him to drag the Genesis World down with him.

“Brat, scram!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was about to charge out of the Void. Fighting with Ling Han was truly meaningless.

“I said I’d beat you up, so how can I go back on my word?” Ling Han laughed loudly, and channeled all his sixth-grade seals. Power of Dimension surged madly, and he let out a long howl as he blasted towards Shatter Mountains.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains couldn’t even be bothered to parry, and wanted to escape even if he had to take a blow from Ling Han. However, after being struck by Ling Han’s attack, his figure instantly flew into the air, and he was forced back an unknown distance in the air.

Ling Han caught up, spread out his hands, and then brought them together.

Boundless power condensed and materialized, and two large hands appeared from the left and right side, ruthlessly slapping towards Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

Peng!

The Void shook, and Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was forcefully smashed to the point that he was as thin as a piece of paper. The power of the peak stage of Seventh Tier was amplified by 3,000 times; this was truly too terrifying.

However, the indestructibility of Seventh Tier was not just for show. With a flick of his body, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains had returned to his original state.

However, the old man’s expression had completely changed. His hair was standing on ends, and his eyes were spitting fire.

An ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier was high and mighty, and he was the only one who could decide the life and death of others. When had he ever been humiliated like this?

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Old thief, do you feel good? It doesn’t matter if you don’t, I’ve prepared many powerful moves for you.”

“Brat, you’re courting death!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ brows and beard twitched, and he finally charged towards Ling Han.

So what if it would have no effect? He still wanted to beat this bastard up.

Peng!

Ling Han’s right fist went straight in, forcibly penetrating the guard both of his opponent’s arms had put up, and then ruthlessly struck Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ face. Then, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was once again sent flying, soaring into the distance at an incomparably high speed.

In terms of power… Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was inferior to Ling Han, and the difference between them was not just a little bit.

“Old thief, where do you think you’re going?”

Ling Han gave chase with a big stride, and his fists rained down like a storm, pouring down on Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

Although Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains tried his best to counterattack, the difference in power was truly too great, even if he channeled a first-grade combination seal.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! The only thing he could do was get beaten up.

His physique could not be damaged, so it was impossible for him to be injured no matter how much he was hit. Even if his power was too terrifying, and his body was deformed from being hit, he would definitely recover in the next instant.

However, Ling Han had no intention of stopping. Instead, the more he fought, the more energetic he became.

Beating up an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier, and one at the peak of the Seventh Tier at that, this feeling could only be described with one word—exhilarating!

Just beat him up.

“Old bastard, how dare you try to kill me!”

Bang! A punch landed on Shatter Mountains’ left cheek.

“What? So what if you’re in the Seventh Tier?”

Boom! Another punch landed on Shatter Mountains’ right cheek.

“I’ll beat you up, you old bastard!”

Boom! Another kick landed on Shatter Mountains’s balls.
