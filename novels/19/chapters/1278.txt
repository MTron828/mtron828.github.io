1279 Escape and Counter-Kill

Cultivation level was not equivalent to battle prowess.

Ling Han was sure that this man that was pointing his sword at him had to be a three-star genius at least, or even a four-star genius!

At present, he was definitely incapable of matching this kind of elite.

In truth, his battle prowess had only reached the peak stage of the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, and taking into consideration that heaven’s might had weakened the other by a sub-minor level, he could only match an opponent in the early stage of the consummate level. Of course, if the Misty Soul Capturing Flower was effective, that would be another story.

However, in a head-on clash, Ling Han did not doubt in the slightest that he would be slashed into halves by the other party.

Never doubt the destructive ability of a sword cultivator. Ling Han’s present physique was only slightly above Level 7 Godly metal, and had not reached the extent of Level 8 yet. And even if he had reached Level 8, if the other’s battle prowess could really surpass three to four stars, he would still be capable of considerable destructiveness against Level 8 Godly metal.

Ling Han directly drew out the Misty Soul Capturing Flower. Instantly, the spirits of the 10 people on the scene were all captured, but it was only a mere instant. The four elites from the Heaven’s Sword Palace and the Absolute Saber Sect all had clear eyes.

Those that had cultivated Sword Heart, Saber Heart, and had reached the Illumination level all had sturdy spirits. It was much too difficult to affect their spirit.

This was also why sword and saber cultivators were so troublesome. They lived only for killing, and had long since severed their other emotions, so it was very difficult to move their spirit. Of course, this was also because these four people had cultivation levels high enough. Otherwise, the Misty Soul Capturing Flower would still have effect on them.

“Die!” A sword slashed over. Four Suns and Moons all shone with bright light, creating a frightening power.

‘F*ck!’

When he saw that the Misty Soul Capturing Flower was ineffective, Ling Han knew that things were not good. He quickly put away the demonic flower, and began to break out of the siege using the Star Plucking Step.

“Where are you going!?” The remaining three people from the Absolute Saber Sect and Heaven’s Sword Palace all brandished their weapons in a strike at the same time, and the remaining six people all returned to their senses after the Misty Soul Capturing Flower had been put away. They all paled drastically, and began their respective attacks as well.

This brat actually had this kind of unusual item on him. If it were not for the fact that they had four companions who had cultivated Sword Heart and Saber Heart, they would probably have fallen for this trick. Who knew, they might’ve even died here.

The moment they thought that they could have possibly died so carelessly in the hands of a junior, they all flew into rage out of humiliation, wanting nothing more but to tear Ling Han into a million pieces.

Ling Han did not zealously continue fighting, and instead put his all into breaking out of the siege.

“Can you leave?” The 10 great elites all humphed coldly. The weakest among them was in the early stage of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and if the 10 of them joined forces, it was enough to kill any cultivator in the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, what more when he was just in the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

Hong, various attacks intertwined, incredibly dazzling with their brightness.

Peng, peng, peng. Ling Han was repeatedly hit, but after he forcefully took a few heavy blows, he finally tore through the siege, and successfully escaped.

There were quite a few bloody holes in his body, but he was still indifferent, and said, “I will remember this debt. I will seek out each of you for repayment in future!”

The 10 people from the Five Sects were all astonished. He was still alive even after all f***** that?

If it had been them, they would definitely have died with any one of those attacks, yet a medium extreme cultivator actually survived, and still managed to threaten them coldly. A coldness rose up in their hearts.

This brat... definitely could not be left alive!

“You will only die here today, so what future would you still have!” The 10 people moved, determined to kill Ling Han. This was not just for eliminating a future powerful foe, but also for the great secret that Ling Han possessed.

They would absolutely not believe that a lowly commoner from a small world could reach this step just with his own merits. He must have hidden some astonishing fated opportunity. Who knew, it might really be the inheritance of the Heavenly River King.

Ling Han humphed, and used the Star Plucking Step, running with all his might.

The 10 members of the Five Sects hurriedly pursued, but the moment they started the pursuit, they realized they actually could not catch up with Ling Han!

Not only were they unable to catch up to him, the distance was still continuously increasing.

“Such a fast movement technique definitely cannot be used for long.”

“Give chase, we must eliminate this disaster.”

“If we do not get rid of this brat, we will not be able to rest or eat in peace!”

Yet Ling Han very soon disappeared without a trace. The 10 people were helpless, and could only separate to search for him.

After Ling Han had escaped, he had already hidden in the Black Tower.

He did not enter into the Black Tower at the first instant, firstly because he did not want to reveal the secret of the Black Tower, and secondly because he did not want to depend too much on the Black Tower, hiding inside the moment he met with danger. He channeled a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, and the injuries of his body immediately recovered at a visible pace.

In truth, he was very seriously wounded.

Those were 10 elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and a few of them had not just reached the peak stage of the consummate level, but were even three-star geniuses and four-star geniuses. One blow from them, and his blood and flesh was sent flying; even his Godly bones had almost been broken by the attacks.

He rubbed his neck. That elite from the Heaven’s Sword Palace almost severed his head with a single strike. With the use of the Indestructible True Fluid, the injury had already recovered, but Ling Han still felt lingering fear.

If it were not for the fact that his Godly bones were strong enough, his head would definitely have been separated from his body by now.

“Huh?”

He was in the Black Tower, but his vision was not affected. He discovered that there was a person running towards him, and it was precisely that old woman from the Earth Dragon Sect.

Even though she was holding a walking stick, her speed was incredibly fast. It was as if she could shrink the distance, covering more than 300 meters with a single step.

She was alone?

Ling Han smirked coldly. Just right, he had suffered such a heavy loss, so he was just thinking of venting his ire on someone.

The old woman suddenly stopped. She had the bloodline of the Earth Dragon, and was very sensitive to smells. She could vaguely smell Ling Han’s scent, but when she reached this place, it had suddenly vanished. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

How strange; could it be that he had tunneled into the ground?

She released a battle cry, wanting to summon her other companions.

However, just at this moment, a sword light suddenly flashed, bringing with it endless killing intent and slashing down at her neck.

‘What?!’

The old woman was incredibly astonished. There was obviously not one person in this place, so where did this sword light come from? She forcibly brandished her walking stick to meet the incoming sword light, and when she turned, she saw that this sword was held in the hand of a young man.

It was Ling Han!

She was stunned and furious. She had not thought that not only had Ling Han not fled in defeat, he actually dared to hide here to ambush her. Yet his methods of concealing himself were really too good. Even she had not found him, and at this time, she was concentrating fully on sensing Ling Han’s disappeared aura, so this could be considered a time when her defenses were the lowest.

This strike was earth-shattering, a major disaster so frightening it was indescribable.

Peng!

Her walking stick still parried the sword strike, but because she had moved in a hurry, her power was inadequate. Instantly, this strike sent her walking stick flying. However, she also managed to gain some time, her figure hurriedly retreating.

Ling Han approached. Because the two of them were too near to each other, he did not have the space to brandish his sword. He simply allowed the Divine Demon Sword to leave his hand and automatically attack, while he shot out his fists in a series of punches at the old woman.

The old woman was desperate to stay alive, and shielded herself with her arms as she hurriedly retreated. She absolutely did not have the time to wonder why Ling Han, who had just been severely wounded, could look like he was completely unharmed in an instant.

At this time, the battle cry echoed out endlessly, and the other nine people were also rapidly rushing over.

The old woman was elated. As long as she could hold on for just a little bit longer, when her reinforcements reached, the attacking and defending positions would switch, and it would be Ling Han’s turn to try to escape with all his might.

“You will not have the chance!” Ling Han smirked coldly, and the Misty Soul Capturing Flower suddenly appeared.

The old woman was shocked, and hurriedly wanted to close her eyes. However, this demonic flower had direct effect on the divine sense, so there was absolutely no difference whether you closed your eyes or not. In the instant she closed her eyes, she saw nine figures rushing towards her from various directions.

However, this was also the last scene that she would see in her life.

Peng!

Ling Han smashed the old woman’s head with a single punch, and even her spirit was destroyed as well. He looked coldly at the remaining nine people from the Five Sects, and used a motion technique to sprint madly without the slightest hesitation, endlessly stretching out the distance between himself and the other nine people in an instant.
