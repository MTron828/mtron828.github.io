3126 Mission

After becoming the Dao Child of the Ancient Dao Sect, the treatment received by Ling Han immediately improved by leaps and bounds.

First of all, his residence had been shifted. He had moved from the foot of the mountain… to the foothills closer to the mountain.

Although Sun Jianfang had established the Ancient Dao Sect, in reality, he had only discovered a fist scripture of the Ancient Dao Sect in this place. He hadn’t obtained the true inheritance of the Ancient Dao Sect.

Moreover, upon the transformation of the heaven and earth, only this small portion of the Ancient Dao Sect had been revealed. Most of the structures were still buried in the mountains.

It wasn’t that the Ancient Dao Sect didn’t want to excavate them, but there were formations sealing them off. No one had the ability to do so.

However, after moving some positions, Ling Han discovered that there were some unknown trees planted around the courtyard. Normally, there was nothing unusual about them, but when he cultivated in the morning, he could gather the power of heaven and earth, making a certain kind of mystical power in the courtyard even more abundant.

Therefore, if he cultivated here, his efficiency would increase by about 20% in comparison to his original residence.

Although it was only 20%, with constant cultivation for a period of time, the results would be staggering.

No wonder Li Changdan was keen on the position of Dao Child. Just this benefit alone was already extremely astonishing.

In addition, Ling Han still had a quota of 100 jade seeds per month, while as an ordinary disciple previously, he had only had one jade seed per month.

Furthermore, the Dao Child could learn three styles of the true Four Directional Fists.

The true Four Directional Fists was extremely powerful. If it was suddenly used in battle, it was very likely to reverse the situation.

Of course, this was under the condition that the strength of both sides was similar. Otherwise, if the difference in cultivation level was too great, not to mention the three moves, even using all of them would be useless.

Ling Han was no longer interested in the Four Directional Fists, but he also needed a secret weapon and a trump card. Thus, he decided not to use the Demonic Monkey Fists unless he was unable to defeat his opponent.

He spent some time practicing the Four Directional Fists. With his comprehension ability of someone who used to be a Heavenly Venerate, this was naturally not difficult to understand, and he quickly mastered it.

In comparison, this set of fist techniques was truly simple. Once one understood it thoroughly, one would understand it thoroughly. It wasn’t like the Demonic Monkey Fists, which was full of changes, and one would gain a new comprehension every time one cultivated it. The two were on completely different levels.

That was true. This area could only be considered the periphery of the true Ancient Dao Sect. How good could the fist scriptures obtained here be?

There wasn’t even a cultivation technique.

Ling Han nodded to himself. No cultivation techniques had appeared in this world yet. Perhaps there were some, but they were definitely pitifully few. However, as the great era advanced, a large number of cultivation techniques might appear one day.

At that time, it would be difficult to surpass the people who were already in the lead.

Thus, now was the best time for him to quickly catch up to others. Ling Han did not believe that he would lose to anyone in terms of cultivation with his ability when he reached the peak stage of Meridian Opening.

After Sun Jianfang taught him the three styles of the Four Directional Fists, he was still waiting for Ling Han to ask him if there was anything he didn’t understand. However, after waiting for a long time, he still didn’t see Ling Han coming over, which caused him to feel puzzled.

Could it be that this Dao Child’s comprehension had fallen to rock bottom? After so many days, he still couldn’t comprehend a little of these three styles of Four Directional Fists?

He called Ling Han over to inquire about his progress.

“How’s your fist training going?” he asked.

“It’s alright.” Ling Han was very humble.

“What do you mean it’s alright!” Sun Jianfang was annoyed, but when he thought of Ling Han’s freakishness from before, he couldn’t help but restrain himself, and said, “Show me, no matter how much you’ve grasped.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Alright.” Ling Han began to practice the three styles of the Four Directional Fists.

The corners of Sun Jianfang’s mouth immediately began to twitch. So this was the reason why Ling Han had never looked for him.

Damn it, he had encountered a monster who had actually completely learned it!

Even with his cultivation that had been immersed in this set of fist techniques for over 100 years, he was still unable to find the slightest flaw in Ling Han’s fist technique.

Sigh, some people were really born for martial arts.

That was all he could think.

“Go and cultivate diligently. Don’t slack off,” he instructed.

“Yes.”

Ling Han left and cultivated with all his might in his residence.

“Young Master! Young Master!” Huan Xue ran over. Since Ling Han had moved here, she had also come along, and continued to be Ling Han’s little maid.

This made everyone sigh ruefully. At first, they had thought that she had been extremely silly for giving up her identity as a disciple of the Ancient Dao Sect and insisting on being a maidservant. However, looking at it now, she could also cultivate in a place that was meant to be used by the Dao Child. How many people were envious of her?

“What’s wrong?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Li Changdan and He Miaoyin’s engagement has been canceled,” she announced the big news.

Ling Han gave an oh, not finding it strange at all.

The He Family valued Li Changdan’s potential, and thought that he could lead the He Clan to greater heights in the future. However, Li Changdan actually lost in the Dao Child competition. Naturally, this made the He Clan change their mind.

However, Ling Han felt that the He Clan was a little short-sighted. Although Li Changdan had lost his position as the Dao Child, he could still be considered a talent. He still had a promising future.

Of course, if Li Changdan didn’t know what was good for him, and insisted on making Ling Han his enemy, then his future would be a dead end, and the He Clan’s decision wouldn’t be wrong.

‘Let’s see how Li Changdan makes his choice.’

How could Li Changdan give up?

In his opinion, that pendant was too important. He had gone through countless dangers to obtain it, and it had also helped him obtain many opportunities. This was a precious treasure, and it was incomparably important.

Thus, he naturally had to seek its return from Ling Han.

Ling Han directly gave him the cold shoulder. First, Li Changdan had sent Zheng Tongfeng to lure him into depravity, and then provoked the hatred of Tan Gaobo and the others to target him. How could Li Changdan not compensate him with something?

This was the residence of the Dao Child. Who would dare to barge in?

Li Changdan didn’t dare to act recklessly. He could only run back angrily.

After this battle, Li Changdan’s prestige in the Ancient Dao Sect had plummeted to rock bottom. Now, everyone was discussing how long it would take for Ling Han to completely surpass this once proud prodigy.

Ling Han knew that Li Changdan was probably going to take the risk.

He didn’t dare to make a move in the Ancient Dao Sect, and even if he did, it would be impossible for him to do so.

This was because Ling Han had already buried the three formation foundations around his residence, and it was actually effective. He had turned this place into a small-scale psychedelic formation. While it did not suppress his cultivation level, this was enough.

Ling Han practiced cultivation techniques and fist techniques every day, and spent the rest of his time studying formations.

In this world, alchemy was tied to formations.

Because he had changed to a better place to cultivate, Ling Han’s advancement was naturally much faster.

Two months later, he cultivated to the peak of the Five Meridians. Subsequently, he naturally sensed the sixth meridian easily.

He was called over by Sun Jianfang again.

“I have a mission for you,” Sun Jianfang said.

“What mission?”

“Go to the Jade Dragon Mine and investigate the situation there.”

“Jade Dragon Mine?”

Sun Jian explained to him, and only then did Ling Han realize that the fact that the Ancient Dao Sect had so many jade seeds was because they were actually all mined. These mines were also the foundation for a sect to continue developing.

The Jade Dragon Mine belonged to the Ancient Dao Sect, and it was located on the other side of Haiping Mountain. Because there were no other forces nearby, there were no elites stationed to guard this mine.

But now, the Jade Dragon Mine hadn’t sent any jade seeds for half a month.
