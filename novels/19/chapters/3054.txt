3055 The Mystery within the Mystery

Extermination didn’t reply, and only increased the intensity of her attacks.

At this time, it didn’t matter what she said. The more she said, the more mistakes she would make. It was better not to say anything.

“Then let me analyze it,” Ling Han said as they exchanged blows. Right now, the only thing in the world that could threaten him was still Hysteria. Even the true body of Extermination from the last era would not be able to suppress him.

“According to the timeline, you first sent the seeds of life to Chong Yan and the others, and also ‘disclosed’ some secrets to them, letting them know of the existence of the World’s Core. According to the information you revealed, this should allow them to advance to the Eighth Tier, right? Otherwise, Chong Yan and the others wouldn’t be so crazy.

“But from what I found out from Hysteria, it doesn’t know about the existence of the World’s Core.

“Although we’re enemies, I’m more willing to believe Hysteria’s words now.

“So, you must be lying.

“The question is, why did you lie to Chong Yan and the others? What benefits do you gain from it?”

Ling Han stopped, looked at Extermination with a smile, and said, “Are you willing to answer my questions?”

“You’re very smart, and even bolder!” Extermination said. “I originally thought that this secret wouldn’t be revealed until Chong Yan and the others died, but I didn’t expect you to be so bold as to verify it with Hysteria!

“If I had known… I wouldn’t have revealed it to you on purpose.”

Although she had the appearance of a peerless beauty, right now her black hair was dancing wildly, and even her hair was entwined with terrifying power. There was an energy storm forming, and a single strand of hair could really kill a Sixth Tier. She was incomparably powerful.

“Destroy!” she cried out softly, and pushed out with her jade-like hands, launching a burst of force that transformed into a mountain pressing down on Ling Han.

Ling Han threw a punch. Peng! The mountain immediately crumbled, but he also slid backward, a slight look of surprise on his face.

Extermination had channeled some kind of secret technique into this attack, allowing the scattered forces to condense together. As a result, the power of this attack had increased by many times.

Fortunately, Ling Han was surrounded by layers of defensive energy. This had only reduced his defenses by 14 layers. Compared to Hysteria, the difference was incomparably obvious.

Ling Han continued, “Since you had possessed this body a long time ago, yet intentionally left a portion of your consciousness at the core of the Genesis World of the last era, what is your purpose?

“Just to say those words to me on purpose?

“Or… do you want to use the power there to do something to me?”

Back then, the power there was extremely strange. It could ignore his defense. Perhaps only the Genesis World could do this. It was also the reason why Extermination had to split away a portion of its consciousness there.

“Now that I think about it, you probably want to do something to me, and the target… should be the light spot in my mind.

“Is that right?”

Ling Han looked at Extermination.

Extermination attacked a few times before saying coldly, “Not bad, you’re very good at guessing.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It’s not that I am good at guessing, but that you exposed yourself.”

If Extermination hadn’t kidnapped the person he had been looking for, then Ling Han definitely wouldn’t have thought of this. This was truly a completely unrelated matter, so how could he possibly make the connection?

Of course, on the other hand, it was also because Ling Han had unlocked the secret of his body possessing the mark of life.

“You’ve done so much for the sake of advancing to the Eighth Tier, right?” Ling Han asked again.

Extermination didn’t say anything. She just sneered and attacked continuously. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You even wanted to trick me into joining forces with you. Do you take me for a sucker as well?” Ling Han asked again. He frowned slightly. At that time, apart from spying on the secret of the light spot in his mind, did Extermination have any other trump cards?

Could this kind of backup plan suddenly cause him to lose his battle prowess, or could it be to control him?

However, Ling Han immediately shook his head. The Power of Dimension in his body surged. It surpassed any kind of fundamental power, and he didn’t discover anything unusual at all.

Extermination’s current strength was about the same as his, but it was impossible for him to be unaware of any tricks that Extermination had set up in his body.

“Humph, since you’ve guessed my identity, I can’t let you live!” Extermination roared, and her black hair danced wildly, transforming into numerous arrows that shot towards Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng! These strands of hair struck Ling Han’s body, triggering the explosion of his defenses. Light flashed wildly, and his defenses were quickly destroyed layer by layer.

However, with just a thought from Ling Han, new defenses immediately formed.

As long as the power directed at him did not reach the level of crushing Ling Han, it would definitely not be able to break through Ling Han’s defenses.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I didn’t guess your identity. I merely uncovered your first layer of disguise.”

He stared at Extermination with a burning gaze. “Who are you? Don’t tell me it’s some World’s Will. Whom are you trying to fool?”

The other party had intentionally pretended to be angry out of embarrassment in order to cover it up and prevent Ling Han from thinking any further.

Extermination sneered. Despite the fierce battle, she was still indescribably beautiful and pleasing to the eye.

She didn’t reply and continued to attack.

Although she believed that Ling Han would never be able to guess her identity, talking to Ling Han did not benefit her in the slightest, so there was naturally no need for her to reply.

“If you don’t tell me, then I’ll beat you up and make you spill all your secrets!” Ling Han let out a long cry, and brandished his Fists of Fury. All the fifth-grade seals were channeled, and his power surged by 4,000 times. This was truly too terrifying.

Even someone as powerful as Extermination could only parry. If she received another punch, she would be sent flying. She was completely outmatched.

In this world, only Hysteria could compete with Ling Han.

Ling Han chased after her, and a fist smashed into Extermination’s face. No matter what kind of peerless beauty you were, as long as you were an enemy, gender didn’t matter.

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han repeatedly brandished his fists. He wanted to suppress the other party and force her to reveal her secrets.

“Dream on!” Extermination said coldly. Her body moved, and her black dress fluttered as she began to break away from the clash.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t let her leave easily, and his attacks became even more violent.

He was going all out, and his current power could be said to be incomparably violent. With a single strike, a few scraps of clothing flew into the air.

Extermination looked at her arm. There was a rip here, revealing her snow-white arm. A hint of embarrassment and anger appeared on her pretty face.

Previously, she was still at ease, and could protect the clothes on her body, but now Ling Han’s explosive power was too terrifying, and she was unable to protect her clothes.

Ling Han was also slightly taken aback, but he immediately regained his fighting spirit.

He did not differentiate between men and women as long as they were his enemy. He did not have any evil thoughts in his heart, so what did he have to worry about?

‘Die!’

He attacked again. Peng, peng, peng! Under his frenzied attacks, Extermination looked even more miserable.

However, a Seventh Tier was a Seventh Tier, after all, so how could she not have some tricks up her sleeve?

When the black dress was close to exposing her body, layers of black mist surged out from her body and enveloped her. It seemed to have turned into clothes or a shield.

Ling Han was astounded because he immediately discovered that this black mist was not as simple as it seemed. Instead, it had a powerful deflective effect. When his attacks struck, they would all be deflected to either side of her, making it very difficult for impact to touch her.
