Chapter 3411: Accepting the challenge

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It wasn’t until Ling Han felt extremely hungry that he finally woke up. He instantly felt an emptiness. He went out to find something to eat, and discovered that two days had already passed.

No wonder he was so hungry.

F***, he had wasted two precious times for cultivating.

Ling Han adjusted some settings on the optical computer. Every day, when the sun rose, there would be a reminder. He definitely could not miss the time to cultivate.

After eating, he went to study the formation again.

As expected of a formation prodigy. After ten days, he had a preliminary grasp of this “Absolute Fairness”.

Ling Han began to attempt drawing, but did not do so on that piece of metal, nor did he use the precious blood of the Demon Emperor. Instead, it was just ordinary ink and brush, drawn on paper.

In these three days, he had many failed attempts, but his confidence was getting stronger and stronger.

On the fifth day, Ling Han decided to officially inscribe it.

He had already asked Xuanyuan Dingguo for help to cut open that piece of metal and forge it into 4.9 pieces that were the size of jade pendants.

Ling Han opened the jar, and instantly, a dense mist rose. It actually took the form of a spirit monkey, vivid and lifelike. At the same time, a refreshing fragrance wafted over.

It was really quite fragrant.

Only now did Ling Han understand why the seven children wanted it so much. That was because even he felt a slight urge to drink this.

Unfortunately, this was blood.

Ling Han shook his head. He definitely didn’t want to be a savage or a beast.

He dipped the brush in this ink, and began to draw.

Formation patterns had to be drawn in a single stroke. If the brush was broken or did not draw into the right place, it would affect the communication with heaven and earth, and thus affect the might of the formation.

The first piece, success!

The second piece, success!

The third piece… the ninth piece, failed.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel heartache. Although failure once wouldn’t damage the foundations of the formation, the ink was still wasted.

This was precious blood.

Ling Han washed this formation foundation clean, dried it, and began drawing again.

This had to be washed away at the first instant. Otherwise, once it dried, it could not be washed away, and would become a flaw, affecting the might of the formation foundations.

Again, again.

Ling Han had once again entered into a state of neglecting food and rest. Though he was reminded by the optical computer, he still didn’t notice. He had missed another dawn again.

Thankfully, the forty-nine formation foundations were all completed.

He inscribed these pieces of clothing on the special material that had been bound with the Precipice Formation. They were incredibly durable, and did not fear being struck by gravity. Otherwise, even if he pulled his opponent to the level of Extreme Bone Tier, the latter would be able to shatter his clothes in a few moves. Wouldn’t the formation be immediately broken then?

Let’s give it a try. Ling Han went to the academy and called his little female attendant back, beginning to test the formation technique.

Weng, he activated the formation, and a power channeled through it, communicating with the heaven and earth, immediately forming a suppression that surpassed all else. Ling Han’s cultivation level was immediately suppressed, becoming Seventh Change.

Blood Transformation Tier, the same as the little handmaiden.

However, the little handmaiden was only a Second Change, while he was a Seventh Change, which meant that this was actually not absolute fairness, but only fairness in terms of a major tier.

It was enough.

With a thought, Ling Han grabbed the fat pig. He wanted to know the fat pig’s cultivation level; he at least had to know whether it was high or low.

Strangely, when this kind of suppression fell on the fat pig, it was completely ineffective.

In other words, the pig was equivalent to nonexistent, and the formation ignored it completely.

Strange, and weird.

What secrets was this pig hiding?

“Damn pig, it would be great if you could open your mouth and speak.” Ling Han sighed. With a thought, he wondered if he could get a Transformation Fruit from the Demon Race for this pig to eat.

It didn’t matter whether he could take human form or not. The important thing was that he could open his mouth to speak.

He found Xuanyuan Dingguo, and asked him to deliver a message to the Demon Race, saying that he had agreed to Yuwen Hou’s challenge, and the battle would begin at noon on the third day.

When the news spread out, a considerable commotion was once again caused in the Imperial Capital.

Who was Yuwen Hou?

The Demon Race prodigy that was at the level of Inscription Tier, but his battle prowess could reach the level of Enlightenment Tier. He was regarded by the Demon Race as a powerful contender who could snipe Hong Tianbu.

But now? Ling Han, this “little guy” that had just advanced into Extreme Bone Tier, actually wanted to challenge such a colossal creature.

Wasn’t this just asking for a beating?

Throughout history, even from ancient records, there was no prodigy that had battle prowess that surpassed two major cultivation levels.

Thus, Ling Han would definitely lose.

However, he still accepted the challenge even though he was about to lose. Had he gone stupid?

Those like Lian Xuerong and Yin Xiujing came to find him and told him not to accept the challenge. No matter how they thought about it, there was no way he could win, but how could Ling Han listen?

It wasn’t long before Yuwen Hou responded. They would battle. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

A day passed, and Absolute Fairness could be used again. Ling Han smiled; everyone was just waiting to be shocked.

This night passed. Ling Han first cultivated for a while. Then, he set out, heading towards Princess Bixiao’s manor.

That’s right, the battle would be held here.

Ling Han arrived just in time, and saw that there was already a sea of people here. Aside from the younger generation of the Demon Race, a considerable number of mighty figures had also come from the human race. In fact, Ling Han even saw the Seventh Imperial Prince, the Third Imperial Prince and so on.

He had had more interactions with the Seventh Imperial Prince, and knew that this was a character that had the essence of an ambitious and ruthless character, but to think that the Seventh Imperial Prince would actually come here. When he looked at Princess Bixiao, his expression was filled with adoration, and this caused Ling Han to feel slightly surprised.

F***, this princess of the Demon Race was really too charismatic, wasn’t she? Even an ambitious and ruthless character like the Seventh Imperial Prince had softened?

Princess Bixiao was all smiles, charming and guiding the conversation, becoming the center of attention, making everyone proud of being able to catch a second glance from her. Her charm was indeed great.

“Ling Han has arrived,” someone said. At this moment, everyone finally withdrew their gazes from Princess Bixiao and turned to look at Ling Han.

Yuwen Hou strode out, and said, “Come, and let’s end the battle quickly.”

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Ten seconds?”

Yuwen Hou’s face instantly flushed red.

Previously, he had arranged a battle with Ling Han, declaring that he would defeat Ling Han within ten seconds, but first, it was the little pink pig, and then it was Third Baby, and they were all able to easily withstand ten seconds in a battle with him, and when it was Ling Han’s turn, the latter used various technique. Formation techniques, treasured armor, and so on all managed to block him for quite a number of ten seconds.

Now that Ling Han had mentioned ten seconds, it was obvious that he was mocking him.

“You will regret this!” Yuwen Hou said balefully. He instinctively thought that Ling Han had done something that made Princess Bixiao feel humiliated and furious. This made him, her loyal admirer, extremely displeased.

Ling Han… had to die.

“What about the stakes?” Ling Han asked.

Yuwen Hou took out a green bamboo pole. There were only three segments in total, and it was about three feet long. He placed the bamboo pole on a stone table at the side and sneered, “Can you take this away?”

“It’s not enough.You need to add another Transformation Fruit,” Ling Han said.

Yuwen Hou was instantly angered. ‘Brat, you’re too greedy, aren’t you?’

Furthermore, the Transformation Fruit was also quite a precious item among the Demon Race, because there were millions of Demon Race warriors, but there were only about a thousand that could take human form.

There wasn’t even enough for the Demon Race to share among themselves, and you still want a share of the loot?

“So stingy? Then forget it, I’m not fighting anymore.” Ling Han shook his head, turned around and was about to leave.

“Stop right there!” Yuwen Hou hurriedly shouted.. Ling Han could be so shameless, but how could he be willing?
