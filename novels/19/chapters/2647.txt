2648 Five Elements Lightning

Wang Dongsen had good reason to hate Ling Han.

If Zhan Feiyu had successfully remained hidden in Ghost King City at that time, the Ghost King City would have eventually been conquered by Prosperous Opening City.

However, because of Ling Han, their plans had all been ruined. In the end, Prosperous Opening City had needed to sacrifice a great deal to calm the fury of Ghost King City.

Ling Han was naturally to blame for all of this. Thus, not only did Tang Mingbo, Lu Gaoquan, and the others want to kill Ling Han, but even those from Prosperous Opening City wanted him dead.

Now that they had come across each other, Wang Dongsen was naturally red-eyed with anger.

“How noisy!” Ling Han said as he launched a palm strike at Wang Dongsen.

At this moment, how could he treat Wang Dongsen with any sense of seriousness? Only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings or supreme monarch stars like Xiao Yingxiong and Miao Hua could be viewed as his opponents.

This kind of insignificant person would be killed with a single slap. They didn’t deserve to waste his time.

“You’re seeking death!!” Wang Dongsen roared upon seeing Ling Han’s dismissive attitude. He was enraged, and he crossed his hands as he unleashed a celestial technique, summoning a frightening battle prowess. He then launched an attack at Ling Han.

As his celestial technique circulated, it transformed into a golden Dragon Turtle that reared its head. Its maw was filled with razor-sharp teeth, each formed from a symbol.

Ling Han’s palm strike arrived.

Peng!

The Dragon Turtle was immediately reduced to smithereens. The large hand continued to press down, crushing Wang Dongsen, who was wearing an expression of shock and disbelief.

As a measly Seventh Heaven emperor tier, how could he possibly block a casual strike from Ling Han?

A rain of blood descended, landing on the faces and bodies of the three other people. They finally recovered from their shock and regained their senses.

As powerful as Wang Dongsen was, he was actually killed by Ling Han in a single strike?

The three of them exchanged a glance before fleeing, not even daring to think about doing battle.

The Empress immediately lashed out, casually unleashing three sword strikes to kill them.

“It seems like these gates aren’t easy to enter,” Ling Han said.

“There’s not a single Ninth Heaven Celestial King in sight, so these gates clearly can’t stop them,” the Empress said with a nod.

Ling Han walked over, saying, “Let’s give it a go.”

He raised his foot, making contact with the wall of lightning.

The bolts of lightning wavered as if they were about to unleash a devastating strike. However, they immediately calmed down again as if they approved of Ling Han.

Ling Han was astonished. “These bolts of lightning were just about to attack me, yet the Four Lightning Technique within me suddenly started to circulate. The two reached resonance, and these bolts of lightning ceased their attack.”

The Empress also walked forward to try. Sure enough, this was the case.

“By the looks of it, the final inheritance is inside this palace,” the Empress said.

The two of them entered the palace, only to be greeted by an expanse of emptiness. All that they could see were towering columns that were 300 meters in diameter. The golden floor tiles also reflected a dazzling and colorful brilliance.

‘Where are the people? Where have they all gone?’

The two of them continued to advance. After a short while, they reached the end of the level. What appeared before them was a flight of stairs.

They walked up the stairs to the second level. After wandering around the second level, they arrived before a set of stairs to the third level.

Repeating this process again and again, they eventually arrived on the ninth level.

This level was finally different. The floor tiles weren’t golden, but instead multicolored and extremely varied.

“By the looks of it, the inheritance should be here.”

The two of them continued to walk around. However, in contrast to before, this place didn’t unleash any attacks at them. After circling around the entire level, both Ling Han and the Empress wore expressions of puzzlement. They hadn’t discovered any clues.

They walked around several more times, trying to use different methods to analyze the situation. However, they were still unable to make any inroads.

“Perhaps… this is only a decoy?”

“Let’s go upstairs to take a look.”

They arrived on the 10th level, only to discover that this level was also decorated with multicolored floor tiles.

‘What the heck?!

They wandered around this level as well, yet they were still unable to make head nor tail of the situation.

They went up another level, only to discover that the 11th level was identical as well. Then the 12th, 13th… and all the way up to the 18th level. All of these levels were decorated with multi-colored floor tiles. However, starting from the 19th level, the floor tiles returned to their original appearance again. The 20th and 21st levels were also like that.

Ling Han and the Empress didn’t go up to the 22nd level. Instead, they made their way back down.

“I’m sure that the final inheritance is here,” Ling Han said.

The Empress nodded in agreement. “We should consider the nine levels together.”

They returned to the first nine levels, and committed all of the multicolored floor tiles to memory. They then visualized them in their minds.

“If we stack the nine levels together, and only consider the floor tiles with the same overlapping colors, it actually forms a word!” Ling Han suddenly opened his eyes and exclaimed in surprise.

“The 16th level, the 967th row, the 3666th column,” the Empress said.

They hurriedly made their way to the 16th level, and found the corresponding floor tile.

After stepping on it, they once again recalled the image of the nine levels stacked together. An extremely powerful intent instantly surged into their minds.

“This Heavenly Venerate is Primordial Ancient. Now that I’m venturing off to face Hysteria, it’s difficult to say whether there will be a day of return. I fear the loss of my Dao, so I’ve especially left five lands of inheritance!

“Only those who have obtained the four previous inheritances have the right to enter this hall and obtain my ultimate technique!”

Boom!

Immediately afterward, countless arcs of lightning flashed in their minds, forming symbol after symbol.

This was the final piece of the Five Elements Lightning Technique, the Lightning of Earth!

However, it was a shame that this final land of inheritance wasn’t a formation. Thus, there was naturally no bestowal of power. However, compared to obtaining a Heavenly Venerate Technique, the elevation of one’s cultivation could completely be pushed aside and ignored. After all, this only required time.

The inheritance was swift, and the two of them reopened their eyes after only seven days.

They both wore expressions of delight. After walking some distance away, they entered the Celestial Guest Residence to immediately fuse the five different lightning techniques together. This would allow them to obtain the genuine Heavenly Venerate Technique.

Mastering the Lightning of Earth was actually very simple. Ling Han completed this process in only 3,000 years. However, fusing the five lightning techniques together would be far more difficult. This was because the separated techniques could only be counted as Celestial King Techniques, rendering them easy to grasp. However, the fused technique was a genuine Heavenly Venerate Technique, so it was naturally incredibly difficult to master.

“We still need to thank the Primordial Ancient Heavenly Venerate for splitting the Five Elements Lightning Technique into five separate techniques. As long as one manages to comprehend the Five Elements and their birth of all matter, one will have a sliver of a chance to grasp this Heavenly Venerate Technique. Otherwise, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings will struggle to grasp this technique. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“No wonder it’s said that each Heavenly Venerate is unique.”

Ling Han sighed with emotion. He then sat still with his legs crossed, silently activating his time physique. He wanted to grasp this paramount technique as quickly as possible.

One year, 10 years, 100 years… 10,000 years, 1,000,000 years, 10,000,000 years!

Time quickly flashed by, with 40,000,000 years having already passed. Inside the Celestial Guest Residence, Ling Han and the Empress were under the influence of accelerated time. Thus, accounting for this, they had already experienced a whopping 40 billion years!

On some day, Ling Han suddenly opened his eyes, with an arc of lightning flashing across his pupils. With a thought, countless arcs of lightning instantly materialized around him. They weren’t white, however, but of nine different colors instead!

“I’ve finally managed to fuse the five elements together!

“Right now, I still have yet to grasp the fundamental power of the Genesis World, so I can only summon the Five Elements Lightning using the power of Regulations. However, the Regulations of the Five Elements and the Regulation of Lightning result in a resonance of six Regulations, so the might that can be unleashed isn’t simply a sum of their might.

“Just how powerful will it be?

“In any case, I’ll worry about this later. I need to face a tribulation first!”

Ling Han exited the Celestial Guest Residence, and dark clouds instantly appeared overhead, lightning flashing amid them.

After 40 billion years of cultivation, Ling Han had naturally reached the peak stage of the Sixth Heaven. Borrowing the opportunity when successfully fusing the Heavenly Venerate Technique together, Ling Han resolutely pushed open the gates to the Seventh Heaven.
