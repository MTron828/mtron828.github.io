Chapter 3563: Visitor from the Stars

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A meteorite had fallen from the skies, and the meteorite had shattered, and a person had actually walked out?

No, it was not just one.

The first to walk out was a young man who looked to be in his twenties at most, but behind him, four old men walked out one after another. All of them exuded a powerful aura, and were definitely not Mystery Realm Tier elites.

Celestial Path elites!

Ling Han immediately drew out the Void Beast hide and draped it over himself. He was sure that with such a far distance, even elites of Celestial Path might not be able to discover him.

Of course, if it was a Core Formation Tier cultivator or even a True Self cultivator, they would be able to discover him with a single glance, even from so far away.

‘■Young Master, we have successfully arrived at the Celestial Sea Planet.” The four old men bowed and said to the young man.

Ling Han was surprised. Though this young man had a very strong presence, he definitely had not advanced into Celestial Path, but four elites of Celestial Path bowed to him respectfully. This completely went against the common sense of the cultivation world that only the strong would be respected.

Thus, this young man definitely had a powerful background, and came from a great clan or force. These four old men were all his protectors.

A guess welled up in Ling Han’s head. These five people had come from another planet, and that was why they had descended from the skies. Furthermore, they had walked out from a meteorite.

As for why they had come from a meteorite, and not from a warship, stargate,

or teleportation formation, Ling Han did not know.

In short, this definitely did not seem like they had come out from the prison.

Did he really have a halo of trouble above his head? Why did this meteorite not fall anywhere, but had to crash onto the top of his head?

The young man nodded, ‘You guys go and scout out the surroundings first. Ten days later, meet back at the Imperial Capital here.”

“Young Master!” The four old men hurriedly advised, “Your body is delicate and noble, and this place is filled with barbarians. What if your noble body is injured…”

“Humph, you all have already said. This is a primitive land, so who would be able to wound me?” The young man appeared very displeased, “Though there were a great many elites imprisoned here all those years ago, after so many years, the majority would probably have died of old age.

“This planet is currently recovering, and in the past, there were also great sects that existed. They would definitely leave behind a great many fortunes and opportunities.”

“I have deliberately come to this primitive land to snatch these fated opportunities. With a little more time, even more competitors would come.”

“Thus, we must hurry.”

“What are you waiting for?”

With this shout from the young man, the four old men hurriedly bowed again in agreement, and turned to leave.

Thinking about it, it made sense. In this desolate land, who would hurt their

Young Master?

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Four figures shot through the air, instantly disappearing without

a trace.

The young man’s initially arrogant expression immediately changed, “Being followed by these four old geezers, how am I supposed to continue playing around? At home, I am being controlled by the old man and the others, and here, I still have to be controlled by these four old geezers?’ “According to the images that the Heaven’s Eye has swept over, a weak Royal Empire has been established here. I will go and see what kind of beauties there are in the Imperial City.”

When he spoke of beauties, he revealed a perverted expression. In his twenty years of life, aside from cultivation, it was still cultivation. Now, he was free to do as he liked, and his heart was also lifted in an instant.

“However, I still have to deal with serious matters.”

“The old man deduced that the Ethereal Peak appeared on this planet. I suppressed my cultivation level all this while and did not break through to Celestial Path because I wanted to obtain a top-grade Foundation Building

Divine Stone.”

“The Wide Star Vine here has already awakened, so I’ll connect to it and make some enquiries.”

Ling Han heard it clearly from afar. F***, this guy, who had come from another planet, and still wanted to come here to snatch treasures and court girls? F***l He quietly hid behind that young man, and arrived behind that man.

“En?” The young man was quite extraordinary. Immediately, he turned his head sternly. He sensed something was off.

Pa!

However, a stone slab was already crashing down on him, and he was instantly knocked unconscious onto the ground.

Ling Han lifted the hide of the Void Beast, and couldn’t help but laugh. This young man’s face still bore a hint of surprise, fury, and panic.

He had just arrived at the Celestial Sea Planet. This young man was filled with hot blood and playfulness, yet he had not even taken the first step, when he was knocked unconscious by someone. There were naturally ten thousand ******* in his heart.

Ling Han searched the young man for a while, and found a Spatial Tool. He stretched out his divine sense for a look, and couldn’t help but look pleasantly surprised.

Good lord, he was really rich.

He saw two suits of armor in his Spatial Spirit Tool, and each suit of armor was covered with mysterious veined patterns, as if they were the God of War.

He tried to put it on, but he couldn’t even disassemble it.

“Father, this armor has already been recognized someone else as Master. You have to erase this mark first,” Second Baby said from the sidelines.

“How are we going to erase it?” Ling Han asked.

“Either your Spiritual Power has to be stronger than the original owner, and forcefully erase it, or you kill the original owner, and the spiritual mark would naturally lose its effect,” Third Baby said.

Eldest Baby immediately became filled with killing intent, “Father, let me kill this guy!”

This little violent maniac.

Ling Han hurriedly waved his hand. Though he had made a move to rob him, this person had not done any evil deeds. To kill him underhandedly, that would have broken his principles.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He tried to erase the divine sense mark on the suit of armor, and a smile instantly appeared on his face. This mark was not all that powerful.

If this was a battle, he would definitely not be able to break through the divine sense mark so calmly, but now, he was relaxed. After all, that young man would not launch a counterattack against him either.

In a short while, he had erased the divine sense mark on the suit of armor, and it was two suits at that.

With a thought, a suit of armor immediately disintegrated by itself, flying towards him. Then, it was worn on his body.

So handsome.

Ling Han moved his arms and legs, and instantly, a terrifying power surged

out.

What a strong feeling of power.

“This has at least doubled my power,” Ling Han murmured. He looked pleasantly surprised. Merely this fact was enough to call this armor a precious treasure, and the armor itself was also incredibly sturdy. Probably Mystery Realm Tier-level power wouldn’t be able to break through it at all.

He had profited.

Ling Han tried the other suit of armor, and the effects were more or less the same.

How extravagant. One person actually brought two Battle Armors. If those young elites in the prison saw this, just how envious would they be? Having come from another cultivation planet, he was indeed rich and imposing.

“Brother, thank you.”

Ling Han put away his armor, patted the young man lightly, and strode off. He did not deliver a fatal strike. Firstly, this was contrary to his principles of conduct, and secondly, since this person could “ride” a meteorite to traverse the universe, he must have a powerful backer. He should have a hfe-saving treasure on him.

If he delivered a fatal strike, it was highly possible that it would cause a backlash, and that would not be good.

However, the first batch of people from other planets had already arrived, so how far could the second and third batch be?

One wave had not subsided, and another wave had risen. The elites in the prison had not all appeared, yet the people from other planets were rushing to join in.. Was this world really going to be in chaos?
