Chapter 3419: Spiritual Weapon

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was something that had been formed when he broke through to Seventh Change. Even heaven and earth had experienced a strange phenomenon because of it. Even elites and prodigies like Yuwen Hou would be affected, what more for a person like Jin Shaojian.

Fear instantly spread across his face. His eyes widened, and his mouth involuntarily gaped open, drooling.

He had been severely shocked, and his mind and spirit had been completely captivated.

Ling Han discovered that he had only discovered the amaizing use of the eye technique that he had obtained after he had broken through into the Seventh Change. He had overlooked the might of this murderous aura.

After all, it was formed after attaining Seventh Change, so how could it possibly be ordinary?

-You’re seeking death!” Ling Han said as he pointed at Jin Shaojian. Pa! Jin

Shaojian’s head instantly exploded into pieces.

“Father, you’re so cruel!” Eldest Baby said.

“Too violent,” Fourth Baby nodded.

“You are going to lead children astray,” Fifth Baby echoed.

Come on, these seven kids all had violent tendencies, so what need was there for him to lead them astray?

Ling Han chuckled, and found a Spatial Spirit Tool from Jin Shaojian’s body. However, aside from some jade seeds, there was nothing valuable inside.

He sighed. Was this heir of a hidden clan fake? How could he be so poor?

“Let’s leave this place first,” Ling Han said.

The members of the Jin Clan would definitely arrive soon. Though Ling Han had Absolute Fairness and was unafraid of facing powerful opponents head-on, in a contest for treasures within an ancient site, who knew how many enemies there were. Thus, it was best to leave a powerful move in hand, and only use it at the most crucial moment.

He took out the Heavenly Pattern Jade again. Because his Spiritual Power had already disappeared, it had returned to its original weight of 5,000kg.

Ling Han injected his Spiritual Power again, and this jade immediately became lighter. However, when it reached around five kilograms, it was difficult to make it any lighter.

“Continue pouring power into it,” Third Baby said.

Ling Han did as he was told. 4kg, 2.5kg, 1.5kg, the Heavenly Pattern Jade became lighter and lighter, but 1.5kg was Ling Han’s current limit, and he could not take another step further.

“Father, toss it out, and the moment it leaves your hand, retract the Spiritual Power,” Sixth Baby said.

Ling Han did as she had said. With a wave of his right hand, he threw out the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and in the instant he made his move, he withdrew his Spiritual Power. Instantly, this fist-sized rock shot out at six times the speed of sound.

Peng!

The rock smashed into the wall, forcibly creating a hole in the wall, and got stuck inside.

Ling Han was astounded. He knew how sturdy this wall was. Even if he used fifty overlapping levels of power, he would not be able to break through it, but he had simply smashed out a rock, and created a hole in the wall.

However, it could be imagined how terrifying the impact would be if a rock weighing 5,000kg was thrown at six times the speed of sound.

He couldn’t help but think that if Spiritual Power was added to the process of throwing it out, what would happen?

Ling Han retrieved the Heavenly Pattern Jade and once again compressed it with his Spiritual Power. Very soon, it became as heavy as 1.5kg. He threw it out, and then used his Spiritual Power to push it.

His Spiritual Power could now cover a range of fifteen meters, which also meant that within this range, he could continuously use his Spiritual Power to accelerate it further.

Xiu, the Heavenly Pattern Jade flew out. Peng, it crashed into the wall, but did not break through the wall, and caused even less damage.

Why was this?

He thought for a moment, then came to a sudden realization. This was because his speed of withdrawing Spiritual Power had slowed down, causing the Heavenly Pattern Jade to not recover to its original weight of 5,000kg when it hit the wall.

Power and speed determined the size of the impact.

This needed to be studied carefully.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. He used his Spiritual Power to stimulate objects to attack. This was his trump card in the first place, and now, the might of this trump card had increased by tons.

Unfortunately, compressing the weight of the Heavenly Pattern Jade took a little too long, a whole ten seconds. Under normal circumstances, this would be no big deal, but in battle, ten seconds was not considered short.

If he needed to use this trump card, his opponent would definitely be extraordinary. Thus, it would become difficult to get an opening of ten seconds.

Thus, not only did Ling Han have to accurately control the time it took to retrieve the Spiritual Power, he also had to increase the efficiency of compression, shrinking the time from ten seconds to five seconds, three seconds, or even less than that. Only then would this kind of trump card really live up to its name.

“There’s no hurry. I can take things slowly,” Ling Han murmured.

“Father, you can still forge this Heavenly Pattern Jade. For example, it can be forged into sabers, swords, and so on, making it more destructive,” Sixth Baby added.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. This was also what he wanted. “However, the Heavenly Pattern Jade is extremely hard, and is a Two Star Celestial level material. At present, there is absolutely no one that can forge it.” Second Baby dampened his enthusiasm.

“Unless we can obtain the Thousand Darkness Water,” Third Baby suddenly said. “This can soften most of the materials in the world and mold them into the desired form. Moreover, it won’t be wasted at all.”

Yi, when did you wake up?

“Thousand Dark Water?” Ling Han repeated.

“This is also an extremely rare item,” Second Baby said. “However, with Father’s heaven-defying luck, I’m sure you’ll definitely be able to obtain it.”

Ling Han laughed loudly, “Thanks for your kind words. My confidence suddenly increased a hundredfold.”

Xixi, the babies all laughed.

Meanwhile, the pervert pig glanced at Ling Han, slightly surprised. This guy’s luck was indeed heaven-defying. In just a few months, he had obtained so many treasures, and there were even Celestial level treasures. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

In the palace where Jin Shaojian’s body was.

Xiu, xiu! Two figures shot over, one old and one young. The old man looked to be in his sixties, while the young man looked to be in his twenties.

The old man’s aura was astonishing, his blood and Qi soaring, like an invincible lion. Meanwhile, the young man’s aura was reserved, but standing beside the old man, he was not the slightest bit inferior.

“Shaojian’s signal was sent from here,” the elder said. “Where is he?” He searched for a while, and soon discovered Jin Shaojian’s corpse. His expression instantly became baleful.

The young man also walked over, similarly revealing killing intent.

“To dare to kill a member of our Jin Clan, he must be tired of living!” the old man said viciously.

Meanwhile, the young man took out a jade box. He only opened it slightly, and placed it next to Jin Shaojian’s corpse. After a while, he said, “I’ve already used the Hook Insect to memorize the killer’s aura. If I encounter him, I’ll be able to find the killer.”

“The culprit must be killed with the cruelest means,” the old man said, “The upheaval of heaven and earth has officially begun. The Jin Clan is going to take this opportunity to rise up, and become the ruler of Celestial Sea Planet.” “What Chen Clan, what Demon Emperor, they can only prostrate in front of our Jin Clan!”

The young man nodded, his expression filled with deep agreement.

“However, this person was able to kill Shaojian, so his abilities are definitely not weak. You can’t be careless either,” the old man said.

The young man revealed a confident smile, and said, “Fourth Grandfather, don’t forget that I’m in the Enlightenment Tier. Even the so-called freak, Hong Tianbu, can only kneel down in front of me.”

He was Jin Shaohuang, and it was clear from his name that the Jin Clan had high hopes for him?.
