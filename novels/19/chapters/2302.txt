Chapter 2303 Cooperation

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

After hearing Wally’s long and winding answer, everyone started to feel slightly dizzy again. However, they at least learned two things.

Firstly, hel was indeed from the Dark Inverse Realm. However, he wasn’t born from parents or born from heaven and earth. Instead, he was artificially constructed. In reality, he was also a War Soldier. It was just that

he could speak and think. He arrived here long ago, more than 35 epochs ago.

Secondly, he was willing to peacefully coexist with Ling Han and the others.

Of course, it was also possible that his willingness to coexist was a trap, with the aim to infiltrate their group and strike at an opportune moment.

All was fair in war; all tactics would be used in war.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’m also a proponent for peace. Welcome, welcome.”

Everyone shook their heads upon hearing this. Ling Han never hesitated when killing others, yet he was calling himself a proponent for peace?

Wally looked at Ling Han, and said, “I need to perform an evolution. However, I’m missing some critical materials. Your sword is coincidentally one of the critical materials. Can you give it to me?”

F*ck! This dude had quite the big appetite. They had just met, yet he was already eyeing the Divine Demon Sword.

Ling Han was curious, and he asked, “You can refine this sword?”

Wally didn’t reply, and it was as if he were pondering something. After a while, he said, “According to my calculations, I can completely absorb the material essence of this sword in 9367 years, 36 days, 8 hours, 10

minutes, and 34 seconds.

“However, I’ve discovered that this sword also has the ability to evolve. If it evolves again, the time needed for me to absorb it will increase exponentially. Once it evolves to the pinnacle level, I’ll be unable to refine it.”

This person was fairly honest.

Ling Han was surprised by what he heard. When ordinary people spoke about time using years as units, they would only say things like 2,300 years or 15,000 years. They wouldn’t give a more specific number. However,

not only did this person give the exact number of years, he even gave the exact number of days and so on.

However, Ling Han wasn’t familiar with the concept of minutes and seconds2. He didn’t know what these units represented.

However, this was enough to illustrate one thing—Wally was incredibly rigorous with details.

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “I have great uses for this sword, so I can’t give it to you.”

Wally was neither frustrated nor angered. “There is nothing that can’t be exchanged. It’s just that I haven’t offered anything of an equal value.”

“When you arrived, you said that you could clear up our confusion?” Ling Han said.

“The aura of your life force, and of these three female living beings”—Wally pointed at Hu Niu, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou—”is different from everyone else, so I think that—”

“Ahem!” Ling Han coughed loudly, cutting Wally off. He then turned to Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others, and said, “Sorry, but can you guys please step away for a moment?”

“Why?” someone asked, clearly unhappy with this request. Wally was a special War Soldier from the Dark Inverse Realm, so they could definitely accomplish a great feat if they brought him back to the academy.

Ling Han was trying to steal this accomplishment for himself?

“If you don’t want to die, it’s best that you obey my words,” Ling Han said with a smile. Killing intent flashed across his eyes.

He certainly wasn’t joking. If Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others learned the truth about his origins from the Celestial Realm, he definitely wouldn’t show them any mercy. He would erase any potential trouble.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe gestured with her hands, and everyone walked very far away.

However, Ling Han still summoned a wall of Regulations just in case. This way, their conversation wouldn’t travel outside. As such, Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop even if they

wanted to.

“Continue,” he said to Wally.

Wally showed no signs of impatience, and it was as if he wouldn’t be affected even if he were to wait for an exorbitantly long time.

Thinking about this, however, it made sense. After all, he had already remained here for more than 35 epochs. This was an unfathomably long time.

“The aura of your respective life force is similar to the living beings of the dimension that I come from,” Wally said. “Moreover, the potential contained by your life force is immense. It possesses the ability to evolve

boundlessly, so I’ve decided to cooperate with you.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I initially thought that you were only interested in my sword.”

“That’s indeed also one of the reasons,” Wally replied in a calm voice. “I still wish that you can give the sword to me so that I can obtain a critical material for my evolution.”

He still hadn’t given up yet.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Give up on the sword; I won’t give it to you.” He had sacrificed so much time and effort to raise the Divine Demon Sword to the level of Divine Metal, so how could he offer it for a

trade?

Wally didn’t appear disappointed. In fact, he always appeared expressionless, with no change in expression at all. “According to my calculations, my chance of evolving will be far greater if I return to the Dark Inverse

ealm.

“We can cooperate,” it continued. “We can return to my world together. Moreover, I also want to go to higher-level dimensions where I can continue to evolve.”

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Sure thing. However, do you know how to leave this place?”

“Easy,” Wally replied with a nod.

“Okay, then let’s leave here first. When the time is right, we’ll go to the Dark Inverse Realm,” Ling Han said.

He removed the wall of Regulations, and called Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others back over.

Wally was responsible for leading the way. His entire body glowed, and he now looked like the War Soldiers from before. However, the light that he emitted was relatively more natural and gentle. It was as if he were

truly a living being who could glow naturally.

Moreover, torches were useless in this area as they could only illuminate an area of less than 15 centimeters in radius. Only War Soldiers like these could act as genuine light sources.

Everyone followed Wally. They didn’t know what kind of agreement Ling Han and Wally had come to, so they were all extremely curious. However, no one dared to ask Ling Han.

Wally was clearly someone who could endure loneliness, and he didn’t speak a single word the entire journey.

It was ultimately Ling Han who couldn’t endure this, and he asked, “Is the transformation of the War Soldiers and the precious armor in the valley all related to you?”

“That’s right,” Wally said with a nod. “I reconstructed the metallic tools of the indigenous people, and activated the Void Particle Energy within them. However, the craftsmanship of these metallic tools was too poor, so

I was unable to completely activate the Void Particle Energy. Otherwise, I would have destroyed their internal structure.”

Everyone was astonished upon hearing this. They had wanted to discover the secrets behind the precious armor and the War Soldiers, and the answer actually lay with this seemingly human person? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What’s Void Particle Energy?” Ling Han asked.

“One of the ultimate energy types of the Genesis World,” Wally replied.

This kind of explanation couldn’t satisfy Ling Han. However, he understood what the Genesis World represented. Since the Void Particle Energy was an ultimate energy of the Genesis World, it most likely belonged to a

very lofty level.

Ling Han proceeded to ask for more specific details about the Void Particle Energy. However, Wally was honest with his reply, and he revealed that he still didn’t have the ability to interact with Void Particle Energy,

because his level of being was still too low.

“However, the potential of your life force is absolutely incredible. You have an 89.4336 percent chance of evolving to that level,” Wally said.

Ling Han’s interest was piqued, and he asked, “Then what about them?” He pointed at Hu Niu and the others.

Wally looked at Bewitching Maiden Rou first, and a beam of green light suddenly shot out from his eyes. Everyone was startled, and they thought that he was suddenly going to attack them. However, the green light

wasn’t destructive at all, and it started to scan Bewitching Maiden Rou up and down.

After a while, Wally said, “Her Vitality Index is 2684, and her Evolution Index is 8.”

Everyone exchanged glances. Vitality Index? Evolution Index? What in the world did this mean?
