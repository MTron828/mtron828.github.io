2989 Sudden Appearance of Extermination

The two great Seventh Tiers were about to join forces, and taking into account Golden Silk Moth that was suppressed by Ling Han, there were a total of three Seventh Tiers on their side.

What was even more frightening was that there were two of them that were true Seventh Tier elites that were undying and indestructible. They couldn’t be killed, couldn’t be wounded, and could only be suppressed. How could this be resolved?

How was Ling Han supposed to deal with this?

Xin Qihu, Lin Youlian, and Wu Haoyang were also looking at Ling Han, wanting to see Ling Han’s choice.

The wisest course of action was naturally to turn around and leave.

Ling Han’s battle prowess was definitely stronger compared to any one of the three of his opponents, but Ling Han’s physique was a shortcoming. With one against three, a drawn-out battle would definitely result in his loss.

Really, there was no need to resort to such brute force.

However, without waiting for Ling Han to express his stand, or for Feng Wuding and Ten Thousand Shadows to move, a terrifying aura spread out, and another Seventh Tier elite appeared.

Everyone turned to look in the direction of the aura. In the blink of an eye, a beautiful black figure had appeared.

Instantly, everyone’s expression froze, revealing an incredibly solemn mien.

Extermination, it was actually Extermination.

Unlike in the past, the current Extermination was cold and noble, her eyes extremely deep, exuding an incomparable intelligence. She was completely different from the previously memoryless, blank-faced, self-proclaimed Niu, Jue Huo.

A man’s name was like a tree’s shadow; who was Extermination?

The culprit behind the destruction of the Genesis World of the last era!

Now that such a vicious person had appeared, who would not feel uneasy?

Everyone involuntarily stood in a row. The internal conflicts between them could be discussed later. Now, they had to fight together against this absolutely great enemy.

“Ling Han, let go of Brother Golden Silk Moth!” Ten Thousand Shadows shouted.

Ling Han smiled calmly. “If we fight, I will naturally let him go.”

He wasn’t an ignorant person. If this Extermination had gone down the old path, he would have had to do his best to eliminate her. However, if this Extermination had changed her mind now, and no longer planned to devour the Genesis World, then what need was there for him to expend so much effort?

In any case, Seventh Tiers were undying and indestructible. Even if he was thrown out in a chaotic battle, there was no need to worry about Golden Silk Moth sustaining any injury.

“Ling Han, you don’t care about the big picture, you’re completely a vile character!” Feng Wuding also shouted loudly.

Ling Han ignored him and simply stared at Extermination. This was the real opponent.

Her beautiful eyes swept over them, and wherever her eyes passed, everyone would feel a chill, and they almost felt as if their skin was about to split apart.

Ling Han, Xin Qihu, and the others were still fine, but Ten Thousand Shadows had cold sweat dripping down his forehead. He was a Seventh Tier, and his physique should be invincible. Why did he feel a tearing pain?

Was this because Extermination was too strong, so strong that even the physique of a Seventh Tier elite could be shaken?

No, no, no. This should be because his cultivation level was still too weak, and he had not reached the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, cultivating his physique to perfection. Otherwise, Lin Luo and the others would have long since died after battling with Hysteria for so long.

With this thought, Ten Thousand Shadows finally felt slightly at ease. Otherwise, he would definitely have broken into a run and fled by now. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

…Previously, when he had faced Ling Han, he had already run once, so what would it matter if he ran again?

“What do you want?” Xin Qihu asked.

He was very bold. In front of Extermination, he actually dared to open his mouth and question her. His tone was also calm and composed, showing fully the demeanor of a supreme prodigy.

On the other hand, there was an indescribable fear in Feng Wuding’s eyes.

For the people of the Genesis World, Hysteria was the most terrifying, but for the people from the Genesis World of the last era, it was Extermination that was the most terrifying.

Feng Wuding, for example, had listened to how Extermination had grown up to be so strong, so cruel, so terrifying. The image of her being like a Heavenly Demon had long since been ingrained into his bones, and now that he had seen her with his own eyes, it naturally made him involuntarily feel fear.

This was the difference among prodigies. One’s natural talent might be high, but it did not mean that one’s willpower was as strong as iron.

Extermination withdrew her gaze, and completely ignored Xin Qihu. Instead, she delivered a palm strike at the ground. Boom, the ground instantly caved in, revealing a massive deep pit. It was dark like the mouth of a great beast, and was just about to swallow all life.

Xiu, she threw herself in. Her figure was exquisitely beautiful, causing one’s imagination to run wild.

However, those who knew her identity probably wouldn’t dare to even think about it, right?

Everyone looked at each other, none of them knowing what Extermination was playing at.

Why had such a powerful Seventh Tier come here?

Below the 33rd level, the fundamental particles formed a wall. Wasn’t it that even Seventh Tiers couldn’t pass through? Could it be that Extermination wanted to pass through?

And what was her motive?

Xiu, xiu. Another two powerful auras surged past, and Zhou Heng and Chu Hao had arrived together.

“Was it Extermination?” They grasped the aura of this place, and their expressions were extremely solemn.

Xin Qihu and the others all nodded. Even though they had nine people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess here, they were all newly advanced. If they really faced Extermination, aside from those Seventh Tier elites who could not die, the others would all be blasted into smithereens. And even if it was Seventh Tier elites, they would definitely be suppressed. Who knew, they might never see the light of day again.

…Extermination was actually this strong.

Hence, the fact that Extermination didn’t make a move just now was really baffling, and made people feel a lingering fear.

“Strange, why has Extermination come here?” Zhou Heng murmured.

“Could it be that she has changed her purpose, and no longer wants to devour the Genesis World?” Chu Hao also said.

Everyone looked at each other, none of them knowing what the meaning was behind Extermination’s actions.

“Let’s go back. Even peak-stage Seventh Tiers won’t be able to pass through the blockade below. It’s meaningless to stay here,” Chu Hao said.

“Yes.” Xin Qihu, Lin Youlian, and Wu Haoyang were all very respectful. Firstly, they were Sixth Tiers, and secondly, Chu Hao and Zhou Heng were both extremely powerful characters. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, their strength was not much worse off, and deserved their respect.

However, Feng Wuding didn’t think much of Chu Hao and Zhou Heng. Coming from the Genesis World of the last era, he had a natural feeling of superiority, and it was unknown where his confidence came from.

“Brother Chu, Brother Zhou, Golden Silk Moth is still in the hands of this brat. Please interfere and convince him to let him go!” Ten Thousand Shadows suddenly spoke up.

“That’s right. Now, with Hysteria in front of us and Extermination behind us, we need to work together. How can we allow our personal grudges to blind us?” Feng Wuding also spoke up.

Ling Han raised his eyes to look at Feng Wuding, and killing intent rose up in his heart.

Feng Wuding provoked him time and time again, and in the end, he managed to survive. This wasn’t because Ling Han was so easy to deal with, but rather because Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the others all thought that Feng Wuding had a bright future ahead of him, and would become one of the main forces fighting against Hysteria. They hoped that Ling Han could join forces with Feng Wuding, and had a strong hope for that.

Due to his respect for Zhou Heng, Lin Luo, and the others, Ling Han had repeatedly held back. However, seeing Feng Wuding jump around like this, Ling Han finally lost his patience.

‘F*ck! I don’t care anymore! There’s only one word for this—die!’

Ling Han’s index finger twitched slightly, but he did not make a move. With Zhou Heng and Chu Hao present, he would definitely not be able to kill Feng Wuding. No matter what, he would definitely give them some face.

In that case, he would just wait until later. In any case, there was still a lot of time.
