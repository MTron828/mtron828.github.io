2678 The wrath of an ordinary man

This was the second time that Lin Piaoxue had said these words.

The first time, He Yufeng was just curious and a little apprehensive, but the second time this sentence was uttered, he actually felt a chill rise within him.

Although it was only one move, he had already noticed the disparity between himself and Lin Piaoxue.

He wasn’t strong enough.

!!

This was because he had relied on the accumulation of resources and extremely long periods of cultivation in seclusion to break through to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Of course, he also possessed natural talent. Otherwise, no matter the amount of resources used or the length of time spent in painstaking cultivation, it would also be in vain. However, his opponent had broken through in bloody battles, with martial intent that couldn’t be faked and was full of resolve and bloodlust.

When compared, He Yufeng was like a flower seedling in a greenhouse, while the other party was like a towering tree that had weathered the storms. If the two of them were to battle, he would lose disastrously. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He was just lacking in experience. If he could exchange blows with a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate more often, then his battle prowess would definitely increase rapidly, and he would not lose to the other party.

However, he wasn’t her match right now.

Therefore, he had to respectfully give her face.

Just like before, He Yufeng could ignore the rules of the martial academy and deal with whomever he wanted, and even publicly announce he would kill Ling Han. Why was he allowed to be so insolent? Strength! The same was true now—his strength wasn’t as great as Lin Piaoxue’s, so he had to admit defeat; otherwise, even if Lin Piaoxue decided to strike and beat the crap out of him, so what?

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was just a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. When facing an existence of the same level, he had to be apprehensive and even bow to her superior strength.

“For Miss Lin’s sake, I will spare the brat this once!” He glanced at Ling Han, cold light flickering in his eyes.

This person had caused him to completely lose face; naturally, this made him furious. He might not be able to kill him this time, but the next time… Lin Piaoxue couldn’t possibly stay by Ling Han’s side all the time, right?

Tomorrow, he would kill this person!

“Get lost!” He Yufeng waved Ling Han away in dismissal; what somebody didn’t see couldn’t hurt them.

Everyone was feeling rueful. Ling Han was indeed born under a lucky star. First, the Wang Clan personally stepped forward to take care of him, then he was protected by an elite like the large black dog, and finally a mysterious Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was helping him out. One might well ask, was there any other Seventh Heaven Celestial King who had such prestige?

There wasn’t a single person who felt that Ling Han should feel aggrieved.

What was there to be aggrieved about?

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was forced to back down; surely your stature was soaring sky-high.

After this incident, Ling Han’s fame would definitely rise to the next level, although it was on account of others.

Ling Han moved, but to everyone’s surprise, he didn’t turn around. On the contrary, he strode towards He Yufeng until the two were only three meters apart, then stopped, and said, “Although I am merely at the Seventh Heaven, and clearly not a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate’s match, but the wrath of an ordinary man can still cause blood to splash three feet!”

He said these words in a very low voice, letting out the anger that he had been suppressing for most of the day, and everyone couldn’t help but be emotionally moved.

‘But… what do you plan on doing?’

Challenging a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

Ling Han paused for a while, and then said, “I would like to spar with Heavenly Venerate He for 10 moves!”

As soon as these words were uttered, everyone was dumbfounded, and many people actually wondered if there was something wrong with their ears to have heard such preposterous words.

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King actually challenged a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

Gasp!

However, big shots such as Du Shiyi and A’mu showed admiration.

Precisely as Ling Han had said, when an ordinary man was angered, he could cause blood to splash three feet.

If Ling Han had just swallowed his anger, it would have been a wise move, but that would make them classify him as inferior. Although he would not be despised, he would not be regarded as one of them, either.

To spar for 10 moves; his voice rang out resoundingly!

I was at the Seventh Heaven, and naturally would not be a match for a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, but I did have my pride, and would definitely not allow you to bully and humiliate me.

Lin Piaoxue’s eyes lit up as well. Although she had come out to help Ling Han, it was only because of her father’s orders. She didn’t have any favorable impression of Ling Han, but, of course, neither did she bear any ill will against him. He was just someone she saw on the streets; there wasn’t any feeling whatsoever.

But at this moment she somewhat understood why someone as powerful as her father would have such high regard for Ling Han.

Just this courage of his was definitely worth her trip.

She was keenly interested, and wanted to know whether Ling Han was simply an ordinary man being angered and blinded by his anger, which led him to overestimate his own abilities and issue a challenge, or he really had a trump card up his sleeve, and was confident he could withstand 10 moves against He Yufeng.

The most furious of all, of course, was He Yufeng.

The dignified Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was actually challenged by a Seventh Heaven Celestial King!

Of course, he could have killed Ling Han with a single palm strike, but for a Celestial King to dare to challenge a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, it was tantamount to the latter’s dignity being ruthlessly stabbed and scraped in one blow.

He Yufeng took a deep breath, and said, “What an ignorant brat! Well, I will allow you to make nine moves first, and when you get to the 10th move… I will make you understand what is reverence!” He made up his mind to kill Ling Han on the spot at the 10th move, and not give Lin Piaoxue a chance to extend a helping hand.

It couldn’t be helped; who asked this brat to challenge a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

The prestige of Heavenly Venerate couldn’t be violated!

Ling Han smiled lightly. He didn’t bring out the Divine Demon Sword. He just shook his hands and squeezed them into fists. The Nine Transformations Divine Scroll was circulating, and his battle prowess was increasing wildly.

Currently, Ling Han’s conventional battle prowess has reached the peak of the Ninth Heaven, and then being magnified by the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, his battle prowess could at least temporarily be comparable to that of a supreme monarch star at the peak of the Ninth Heaven, or even stronger.

“Kill!”

Ling Han charged forward, his fists striking furiously.

Even if he was only a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, did it mean that he had no temper, and could be humiliated by others?

As for the two elites of the Wang Clan, they were injured by He Yufeng on Ling Han’s account, and the large black dog was almost seriously wounded. Why should innocent people be implicated?

Just because He Yufeng was strong?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han struck furiously using both fists with enormous strength.

Everyone was stunned—was Ling Han really a Seventh Heaven Celestial King? How come it felt like he was stronger than a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

However, what was even more terrifying was He Yufeng. He crossed his hands behind his back, and no matter how Ling Han struck him furiously, he was like a boulder that wouldn’t budge, making people feel despair at the situation.

This was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, who had broken away from the Celestial King Tier and Regulations, and ascended to a kind of height that a Celestial King could only look up to.

“Is your strength only this much?” He Yufeng sneered.

Lin Piaoxue secretly shook her head, Ling Han’s current battle prowess was indeed extraordinary; if he was at the cultivation level of Ninth Heaven Celestial King, then after channeling this secret technique, it would really be possible to hurt a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. However, Ling Han was merely at the level of Seventh Heaven after all. Such an attack would make any Ninth Heaven Celestial King apprehensive, and even not dare face this kind of attack head-on, but it was still a long way off from dealing with a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

The seventh move, eighth move, and ninth move!

He Yufeng smiled lightly, and countered Ling Han with a strike of his palm. “Ant, you take a blow from me as well!”

Boom, when the strike was unleashed, heaven and earth almost ruptured.

Lin Piaoxue could not find a reason to lend a hand, as it was Ling Han who said to spar for 10 moves. If he was killed by He Yufeng, that would be what he had brought upon himself.

How could a Heavenly Venerate be provoked?

Ling Han didn’t think of retreating. He gave a loud roar, his eyes flashed fiercely, his face was full of determination, and his right fist opened and spread out to form a palm strike, and nine-colored divine lightning flashed, striking fiercely towards He Yufeng.

Pa, pa, pa, as he unleashed this palm strike, his right arm began to rupture; all the blood vessels exploded at the same time, and skin and flesh flew, leaving only the bare bones as Ling Han charged forwards relentlessly.

The wrath of an ordinary man.
