Chapter 3566: Starting with you

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

This was a short sword, no more than three inches long. It was completely silver in colour, and there were even glowing patterns on it.

This was a Spiritual Power Spirit Tool. It was activated to six times the speed of sound, and was astonishingly fast.

However, the Seventh Imperial Prince did not throw out his sword first. Relying on Spiritual Power alone, though it did have an unexpected effect, speed had not soared to the extreme. Otherwise, he would definitely be able to reach ten times the speed of sound.

Ling Han smiled. Though he had already struck out with both hands, and could not possibly turn back around to save him, he still had other tricks up his sleeve.

He opened his mouth and spat out a golden sword.

Ding!

The golden sword crashed into the short sword, instantly causing the short sword to tilt. Losing its accuracy, it streaked past Ling Han’s ear.

“What!” The Seventh Imperial Prince was shocked. How the f***** could you spit out a sword from your mouth? Are you a sideshow?

That short sword was stabbed into the pillar behind Ling Han, and was still slightly trembling.

It was obviously not a treasure like the Heavenly Pattern Jade. Otherwise, even if it weighed 5,000kg, it didn’t need to weigh 5,000kg, it only needed to weigh a few kg, and smashing over at six times the speed of sound, it was guaranteed that this stone pillar would shatter on the spot.

Of course he knew from its collision with the golden sword that this sword was only about toog in weight, and extraordinarily light. Otherwise, it would not be suitable to be powered by Spiritual Power.

This sword was extremely sharp, and was also extremely sturdy. Otherwise, it would not have been able to pierce into the stone pillar. Instead, it would have broken.

Thus, though this was far less valuable than the Heavenly Pattern Jade, it was still an extraordinary Spiritual Power Spirit Tool.

“Your Imperial Highness, do you want to assassinate the Chief of the Foreign

Affairs Department?” Ling Han asked calmly.

This was a very serious crime. The Foreign Affairs Department had been personally appointed by Chen Fengyan. If it was known that the Seventh Imperial Prince had attempted to assassinate the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department, then to say nothing of the fact that he could no longer think of claiming the throne, it was even possible that he himself would be stripped of his position as Imperial Prince and demoted to a commoner.

-Utter nonsense!” The Seventh Imperial Prince declared coldly, “It was clearly you who wanted to imprison me. I was merely defending myself.

-He, Your Imperial Highness had best surrender obediently.” Ling Han moved again This time, he had finally gotten a bit serious. His abilities were on full display, and that was not something that the Seventh Imperial Prince could contend against at all.

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s strength lay in his Spiritual Power. At present, he could only use Spiritual Power as a weapon, and counterattack against Ling

Han.

Unfortunately, his strongest point against Ling Han did not have the slightest advantage. The Spiritual Power of both sides tied, and in terms of battle prowess, how could the Seventh Imperial Prince possibly be a match for Ling

Han?

In less than ten moves, the Seventh Imperial Prince was captured by Ling Han.

Ling Han recalled that this Imperial Prince was skilled in Spiritual Power. Even if his arms and legs were bound, it should not be too difficult for him to escape. Thus, he took out the broken piece of the tombstone, and smashed it at his head.

Pa, the Seventh Imperial Prince fainted resentfully.

On the second day, Ling Han locked the Seventh Imperial Prince in a cage and displayed him at the entrance of the Foreign Affairs Department. At the side was a list of the Seventh Imperial Prince’s crimes.

Ling Han also issued a final warning to the other Imperial Princes, telling them to hand over the extortion profits and they would be dealt with lightly. Otherwise, when the Foreign Affairs Department came to call them to an accounting, the Seventh Imperial Prince would be a good example.

When they heard the news, the whole Imperial Capital was in an uproar. Towards Ling Han, everyone only had one word, and that was concede defeat. They had no choice but to concede. This guy was indeed outrageously bold, daring to make a move on even the Seventh Imperial Prince.

It should be known that ever since the news that Chen Fengyan was a Spirit Transformation True Lord, everyone’s admiration for this Holy Emperor had naturally increased countless times over. As it turned out, this was the strongest existence on the Celestial Sea Planet.

Precisely because of this, the Imperial Princes’ status naturally rose accordingly.

But now?

Ling Han actually dared to make a move on an Imperial Prince. Furthermore, it was not just a beating, but rather imprisonment for public display.

Do you really think that Chen Fengyan would still indulge you by doing this? The Eldest Imperial Prince and the other Imperial Princes were all furious.

They were all members of this special group, and since Ling Han dared to make a move on Seventh, he naturally would also dare to make a move on them.

This, this could not be tolerated!

Just when the Imperial Capital was in an uproar, Ling Han left the Imperial Capital extremely leisurely, heading towards the Seven Shattering Sect.

This was the first sect they had to visit. The sect master’s name was Pang Haifeng, and he was a Foundation Building Tier elite that had built foundations of Heavenly Dao.

in the sects that had previously submitted, the sect masters were basically all Foundation Building Tier elites that had built foundations of human Dao. Thus, if they could subdue the Seven Shattering Sect this time, it would have extraordinary significance.

“Aren’t you afraid of offending His Majesty by treating the Seventh Imperial Prince like this?” Princess Bixiao asked. The two of them travelled on foot.

Actually, Princess Bixiao already had the ability to fly on the battle hammer, but she had just gotten hold of that battle hammer. Firstly, she had not used it proficiently yet, and secondly, a beautiful woman was flying on a battle hammer. This scene was a little painful to the eye.

In any case, flying on a Spirit Tool was not much faster than her running on foot like this. As long as there was no terrain factor, running was practically no different from flying.

Moreover, she could fly, but what about Ling Han?

Let’s run together.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “It’s fine. With His Majesty’s wisdom, he will definitely understand my painstaking efforts.”

Princess Bixiao shook her head, and said, “Although His Majesty holds you in high regard, you have to understand that His Majesty and the Seventh Imperial Prince are truly family. You’re an outsider, after all.

Ling Han snickered. Chen Fengyan actually dared to flip out at him? In terms of seniority, he was Chen Fengyan’s uncle. So what if he disciplined his unfilial son on Chen Fengyan’s behalf?

If Chen Fengyan dared to make a move on him, then when Brother Monkey escaped, he would definitely beat the crap out of this Holy Emperor.

“What is it? Are you worried about me?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Princess Bixiao scoffed and said, “You’re the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department, after all. I’m afraid that after you die, the Foreign Affairs Department will be removed. If that happens, won’t I lose my job?” “Hehe, just say it out loud if you care about me. I’m very popular,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Princess Bixiao rolled her eyes repeatedly, “You are popular? Can you not make me laugh to death?”

If one went to the Imperial Capital and asked who was the most hated, the answer would definitely be Ling Han.

Ling Han sighed, “Those who are not envied are mediocre.”

When Princess Bixiao saw how Ling Han could still joke so easily, she could only think that he indeed had absolute confidence that dealing with the Seventh Imperial Prince would not bring him any trouble.

After the two of them travelled for a few days, the Seven Shattering Sect was already within sight.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ordinary sects would either be built in the mountains, or on the banks of a river, next to the mountains and next to the water, but the Seven Shattering Sect was built on a plain, which was very strange©.

This time, it was only Ling Han and the Demon Race Princess. They arrived at the entrance, and announced their identities. They wanted to see Pang Haifeng. The Seven Shattering Sect had practically staked a claim over the entire plain. As the territory of the sect, ordinary people were strictly forbidden from approaching, which also led to the forced relocation of the herdsmen that had originally been living here.

After a while, a tall, slender man with bewitching features walked out. He swept an eye over Ling Han and the princess, then said indifferently, “My Master is presently cultivating in seclusion. The two of you had best come back after a year and a half.”

A year and a half?

Ling Han chuckled, “Don’t get it wrong. We have come on behalf of the Dark North Nation, and on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Department, not to seek an audience with Pang Haifeng! Tell him to come out immediately, or we will raze the Seven Shattering Sect to the ground!”
