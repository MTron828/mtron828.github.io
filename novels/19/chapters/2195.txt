Chapter 2196: Saintly Origin Academy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han moved. This was the suppression of the Immortal Palace Tier against Dividing Soul Tier. How could Zhan Fei and his group possibly be a match?

In just an instant, all five of them were killed. They didn’t even get the chance to use their trump cards.

“Let’s go!” Ling Han grabbed everyone. His figure flashed using the Void Space, and very quickly disappeared from sight.

Only a few minutes after they had left did Ascending Origin Tier elites come belatedly. They could only look at the blood pooled all over the ground, as well as the spiritual pieces that had not yet dissipated, screaming, and unwilling to return to the heaven and earth. However, this was destined to be wasted effort. Without a physical body, whole spirits could not linger for too long, what more when they were just pieces.

After Ling Han traveled for a very long while, he finally let everyone down, including Yan Xianlu and the others. Ji Wuming had given him some face, and had not made a move on those close to him—perhaps he, too, knew that if he’d made a move on these people, Ling Han would definitely have moved to stop him, and the both of them would’ve been embroiled in a fierce battle ahead of time. In that case, Ji Wuming naturally would not have been able to hunt down others.

“Brother Ling, do you have any plans of returning to the Eastern Celestial Realm after this?” Yan Xianlu and the other prodigies from the Eastern Celestial Realm all asked.

Ling Han shook his head. He was going to change his appearance after this, and enter into the Imperial Void Sect. His ultimate goal was the Sealed Emotion Palace. Hence, he naturally could not return to the Eastern Celestial Realm.

“Ling Han, we will wait for your return. The alliance cannot lack a leader, naturally,” Cheng Zixin said. By now, he was completely impressed with Ling Han.

“That’s right.” Fu Zhou nodded as well.

Ling Han thought for a moment. “I will find the time to make a trip back to the Eastern Celestial Realm. Before this, I will leave the matter of the alliance to you guys. I hope that you all, together with Yi, can improve your cultivation levels as soon as possible because there is not much time left for us.”

He was not a selfish person. By then, he would let everyone into the Black Tower, and enjoy the hundred thousandfold time acceleration effects.

Faced with the survival of the heaven and earth, all else could be set aside first.

Yan Xianlu and the others agreed, and then left. They could not stay for too long. After all, they still needed Celestial Kings to take them back, and how could they make a Celestial King wait for too long?

“Second Brother, are you returning to the Great Majestic Sect?” Ling Han asked.

“I’m fine with either. In any case, I am roaming around in my travels all for the sake of becoming stronger,” the Rain Emperor said very carelessly.

Ling Han nodded. The two brothers had finally reunited after over 10,000 years spent apart. He did not want to immediately separate with the second brother, either. No matter what, they had to stay together for a while longer.

“Fourth Brother, what are your plans?” the Rain Emperor asked him instead.

Ling Han naturally would not be hiding anything from the Rain Emperor, and spoke of how he was going to enter into the Imperial Void Sect.

“Then Second Brother will go with you,” the Rain Emperor replied. He, too, was extremely curious about Heavenly Venerable Tier, and saw it as a tall mountain that he wished to conquer.

Weng, right at this moment, multiple streaks of celestial light suddenly flashed in the skies, which then led to the appearance of a decree. It was entwined by nine streaks of celestial light, and then characters flashed out one after another. A boundless might spread out, as if it was the arrival of a Celestial King, looking down on the mass of common people.

A Celestial King Tier decree—one that was written by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at that.

Could it be that because Ji Wuming had committed mass slaughter, it had enraged a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and thus they’d written this decree as a warrant of arrest for him?

At this time, those characters stopped moving, and turned into words.

“The calamity will soon arrive, and great changes will occur. To ignite the sparks of our Celestial Realm, the Residual Green Flames Celestial King, together with 21 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, will establish the Saintly Origin Academy, nurturing exceptional prodigies to resist the storm of darkness that would be coming soon. Any who think themselves as having superior natural talent may advance to the Twin Horses Heavenly Realm, Lishui City, where there will be someone in charge of selections.”

These words stayed for about an hour’s time, and then the nine streaks of coloured light dispersed, completely disappearing without a trace.

Instantly, the entire Celestial Realm was in an uproar.

Right. This decree did not just appear above of Ling Han and his group, but rather in every corner of the Celestial Realm. Every single person of the Eastern and Western Celestial Realms could see it—even if they were blind, this was Regulations, and would directly enter into their mind’s eye.

No one doubted the authenticity of this decree, because the nine streaks of celestial light were a symbol unique to Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. And to say that any Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be bored to the point of using this as a prank, even if they fell for this deception, they should be feeling honored.

Ling Han and his group exchanged looks, a strong feeling of unease rising up in them.

First, it was the heaven and earth that had broken their own rules, allowing the Dragon’s Gate Mountain to appear ahead of time, and next a considerable number of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had established an academy together, gathering the exceptional prodigies of the world, intent on standing against the storm of darkness.

It should be known that before this, there were practically few that knew of the existence of the Foreign Realm, and that they were attempting to invade the Celestial Realm, and occupy this heaven and earth for their own. Though the decree had not clearly explained the origins of the storm of darkness, it had pointed out that the Celestial Realm was presently facing a great crisis.

What could this mean?

“The time that the Foreign Realm invades us may be far sooner than we have expected.” Ling Han pondered deeply.

“An unexpected change must have taken place in the Two Realm Passageway, causing this passageway to become even stabler, and also causing the Celestial Kings at the front lines to feel increased pressure,” the Empress deduced.

Hu Niu took a bite out of her chicken drumstick. “No matter what comes, Niu will beat them all down!”

The Rain Emperor said, “Then we should first check this Saintly Origin Academy out.”

“En!” Everyone nodded in agreement. As many as 22 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had moved together to set up an academy. Just how astounding was this? Merely in terms of backers, this had surpassed any great sect in this world.

“All right, we’ll first take a look at this Saintly Origin Academy.” Ling Han nodded as well. In this way, probably all the prodigies in the entire Celestial Realm would gather there. By then, he would be able to meet the most outstanding prodigies of the world.

As for the Imperial Void Sect… He’d just leave that for later. In any case, it would not be going anywhere.

However, they did not immediately set out to the Twin Horses Heavenly Realm, but rather went to find a Mystery Realm for Severing Mundane Tier.

…Helian Xunxue and the other women had been improved in all aspects, and had the confidence that they could strike the heaven and earth to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier. In the past, they had not dared to deliver this strike—not that they could not. Now, success would follow naturally when the conditions were right.

Meanwhile, the Rain Emperor first went to break through to the Heaven Soul. They all promised to meet again at Lishui City of the Twin Horses Heavenly Realm.

Thus, Ling Han brought the women with him, searching for the closest Severing Mundane Tier Mystery Realm that would be opening soon. Their luck was not too bad. A Severing Mundane Tier Mystery Realm would be opening 27 years later. They immediately made their way there. They spent over three years on the journey, then waited for another 20-odd years, and the women joined hands as they entered.

Ling Han could not do anything to help here, and could only wait outside.

Thankfully, two years later, not one of the women was missing, and they all walked out of the Mystery Realm. Furthermore, they had all broken through to the Severing Mundane Tier.

Ling Han naturally did not expect that they would all attain the Fifth Severance. It was already enough that they could successfully strike the heaven and earth.

They then headed towards the Twin Horses Heavenly Realm. This delay lasted over two decades, and in this time, a great many events had happened.

The most sensational event was naturally the establishment of the Saintly Origin Academy. It was indeed set up by over 20 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in cooperation, and those that would be enrolling were all exceptional prodigies of the generation. However, this was not just limited to cultivation. Prodigies of alchemy, geniuses of formations, and skilled artisans would also be included. As long as they had one particular field of expertise, they all had a chance of enrolling into the academy.

But no matter the case, the most famous naturally would be cultivation prodigies.

In these 20-plus years’ time, the Saintly Origin Academy had a few disciples whose names rang out loudly through the Celestial Realm, and it could practically be claimed that they were unknown to no one.

“F***, Ji Wuming actually managed to make his way in as well?” Ling Han was dumbfounded.
