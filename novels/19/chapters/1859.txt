Chapter 1860: Suppressing a Holy Son with just a flip of the hand

“Invincible is not mere empty words,” Bao Cheng said slowly.

If it was Yan Xianlu that had come, then he definitely could only admit his inferiority, but Zhao Qingfeng? That was only one of Yan Xianlu’s lackeys, and he was qualified to say that there was no one that could match him in the Severing Mundane Tier?

What a joke, then what were Holy Sons and Holy Daughters like them? Trash?

Zhao Qingfeng cast a look at Bao Cheng, showed a taunting smile, and said, “You do not yield?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

‘Of course I don’t!’

To say nothing of Bao Cheng, even the other Holy Son and Holy Daughter’s expressions were filled with defiance. ‘You are but a mere lackey, and you actually dare raise your head in front of us? You think that just because you have followed Yan Xianlu, you are a Monarch tier?’

“Of course not!” Bao Cheng humphed.

“The two of you also do not yield?” Zhao Qingfeng looked towards the other two.

“Humph!” This Holy Son and Holy Daughter both appeared to be very prideful. It was not worth their while to fall to the same level as a mere servant.

“If you do not yield, then come battle me. The reason I have come this time is to thrash such trash like you people!” Zhao Qingfeng declared without the slightest reservations, not giving any face at all to these Holy Sons and Holy Daughter.

Bao Cheng and his companions were naturally furious. ‘A mere follower like you actually dares speak to us like this way? What gives you the right?’

Zhao Qingfeng smiled slightly, the smile that turned up the corners of his lips filled with mockery, and he said, “Do you think that just anyone can be the Lord Holy Son’s subordinate? With your strength.... heh, you’re not even worthy of picking his shoes!”

Shua, Bao Cheng and the others stood up simultaneously, their faces filled with rage.

‘F***, we admit that we are no match for Yan Xianlu, yet you actually say that we are not even worthy of playing second fiddle or picking up his shoes? You are looking down on us too much, aren’t you?’

“Hehe, some people are in serious need of a lesson!” Bao Cheng walked towards Zhao Qingfeng, and crooked a finger. “Come, see how I shall beat you to submission!”

Zhao Qingfeng sneered, “You really have a lot of rubbish to say!”

It was true that Bao Cheng was very much angered, and even the other Holy Son and Holy Daughter showed expressions of fury. That was because they were treated with the same level of disdain. Meanwhile, Lu Xianming had absolutely no intention of stepping out to play mediator, and merely sipped his tea with a smile.

Sun Dong’s heart was filled with excitement as he watched. He had not thought that Zhao Qingfeng was so awesome. By himself alone, he actually dared to challenge three great Holy Sons and Holy Daughter, and more importantly, the former had said that he was going to deal with Ling Han.

He naturally hoped that Zhao Qingfeng was as strong as possible, and could crush Ling Han without much effort.

Zhao Qingfeng and Bao Cheng walked outside the main hall, and then flew into the air. The space in this fourth level was naturally protected by formations, and with their strength as Severing Mundane Tiers, there was no way that they could destroy this protective formation.

Fighting in midair was only so that the shock waves from their battle would not raze the structures here.

“Make your move!” Bao Cheng conducted himself with dignity. He was a Holy Son, while the other party was only a subordinate of Yan Xianlu. He had no wish to damage his own reputation.

Zhao Qingfeng bared his teeth in a grin. He suddenly made his move. Xiu, his figure suddenly disappeared from his original position. Then, he appeared in front of Bao Cheng, and shot out a punch.

“Regulations of Space!” Bao Cheng grunted, his expression shifting slightly. He had not thought that Zhao Qingfeng had actually grasped the rare Regulations of Space. This was a little unexpected.

However, he was a Holy Son, after all, and was an emperor tier himself. Though he was surprised, he did not panic. Using his forefinger and middle finger like a blade, he sliced out towards Zhao Qingfeng. Light flickered at the tips of his fingers, exuding a metallic air.

He was an Acute Metal Divine Fetus. The moment he activated the power of his bloodline, every single part of his body could be used like an indestructible weapon.

His strike was strong enough to split heaven and earth apart!

Yet Zhao Qingfeng was unafraid, and his punch still descended, clashing with Bao Cheng’s strike head-on.

Boom!

In a clash of power, Regulations exploded. This was a conflict between the Dao of two elites.

Xiu, Bao Cheng was immediately sent flying backwards, spitting out a mouthful of blood. His whole body was enshrouded in a shield of light that seemed close to collapsing. Zhao Qingfeng, on the other hand, was calm and composed, and had not retreated even half a step.

This scene caused the expressions of the other Holy Son and Holy Daughter to change greatly.

Too strong, too powerful—so much so that even Bao Cheng was defeated with a single strike.

Admittedly, this was because Bao Cheng had underestimated his opponent slightly, and had not expected that the latter was an expert in Regulations of Space, and was thus compelled into a head-on exchange of blows, but it should be known that he should be invincible among his peers as a Holy Son, and it would only be they that would be suppressing others.

But now, he had actually been defeated in a head-on confrontation.

Was this really a follower? He was stronger than even a Holy Son!

The moment Zhao Qingfeng made his move, his whole aura immediately underwent a drastic change. Previously, he was indifferent. Though he was also very arrogant, his attitude leaned more towards contempt. But after he made his move, he became incredibly cold and ruthless, exuding a killing intent that made one shiver.

Xiu, with another flash of his figure, he chased swiftly after Bao Cheng. Then, he made his move again, and shot out a punch that turned into a boundless descending mountain.

Bao Cheng could only take it head-on, but the result of taking it head-on was him throwing up blood madly again and the shield of light on him completely dispersing.

In an exchange of merely over a dozen moves, Bao Cheng was forcefully blasted down from the skies. He coughed up blood repeatedly, his vitality dropping to rock bottom.

Zhao Qingfeng was not ruthless. Crossing his arms behind back, he looked towards the other Holy Son and Holy Daughter, and asked, “Are you trash still unyielding?”

The two of them bore expressions of bitterness, and swallowed with extreme difficulty, but were completely unable to refute his words.

To become a Holy Son or Holy Daughter, it was a requirement to possess a Divine Fetus. Of course, there was also the extremely limited number of people whose natural aptitude was excellent. They clearly were not Divine Fetuses, yet the potential they displayed surpassed any Divine Fetus.

These two naturally were Divine Fetuses as well, but in front of Zhao Qingfeng, they knew that their Divine Fetuses were worth nothing!

Just like how Celestial Kings were divided into Nine Heavens, Divine Fetuses... also differed in strength.

Zhao Qingfeng was a Space Element Divine Fetus. Before Celestial King Tier, the power of Regulation he possessed was stronger than all the Five Elements. The two of them clearly had the same cultivation level, and their natural talent was about equal, but because he was a Space Element Divine Fetus, he was much stronger.

Actually, Bao Cheng was not as weak as he seemed, but he had not thought that he would actually encounter a Space Divine Fetus. Furthermore, he seemed to have reached Great Accomplishment at that. Once he had lost the chance to make the first move, he was directly beaten into crap.

However, these two assessed themselves. Even if they were now prepared, it would only be a matter of how many blows they could withstand. It was absolutely impossible for them to emerge victorious over Zhao Qingfeng.

...Zhao Qingfeng’s strength was unimaginable!

They all could not accept this easily. If it was said that Yan Xianlu could be that strong, they would have no objections, but he was only a mere subordinate, yet was still able to easily defeat them. This was something that they could not accept.

Then just how wide was the gap between them and Yan Xianlu?

“Brother Lu, we are taking our leave!” The other Holy Son and Holy Daughter’s expressions were dim. They had come to contest for the Dao Regulating Pill, but with Zhao Qingfeng, what need was there for them to seek their own humiliation here?

Lu Xianming only clasped his hands in farewell, but did not urge them to stay. Initially, they did not have much relation between them. If it were not for the Dao Regulating Pill, perhaps they would never have met in this lifetime.

After Bao Cheng awoke, he, too, left in misery and dejection.

Meanwhile, Zhao Qingfeng looked towards Sun Dong, and said, “Where is that person? Take me there!”

“Yes, Milord!” Surprised but delighted, Sun Dong hurriedly nodded. This lord was really very awesome, being capable of easily defeating even a Holy Son. In that case, what was Ling Han worth?

‘You are only the heir of a three-star force at most; could you compare to the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier-level force? You will definitely be crushed into dust.’

Lu Xianming chuckled, and said, “Then I, too, shall go and take a look.”

He might not need to be concerned about others, but Yan Xianlu was too strong. It was definite that he would become a Celestial King in the future, and he had to take advantage of this chance to develop amiable relations with him.
