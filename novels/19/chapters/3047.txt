3048 Putting On An Act

“Brother Ling, long time no see!” Lin Youlian was the first to greet him.

“Brother Ling!” Wu Haoyang also nodded. In the face of Ling Han’s invincible battle prowess, he had no choice but to address him as “Brother Ling.”

“Big Brother!” Bai Mifan jumped up, intending to hug Ling Han.

“Go away, go away, isn’t this disgusting!” Ling Han hurriedly pushed him away.

Xin Qihu, on the other hand, did not speak. He only looked at Ling Han.

Ling Han also looked over, and his eyes flashed in anger. “Sick Tiger, today, we’ll settle the score between us.”

“Is there any debt between us?” Xin Qihu pretended to be surprised and then nodded. “That’s true. It’s time to return the favor you owe me.”

“Hmm?” Ling Han’s gaze turned cold. Was this guy even more shameless than him?

“Brother Ling, you do have to thank Brother Xin,” Lin Youlian said.

What did this mean?

Ling Han looked towards Lin Youlian. When it came to the Lin Clan, he had always harbored an extremely favorable impression and gratitude. If not for the Lin Clan repeatedly helping him back then, perhaps he would not have been able to live to this day. At the very least, it would’ve been impossible for him to possess battle prowess that surpassed the peak stage of the Seventh Tier so quickly.

Therefore, he was willing to listen to Lin Youlian.

“I only found out not too long ago.” Lin Youlian smiled apologetically at Ling Han, and said, “The reason why Brother Xin has been targeting Brother Ling was actually because of my father and the other ultimate elites’ arrangements.”

“Why?” Ling Han asked in a low voice.

“Because for a prodigy like Brother Ling, only by giving you enough pressure would you be able to work hard and maintain motivation at all times,” Lin Youlian said.

Ling Han was astounded. Was that really the case?

“Brother Ling, think about it carefully. Although Brother Xin has repeatedly pressured you, has there ever been a time when you fell into a desperate situation?” Lin Youlian continued.

Ling Han thought to himself. In terms of Xin Qihu’s oppression of him, it was naturally the time when, at the beginning, he had been asked to carry out the raids behind enemy lines. However, because he had mastered the ability to travel between dimensions, this mission was obviously a close call.

It was only because he had Hysteria’s subordinates spying on him that he was almost killed by Hysteria.

“You have to know that when Chong Yan and the others ruled that you were a traitor, Lord Xin Fu voted against it,” Lin Youlian said as she continued to clear Xin Qihu’s name.

Indeed, Xin Qihu’s actions were a little contradictory. Previously, when Ling Han and Feng Wuding had been fighting fiercely, he had given up on defense and allowed others to bombard him. Even Xin Qihu had shifted his attack. Otherwise, even if he had killed Ling Han at that time, he could still have said that he had been unable to stop in time.

No.

Ling Han then looked at Xin Qihu. “The first time you fought with me, you were indeed filled with killing intent. That was absolutely not an act.”

Xin Qihu smiled lightly. “At that time, I did want to kill you. It was precisely because of this matter that Lord Lin Luo came to me and asked if I was willing to help carry out this plan.

“I agreed to it. However, I’ve also told Lord Lin that if I participated, I wouldn’t go easy on you. When it was time to attack, I wouldn’t show mercy. Otherwise, what kind of trash would I train?

“If he couldn’t even compare to me, Xin Qihu, what right would he have to save the Genesis World?”

He crossed his arms, looking very proud.

Ling Han didn’t say anything else. In truth, he believed it in his heart. This was the only explanation for the Xin Clan’s incomparably contradictory position.

Furthermore, it was indeed because of Xin Qihu that Ling Han had accumulated endless motivation. Otherwise, his cultivation level would not have advanced so quickly.

However, Xin Qihu’s current appearance was too cocky.

“I don’t believe you!” Ling Han said coldly. Boom, he released an endless aura, and even more so a baleful killing intent that was almost tangible, causing pain to spread throughout other people’s bodies.

One had to know that the people here were all Heavenly Venerates, and even they felt as if their entire bodies were being sliced by blades. It could be seen just how powerful Ling Han was, and just how intense his killing intent was.

Xin Qihu’s expression also changed. Although he possessed Seventh-Tier battle prowess, he was not an ultimate elite of Seventh Tier, and his physique had not reached the level of indestructibility.

If Feng Wuding died, so would he.

“Ling Han, at this point, I have no reason to lie to you!” he said loudly.

“I don’t care if you’re lying to me or not. Since you’ve made me unhappy, you’ll have to bear the consequences!” Ling Han charged out. Peng, his speed was too fast, and the space behind him instantly exploded.

He instantly appeared in front of Xin Qihu and punched him.

Peng!

Xin Qihu was instantly sent flying. So what if he had Seventh-Tier battle prowess? He had yet to reach the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. Moreover, so what even if he reached the peak stage of the Seventh Tier? Even someone as powerful as Chong Yan and the others had been single-handedly suppressed by Ling Han.

Ling Han chased after him, and his killing intent materialized. He extended his right hand again, and boundless power condensed, turning into a long sword that stabbed toward Xin Qihu.

Xin Qihu turned pale with fright. This attack… He could not block it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Despite not being able to, he still had to block it. Otherwise, he would die.

He roared and attacked with all his might. He used whatever secret techniques and Heavenly Venerable Seals he had, regardless of the consequences.

If he lost his life, everything would be over.

Lin Youlian, Wu Haoyang, and Bai Mifan also hurriedly made their moves, attacking Ling Han in an attempt to stop him from killing.

Unfortunately, even back when Ling Han was still a Fifth Tier, he could allow them to bombard him without getting injured, let alone now.

Within the same cultivation level, who could be a match against Ling Han?

No matter how freakish he was, it was impossible.

Peng, peng, peng, the attacks landed on Ling Han’s body and bounced back one after another, completely ineffective. Meanwhile, Ling Han merely shook the power of his fist, and Xin Qihu’s defense was like ice and snow meeting boiling water, immediately disintegrating.

Shua, the sword struck.

Xin Qihu couldn’t help but close his eyes. In that short instant, countless thoughts surfaced in his mind. In the end, it turned into a bitter smile.

…Hey, why didn’t he feel the pain he had imagined?

Xin Qihu couldn’t help but open his eyes, only to see Ling Han smiling at him. Meanwhile, the longsword condensed from fundamental power had long since disappeared.

‘F*ck, are you playing the fool with me?’

“Since you’ve put on an act to trick me, I’ll have to trick you once as well. Only then will I be able to call it even,” Ling Han said calmly.

Xin Qihu couldn’t help but feel gloomy. How could Ling Han’s acting be so realistic? He really thought that he was going to die just now.

Lin Youlian and the other two also heaved a sigh of relief. They were really afraid that Ling Han would kill Xin Qihu. If that happened, who knew how berserk Xin Fu would become.

Peng, right at this moment, Ling Han suddenly threw a punch, and it landed on Xin Qihu’s nose. Even with Xin Qihu’s physique, he still couldn’t withstand it, and blood instantly flowed from his nose.

He looked at Ling Han in surprise, his face full of innocence.

What was going on?

“Since you admit that you wanted to kill me the first time, how can I vent my anger if I don’t beat you up?” Ling Han said as he punched out repeatedly. Under the suppression of his strength, Xin Qihu simply had no power to retaliate, and could only get beaten up.

Lin Youlian and the other two wanted to dissuade Ling Han, but after thinking about it, they still didn’t make a move.

In any case, Ling Han wouldn’t kill anyone, so let him vent his anger.
