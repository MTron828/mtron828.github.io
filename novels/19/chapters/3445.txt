Chapter 3446: Battling Hong Tianbu

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

How are you worthy of being my equal?

Ling Han could say these words to 99% of the people in the Imperial Capital, and with his cultivation level, talent, as well as his outstanding accomplishments in alchemy and formations, there were really very few people that could be his equal.

However, Hong Tianbu was one of the very few exceptions. In fact, his current strength was even superior to Ling Han’s.

Thus, only Hong Tianbu should be qualified to look down on Ling Han, and not the other way around.

Hiss, this guy was really very bold, and was completely unwilling to suffer a loss either.

Hong Tianbu faltered slightly. He hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would actually dare to face him head-on.

He then laughed in spite of himself, and said, “Do you think that I am not qualified to be your equal?”

“You, are, unqualified!” Ling Han stated calmly. Just from the fact that the other had repeatedly used his cultivation level to oppress him, he felt that Hong Tianbu was unqualified.

If he discovered a young prodigy that could possibly match him in the future, he would definitely not take the approach of suppressing him. On the other hand, he might even help him. With a powerful competitor, he would not dare to slack off at all times.

But what had Hong Tianbu done?

He kept taking advantage of the fact that his cultivation level was higher to bully him!

What the heck.

Hong Tianbu’s expression changed slightly. He hadn’t thought that Ling Han would actually dare to speak to him like this. He stared at Ling Han, and his might gradually appeared. “Ling Han, you’ve forgotten yourself in your conceit!”

“Humph, in a battle of equals, are you a match for me?” Ling Han charged out. Absolute Fairness had already been activated.

Hong Tianbu exclaimed in shock. His cultivation level had actually plummetted.

From Enlightenment to Inscription, from Six Inscriptions to Five Inscriptions, Four Inscriptions… all the way down to Sixth Extreme.

However, right at this moment, his palm glowed slightly, causing his cultivation level to bounce back to the level of Inscription Tier. However, it was only the level of One Inscription.

Absolute Fairness could pull everyone’s cultivation level in the formation to the same major tier in cultivation level, but Hong Tianbu was too freakish. He could actually resist a portion of the formation’s might, and still stay a major tier higher than Ling Han. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Boom, Ling Han’s punch arrived.

Hong Tianbu tapped out a finger, calm and confident like a Celestial plucking a flower.

Peng! With a loud bang, Ling Han was immediately sent flying.

Hong Tianbu stood with his hands clasped behind his back, saying, “So it’s ‘Absolute Fairness’. However, in front of me, who can rival me at the same cultivation level?”

He didn’t mention at all that he was actually an Inscription Tier now, still holding firmly to the upper hand.

Ling Han somersaulted and landed on the ground. Da, da, da! There was blood dripping from his fist. Hong Tianbu’s finger from before had already wounded him.

This guy definitely didn’t have the cultivation level of Sixth Extreme.

Unless someone could also cultivate the Seventh Change, no one would be able to suppress him at the same cultivation level.

He suddenly recalled that there was a Primordial Beast’s eye in the palm of Hong Tianbu’s hand.

It must be this item that had affected a portion of the formation’s might, and that was why it was unable to weaken Hong Tianbu’s cultivation level to Extreme Bone Tier.

He activated his eye technique, and sure enough, five of the inscribed patterns on Hong Tianbu’s chest had already dimmed. However, one of them was still glowing.

This guy presently had the cultivation level of One Inscription.

Ling Han didn’t expose him. Within Absolute Fairness, it was naturally absolutely fair. If he insisted that Hong Tianbu was an Inscription Tier elite, who would believe him? They would only think that he was a sore loser.

Fine, One Inscription it was!

Ling Han took a deep breath, and charged out again. Boom, the murderous aura surged, and combined with Spiritual Power, blasted towards Hong Tianbu.

Even though Hong Tianbu was a freakish prodigy, he was still slightly distracted by the murderous aura. When he came to his senses, Ling Han’s fist had already smashed over.

He hurriedly counterattacked, and still tapped out a finger.

Peng!

Fist and finger collided. This time, the two of them each took a few steps back, and it was hard to decide who was stronger between the two of them.

Hong Tianbu’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. He had the advantage of a major tier in cultivation level, yet Ling Han had actually tied with him?

He knew that he had been affected by Ling Han’s murderous aura, and that was why he was unable to unleash his full power. However, what kind of mental state and cultivation level did he have that he would actually be affected by Ling Han’s murderous aura?

Hong Tianbu couldn’t help but feel a sliver of killing intent rise up in his heart. Ling Han made him feel threatened.

He humphed, and tapped out another finger. Another image of him appeared from his body, and he also tapped out a finger.

The aura of this projection was much more majestic. It was as if with just the tap of a finger, even if there was a star in front of him, it could only explode.

That was because this finger technique was called the Star Fragment Finger.

Ling Han activated the Demonic Monkey Fists and unleashed a murderous aura as usual. Only then did he greet the attack with his fist.

Even if Hong Tianbu was prepared, so what? He was still blasted to the point that he had lost grasp of his divine sense, causing the might of the finger technique to decrease greatly.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged another blow. The Demonic Monkey also shot out a punch at the shadow’s finger, as if there were two pairs of people fighting.

After this attack, Ling Han and Hong Tianbu both stepped back.

Hong Tianbu’s expression became even more solemn. He was already prepared this time, and his divine sense was still tightly guarding his mind. However, he was still affected.

It wasn’t like he hadn’t experienced Blood Transformation Tier before, so he was naturally aware of the murderous aura’s amazing effects. However, he couldn’t have cultivated it to such a terrifying extent.

“Hiss!”

“This is too shocking. Hong Tianbu and Ling Han are fighting, and it is actually hard to decide who is stronger between them.”

“I’ve always wanted them to battle at the same cultivation level, to see who’s more powerful. I’ve finally gotten my wish.”

“As expected of the twin prodigies of the Imperial Capital. They are both too powerful.”

Everyone cried out one after another. Previously, whether it was referring to Ling Han as the second Hong Tianbu, or placing the two of them at the same level, it was all based on deductions about the abilities of the two of them. Now, they were finally fighting.

However, these people didn’t know that Hong Tianbu actually had the advantage of a major tier in cultivation level. Otherwise, they would definitely grab their heads and exclaim in shock. How could Ling Han be freakish to this extent?

Hong Tianbu strode forward, and the power in his body surged. He was like a True Dragon that had been hibernating, and now, he was finally going to soar into the sky, baring his fangs and brandishing his claws.

“Come, let me take a good look at the so-called number one freakish genius of the Imperial Capital.” Ling Han laughed loudly, and stepped forward to greet him.

Hong Tianbu’s expression was calm, but there was killing intent hidden in his eyes. He continued to attack with his finger technique, but as he tapped out a finger, flames blazed, as if they could incinerate even heaven and earth.

Ling Han didn’t care, and a murderous aura shot out. He channeled the Demonic Monkey Fists, and fifty overlapping layers of power added with Frequency Attack, he began a powerful counterattack.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

It had to be admitted that Hong Tianbu was really too strong. Though he had been hit repeatedly by Ling Han’s murderous aura, and was greatly affected, causing his power to be not much different from Ling Han’s, even so, he was completely capable of fighting Ling Han to a tie.

He had grasped an astonishing secret technique, and as he tapped out a finger, it was capable of moving mountains and rivers. It was as if the heaven and earth were all on his side, and together with him, were suppressing Ling Han.

This cancelled out the might of Frequency Attack, and Hong Tianbu was also able to deliver fifty layers of stacked power, which was not the slightest bit inferior to Ling Han.

At this moment, it was hard to decide who was stronger between the two of them.

For the majority of spectators, they had enjoyed a battle that could be considered the strongest battle in Extreme Bone Tier, and had gotten enough of a show, but for Ling Han, the finishing line of his victory was getting further and further away.

That was because Absolute Fairness could only last for ten minutes.

What could he do?
