Chapter 1906: Ling Han ascends to the apex

“Holy Daughter Qin Guyu has concocted Earth Replenishment Pill. Among Two-Star alchemical pills, the difficulty level is high. The grade of the completed pill is Peak Grade, and First Refinement is ordinary, Second Refinement is ordinary,” the third alchemist reported.

As his words fell, a commotion rose up among the crowds.

For a Two-Star Alchemist to concoct an alchemical pill of high difficulty, and still actually manage to reach the extent of Peak Grade, this was too exaggerated.

Astonishing, too astonishing.

Even Grandmaster Zi Cheng showed an expression of appreciation, and said to Qin Guyu, “You have advanced into Dividing Soul Tier 300,000 years ago. Could it be that your first divided soul is an embodiment of one of the Five Elements of heaven and earth?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As expected of a Grandmaster Alchemist. He had immediately guessed the reason, but as for the exact elemental alignment, even he could not possibly make an accurate judgment.

“Yes!” Qin Guyu immediately replied respectfully. “My yang soul is the essence of Water and Wood.”

Essence of Water and Wood!

Everyone showed expressions of envy. This kind of yang soul definitely did not have the slightest benefit for battle or cultivation, but for alchemists, it was like a precious gift bestowed by the gods. Only a Fire and Wood divided soul, or Earth and Wood Divided Soul could match that.

This definitely could greatly add extra credit for her.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng paused slightly, and then said, “Comprehensive mark is 11.”

Qin Guyu was slightly disappointed, but now she shared first place with Lu Xianming, and had surpassed Ou Kan. Then, she really didn’t have any other rivals. In the future, it would be a contest between only her and Lu Xianming.

And she was a Water and Wood Dividing Soul Tier. As her cultivation level increased, the benefits of that in alchemy would gradually be exhibited, and she would become even more brilliant and dazzling.

Lu Xianming was definitely no match for her!

Ou Kan was even more disappointed. He knew that the position of chairperson was already incredibly far from him. All of a sudden, he was completely disheartened, and collapsed on the ground, not knowing what kind of expression he should wear.

The fourth place, the fifth place, and the sixth place, the 10 alchemists all reported the grade of the alchemical pill they had respectively examined, while Grandmaster Zi Cheng gave a grade. He showed no bias to anyone, winning everyone’s respect.

Finally, it was Ling Han’s turn.

“Holy Son Ling Han has concocted Heavenly Flame Pill. Among Two-Star alchemical pills, the difficulty level is high. The grade of the completed pill is High Grade. The First Refinement is perfect, Second Refinement is perfect,” the 10th alchemist announced.

‘What?!’

Everyone erupted in uproar.

Though the alchemical pill that Ling Han had concocted was slightly inferior to Qin Guyu’s, it had also reached High Grade, and added with his “age” in alchemy, that definitely could compensate for the gap between the two of them. In fact, he could even surpass her.

And his two times of Spirit Refinement were actually both perfect!

Hiss.

That was not right. Weren’t you just frowning? Didn’t you mess up?

Grandmaster Zi Cheng couldn’t help but smile, and seeing doubtful expressions appear on quite a number of faces, he said, “The 10 of you can all come and examine.”

The other nine Three-Star Alchemists hurriedly gathered round. They could not believe that if they did not personally see it with their own eyes.

But not a while later, all of them looked stunned, and felt a kind of reverence for a prodigy, even if Ling Han’s present skill of alchemy was inferior to theirs.

“First Refinement is perfect and flawless, but there is a slight flaw with the Second Refinement, though it can still be considered perfect.” The 10 alchemists discussed for a while, and announced the final conclusion. They did not mention the grade of the completed pill, so they had to be certain about it.

“I, I don’t believe it!” Lu Xianming called out in spite of himself. There was no need for Grandmaster Zi Cheng to give a grade. Everyone knew that Ling Han had already won, and furthermore, he had not surpassed the other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters by just a bit, either.

“Humph, this is the conclusion of all 10 of us. How could you be allowed to doubt us?” a Three-Star Alchemist said without being the slightest bit polite.

Just how many Four-Star Alchemists were there?

Though Lu Xianming was a Holy Son, his future accomplishment should only be limited to being a Three-Star Alchemist, and added with the fact that he was only a Two-Star Alchemist at present, what right did he have to doubt the united conclusion of 10 Three-Star Alchemists?

‘You’re not convinced? Get lost, there is no need for you to be convinced!’

Grandmaster Zi Cheng nodded, and said, “I give Ling Han 15 marks. Does anyone object?”

Everyone exchanged looks. They all thought that it was absolute that Ling Han had surpassed Lu Xianming and Qin Guyu, but it was not to the high extent of 15 marks. 12-13 marks should be just about it.

But it did not affect the result in any case, so what need was there to dampen Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s spirits? It was his disciple, after all, so it was understandable that he wanted to lift him up to a higher position.

Unfortunately, they did not truly understand.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng had given Ling Han 15 marks not because he wanted to deliberately raise Ling Han higher, but because he had taken the method of Spirit Refinement that Ling Han had invented into account. Just for that alone, it was definitely reasonable to add another two or three marks.

No matter what, Ling Han had won with a completely undisputed advantage.

“Let me announce that the future chairperson of Alchemy City... will be Ling Han!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said, his voice rolling out like thunder, ringing out through every corner of all five levels of Alchemy City. “300 million years later, I will leave my office, and Ling Han will inherit.”

“Yes!” In the hall, everyone bowed low. The replacement of the older generation with the new generation had been successfully completed, and Ling Han’s potential also made everyone believe that this boy would definitely be able to become a Four-Star Alchemist in the future, and might in fact even surpass Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

Even if he could not become a Five-Star Alchemist, perhaps he could reach Eighth Refinement in Spirit Refinement!

Everyone left in turns, and both Qin Guyu and Lu Xianming stared at Ling Han venomously. If it were not for Ling Han’s sudden rise to power, they would have had a chance to become the chairperson of Alchemy City.

But this step could either be to heaven, or to hell.

“Congratulations, Holy Son Ling!” The other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters all came over to express their congratulations. They knew that they would be living in Ling Han’s shadow in the future. Unless they were willing to leave Alchemy City, they would definitely have to bow their heads in front of Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded at everyone with a slight smile. In the first place, he was a very magnanimous person.

“Holy Son Ling!” Ou Kan also walked over. Though his face was still indescribably pale, he still congratulated Ling Han.

When it came down to it, this result was something that he could better accept because he had already been struck heavily in the very beginning, but in a surprising turn of events, neither Lu Xianming nor Qin Guyu managed to be promoted to the position, which made him feel considerably better.

Ling Han looked at him smilingly. In the beginning, Ou Kan was very arrogant. He had wanted to recruit him, and when he had not succeeded, he had threatened him, and had even come up with malicious ideas against him.

“All the events of yesterday should be buried yesterday. From today onwards, I am willing to follow Holy Son Ling, and exert effort for the growth of Alchemy City!” Ou Kan knelt on a single knee as he announced his loyalty to Ling Han.

Was it true surrender, or a deliberate move to get nearer to him for the sake of a conspiracy?

A confident smile spread across Ling Han’s face. He had the generous spirit that could accommodate everyone in this world. However, if anyone wanted to stay by his side and still bear disloyalty, then don’t blame him for being cruel and merciless as he erased all of them.

“Good, then let’s work together.”

Ling Han helped Ou Kan up, and Ou Kan smiled. It seemed as if the grudges between them had all died out with this smile, but whether Ou Kan had truly been sincere, it was up to time to decide. One might know a person for a very long time, but still not understand his true character after all.

Subsequently, there would naturally be a celebration hosted in the city. They did not invite outsiders this time round. It would have to wait for another 300 million years later when Alchemist Zi Cheng left his office, and Ling Han succeeded his position. Then they would definitely invite the whole world.

That was something for the future.

Five days later, the craze dissipated, and Ling Han began preparations to set out for his meeting with Yan Xianlu.
