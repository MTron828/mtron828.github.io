Chapter 1199: False Accusation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Second Brother received the inheritance of an Eternal River Tier elite?” Mu Rong Qing instantly became excited, saying, “That’s definitely the case. With Second Brother’s talents, he definitely has the right to receive such an inheritance.”

Feng Po Yun also nodded slowly. He had to admit that the Rain Emperor was supremely talented. In fact, it was possible that he was as talented as Ling Han.

“That brat is fairly lucky,” Helian Tianyun said in envy.

Ling Han had speculated thusly to reassure himself and to give himself hope. Otherwise, he would lose his Second Brother forever.

The cultivators continued to stream out, but Ling Han and the others still didn’t leave.

Although they suspected that the Rain Emperor had been chosen as a successor, they hadn’t received any confirmation of this. As such, they weren’t certain that this was the case, and thus they wanted to wait for a little longer.

In the end, they were the only people still remaining in the mystery realm.

“Hurry up and come out!” Venerable Trinity shouted. Why were these people idling about? Didn’t they know that it was extremely burdensome to keep this passageway open, even for an Eternal River Tier elite like him?

Ling Han nodded, and then left the mystery realm with the others.

Xiu!

The passageway instantly closed.

“Hurry up and leave,” Venerable Trinity said.

“Understood!”

Venerable Trinity cleared the path for them as they speedily left the valley. When they made their way out, Venerable Trinity immediately left them and flew into the sky.

“He Tao, Shen Zhu’er, Ling Han...” a Heavenly Body Tier called. These were the names of the seven king tiers. “Return to the sect as soon as possible and report to the Seven Rain Hall.”

Ling Han and the five other king tiers hurriedly accepted this command. However, Wu Zhe would remain in the mystery realm forever, and it would be impossible for him to return to the sect again.

In any case, they understood that the Majestic Heaven Sect was interested in the inheritances that they had obtained from the palace—the sect had long been aware that the door to the palace could only be opened by seven king tiers. Thus, now that they had left the mystery realm, the sect would naturally summon them to ask about their gains.

If the techniques they received were valuable enough, the sect would naturally make a copy of them.

Everyone returned where they had come from, with the disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect returning to the Majestic Heaven Sect. If one wasn’t from the Majestic Heaven Sect, they would return to wherever they cultivated or lived. This was the Death Valley, and there was nothing of worth apart from the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm there. People naturally didn’t want to stick around this place for too long.

Ling Han and the others didn’t leave right away. They still wanted to wait for the Rain Emperor.

However, 10 days passed, and there was still no sign of the Rain Emperor.

“Let’s go. If Second Brother has truly obtained the inheritance, he’ll naturally return when he masters his craft.”

Ling Han nodded after a brief moment of thought. Waiting here was pointless, and he had also received a command to return to the sect as quickly as possible. If this was a command from Venerable Trinity, even Empress Luan Xing wouldn’t be able to protect him if he arrived too late and offended him.

They set off for the Majestic Heaven Sect. They had the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, so their speed was incredibly quick. Although they had stayed at Death Valley for an extra 10 days, they only arrived at the sect one to two days later than everyone else.

Ling Han immediately went to the Seven Rain Hall, a hall that was located on the Cloud Piercing Peak. However, he didn’t see He Tao and the others when he reported his arrival and was summoned into the hall by a Sun Moon Tier elite. They had either come already, or they still hadn’t returned to the sect yet.

“What secret technique did you obtain in that treasure storage?” the Sun Moon Tier elite asked.

By the looks of it, Shen Zhu’er and the others had already reported to the Seven Rain Hall and recounted the events of the mystery realm. This wasn’t strange. However, did they truly report the secret techniques that they had received?

Or did they report some random cultivation technique to conceal the truth?

Ling Han was slightly hesitant. ‘Should I hand the Star Plucking Step over?’

He had mulled over this movement technique while waiting at the Death Valley and returning to the sect. However, even though he had completed a dozen or so days of comprehension under the Reincarnation Tree, he still wasn’t able to grasp it. In fact, he was still quite a distance away from being able to grasp it.

From this fact alone, one could imagine just how high-grade this movement technique was.

‘Should I hand it over for nothing?’

“Hehe, rest assured, the sect won’t take your secret technique for nothing. We’ll definitely compensate you fairly,” the Sun Moon Tier elite said.

‘Even if I want to hand over another secret technique to hide the Star Plucking Step, there’s nothing suitable.’

None of the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art, Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, and Universal Eight Desolation Technique was necessarily less valuable than the Star Plucking Step. In fact, they were perhaps even more valuable.

Thus, he pondered for a moment before saying, “I received a movement technique called the Star Plucking Step.”

“Mm-hm, write the secret technique out,” the Sun Moon Tier elite urged. “We’ll reward you based on its quality.”

Ling Han nodded, and then started to write the movement technique onto paper.

After writing for a while, he was surprised to discover that a portion of the inheritance couldn’t be written in words. It was something that could be understood, but not described. No amount of words or writing would be able to encapsulate it. However, if this portion was left out, the might of the movement technique would decrease dramatically.

He was slightly taken about. However, he immediately decided to let it go. He wasn’t interested in the reward from the sect anyway. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He continued to write, and it wasn’t long before he finished.

“Done?” the Sun Moon Tier elite asked. He took the copy and immediately sealed it with a decree, not even flipping through it. The decree seal would make it easy to detect whether someone had read the copy before it reached its target recipient.

“You can leave now. You’ll receive your reward once the grade of this movement technique is determined.”

Ling Han nodded and bowed respectfully before leaving.

He was a very busy person.

He had to study pill recipes, and he also had to practice movement techniques. Moreover, he was nearing the peak stage of the pinnacle level, and he would have to comprehend Regulations of the Sun Moon Tier after reaching it. This would definitely be time-consuming.

He felt like there wasn’t enough time.

Ling Han cultivated earnestly in reclusion, comprehending pill recipes at times, and practicing the Star Plucking Step at others. Time slowly crept by.

However, a hidden turbulence silently swirled through the sect, becoming more and more serious by the day.

Gao Huang lodged a complaint to the sect, accusing Ling Han of wantonly killing fellow disciples and seizing Thousand Source True Fluid that originally belonged to the Gao Faction.

News of this had originally been confined to the higher-ups, with not many people aware of the complaint. However, it suddenly spread throughout the entire Majestic Heaven Sect, and every single disciple was now aware of the situation.

The sect instantly erupted in uproar.

Killing fellow disciples was a massive taboo, and it was an action that would draw scorn and disdain.

However, many disciples had witnessed the battle on the Eagle Beak Mountain and seen a portion of the truth. Ling Han had suppressed the masses and obtained four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid. As for whether the members of the Gao Faction had died by Ling Han’s hands, no one knew. This battle had occurred after the battle for the Thousand Source True Fluid, so no one had been around to witness it.

Moreover, the Majestic Heaven Sect had Sun Moon Tier disciples in addition to Mountain River Tier disciples, and only a portion of people had been at Eagle Beak Mountain to witness the battle. Rumors about Ling Han killing fellow disciples for Thousand Source True Fluid was swirling about, and after a while, these rumors gradually became the truth.

Killing fellow disciples and stealing their treasures was an abhorrent act. Ling Han’s rising reputation was instantly crushed, and many people expressed their disdain for him.

Was such a person worthy of remaining in their sect?

A growing number of voices called for Ling Han to be punished severely. Otherwise, the anger of the masses would be unsated.
