Meng Dong should indeed look for Ling Han.

Back when Ling Han had “completed” the mission, there should have been a celebratory feast waiting for him. However, he was either busy mining or had gone into seclusion for a long time. It was impossible for Meng Dong to find him.

Now that Ling Han had returned to the Flaming Frost Realm, the latter had finally arrived.

Ling Han also sent out a message in reply to Meng Dong.

!!

After a while, Meng Dong arrived.

“You’ve really made it difficult for me to find you!” Meng Dong shook his head.

30 billion years had passed, and Meng Dong had already advanced to Fourth Tier. This speed was astonishing, and even if he was inferior to Xin Qihu and the others, he could also be considered a rarity himself. After all, in a certain sense, he was a creation of Hysteria.

Ling Han believed that Lou Xiyue, Ba Duo, and the others had also advanced to the Fourth Tier.

Ling Han couldn’t help but think of himself. After more than 30 billion years, he had actually only advanced a little bit.

If the middle stage to the late stage of the Third Tier was divided into 100 steps, then he would have taken about 10 steps. At most 12. At this speed, if he wanted to reach the peak stage of Third Tier, he would really need a whole epoch.

Ling Han sighed inwardly. Without the support of Great Herbs and refining of the life essence of Heavenly Venerates, his cultivation speed was truly low. And this was still because he had obtained more than 200 Heavenly Venerable Seals, which increased his cultivation speed by nearly 1,000 times. Otherwise, how slowly would his cultivation progress?

Ling Han didn’t even dare to think about it. If that was really the case, then he would have to cultivate until God knew when; it’d be a cold day in hell when he would advance to the Seventh Tier.

Thus Ling Han thought to himself, but his expression didn’t change. He nodded, and said, “I was in seclusion all this while, and couldn’t bother with anything else.”

“Come, let me introduce you to a few brothers and sisters.” Meng Dong smiled, and did not waste any time on the previous topic.

“Alright,” Ling Han agreed. This was exactly what he wanted.

Although Meng Dong had already advanced to the Fourth Tier, Ling Han did not take it to heart. Although Ling Han’s cultivation level progressed slowly, it was only his cultivation level’s increase that was slow—his strength was still rising at a terrifying rate, especially now that he had the complete set of eighth-grade seals, which caused his strength to increase by nearly 1,000 times.

Whom was he afraid of?

Meng Dong led the way, while Ling Han followed behind. After traveling for several days, they arrived at a mountain range, and then entered a cave. It actually had a powerful effect of cutting off divine sense.

Ling Han took a closer look, and saw Heavenly Venerable Stone scraps all over the cave walls.

These people were really careful. With these stone scraps blocking the sense of Heavenly Venerates, even if the Seventh Tiers returned, they might not be able to discover them.

Soon, the two of them arrived at a huge underground chamber. The space was huge, as if there was another world here.

“Meng Dong.” There were six people standing or sitting cross-legged. When they saw Meng Dong, they all called out.

Ling Han swept his gaze over them. He recognized two of them. They were naturally Lou Xiyue and Ba Duo. He didn’t recognize the other four at all, but their cultivation level was Fourth Tier. No matter where they were placed, this group could be said to be extremely powerful.

“Come, let’s get to know each other. This is Ling Han, our last awakened brother.” Meng Dong patted Ling Han’s shoulder.

Ling Han nodded at these people, and said, “I’ve been looking forward to it for a long time. I’ve finally met all of you.”

Back then, he had seen Hysteria shoot out hundreds of light spots. Although most of them had been annihilated in the Void, there were still more than 100 light spots that had entered various dimensions. Even if only half of them had matured, there should be about 50 of them now, far more than this number.

The four people whom he didn’t know also introduced themselves. They were Luo Ming, Yang Que, Wu Junyi, and Shao Ying. All of them were very arrogant. This was a kind of sense of superiority that originated from their advantage in cultivation level.

“Ling Han, I heard that your tier-surpassing battle prowess was extremely formidable, and I would like to spar with you,” Shao Ying said.

Their hostility was so great, and Shao Ying already wanted to challenge Ling Han right from the start?

Ling Han glanced at Ba Duo. This guy was also full of fighting spirit. It was obvious that he felt that he had reached a higher level, and was now qualified to challenge Ling Han.

“Sure.” Ling Han nodded, appearing very indifferent. Unless his opponent was Xin Qihu, it would be really difficult for him to have much interest.

His perfunctory attitude naturally made Shao Ying very dissatisfied, but he didn’t say anything. A cold smile appeared on his lips. His strength was not a mere boast; it was a result of genuine battles.

“Come and fight.” He soared into the air. The space here was extremely large, and with a little control, it absolutely could allow Heavenly Venerates to battle.

Ling Han paced into the air one step after another, put his left hand behind his back, and then hooked his right hand. “Make your move.”

Shao Ying was even more dissatisfied. ‘How much do you look down on me?’

He let out a long howl, and charged towards Ling Han. His hands turned into hammers, which he smashed towards Ling Han.

Being chosen by Hysteria, each of them was a super genius. Even at Fourth Tier, they had a certain level of tier-surpassing battle prowess. For example, Shao Ying was only in the early stage of the Fourth Tier, but his battle prowess had reached the peak of the Fourth Tier. It was truly astonishing.

It was unknown if this guy had nurtured a small world in his body, or if he had collected a lot of Powers of Dimension. Prior to reaching Sixth Tier, there was actually not much difference.

The more Powers of Dimension he harvested, the stronger it would be as compared to the power of a small world. However, if he only harvested 10 to 20 Powers of Dimension, he would soon be surpassed by the power of a small world.

Ling Han appeared nonchalant, and only returned Shao Ying’s punch when it arrived.

Peng!

The power of his fist was too terrifying. When Ling Han punched out, endless Primal Chaos Qi surged, and Shao Ying’s attack power was instantly shattered.

However, Ling Han did not take advantage of his victory to push his advantage. Instead, he stopped the force of his fist in time, and smiled faintly at Shao Ying.

The more polite he acted, the angrier Shao Ying became. This was because this was simply a blatant disregard in Shao Ying’s eyes.

Shao Ying roared. Weng, he had already channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal. In an instant, he seemed to have transformed into a god, exuding a powerful aura that suppressed the heavens.

First-grade seal!

With a shake of his hands, his arms turned purple-golden, and strange veined patterns appeared on them.

He charged out, brandishing his arms as he swept them at Ling Han.

Ling Han raised his hand to receive it head-on. Peng, he felt his arm shake, and he actually felt as if it was about to break apart.

Although a Heavenly Venerate’s body was tempered by fundamental power, and it would seem as if one gained an indestructible body made of Devouring Metal at Great Accomplishment when one advanced to the Seventh Tier, the body could never be compared to Devouring Metal prior to that point.

However, Shao Ying’s arms gave Ling Han a feeling that this was simply a Heavenly Venerate Tool.

If he could cultivate his physique to such an extent at Fourth Tier, then apart from a Seventh Tier, could anyone else hurt him?

Utterly impossible!

...

Ling Han immediately shook his head. He dusted off his hands to dispel the numbness in his arms, and then suddenly said, “You refined the Devouring Metal into your body. No wonder your arms are so strong.”

“It’s not just the arms!” Shao Ying sneered, and his figure pounced forward, launching a fierce attack at Ling Han. An ancient and aged veined pattern appeared on every part of his body.
