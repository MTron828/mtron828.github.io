3053 Who is attacking?

He was out!

Ling Han fell out, but his figure did not stop. Even if Hysteria would be suppressed by the heaven and earth of the Profound Negative Realm from here onwards, the battle prowess it could unleash was still terrifying, and he absolutely could not be careless.

He sped forward, and further ran for tens of thousands of kilometers before stopping.

Once he had reached this place, he was no longer within Hysteria’s domain. It would become rather difficult for it to track Ling Han’s whereabouts.

Ling Han lay on the ground, panting heavily.

He had already made a very high estimate of Hysteria, but he had still miscalculated. As expected of the number one scourge in history. It was truly too powerful.

‘If I want to stand against Hysteria, I must develop the dimensions in my body into high-tier high-level dimensions. Otherwise, my own defense will still be unable to withstand its attack.’ Ling Han looked at the gray sky. In the Realm Battlefield, the sky was dark and extremely oppressive.

‘The gains this time are not small. After destroying many mother trees, I can at least reduce the pressure on the secondary battlefield.

‘In the end, Hysteria must have used a lot of strength to chase after me. This will also have a positive effect on the main battlefield.

‘Although I didn’t talk much with Hysteria, it revealed some secrets.

‘What exactly is the World’s Core? Does it even exist?

‘I, Chong Yan, and his group all know about this thing. It was revealed by the World’s Will of the Genesis World of the last era, but this guy itself is very suspicious. It kept blabbering, and seemed to have accidentally let this piece of information slip out, which made it seem very genuine, but it has a more confusing effect.

‘If this so-called World’s Will is lying, there might not be a World’s Core.

‘If this deduction is true, then what’s its purpose in deceiving Chong Yan and me?

‘Also, Hysteria mocked me as a “frog at the bottom of a well[1].” What’s the truth behind these words?

‘Could it be that… the Void is so big, and there’s a second, third, or even more Genesis Worlds?’

Ling Han was shocked. Could it be that Genesis Worlds could also be like dimensions, one after another, without an end?

Thinking about it, it made sense. Compared to the Void, the Genesis World was indeed pitifully small. It wasn’t impossible to say that there were a few or even more Genesis Worlds in the Void.

“Things are getting more and more confusing. Just what are Hysteria and the World’s Will plotting, and what is the role of Extermination in this?” Ling Han muttered. However, this was clearly not something that he could think of just by clasping his head here. Thus, he quickly got up, and decided not to think about these things for the time being.

Strength was the most important thing. As long as one had enough strength, one punch would be enough to settle anything—well, at most two punches.

Ling Han returned to the barrier at the secondary battlefield, and upon seeing his bloody appearance, Lin Youlian and the others were all shocked.

Hysteria was indeed Hysteria. Even someone as powerful as Ling Han was in such a sorry state. As expected of its reputation as the number one monster in the world who wreaked havoc. Meanwhile, Ling Han was also very impressive and awesome. As a Sixth Tier, he could actually go to the headquarters of Hysteria, charge right in, and come charging back again. This should be something that even Seventh Tiers could not do.

Ling Han briefly explained the situation, but did not reveal the details of his conversation with Hysteria. He did not want Lin Youlian and the others to be overly suspicious for no reason. Their focus should still be on cultivation.

“When can you guys break through to the Seventh Tier?” he asked.

Lin Youlian and the others all shook their heads. Breaking through to the Seventh Tier was easier said than done.

Without the accumulation of a few epochs, it was impossible for them to break through easily.

Just take a look. Right until this moment, just how many Seventh Tiers had been nurtured in this era of the Genesis World? Furthermore, that was still because they had the core of the Flaming Frost Realm, which allowed Ten Thousand Shadows and Golden Silk Moth to take that final step. Otherwise, there would only be seven ultimate elites.

For these four people (Lin Youlian and others) to break through to the Seventh Tier as soon as possible, they would possibly have to place their hopes on the destruction of the Profound Negative Realm so that another dimensional core could be contributed.

Ling Han did not ask further. He left the Realm Battlefield, and prepared to make another trip to the various dimensions to see if there were any new gains. Once the dimensions in his body matured, he would truly become qualified to stand against Hysteria.

Even if he would still be outmatched, he could at least ensure that he would not be killed or wounded.

Ling Han first recuperated from his injuries. Fortunately, they didn’t hurt his foundation, and he recovered very quickly.

He set off and returned to reunite with everyone. Then, he began his interdimensional journey.

He passed through one dimension after another, and after arriving at a low-level dimension, Ling Han received a piece of news that made him frown incessantly.

A person who met Ling Han’s requirements had indeed been discovered here 300,000 years ago, but only 70,000 years had passed, and he had suddenly disappeared.

No one knew how he had disappeared, and it was as if he had never existed.

Ling Han didn’t believe that; this was definitely an elite who had interfered and captured him.

However, there was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate guarding this place. To be able to make him unable to detect anything, the other party’s cultivation level had to be at least at the Third Tier.

A Third Tier ultimate elite had appeared in a low-level dimension?

This was impossible unless the other party came from another dimension.

That was worth thinking about, then.

Did he pass by here coincidentally and discover that the chosen person had outstanding natural talent in cultivation, so he took him in as a disciple and left silently, or… was the other party targeting the light spot in the chosen person’s mind?

It would be fine if it was the former, but if it was the latter, then it would be a big problem.

Ling Han traced back time to 230,000 years ago. He had indeed seen a young man here, but then he suddenly disappeared.

Ling Han set the time for the day of the disappearance, and slowly examined this one day.

The young man had been cultivating when he suddenly revealed a shocked expression and disappeared.

Ling Han seemed to have seen a large hand grab out, but it was too blurry.

He wanted to see clearly, but there was nothing he could do. Too much time had passed, and the person who had attacked had been too powerful. He had blinded the heavens, preventing time from leaving a shadow of him.

However, even if he only saw a hand, Ling Han was sure that this person’s strength was incomparable, and he was at least a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han didn’t make a big fuss, and arrived at the next dimension. However, the type of person he was looking for wasn’t here.

After traveling through 937 dimensions, he finally found someone who met the requirements.

After Ling Han obtained the information regarding the light spot in that person’s mind, a thought occurred to him. He decided not to send this person to the Profound Negative Realm first, but to stay behind and pretend that nothing had happened. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Traveling through dimensions was extremely time-consuming. Apart from special people like Ling Han, who wouldn’t need hundreds or thousands of years, or in fact even longer?

Therefore, if someone was also searching for someone with a speck of light in his mind, that person should be slower than Ling Han, and would come looking.

He would wait for him, then. He wanted to snatch that young man back from him.

Ling Han sat quietly at the side. He restrained all of his aura. With the height he was currently standing at, no one would be able to discover his existence at all—unless Hysteria personally arrived.

Another 90,000 years passed, and Ling Han suddenly sensed a powerful aura surging over.
