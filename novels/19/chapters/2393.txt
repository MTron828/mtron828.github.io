Chapter 2394: I’m Zhou Heng

“Aiyah!” The young man looked up with an apologetic smile. His petrifying aura also receded like a tide.

In an instant, it was as if he had transformed into an ordinary person. The tribulation of heaven and earth also lost its target, leading it to rapidly dissipate.

Ling Han was astounded by what he saw. This young man was definitely a Heavenly Venerate. However, he could actually conceal his aura and trick the heavens? This was far too astonishing!

Wally’s eyes became green as he looked the young man up and down. He was acting as recklessly as one could.

However, this young man seemed to have a good temper, and he swept his gaze over them before smiling, and saying, “Hi, I’m Zhou Heng, and I come from another dimension.”

This kind of arrival and introduction… Ling Han and the others were rendered speechless. A Heavenly Venerate was actually this amiable? He wasn’t stating his title and sect?

Meanwhile, Wally frowned, and said, “Something on his body is blocking my scanning.”

“A War Soldier from the Technology Realm?” Zhou Heng took a few glances at Wally before nodding, and saying, “Quite hard to come by. There’s no guarantee that one can be created every few hundred epochs.”

Ling Han and the others were even more astounded. This Heavenly Venerate was seemingly familiar with many different dimensions.

One had to realize that the Genesis World was a cruel dog-eat-dog world, where the different dimensions were always at war and trying to engulf each other. With the arrival of a foreign Heavenly Venerate, just what kind of devastating calamity would follow?

“Fellow friend, are you cultivating your mind in the mortal world?” Zhou Heng asked as he looked at Qing Qing. He wore an expression of praise, and he continued, “It’s extremely difficult to take the second step in super low-level dimensions. However, you’re able to find a different method. Your talent is truly worthy of my praise.”

Ling Han and the others felt as if they were dreaming. Just how freakish were Heavenly Venerates? Their status was paramount, and they would often refer to themselves as “This Venerate.” However, Zhou Heng was simply referring to himself as “I” or?“my”1. This was truly inconceivable.

However… Zhou Heng was actually referring to Qing Qing as a “fellow friend”?

Fellow friend!

Gasp!

Ling Han and the others all drew a sharp breath. Perhaps Qing Qing was also a Heavenly Venerate?!

There were only four Heavenly Venerates in the entire Celestial Realm—Wu Le, Jiuwu, Sealed Emotions, and Green Flames!

Qing Qing… Green?Flames1?

Qing Qing was also looking at Zhou Heng. Her gaze was still puzzled, yet it was gradually regaining clarity.

“Bah!”

Zhou Heng suddenly unleashed a short shout, and it was as if the drums of evening and the bells of dawn were awakening one’s soul.

Weng!

Ling Han and the others felt their minds sink before awakening again. It was as if something extra had appeared in their bodies. They couldn’t describe what this was, yet it was seemingly allowing them to attain new comprehension of the great dao of heaven and earth.

Was the Heavenly Venerate bestowing this upon them?

Qing Qing’s gaze instantly became clear.

Boom!

A paramount aura instantly exploded from her body. At this moment, it was as if all mortals could only kneel and prostrate before her.

Heavenly Venerate… This was definitely the aura of a Heavenly Venerate.

Qing Qing… No… The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate unleashed her paramount aura at this moment, and she frowned as she gazed at Zhou Heng. She couldn’t see through this powerful being. However, would a mighty Heavenly Venerate be afraid of others?

Boom!

Green flames erupted above her. These were flames that would cause even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to tremble.

Ling Han and the others bared their teeth. They had actually journeyed together with a Heavenly Venerate for so many days? And they had even protected her as if she were a helpless young girl? In fact, Ling Han had even wanted to take her as his disciple?

According to Zhou Heng, the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate had been cultivating her mind in the mortal world. Thus, by the looks of it, she had purposefully suppressed her cultivation and transformed into an ordinary human in the toilsome mortal world. Through struggles and hardships, she desired to temper her mind, and thus take that second step.

Each person was a part of heaven and earth. Each person possessed the power of heaven and earth. However, it was just that ordinary mortals were unable to harness and wield this power.

Each person was a treasure trove.

“Who are you? From where do you come?” the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate asked. However, she was still in the form of a young girl of seven or eight years old, so her voice sounded extremely childish. The contrast was extremely stark.

Heaven and earth didn’t tolerate Heavenly Venerates, so flashes of lightning lashed down at the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate. However, this was naturally useless against Heavenly Venerates. They didn’t even need to dodge it.

Zhou Heng smiled faintly, and said, “I harbor no animosity. My reason for coming here is simple. I want to invite elites such as yourself and other young prodigies to a transcendent dimension.”

Go to a transcendent dimension!

“Dare I ask, Lord, what’s a transcendent dimension? Is it even more powerful than a high-level dimension?” Ling Han asked with courage. He felt like this Heavenly Venerate was an extremely amiable person.

In fact, this Heavenly Venerate’s personality was quite similar to his. He would be extremely friendly and easy to approach as long as his bottom line wasn’t crossed. If this bottom line were crossed, however, he would be even more ruthless than others when he unleashed his fury. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Heng nodded, and replied, “There are a total of four transcendent dimensions. Now, however… only a single one remains.” He wore a solemn expression as he spoke.

Everyone was astonished.

The fundamental goal of the Realm Wars was to engulf other dimensions. Theoretically speaking, if this remaining transcendent dimension had managed to engulf the three other transcendent dimensions, it should have become invincible. As such, what was there to worry about?

Zhou Heng smiled, and said, “Fine, let me explain this from the beginning. It will clear up your confusion.”

This Heavenly Venerate was indeed a good-tempered person.

“The entire Genesis World is like a snake. The dimensions exist in a linear fashion, from the strongest down to the weakest. Moreover, the oldest dimensions will slowly decay toward death. At the same time, new dimensions are also being born. This is an endless cycle of death and birth.”

Zhou Heng pondered for a moment before continuing, “Instead of viewing it as a snake, it’s better to view it as a?Taiji1. It’s a cycle of life and death.

“A long time ago, each dimension in the Genesis World was completely independent. There existed no connections between them, and neither one would interfere with another. As such, there was naturally no Realm War.

“However, at some point in time, the people in an aging dimension were unresigned to their dimension decaying and crumbling, transforming into void. Thus, they created a powerful type of being—a being called Hysteria.

“Hysteria exists to engulf others. It exists to extract energy from other dimensions to replenish an aging dimension.

“Relying on Hysteria, this aging dimension managed to hold on for several hundred more epochs.

“However, after absorbing so much power of heaven and earth, Hysteria became more and more powerful. In fact, it became so powerful that even the people in that aging dimension couldn’t control it anymore.

“And thus, that aging dimension also became a sacrifice to Hysteria. It was engulfed by its own creation.

“Hysteria started to engulf dimensions with no bounds, continually strengthening itself. In the end, it also transformed into a dimension itself, the most powerful dimension. According to the rules of the Genesis World, it’s located at the very front.

“It continued to engulf dimensions. However, behind it were four powerful transcendent dimensions that contained countless elites, greatly slowing it down.

“However, after countless epochs, three of the transcendent dimensions have already been engulfed by Hysteria. The supreme elites from these dimensions have all retreated to the final remaining transcendent dimension. Together with the elites from this dimension, they’re now resisting the invasion of Hysteria.

“Even so, we’re still on the back foot. If this continues, there’ll eventually come a day when the final transcendent dimension also falls. At that time, the entire Genesis World will be engulfed by Hysteria, forever descending into darkness and primal chaos.

“As things stand now, the Genesis World has also been forced to launch a defensive mechanism, activating the Realm Wars. This is an attempt to create more transcendent dimensions.”

Everyone was transfixed with shock. This was the truth behind the Realm Wars?!

The aim of the Realm Wars was actually this lofty and supreme? It was in order to fight back against the destruction of the entire Genesis World?!

Ling Han was still confused, and he asked, “Why do we need to create more transcendent dimensions?”

Zhou Heng smiled, and replied, “Because the higher one’s cultivation, the more they require a higher-level dimension to unleash their full power. Take me, for example. If I release my full cultivation, the response from heaven and earth will be immense. If it isn’t heaven and earth that suppresses me, it will be me who destroys heaven and earth.”
