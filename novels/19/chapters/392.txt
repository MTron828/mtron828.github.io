Chapter 393: Ice Fire Gourd Valley

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Hu Niu was completely unafraid. Her small body scuttled through the red vein-like lines, and if she couldn’t avoid it, she used her nails and mouth to tear and bite it apart; such terrifying ability made Ding Gao Yang and Ding Wan Qing dumbstruck.

Two freaks—they were definitely two freaks.

On the other side, Ling Han had already completely gained the upper hand; he didn’t even need to use the Three Styles of Black Origin. His right hand unleashed the Four Seasons Sword Art and his left hand clenched into a fist, blasting out War Elephant Fist continuously.

Hong , seven flashes of Sword Qi flew unhindered; with the sharpness of Demon Birth Sword, even a Spiritual Pedestal Tier wouldn’t dare to receive it head-on, or else it would at least leave a gash—and at worst, sever his hands or feet.

Ling Han was somewhat in a bad mood. He could only launch seven flashes of Sword Qi, but couldn’t send out six flashes of Fist Qi at the same time; the two things couldn’t be used simultaneously.

He was very depressed, but immediately laughed loudly; if it could be stacked infinitely, then he could strike with his sword, send out punches, and throw kicks—how much Qi would he shoot out?

“Old man, it’s time to end this!” Ling Han said. He had no time to tangle with him; Zhu Xuan Er came here earlier than he did, and since that woman’s charm was tremendous, who knew how many people it could influence in helping her find Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass. He had to hurry.

Elder Mo was both shocked and angered. As a Spiritual Pedestal Tier elite, he was actually suppressed by a youngster? He felt very unwilling to be outdone; It was mainly because of the two Spirit Tools that were too domineering on Ling Han, making him unsuccessful in his attacks and confounded in his defenses.

If this went on, he would truly lose.

“Youngster, we have no grudge and this old man was deceived, so why not just stop the battle now?” He thought of retreating, finding no reason to fight Ling Han to the death.

He only received some benefits from Ding Gao Yang, it wouldn’t be worth it at all if he fought so desperately!

Ling Han sneered and said, “That’s really funny. You chased to kill me, and if you could kill me, you definitely wouldn’t show mercy. When you can’t beat me, you actually want to leave just by saying we have no grudges. Old dog, your head got * messed up?”

“Brat, how dare you!” Elder Mo was trembling with anger; this kid’s mouth was too malicious. His gaze turned grim as he said, “You really want to force this old man to fight to the death?”

“Whether you fight to the death or not, the result will be the same,” Ling Han said indifferently, taking a deep breath as Mysterious Three Thousand was ready to be launched.

“Hmph!” Elder Mo threw three consecutive palms, and actually turned tail and ran.

“Still want to run now? Too late!” Ling Han unleashed his sword as the Mysterious Three Thousand was launched. Xiu, xiu ,xiu, xiu, eight hundred sword lights moved simultaneously, covering the sky and the earth.

This was sword light set off by the Demon Birth Sword—what kind of power would it have?

Elder Mo turned around, raising his palm to parry, but the sword light came pouring vast and mighty, swallowing him like a tsunami. When all the sword light disappeared, Elder Mo disappeared from the spot and only fragments of blood, flesh, and bones fluttered in the air.

Ling Han leapt over, picking up a ring that once belonged to Elder Mo from the ground. He then looked at Ding Gao Yang and Ding Wan Qing who were obstructed by Hu Niu—they wanted to escape but just couldn’t manage to.

“Niu Niu, let me!” Ling Han charged over sword in hand.

Ding Gao Yang and Ding Wan Qing were panic-stricken; Ling Han even killed Elder Mo, and in comparison, what where they?

“Friend, keep calm, we’re Ding Family’s people. The Ding Family, Four Way City’s Ding Family! The Lord master is a Flower Blossom Tier elite! My Brother is Ding * Xin, a figure on the the last last term’s prodigy roll. Now he’s at the cultivation of the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and is in this forest,” Ding Gao Yang said, pretending to be calm.

Hu Niu was unable to be reasoned with. Ling Han wouldn’t also be unreasonable, right?

Ling Han scoffed and said with a smile, “Don’t they say that backgrounds are useless in the Dark Demon Forest?”

No kidding. Inside the Dark Demon Forest, one’s background was certainly useless; they could only look at who was the stronger one. The problem was that they were no match for him now, so Ding Gao Yang could only bring out his background to scare people.

Ding Gao Yang saw that Ling Han didn’t immediately attack, and thinking that it worked, he hurriedly said, “Friend, it’s all only a misunderstanding.”

“Hehe, me killing you guys is also just a misunderstanding.” Ling Han laughed, and waved his sword, striking outwards.

Pu, pu , two flashes of Sword Qi flew by and Ding Gao Yang and Ding Wan Qing were easily killed. In front of Ling Han who brandished a tenth tier Spirit Tool, it would be strange if they weren’t killed in one move.

Ling Han picked up two more spatial rings—the profits were pretty good.

“Lets’ go,” Ling Han said with a smile. Hu Niu immediately agreed in a crisp voice and began signing cheerfully; this primitive forest was the place where she felt most at ease. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

While walking, Ling Han rummaged through the things inside the three spatial rings.

Ding Gao Yang and Ding Wan Qing’s spatial rings were almost all empty. This was normal as they had just arrived at the Dark Demon Forest for medicinal harvesting and naturally wouldn’t have any gains yet.

However, Elder Mo’s spatial ring had plenty of Origin Crystals. Majority was one star ones, and only a dozen were two stars—it wasn’t abundant, either. Other than Origin Crystals, there was also a book of martial arts technique as well as a map.

Ling Han stored everything in the Black Tower, then took out and flipped through the book. Surprisingly, it was a claw technique at Earth Grade, but Elder Mo didn’t display it earlier, most likely having obtained it just recently.

Earth Grade martial arts techniques could only be cultivated at the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Ling Han threw this book into the Black Tower, then looked at the map again.

With a single glance, he revealed a smile.

This was a very detailed map of the Dark Demon Forest—every single place other than the core region was labeled. For example, every single stronghold and what force it belonged to, and what areas had precious spirit medicines.

Other than that, the areas Flower Blossom Tier beasts were active in were also marked, marked by a red circle to emphasize danger.

Not bad, not bad, this map was quite valuable.

Ling Han searched briefly; the place Ding Gao Yang had mentioned was labeled “Ice Fire Gourd Valley” on the map—half the area had been covered by chilling ice for years, while the other half had lava spurting out with scarlet flames surging into the sky. It certainly was a place where the cold and heat intertwined.

This place could give birth to Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass.

Ling Han hurried over—the distance wasn’t too big. Inside the valley was a peak stage Spiritual Pedestal Tier beast. It was an extremely terrifying large snake, and it was very sly; when it encountered Flower Blossom Tier cultivators, it would worm into the ice caves to hide, and when it encountered other martial artists, it would attack unrelentingly. Thus, very few people entered this valley.

However, with the valley’s harsh conditions, it was almost impossible to birth any other spirit medicines, so no Flower Blossom Tier elite intentionally went to kill this large snake while the medicine harvesters stayed far away.

One day later, he arrived at the gourd valley.

He hadn’t entered the valley yet but was suddenly alerted, turning around in a rush to see that a person had appeared unknowingly thirty feet away.

Ao Feng!

This guy definitely came chasing after him, but it was the disguised identity he pursued—Han Lin.

Ao Feng had a killing intent written all across the face, but seeing Ling Han turn his head, he was momentarily startled.

It actually wasn’t the one he was searching for, so how come they looked so similar from behind?
