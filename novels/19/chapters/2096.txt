Chapter 2097: Stimulating the Yin Soul Jade

Emperor tier!

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock. Even those that had been concentrating on stimulating the Yin Soul Jade stopped.

…They could stimulate the Yin Soul Jade later, but it was not every day that they could see an emperor tier.

“Emperor tier can still be invincible against an opponent that is superior by a whole minor level!”

“They can reign supreme even among Yin Souls!”

“Heavens, even if I broke through, I would not be a match for them now.”

“Sigh, why is the gap between people so overwhelmingly massive?”

A great many people were defiant. They all had to cultivate, so why would there be such a colossal disparity in their battle prowess?

“Don’t be shortsighted. For them to manage to attain this level, who knows how much hard work and effort they have exerted. It is definitely not something that can be explained away just by the words ‘natural talent’.” Someone was still very objective, and said a very pertinent line.

Quite a number of people nodded their heads to express agreement. The path of cultivation was difficult, and becoming an emperor tier definitely could not be summed up as simply as the words “natural talent”.

“Look, they are not stopping yet!” someone exclaimed, pointing at Ling Han and his group.

“This, this, this, this!”

“I heard that Tian He had once reached 90 meters away from the pool in the past.”

“Tian He, he is no ordinary emperor tier, but can be ranked in the top three even among emperor tiers.”

“There is definitely no way that they can compare to Tian He.”

“Of course.”

Numerous people were making cynical remarks. The majority of people could not bear seeing someone better than them.

However, Ling Han and his group had already walked closer and closer to the 90-meter point from the pool, which was a solid slap in these people’s faces.

“They’re about to catch up to Tian He.”

“Heavens, there are actually as many as four such existences!”

“This is inconceivable!”

Ling Han and his group walked a few more steps, and Bewitching Maiden Rou was the first to reach her limits. She had no choice but to stop. Even so, she had reached the 84-meter point from the pool, a whole six meters further than that so-called Tian He.

This had completely thrown those around them over in shock, all of them gaping widely.

In their eyes, Tian He was a top-notch prodigy, and it was definitely impossible for him to be surpassed. Yet now, all of a sudden, there were seven people that had surpassed him, which naturally led to all of them being stunned to numbness.

But Ling Han, the Empress, and Hu Niu were still walking forwards, continuing to break the limits of acceptance of the masses.

When they arrived at the 45-meter point, the Empress’s and Hu Niu’s speed also began to slow. Even they were feeling pressure at this point, and the blood flow in their bodies was clearly slowing down.

Once the blood flow completely stopped flowing, that meant the Regulations of Water had completely crumbled their bodies, and they were dead.

The two women activated their respective bloodlines, and continued to walk forwards.

42 meters, 33 meters, 27 meters, 21 meters, 15 meters!

Finally, they stopped altogether. If they took one step further, they would be completely frozen stiff, and that would be seeking their own demise.

The two women felt a little regret at this, yet the others were dumbfounded.

15 meters!

“Monarch tier!”

“And it’s a top-grade monarch tier at that!”

“I have heard Tian He mention that only monarch tiers would be qualified to walk within 30 meters of the pool, and in the case of 15 meters, that would be the limit of all monarch tiers.”

“But that guy has already walked to the 12-meter point!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was in shock, watching dumbly as Ling Han continued his way forwards.

“Heavens, is this guy planning to walk right up to the pool in one go?”

“Impossible! Absolutely impossible! That would really be heaven-defying!”

“That’s right. I don’t believe that such a freak would exist, either.”

15 meters!

Ling Han finally stopped walking, which also made the masses sigh in relief. This guy had ultimately not defied the heavens.

So this was his limit?

Ling Han thought. His physique added with the power of Regulation he had grasped only allowed him to walk until this point. At this moment, aside from blood still circulating in his heart, his whole body had already been frozen completely.

If he took another step further, that would only be suicide.

Fire and water were incompatible, so could he use the Nine Heavens Flame?

Ling Han pondered, but then immediately shook his head.

Water and fire were incompatible, but they also corresponded with each other. For example, while a massive primordial wave could extinguish a great fire, what about a cup of water?

To this pool, the Nine Heavens Flame would be a “cup of fire”, and would not be able to have the effect that it should have. Who knew, maybe it would instead anger this pool, and cause great trouble—if one could use divine sense to stimulate the Yin Soul Jade at the bottom of the pool, why couldn’t it be angered?

It could not be helped. The Nine Heavens Flame was still too weak now.

Then what about the Xuanyin Source Water?

With a thought from Ling Han, the Xuanyin Source Water was immediately stimulated, and began channeling inside his body.

The effect produced instantaneous results.

The blood that had already stopped flowing in his body began circulating again, and his frozen stiff body was also gradually becoming warmer, so he raised his foot and took another step.

Heavens!

Seeing this scene, everyone was grabbing their head and exclaiming in shock. Just what had they seen? A miracle!

Ling Han did not stop walking. The further forwards he walked, the warmer his body became. With the help of the Xuanyin Source Water, it was as if he had been immersed into the pool. Thus, no matter how frightening the coldness exuding from this pool was, it could no longer harm him.

In simpler terms, he had already been assimilated with the Regulations of Water here.

Six meters! three meters!

Ling Han was still walking forwards, and finally stopped at the edge of the pool. If he walked even the slightest bit further, that would be the extremely icy waters of the pool.

This was unprecedented!

This was a feat that only Celestial Kings could accomplish, yet it had actually been accomplished now by a Dividing Soul Tier.

Heavens, what kind of freak was this?

Ling Han sat down in a cross-legged position. He couldn’t care to be concerned about what the others were thinking. If he could stimulate the Yin Soul Jade from this distance, the dividing soul that he manifested would be the strongest among Yin Souls.

Weng, he unleashed his divine sense, which spread out endlessly.

When the divine sense spread out, it was naturally solid, but when it headed into the direction of the pool waters, his divine sense encountered a block. No, the word “block” was not very appropriate. It should be compared to a layer of mud that caused his divine sense to make progress only with great difficulty.

And at this moment, he could “see” multiple crystalline rocks around the pool.

This was the Yin Soul Jade. If his divine sense attained resonance with one of them, that Yin Soul Jade would fly out of the pool on its own volition, and become the bearer of his second divided soul.

However, Ling Han had no intention to stop, but rather unfurled his divine sense to continue further downwards.

…The reason he had walked to the pool was for the sake of obtaining the best Yin Soul Jade, and the best Yin Soul Jade was naturally at the greatest depths of the pool. How could he possibly be satisfied with only that?

He continued further downwards, and it was extremely difficult.

This was too exhaustive for divine sense. Not long had passed, and Ling Han felt spiritually exhausted. He wanted nothing more than to just flop down and sleep. But if he did fall asleep, all his previous efforts would be wasted. How could that be allowed?

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and headed downwards dauntlessly.

One day, two days, three days… With every instant that passed, Ling Han felt like he had reached his limits, but he still forcefully broke through his own limitations repeatedly, breaking previous records.

He could see the bottom now!

Ling Han felt a little numb, but right at this moment, he spotted the bottom of the pool.

There was only a single jade there, and it was exuding a gentle light of bluish green.

Ling Han immediately had the feeling that this was the Yin Soul Jade that he had been searching for.

He extended his divine sense, which bulldozed towards that Yin Soul Jade.

Boom!

His divine sense crashed into the rock. There was clearly no actual physical contact, yet he felt his whole body tremble, and felt like his head was about to be split apart.

Hiss, so tough.

Ordinarily, divine sense was shapeless, and could pass through everything, so why couldn’t it do the same with this rock?

This should be the reason why it was capable of becoming a container for a divided soul.
