Chapter 1960: Wuming, Celestial Tool

Ji Wuming?

They all exchanged looks, and then shook their heads. This person was really Wuming[1]. None of them had heard of this character.

However, everyone immediately looked furious. This man attacked them without distinguishing any target, and had provoked so many people all by himself. Just how outrageously bold could he be?

“What is the meaning of this?” a monarch tier asked with forced patience.

The reason why he had asked instead of directly attacking was because the attacks that Ji Wuming had previously launched were all too weak. Without absolute uncertainty, how could anyone dare to make a move? What if it led to his own embarrassment?

Moreover, there were still such top-grade monarch tiers like Shu Yarong, Tang Minglong, and Ling Han present. Even if anyone were to stand up in resistance, it would not be them, right?

“I just wanted to take a look at all your strength,” Ji Wuming stated calmly.

This kind of answer caused a great many to be outraged. Just because he wanted to take a look at their strength, he attacked them without any prior warning? What if they were injured then? Of course, no one would say such words. How could it be that cultivators feared battle?

The people of the Wide Prosperity Heaven all looked at Shu Yarong and Tang Minglong, while the people of the Calm Peace Heaven looked towards Ling Han and Hu Niu.

However, Shu Yarong and Tang Minglong were only staring at Ji Wuming, or to be more exact, staring at the white bow in his hands.

Hu Niu gave a soft “yi”, and said, “I seem to have a little recollection of that bow.”

She thought for a while, then clapped her hands suddenly, and declared, “That is the Minor Heavens Complete Bow!”

“What? What?” Ling Han hurriedly asked.

Hu Niu nodded, looking very serious and solemn, and said, “Niu isn’t very clear, either. I just have some vague recollection. That is a Celestial Tool, and belongs to the very, very powerful category even among Celestial Tools.”

“That’s right, Minor Heavens Complete Bow!” Shu Yarong continued. “The bow is made from the trunk of the World Tree, while the string is made from a main tendon of a Ninth Heaven Immortal Dragon. One only has to pull the bow string slightly, and it would be able to shatter the heavens.”

World Tree, Ninth Heaven Immortal Dragon!

Among the Source Powers of heaven and earth, the World Tree was one of the nine great Ancestral Woods. A bow made from this wood should be unsurpassed by anything else. At most, another object would only be able to catch up to it. And the main tendon of a Ninth Heaven Immortal Dragon was even more frightening because the Source Power of heaven and earth could only represent Celestial King Tier, while a Ninth Heaven Immortal Dragon represented the pinnacle of Celestial King Tier.

Merely these two objects were already supremely precious treasures, but now they were put together, and used to construct a Celestial Tool. The value of this was practically unimaginable.

Hence, though this thing looked so small it seemed like a toy, its might was incredibly astonishing. If news of it spread out, even Celestial Kings would be tempted. Whether it was snatching it in public or stealing it secretly, they would definitely make a move.

Even Ling Han was a little tempted, but as long as others did not come to trifle with him, he would not think of stealing just because someone else had something precious. Of course, the fact that Ji Wuming had attacked him without rhyme or reason just now was already enough reason to make Ling Han angry, and thus make a move.

“Hehe, not too bad.” Ji Wuming laughed. “Everyone, the opening of the Three Blooms Valley is close at hand. A Source Power of heaven and earth will appear. You all don’t mind if you have an additional competitor, right?”

“Sir... which Heaven do you belong to?” Shu Yarong asked.

“Traveling the world, not belonging to any Heaven.” Ji Wuming gave a very vague answer. In truth, due to the fact that he called himself Wuming, it would be very, very hard for others not to pay particular attention to his identity[2].

A top-grade monarch tier, and one that had a top-grade Celestial Tool, appeared out of nowhere. Why did everyone think that there was something off about this? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Shu Yarong calmly said, “Everyone has a share of natural treasures. Obtaining it would have to depend on your own fortune and strength.”

“I am quite confident in my own strength, though,” Ji Wuming answered with a smile. His eyes swept over the gathered masses, a strange smile curling the corners of his lips. Then, he sat down at the side as well, closing his eyes to rest.

Everyone was infuriated by this. This guy had just launched an offensive against them, and now he actually dared to sit down right in front of them, looking like nothing whatsoever had happened. How could they not be angered by this?

But neither Shu Yarong nor Tang Minglong looked like they had any intention of making a move, so the people of the Wide Prosperity Heaven all wilted.

On the side of the Calm Peace Heaven, Ling Han was quite intrigued. He had a feeling that this Ji Wuming was the same level as Shu Yarong and Tang Minglong, and was worthy of being a strong rival for him. This caused his fighting spirit to begin blazing.

Very good, he could now fight to his heart’s content.

“The Mystery Realm has opened!” Just at this moment, someone suddenly cried out.

At the entrance, the mist was rapidly dissipating, revealing a valley path that was slanting downwards. It was very wide—about 3,000 meters wide—and it was very even, as if it had been sliced out with blades.

Really, there were clear signs of the rocks having been sliced. It was absolutely impossible that these marks had been created through wind erosion.

“It is said that when the ultimate Celestial Kings battle, their battlegrounds could possibly transform into a natural Mystery Realm,” someone said slowly.

This Three Blooms Valley had also been formed in that way?

Ahead of them, the mist was dissipating even faster and faster, as if it had suddenly been absorbed by the ground, and their vision became incredibly clear.

“Let’s go!” Someone immediately leaped out, entering into the valley.

It was fine even if they were not the strongest. They only had to be the one to arrive first in front of the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, and then they would gain a chance of being selected. Which one of those gathered here was not at least an emperor tier? Wasn’t an emperor tier impressive enough?

Thus, the stupid bird would fly first.

“Let’s go too, let’s go too!” Hu Niu shouted in excitement, arms wrapped around one of Ling Han’s arms.

“All right, we’ll go too,” Ling Han said smilingly. He first drew the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden into the Black Tower. Those whose cultivation levels had reached the Dividing Soul Tier or further than that could not enter, but it did not mean that those below the Severing Mundane Tier could easily enter.

It only permitted Severing Mundane Tiers.

Hu Niu ran energetically ahead. She was practically dragging Ling Han along with her, while Ling Han and the Empress walked side by side. Finally, the last person was Bewitching Maiden Rou, looking a bit like a wife that had been bullied.

In the past, she only feared the Empress, and now there was another Hu Niu. Both of them could restrain her easily.

...The Empress was majestic and stern, born as a ruler, while Hu Niu was completely unreasonable. If you did not obey, she would just beat you up, and continue beating you up until you obeyed.

Yan Xianlu and the others also moved out. They had long since formed an alliance. They could use a formation to oppose an existence stronger than themselves. Hence, they similarly were filled with confidence. The contest... was going to begin from this moment.

Getting a Source Power of heaven and earth naturally could grant them a complete rebirth, so they could make up for the distance that separated them from top-grade monarch tiers.

The path in the valley was slanting downwards, and the further down, the wider the path became. Occasionally, underground gases would spray out, turning into incredibly beautiful blooms of great dao.

But no one dared touch them.

The slightest touch would result in either death or injury, and it would be serious injury at that. It was even possible that they would never be able to heal such injuries.

These blooms did not have roots, and would slowly float. One had to dodge them at the first instant.

Though they were floating very slowly, it was like they were capable of instant teleportation. In truth, they were not the slightest bit slow. Thus, one had to maintain absolute caution against them.

Furthermore, the further down, the more the number of these blooms of great dao would increase. They were close to covering the entire path in the valley, so one did not know where it was safe to set his foot.

Ling Han and his group were all cautious. Now that they were here, even Hu Niu did not dare to be rash. This made the little girl very displeased. Her lips pouted, her unhappiness written all over her face.

Thankfully, only the blooms of great dao were floating around. If an enemy suddenly appeared at this moment, it really would not be easily dealt with.

An entire three days later, the path of them finally became even.

Had they reached the bottom of the valley?

“Whom are the funeral bells ringing for?” A low voice rang out.
