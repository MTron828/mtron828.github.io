Chapter 1608: Slaughtering Saints again

“Yi, why are you attacking me as well?” The large black dog broke into a run. “This human is really too despicable. Brat Han, beat him up for your Grandpa Dog, thrash him until he admits defeat!”

Its speed was really exaggeratingly quick. It actually managed to race out of the range of attack of a Saint in the nick of time, and then stood on its hind legs, patting its iron underwear. “If you’re not convinced, come bite your Grandpa Dog then? If you manage to bite me, Grandpa Dog will gift this supreme treasure to you!”

Everyone was rendered speechless. This large black dog was as despicable as always, but they did not have the leisure to be distracted. The attack from a Medium Saint fell, and was already pressing down on the top of Ling Han’s head.

“Small Tower!” Ling Han called out internally. Weng, his cultivation level suddenly soared, spiking up to the peak stage of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier in a single instant.

He also delivered his own palm strike in a counterattack against Hu Dongping.

“Not good!” Hu Luo suddenly stood up. Xiu, his figure streaked out, charging towards Ling Han. At this moment, he was exerting his full effort, and there were flashes of light flickering on him, forming vibrantly colorful patterns of great dao.

Peng!

Unfortunately, he was too late. Ling Han’s palm strike landed, and without the slightest bit of doubt, Hu Dongping was crushed into a stain of blood. There was not even the slightest bit of complete bone that could be found.

“Ah, brat!!” Hu Luo roared out in fury to the heavens, his white locks dancing in the wind. His killing intent solidified, rolling out in waves.

Meanwhile, the others were watching with dumbfounded shock.

F***, he had slaughtered a Saint again!

Had you now f****** become a specialist in slaughtering Saints?

Yet they did not know that Ling Han had been even more ruthless in the Netherworld, killing more than 100 Demon Masters in a single go, and that was what true savagery was.

The heaven and earth grieved, taking the form of a rain of blood, emotionally moved at the death of a Saint.

“Great, well done, fantastic!” The large black dog waved its behind at a distance, its iron underwear reflecting sunlight, showing how despicable it could be.

Hu Luo’s expression was filled with killing intent, and he suddenly tapped out a finger at the large black dog. A flash of light shot out, indescribably fast.

Ling Han pressed down with a casual hand, and the large black dog immediately vanished. Only a whole breath’s time after that ray of light streaked past did the large black dog suddenly reappear in its original position, looking completely dumbfounded.

“Brat, you dare to stop me?” Hu Luo roared, striking out at Ling Han.

“Why would I not dare? Who do you think you are?” Ling Han moved, greeting Hu Luo’s incoming attack. Peng, their two attacks clashed, and a frightening power tore a rip in the space as multiple cracks appeared. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He had blocked it!

Everyone was in disbelief. Previously, Ling Han had surpassed a god because he had channelled a drop of Celestial King blood essence, but now faced with a true Saint King, he was still invincible. How could this be possible?

“No! Impossible!” Cai Miao muttered, shuddering. He still had his delusions that Hu Luo would save him after everything was settled here, but seeing how powerful Ling Han was, he couldn’t help but conceive a terrifying thought.

“You, you actually really merged the Regulations of the two Realms!” Hu Luo inhaled sharply. On the surface, it seemed like they were equal, yet he was clear that he was weaker than Ling Han, a fact that he had only concealed.

Ling Han was capable of merging the Regulations of the two Realms. This naturally was no secret in the Heaven Crushing Alliance, but Hu Luo could not imagine at all that an Eternal River Tier could suddenly possess the cultivation level of the Genesis Tier, and even manage to merge the Regulations of two Realms at the level of the Genesis Tier.

This was practically like a dream!

“Surprised?” Ling Han laughed loudly, charging towards Hu Luo. He channelled the Nine Heavens Flame, which took the form of a blade of fire, and struck wildly at this old Saint King.

Rather than calling it a surprise, it would be better to call it a shock!

Only now did Hu Luo know. No wonder Ling Han dared strut back bravely like this to the Immortal Realm. As it turned out, he actually had an amazing method to release battle prowess on the level of the peak stage of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, and had furthermore merged the Regulations of the two Realms!

Hiss, if he wanted, wouldn’t he be able to immediately tear open space and enter into the Celestial Realm?

Yet this was only his wild imagination. Though Ling Han was very powerful now, this power and cultivation level did not belong to him, so there was no way that he could open the doors to the Celestial Realm.

The other Saints of the Hu Clan could tell how strong Ling Han was by now, and the other Saint King immediately leaped out, joining forces with Hu Luo to attack Ling Han.

“You come to deliver yourselves to death?” Ling Han asked menacingly.

“The only one who will be dying is you!” Hu Luo exclaimed. Since he already knew that Ling Han’s confidence originated from himself, he naturally understood that there were no other Forbidden Lands allying together to target the Hu Clan, and was relieved instead.

As long as he killed Ling Han, that was fine. The inheritance of the Celestial King would be theirs.

“Die!”

He joined forces with another Saint King, beginning the strongest barrage of attacks at Ling Han.

Ling Han casually parried a few strikes, and said, “You all probably don’t know yet, right? I have killed at least 100 Demon Masters in the Netherworld, and there were more than 20 Heaven Demons among them. With just the few of you now, it is far from enough!”

He had to be blabbering nonsense, Hu Luo and the other Saint King thought. Otherwise, their fighting spirit would definitely crumble in an instant.

“Whether you believe it or not, it doesn’t matter. Within three moves, I will send you two to your deaths!” Ling Han stimulated the Nine Heavens Flame. Though he would be able to win even without using this, it would definitely be impossible for him to kill the two of them in three moves.

He aggressively suppressed them, and even if Hu Luo was a big shot among Saint Kings, so what? One move, two, and he was already in desperate straits, and then with a strike from a flaming sword that he had formed from the Nine Heavens Flame, his physical body and soul were both burnt to nothing.

When the other Saints from the Hu Clan saw this, they were all terrified, and hurriedly stretched open their golden pathways, planning to flee. Yet Ling Han used the Banishing Technique to throw them into the separate dimension, and when they came back out, he killed each with a single sword strike as if he was merely slaughtering animals.

Six Saints were all eliminated practically in a single instant.

All the others were numb with shock, and felt that this world was really too surreal.

Though Ling Han had also killed a Saint before, that was only one. Who had seen Saints being killed in massive numbers as if they were just vegetables on the chopping block?

Ling Han... was really invincible!

In the past, the means for his strength could not possibly last forever, as he had depended on only a single drop of Saint King blood essence, but now? Not only could he be even more powerful, he had even killed two Saint Kings this time.

Just ask who else was still not convinced of his superior strength?

“Ling Han!”

“Ling Han!”

“Ling Han!”

The disciples all released a tsunami wave of cheers. This scene would eternally remain in their memory, and would also be passed down through the generations.

Ling Han smiled at the masses, his expression of pride flashing past before quickly disappearing.

This was not his true strength, and furthermore, his three power boosts had already been used up. If another Saint came, even if it was only a Small Saint, he would only be able to hide inside the Black Tower.

However, after this battle, his name would definitely be known throughout the world, and even the Forbidden Lands would be moved. Would they still dare make an enemy out of him?

Who knew if Ling Han would still be able to show his might again?

Ling Han took away the Spatial Spirit Tools that the Saints of the Hu Clan possessed, and there were a large volume of cultivation resources among them, which he handed over to the academy. This was considered a small portion of his compensation to them. As for the rest, it would have to wait when he swept through the Eight Stones Forbidden Land to get it back for them.

The Hu Clan still had a Saint King, and was still very powerful among the many Forbidden Lands, but this Saint King was not at the peak stage, and with so many Saints dying all at once, the Hu Clan would definitely begin to decline.
