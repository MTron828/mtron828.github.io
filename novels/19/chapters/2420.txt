Chapter 2421: Fighting a Celestial King

The Blue North King extended an olive branch towards Ling Han.

If this was outside, there would definitely be a great many people that would be laughing at the Blue North King for overestimating himself. As a mere First Heaven Celestial King, he actually wanted to recruit a Five-Star Grandmaster? Did he not fear that the guest would be too powerful to the point of bullying the host?

But in this place, even the strongest Celestial King was only at the Third Heaven, which had imperceptibly lowered the status of a Five-Star Grandmaster considerably. Hence, this recruitment venture of the Blue North King would not seem too abrupt.

Ling Han broke into a smile. “Thank you for your regard, Brother Blue North. However, I am only here for the sake of becoming a Celestial King, and have no intention to stay too long on the Celestial Path.”

As long as he had walked the Celestial Path, he, too, would be a First Heaven Celestial King, and added with the label of a Five-Star Grandmaster, he would definitely be much stronger than the Blue North King. Hence, there was no need for him to be humble in front of the latter. Moreover, his present strength was also endlessly close to the Celestial King Tier. If they really got into a fight, it was uncertain who would win between the two of them.

The Blue North King couldn’t help but raise a brow slightly. There were no Five-Star Grandmasters on the Celestial Path. Hence, the fact that a Five-Star Grandmaster was an equal to a Celestial King was nothing but a myth to them, and now a mere Ascending Origin Tier directly addressed him as Brother Blue North, causing a feeling of displeasure to rise up in his heart.

This was the Celestial Path; no matter how great your background was outside, it was useless. There was no way that they could interfere here!

However, as a Celestial King, he naturally was not one who would easily show emotion. Hence, he stated evenly, “All right, since Grandmaster Ling’s ambitions do not lie here, I will not force the matter, either.” He paused slightly. “However, this Celestial Tree ultimately belongs to the line of Blue North. Since Grandmaster Ling is interested, I naturally would not refuse to part with it. I shall bestow one of the fruits on Grandmaster Ling then.”

He only mentioned gifting one to Ling Han, but as for the remaining four… hehe, his approval would have to be gained.

Ling Han was unafraid, and did not back down as he asked, “Shouldn’t all natural treasures only be obtained by those with the strength and fortune to come upon them?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When everyone heard this, their heart throbbed strongly. Was Ling Han planning to publicly go against the Blue North King?

Even outside, where the status of a Five-Star Grandmaster was revered, the respect for them was still granted by cultivators. For example, Celestial Kings would be polite and respectful, but that was only on the surface. If any Five-Star Grandmaster really went too far, a Celestial King could still ignore them.

After all, this was a world ruled by cultivators!

This was the Celestial Path. A First Heaven Celestial King was an extremely powerful existence, and Ling Han actually dared to refute the Blue North King so directly. This naturally caused worry for those who were listening.

Let’s just put it this way. If the Blue North King really killed Ling Han, just see what Celestial King of the Celestial Path would come and make trouble for the Blue North King for the sake of a dead Five-Star Grandmaster? Not even one!

Sigh, this guy was really treating the Celestial Path like the Celestial Realm. The label of Five-Star Grandmaster was not as useful on the Celestial Path.

The outsiders all shook their heads, while those from the line of the Blue North looked furious. Even Shen Hao looked grim.

The Blue North King was an extremely subtle person. He did not flip out even after having been refuted like this, and merely looked coldly at Ling Han, saying, “Young man, you are very outstanding. At such a young age, you have already gained such prolific achievement in alchemy, and it is also hard to find a peer that could match you in cultivation. In the future, you will definitely attain greater accomplishments. However, if you are too stubborn, you will be broken easily. If you show too much of your skill, you will not be able to live until then, either!”

This was a threat from a Celestial King.

A fearful pressure spread out, and everyone felt their heart constrict, which was an indescribably terrible feeling.

Yet Ling Han was unconcerned. The strength of his physique was in fact close to the Celestial King Tier. This was but mere aura, and he wanted to suppress him with just that?

“I still stick by my words. All natural treasures would be obtained through destiny!” he said, neither servile nor overbearing.

The Blue North King chuckled, yet stretched out his right hand, and grabbed out at Ling Han through the air. Source Power stimulated the Regulations, turning into a giant golden hand. Multiple seals flickered to life. This was a manifestation of the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

A Celestial King had moved. Being impacted by just the slightest bit of shock wave, even the heavens were trembling, as if this realm was about to collapse.

Ling Han’s expression remained unchanging. In his eyes, a First Heaven Celestial King was really not worth much.

…He had already slaughtered many of them, and it was not just once, but thrice, and the strongest Celestial King among them had even reached Fifth Heaven!

Ling Han unleashed Fists of Fury, and channeled the terrifying power in his body. His attacks would be launched with his thoughts.?Peng, a fist shot out furiously, striking towards the giant golden hand.

When everyone saw this, they were all gaping in astonishment.

This was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. A mere Ascending Origin Tier actually wanted to clash head-on with a Celestial King. Just how much was he overestimating himself?

“You are courting death!” the red-clothed woman and the others all declared coldly, especially the red-clothed woman. She had suffered too great a loss. She could not possibly recover her black hair, and there were also a great many wrinkles on her face now, so her hatred towards Ling Han and his group was naturally bone-deep.

The outsiders were also shaking their heads. It looked like the Eastern Celestial Realm would be returning to a state when they had no Five-Star Grandmaster from now onwards.

Peng!

Just when everyone was entertaining various thoughts, Ling Han and the Blue North King had finally clashed. A terrifying gust of wind whistled. This was a clash of the strongest power of the Celestial Realm—Heavenly Venerable Tier had surpassed the range of Regulations, so it was not counted.

Boundless light dazzled, and everyone felt like they had become blind. They could not see anything clearly, but their ears were filled with a banging cacophony, showing just how terrifying the clash was now. But after only a while, even their ears had lost hearing, and they could no longer hear anything.

Because this commotion was too terrifying, and had surpassed the limits that they could bear.

Everyone was bleeding from their seven apertures, and felt their hearts beat like a drum, almost exploding.

Most people only felt discomfort, but there were also a limited few that showed expressions of indescribable shock.

…A Celestial King had already moved, so shouldn’t Ling Han have been defeated in an instant? Whether it was being captured alive or being killed, it definitely was just the matter of a single movement, yet now the ruckus was not ending. The battle was still continuing, so what did that signify?

The Blue North King had yet to defeat Ling Han!

‘How is this possible?!’

That was just a mere Ascending Origin Tier, and even if he held the status of a Five-Star Grandmaster, and that Celestial Kings would have to be polite and respectful, it definitely did not mean that his strength was really capable of making him an equal of a Celestial King,

At least 15 minutes later, everyone felt that frightening pressure had vanished, and their visibility was also slowly recovering. Their lost hearing was also improving.

The plumes of dust that filled the skies dispersed, revealing two figures that were facing each other, arms crossed behind their backs.

The Blue North King, as well as… Ling Han!

Gasp!

When they saw this, everyone was dumbfounded, and even wanted to grab their heads with both hands, screaming that this was impossible.

For an Ascending Origin Tier to stand against a Celestial King was absolutely ridiculous.

This was something that was unthinkable even in dreams, yet had taken place in reality now.

Who could believe their eyes?

“I, my eyes must have blurred!”

“This can’t possibly happen!”

“It’s fake; it’s all fake!”

After a short moment of silence, a tsunami wave of noise arose. Everyone was rendered speechless, and seemed like they were hoping that someone could tell them that all this was just a dream.

The red-clothed woman was dumbfounded. She had actually offended this kind of elite?

If Ling Han had really wanted to kill her, then what could even the Blue North King have done? The former was not afraid at all!

Only now did Shen Hao know what exactly Ling Han had meant by saying that they were prepared.

His strength was powerful enough to match a Celestial King, so he was naturally unafraid.

“Your strength is inconceivably powerful!” Blue North King said, his tone still calm, but carrying a strong feeling of curiosity.
