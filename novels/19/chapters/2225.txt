Chapter 2226: New heaven and earth

Lu Zhen and that strange creature fought fiercely, locked in a tight battle.

Because this zone had come into being only recently, and had formed unique creatures that had grasp of unique Regulations, Ling Han could not judge whether this creature was an Earth Soul emperor tier, a Heaven Soul king tier, or something else.

Their understanding of this region and the new creatures in this region was zero.

But Ling Han was sure that since Lu Zhen could not win in a short time, then it was definite that he definitely would not be able to.

The reason was very simple. The Regulations stored up in his body would be exhausted quickly, and by then, his battle prowess would drop drastically, and he would be easily killed by this creature.

Though Lu Zhen also knew this fact, he did not panic, because there was Ling Han standing behind him. If he could no longer battle, once Ling Han moved, he would be able to instantly suppress his opponent.

For the moment, Ling Han had no plans to move. He was studying the unique Regulations of this place.

Directly comprehending the Regulations was as difficult as ascending the heavens, just like if he were to enter into a different cultivation system without a guide—this was practically an impossible feat. Merely the Regulations in his body would be endlessly expelling his attempts.

But now that there was a creature of this place attacking, it provided reference material for Ling Han, so he had a sliver of hope to grasp the Regulations of this place from the attacks of this creature.

However, when the battle had reached the eighth hour, Lu Zhen suddenly fell into an exhausted state.

He had not been able to suppress that creature, yet the Regulations in his body were more or less exhausted, and he had thus sunk into a dilemma. Though he knew that there would be no danger to his life, his expression was still ugly. As an emperor tier, he naturally had great pride, and thought that there was no opponent he could not suppress, yet that wasn’t the case now, which made his expression look ugly.

Ling Han still did not move. For cultivators, life-and-death experiences were extremely important as they could better excite one’s potential. Of course, Lu Zhen knew that he would definitely interfere, so it wasn’t possible that his potential would be completely forced out.

This was fine, though. In any case, Ling Han had no intentions of nurturing this person. Merely on the basis that they were both people of the Celestial Realm, he was willing to give him a chance.

After fighting for another 30 minutes, Lu Zhen was in repeated danger. Blood would be streaming from his body endlessly, but he was still quite proud. For the whole period, he had not asked for Ling Han’s help. However, his circumstances were worsening. That creature suddenly turned its hand into a blade that stabbed at his forehead.

This attack was both quick and harsh. Strange seals flickered on its arm. If Lu Zhen was pierced through, it was probable that he would be dead in the present circumstances.

Ling Han was slightly surprised. When the battle had progressed until now, this creature’s battle prowess had actually been increasing all the while, though the rate was extremely small. However, with his insight, he naturally could notice this fact. It seemed as if this creature had initially had absolutely zero battle experience, yet now it was slowly being enlightened.

It could be said that this region was still in a state of “world creation.” Thus, the creatures here were extremely primitive, and cultivation had just begun to develop. Every creature had a great room for growth.

As he thought this, Ling Han moved carelessly, capturing that creature in a single stroke. Then, he flung it onto the ground.?Peng, a deep, bottomless pit was created in the ground, and that creature had already disappeared completely.

Yet Ling Han was slightly dumbfounded. If he were to throw it at some other place, it was probable that a great explosion would take place in the nearest 50 km, and everything would sink in, yet now there was actually just a tiny pit like this, which showed how sturdy the structure of the heaven and earth in this place was.

He stretched out his hand, and as his Origin Power surged, he plucked that creature from underground.

“Yi!” Both Lu Zhen and Mei Hua exclaimed in shock—though this creature’s limbs were drooping, there were actually no wounds on it at all.

It should be known that it had been harshly flung by a First Secret monarch tier.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and tugged at the hide of this creature.?Pa, it bounced back, showing an astonishing elasticity.

“This defense is quite shocking.” He nodded.

“No wonder I couldn’t wound it at all even after hitting it so many times.” Lu Zhen inhaled sharply.

Previously, it was indeed he that was at a slight advantage, and hit that creature a good many times, but he still did not manage to win.

Ling Han mumbled, “The world is newly created, and the first batch of creatures would be called Source Beasts. Their battle prowess far surpasses the creatures that would be born in later generations.”

“Young Master Han, are you saying that this is a new heaven and earth?” Both Lu Zhen and Mei Hua exclaimed in shock. They knew that this was a zone that had been created from the collision of the two Realms, but they had never thought of anything else.

Ling Han nodded. The power of the heaven and earth was strongest, and that was why they could suppress Heavenly Venerates. Thus, the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm could not come in here. They could only wait until the connecting point between the two Realms stabilized to unleash their strongest offensive.

Regulations were only subsidiary to the heaven and earth.

This place was like a new heaven and earth, and it was definite that a batch of powerful creatures that belonged to this heaven and earth would be created. However, the heaven and earth here were still too young. The Regulations were limited to the Immortal Palace Tier, so the strongest creatures should only be the strongest of the Immortal Palace Tier.

It could not be helped. This heaven and earth were only formed through the collision of two original heaven and earth. Strictly speaking, this was only a zone, and not an actual heaven and earth.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and placed it on the head of that creature, moving to read its memories.

“Wu!” He suddenly stumbled backwards, blood dripping from his nose and eyes. He felt his heart beating extremely hard, as if it was about to explode. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He couldn’t help but feel shocked. It should be known that he had cultivated his heart into the first Mystery Realm of the human body, and Regulations of Time were active there. Even then, it had still almost exploded, so it could be imagined just how dangerous it had been.

“Young Master Han!” Lu Zhen and Mei Hua hurriedly supported Ling Han from either side.

Ling Han stood firm, and waved them off, saying, “I’m fine, but you two must not attempt to extract the memories of this creature. It is too dangerous.”

Lu Zhen and Mei Hua both nodded. Even Ling Han had come off so badly, so if they really did that, that would definitely be suicidal.

Ling Han wiped away the blood on his face. He did not give up, and placed his hand down once more.

Boom, a frightening aura filled with Primal Chaos surged towards him, as if capable of swallowing everything.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to stand off against it.

Weng, multiple streaks of golden light appeared on his body, turning into many ancient seals. They were not recognized by the heaven and earth, because Lu Zhen and Mei Hua glimpsed them for a while before complete darkness filled their vision. Their minds were completely empty, with nothing imprinted at all.

This was the true meaning of the great dao that surpassed Regulations of the Great Dao. it could be considered as another type of Regulations of the Great Dao, so it was natural that they could not possibly study it.

…Without the Black Tower, Ling Han wouldn’t have been able to cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll at all, unless he had reached Heavenly Venerable Tier, and gone back to cultivate from the beginning again. What meaning would there be to do that?

The air of Primal Chaos swallowed Ling Han’s soul completely, or rather assimilated him, dragging him into an endless darkness.

Understanding rose up in Ling Han. This was a fusion of the Regulations of both realms, so the creatures here inevitably carried the air of the Foreign Realm, which was filled with slaughter and murderous intent, as well.

He attempted to decipher the Regulations within, but discovered that this was completely pointless. The Regulations here were all shards, and could not be studied at all. They could only be formed naturally by the heaven and earth.

It could not be helped. This was not a real world, but a small zone that had been created from the collision of two worlds and two different types of Regulations.

However, through these shards of Regulations, he had grasped some bits of the Regulations of the Foreign Realm..
