Chapter 604: Disputes

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Everyone introduced themselves—except for Can Ye and Chou Zi Fei. The other four young men were called Cen Jian Sen, Yu Yuan Ming, Zou Kai Ji, Fan Wen Lin, respsectively, while the only girl, the one in red clothing, was called He Lan Yun.

The majority of martial artists were men. Women were the minority to begin with, and even less could cultivate to the Flower Blossom Tier. Since He Yun Lan was a splendid beauty, she was someone even harder to come by.

Thus, Chou Zi Fei and the others all circled around He Yun Lan. However, He Yun Lan seemed to have a favorable impression of Can Ye, and didn’t pay attention to the ingratiation of the other people.

Chou Zi Fei and the other four felt it extremely unfortunate.

They also felt unfortunate for Zhu Xuan Er, because from the looks of her figure, she was absolutely perfect, without any flaws. However, when moving their gaze onto her face, anyone would say that heaven was unfair; since she was given such a perfect physique, why was she born with such an average face?

Zhu Xuan Er won the title of number one beauty in the north region just from her figure and revealing a bit of her chin; her figure was too perfect, and a covered face gave people unlimited imagination.

But now, her figure was still perfect, but her face was no longer obscured, obviously not leaving any room for imagination.

This countenance was too ordinary.

The ten people set out again, and when talking about the Restore Heaven Academy, Chou Zi Fei and the others all appeared to be full of confidence, thinking they could definitely enter, and were without a shred of worry.

Chou Zi Fei obviously took to blows at Ling Han from time to time, and said that Restore Heaven Academy’s admittance exam was definitely as difficult as climbing the skies and that even Spiritual Pedestal Tier elites might not qualify to enter, wanting to make a fool of Ling Han.

Ling Han wouldn’t possibly care about it. When it was time for the exam, he would reveal his strength, and this guy would obviously piss his pants in fright. The more Chou Zi Fei boasted now, the harder he would fall in the future.

They travelled by day and slept at night. They all had spatial rings, and at night, they would take out tents and pitch them to cultivate and rest. On the second day, they hastened on their journey again. People shouldn’t forget to cultivate even when outside; only by maintaining optimal condition could they deal with sudden accidents.

After all, the world of martial arts was extremely brutal, and encountering slaughter for no reason was a run-of-the-mill occurence.

As expected, after traveling for three days, they encountered an accident.

Ding, ding, ding, ding , the sounds of a fierce battle were heard in the distance before them, and soon, a few people approached rapidly. On one side was a beauty a little over twenty, wearing a crimson red silk dress and holding a long sword in hand. Her opponents were four scantily clad women with heavy make-up; whether it was attacking or leaping, the two large white rabbits on their chests seemed to bounce out like surging waves.

Comparably, the girl in silk dress was not only young, but also ten times more beautiful, with long slit eyes like water and extremely touching.

These five women were all in the Flower Blossom Tier, and by the looks of the situation, the silk-dressed girl was a notch higher in Tier. However, she wasn’t keen on fighting, and after she fought her way out of the encirclement, she immediately leapt away. It was rather the four beautiful woman that were at her heels.

This was baffling to people; why did she keep running despite having the advantage?

After the four beautiful women chased her for a while, one of them threw out a ribbon at extremely fast speed, instantly catching up to the silk-dressed girl and fastening onto her small waist. With a zi, her figure instantly halted. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The other three beautiful women took advantage of it to charge over, and caught up to the silk-dressed girl, recommencing the fierce battle.

The silk-dressed girl struggled free from the constraint with great difficulty, yet fell into an encirclement again. She could only continue fighting to break through the siege.

“So beautiful!”

“Beautiful as a fairy!”

“She is my type, no one’s allowed to contest with me!”

“Get lost, I’ve also taken a fancy to her!”

Chou Zi Fei and the other four all had their eyes lit up brightly. This silk-dressed beauty was certainly extremely beautiful—a whole lot more than He Lan Yun. The other four women were not bad, but they were older after all, and since advancing into the Flower Blossom Tier slowed down aging, maybe their age was enough to be grandmothers.

The five people wanted to intervene to play out a hero rescues the beauty scenario, naturally giving the them the excuse to strike up a conversation.

“Qin Yi Yue, how could you possibly run from this young master’s grasp!” A voice came from afar, and soon, a luxurious carriage could be seen approaching quickly, drawn by two Jasper Lions. These were ancient relic species; though they were high tier, their bloodline was rare, and they were very seldomly seen.

The carriage was extremely luxurious, reaching fifteen meters in length and ten meters in height, looking like a moving palace. The materials used were extremely exquisite—Purple Pear Wood and Jade Dragon Gold, which were extremely precious and treasured materials, but looking at the designs on the carriage, it made people unceasingly disgusted.

They were all extremely vivid and lifelike designs of men and women making love. Just by looking at it, people could imagine the movements and the decadent sounds.

“Wind... Wind Moon Sect!” Cen Jian Sen was first to cry out, his gaze fixed on the flag planted on the carriage, and voice somewhat quivering.

“What!?” Chou Zi Fei and the others all cried out immediately.

The Wind Moon Sect was a super force in the middle state. It wasn’t as powerful as the five great ancient sects, but it also had Heaven Tier elites, and was far from what their backgrounds could compare to.

Instantly, their thoughts of hero rescuing the beauty immediately dimmed.

“Everyone, I am Dark Glory Valley’s Qin Yi Yue, please lend me a hand!” At this time, the silk-dressed girl asked for everyone’s help.

Dark Glory Valley!

Everyone was startled within again. That was also a great force, though much inferior to Wind Moon Sect.

“Qin Yi Yue, why involve others. I am Wind Moon Sect’s sect master’s son, and you’re Dark Glory Valley’s master’s junior disciple; we’re practically a match made in heaven. Hurry and surrender to this young master. This young master will take you into the world of paradise to enjoy the most joyous things between men and women.”

“Hu Qing Fang, don’t kid yourself! Even if I die, I won’t submit to your wishes!” Qin Yi Yue tangled persistently with the four beautiful women while reprimanding, and killing intent was all over her delicate face.

“It’s over, this beauty’s done for!” Yun Yuan Ming said covering his head, appearing to feel extreme pity.

“It’s rumored that Wind Moon Sect’s disciples are all lecherous, viewing the thing between men and women as cultivation. Wind Moon Sect’s sect master is all the more lustful. It’s rumored that he has several hundred wives alone, and the beauties that he’s defiled reach several tens of thousands!”

“Qin Yi Yue being fancied by Wind Moon Sect’s sect master’s son... it’ll definitely be hard to get away!”

“It can’t be helped, we can’t interfere at all!”

“Even if we wanted to interfere, our strength is not enough!”

Chou Zi Fei and the others found excuses for themselves. They all just entered the Flower Blossom Tier; whether it was Qin Yi Yue or the four beautiful women, they were all at least mid-level Flower Blossom Tier—there certainly was somewhat of a gap in tier.

However, for geniuses, this bit difference in tier was actually not much; wasn’t it quite normal to battle surpassing five stars?

They simply didn’t dare to provoke the Wind Moon Sect.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Can Ye, help!”

“Okay!” Can Ye said no more, and charged right up brandishing his saber.
