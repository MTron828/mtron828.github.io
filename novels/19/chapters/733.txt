Chapter 734: Fight Again with the Absolute Saber

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

“So what you mean is, I’ll be dead?” Ling Han spoke with indifference.

“You can’t be any more dead than you already are.” Xu Xiu Ran nodded. “Right now, you are just a breathing corpse.”

The five great sects ruled the realm for more than ten or even twenty thousand years; this was an extremely long time. Their rule couldn’t be shaken. After accumulation of ten thousand years, the quantity of Shattering Void Tier elites in particular was excessive to the point of making every party lose hope.

What could possibly go wrong killing a brat at mere Spiritual Infant Tier?

Even if Ling Han was now in the Shattering Void Tier, so what? Being chased by hundreds of Shattering Void Tier warriors, even if his battle prowess was in defiance of the natural order, he could only die with resentment!

One had to know that out of those who could cultivate until the Shattering Void Tier, how many could actually shatter the void and become immortal? And which one of them wasn’t a phenomenal genius of his or her era? Would one be able to bypass the ranks and kill them off so easily?

The strength of humanity at its peak!

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Then let this ‘corpse’ destroy you first!”

“Is that possible?” Xu Xiu Ran instantly pulled out the Absolute Saber. “I’ve had an enlightening encounter. My comprehension on the path of the saber had risen a level higher, allowing me to double Absolute Saber’s power and capability. Today, what do you have to counter me?”

He was indeed proud. Previously, even with the full recovery of the Demon Birth Sword, it was equally matched with the Absolute Saber. Now that the latter’s power and capability had doubled, it would naturally be suppressed entirely.

“Oh, is it?” Ling Han smiled slightly. He wasn’t afraid, because what he would be using now wasn’t the Demon Birth Sword.

Generally speaking, should worse come to worst, he still had the Black Tower.

Xu Xiu Ran stopped talking and just stared at Ling Han. Saber Qi overflowed from his body and transformed into a heavenly saber devoid of shadow behind him; this was extremely terrifying. Obviously, he was merely at the Deity Transformation Tier, yet this heavenly saber astonishingly had the aura of the Heaven Tier.

A super genius who could battle an opponent superior to himself by a whole cultivation tier! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The heavenly saber slashed down. It was about 300 meters long, so the area which fell within its range was amazing.

Ling Han raised his fists to counter the attack. In this one strike, the opponent did not use the Absolute Saber to fight. Hence, Ling Han wanted to see how much was the difference between him and this number one genius of the Absolute Saber Sect.

He did not dare to underestimate Xu Xiu Ran, so this punch had utilized his full strength.

Hong , although he used a fist, Sword Ray actually appeared in a flash to greet the heavenly saber.

As the heavenly saber smashed down, Sword Ray collapsed in an instant, the saber making an impact with Ling Han’s fist.

Weng , Ling Han’s arm trembled like a wave, so much so that it was like a dough being flattened to make pastry. His arm had gone so far as to spread out like an opened umbrella. It was difficult to express how grotesque it was.

With a slash of the saber, Ling Han was propelled over 20 meters backwards. A wound had formed on top of Ling Han’s hand, and even some veins in his arm had burst open, dyeing his entire arm red.

However, that was about it.

Xu Xiu Ran could not help but express his shock. “Merging of strength and gentleness?” He furrowed his brows. Even ordinary body arts which had achieved the level of merging strength and gentleness wouldn’t be able to withstand a strike of his saber. It was like a soft dough; no matter how soft, it should still be cut into two by a sharp blade.

Ling Han shook his arm. As Indestructible Heaven Scroll circulated, his Body of Diamond was able to automatically heal itself. In an instant, the injury was healed, leaving his skin smooth and glowing like a jade under the light.

Xu Xiu Ran remained cool. He kept the Absolute Saber in a vertical position. Although he had absolute confidence that he could cut down Ling Han with his own strength, he attached more importance to the outcome of the overall situation; this kind of evildoer had to be eradicated as soon as possible, and absolutely couldn’t be allowed to become a danger later.

Therefore, he’d use the Absolute Saber to exterminate the opponent without any second thoughts.

Weng , the Absolute Saber was slightly shining despite having been already damaged. The saber’s blade was mottled, but it still emitted a terrifyingly suppressive Qi which spread far and wide. The saber intent was flowing, making it come alive. It was as if it had its own will, and was no longer under the control of Xu Xiu Ran.

The strong were naturally proud. Who could control it?

Ling Han held up the Revere Life Sword. Weng , this sword seemed to have felt the threat. The markings on the blade glowed, with a murderous aura encircling it.

This was a killing array!

Hong , the Absolute Saber was exuding an amazing brilliance which soared into the sky, masking the sun’s rays and causing it to appear bleak. At this moment, it seemed to transform into Shattering Void Tier’s supreme capability of being able to cut down everything.

On the other hand, the Revere Life Sword’s array patterns’ glow remained sleek and restrained. It seemed to have become an ordinary sword, but Ling Han knew that at this moment, this killing sword had also entered into a state of killing any god or Buddha that dared to block its path.

A dog that bit would not bark; the strongest killing sword naturally didn’t require an extravagant appearance to show off its power.

It was a sword of massacre; its everything was meant to kill.

Xu Xiu Ran was surprised. Naturally, he was able to recognize that this was not the Level Ten Spirit Tool previously used by Ling Han. Ling Han was certainly aware of Absolute Saber’s power. Nevertheless, he had switched to another sword to fight it. What was the meaning of this?

Could it be that this sword was stronger?

He really didn’t believe it. Would it be so easy to get a Tenth Tier Spirit Tool? Even Shattering Void Tier elites wouldn’t be able to have one in each hand. Did he think that the quantity of Level Ten precious metals was too much to count? It was incredible enough to possess one, but to be able to switch to another?

It was really hard to believe!

Hong , the Absolute Saber took the initiative to kill and smashed towards Ling Han.

The Revere Life Sword had also come out from under Ling Han’s control, and automatically flew up as unlimited Sword Ray dazzled around it. It shot towards the Absolute Saber.

Peng!

The two exceptional Spirit Tools collided powerfully. In the terrifying aftermath, everything was shaken; the earth was suddenly split open, and the sun in the sky was also on the verge of collapse. The sun was a gigantic ball of fire itself. How could it hold such a strong impact?

After a single blow, the Absolute Saber and the Revere Life Sword were both thrust back in succession. The Absolute Saber emitted black light and shadow, while Revere Life Sword then led the way with endless white light. The two had divided the world into black and white, absolutely in opposition to one another.

Xu Xiu Ran expression finally changed; the Absolute Saber had not gained the upper hand!

How was that possible!?

The Absolute Saber was a weapon used by a powerful god during ancient times. Originally, it was just an ordinary weapon. The material used was at most of Level Three, but having been nourished gently and unceasingly with the essence of the powerful god, this saber had gradually detached itself from the womb of the ordinary and became a genuine heavenly saber.

That powerful god was the backbone of the saber. Therefore, even though it had gone through thousands of years, so much so that this saber had been damaged, if there was still a part of the saber left, it would still be the most powerful Spirit Tool in the world!

Among Level Ten Spirit Tools, this one could definitely be included in the top ten. Even being placed within the top three would not be an exaggeration.

However, the very same saber had been blocked.

What kind of sword was that? It was too much in defiance of the natural order!

Ling Han smiled lightly, and said, “It seems that our Spirit Tools cannot be used.” Now the two precious weapons had activated, fighting independently among themselves. Neither Ling Han nor Xu Xiu Ran could intervene. How capable were they to interfere with the battle among Shattering Void Tier creations?

However, Ling Han possessed quite a lot of Spirit Tools.

He instantly took out Demon Birth Sword, and said, “Come, let’s fight!”

Despite Xu Xun Ran’s temperament, he couldn’t help but want to curse. This fellow still had yet another Level Ten Spirit Tool!

Fortunately, if the Level Ten Spirit Tool had not awakened, then fighting against it wasn’t an impossibility.

He used the palm of his hand like a saber—with the Absolute Saber, how could he still spare other sabers a glance and need other sabers? Now, he would have to beat Ling Han with his bare hands.
