Chapter 1838: Heavenly Fire Celestial King

The large black dog shook his head, and said, “You’re far too weak right now, so it’s not beneficial for you to know too much. Initially, I wanted to help you reach the Celestial King Tier. However, following the increase in my power, I suspect that several old monsters have already detected my presence. As such, I’ll only be putting you in danger if I stay beside you.”

Ling Han was rendered speechless. To be referred to as old monsters by someone who had reached the eighth heaven or ninth heaven... Just what kind of beings were these?

They were definitely ninth heaven Celestial Kings!

He carefully recalled the past events. Even though the large black dog had always been causing trouble for him, this could also be viewed as an act of examining and tempering him. Moreover, even if the large black dog hadn’t provoked others, would the conflict between Ling Han and them not have occurred? For example, his conflict with Zihe Bingyun?

For the sake of the Heavenly Dao Jade, it was inevitable that there would have been a battle between them. Moreover, with Zihe Bingyun’s resolute nature, it was inevitable that they would have still battled to the death.

The large black dog had simply caused this battle to erupt earlier.

Anyhow, even if an elite had interfered, the large black dog would have been more than powerful enough to deal with them.

Everything was in order to train and toughen Ling Han.

Of course, the large black dog definitely wasn’t an individual of great morals. He would often lie, cheat, and screw others over, and he had even set his eyes on the panties of a fellow Celestial King. Only the large black dog would commit such atrocities, and only the large black dog would ponder such atrocities.

Not long ago, the large black dog had also given him some suggestions regarding his cultivation. Most importantly, he had told him about the fifth severance. This was an obstacle that Ling Han had to overcome if he wanted to become a supreme Celestial King. If Ling Han had unknowingly skipped this test, there would have been no chance for him to regret his decision.

“Then what’s up with this volcano?” Ling Han asked.

A rare expression of loneliness spread across the large black dog’s face as he glanced at the volcano, and he replied, “This is the burial place of an old friend. He failed while trying to advance to the ninth heaven, and his body is buried in this mystery realm. This was his own decision, and he desired for his willpower to be refined by time such that the purest of his essence would remain for future generations to use and undergo transformations.”

Ling Han shuddered upon hearing this. “Although the ninth heaven is the pinnacle of the Celestial King Tier, eighth heaven Celestial Kings don’t necessarily need to sacrifice their lives in an attempt to reach such a level, right?” After reaching the eighth heaven, how many more opponents would one still have? Moreover, they would enjoy an infinite lifespan, so did they really need to roar in urgency and attempt to advance to the ninth heaven?

If they waited for several epochs, perhaps they could have gathered enough Source Power and Celestial medicines, thereby increasing their chance of success?

Why did they need to risk their life?

“Brat, you don’t understand!” The large black dog patted Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “On the surface, it appears as if this is a calm and peaceful world. In reality, however, there’s a terrifying killing intent hidden beneath this facade of calm.

“Grow as fast as you can. Otherwise, when this storm of darkness arrives... everything will be destroyed!”

Ling Han knew that the large black dog wouldn’t tell him any more details even if he asked. This was just like with Small Tower. When it came to these critical matters, they would always refuse to answer. Moreover, their excuse was simple—he was still far too weak. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He slowly nodded in understanding. Although he was curious about this storm of darkness or whatever, he understood that his main focus right now was raising his power.

“How is this Celestial King related to the Nine Heavens Flame?” Ling Han asked.

The large black dog chuckled before saying, “Source Powers of heaven and earth can evolve. For example, the Heavenly Dao Jade that you obtained was birthed by the life force of heaven and earth. Yet, it’s no longer a Source Power of heaven and earth. Similarly, the Nine Heavens Flame can also develop intelligence and awareness. At that time, it will no longer be a Source Power of heaven and earth. Instead... it will become a living being!”

Ling Han was astonished, and he asked, “So you’re saying that this Celestial King was formed from this Nine Heavens Flame?” No wonder the Nine Heavens Flame had been so excited just then.

“Correct!” the large black dog said with a nod. “This Celestial King was called the Heavenly Fire Celestial King, and he was skilled in manipulating fire. After his passing, a wisp of remnant flame remained burning for hundreds of millions of years, giving birth to a new Nine Heavens Flame. Meanwhile, after being burned for countless hundreds of millions of years, his murderous aura has already been refined away, with only his essence remaining.

“I then used this essence power to temper you, not to raise your cultivation level, but instead to strengthen your cultivation foundation. This is to help you reach the pinnacle in the future.”

“Can’t others use this power?” Ling Han asked.

“Of course not!” the large black dog said proudly. “This is a Source Power of heaven and earth, and unless it was me, it would rather return its essence to heaven and earth.”

Ling Han became even more curious upon hearing this. From the large black dog’s reply, it was clear that the Heavenly Fire Celestial King could have still survived even though he had failed to advance to the ninth heaven. However, he had chosen to abandon his life and leave his essence for those in the future instead.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel immense admiration.

“Come over here, brat. After preparing for hundreds of millions of years, all we yearn to see is a spark that illuminates the entire universe,” the large black dog said in a solemn voice. “After being tempered by this essence of a Celestial King, you’ll also have a greater chance of advancing to the fifth severance.”

‘After refining himself for hundreds of millions of years, the essence left behind by the Heavenly Fire Celestial King can only improve my chance of advancing to the fifth severance by a little bit. The fifth severance is far too difficult to reach, no?’

“The fifth severance is naturally extremely difficult to reach. Moreover, your foundation is still far too weak, and you haven’t been strengthened with the resources of a Celestial King Tier force, either. Although you’ve risen from a small world, and although you’ve reached a state of perfection in each major tier, your potential... Heh, potential is far too important.” The large black dog couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. “Right now, it’s time for you to defy the heavens and rewrite your fate!”

Ling Han was slightly doubtful about this. He wasn’t weaker than any prodigy. After all, weren’t Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng also the successors of Celestial King Tier forces? Yet, they had still been killed by him. Moreover, his cultivation level was even inferior to theirs.

The large black dog noticed his doubts, and he couldn’t help but scoff and say, “You think I’m comparing you to those pieces of trash? Those I care about are the successors of Celestial Kings who have at least reached the seventh heaven!

“If you come across those prodigies, you’ll understand just how terrifying they are!

“In this kind of small place, it’s simply impossible for Celestial King Tier forces to raise successors who are capable of becoming Celestial Kings. However, in genuinely powerful sects, those who are bestowed with the title of Holy Son and Holy Daughter can definitely become Celestial Kings. The only difference is which heaven they can reach.”

Upon hearing the large black dog’s words, Ling Han’s haughty pride finally subsided. A solemn expression spread across his face.

“There are many Celestial King Tier forces like this?” Ling Han asked.

“Heh, the Western Celestial Realm has always been more powerful than the Eastern Celestial Realm. However, even the Eastern Celestial Realm has several Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces. It’s just that you’re located extremely far away from them. It’s because of this that you haven’t come across any true prodigy,” the large black dog said. “I’m not trying to deflate you, but you can only rank in the lower quartile among the genuine successors of powerful Celestial King Tier forces.”

Ling Han was slightly unwilling to accept this again, and he said, “Don’t forget, I possess two Source Powers of heaven and earth!”

“I’ve already taken them into account. It’s because of them that you can rank in the lower quartile. Otherwise, heh!” The large black dog shook his head.

Ling Han was indeed deflated by this. In the next instant, however, his fighting spirit immediately started to rage. He gazed at the peak of the volcano, and he asked, “Then what about after I defy the heavens and rewrite my fate?”

“You’ll rank in the middle... or perhaps in the upper quartile,” the large black dog replied with uncertainty.

‘This is only enough to reach the upper quartile?’

An expression of doubt spread across Ling Han’s face. Was this detestable dog purposefully trying to deflate him? Even if he wanted to trigger his fighting spirit, there was no need to take things so far, right?

“Heh, if I told you that some have abandoned their body thousands of times in order to reach a state of perfection in the Severing Mundane Tier, would you be so shocked that you can’t even fart anymore?” the large black dog said with a chuckle.
