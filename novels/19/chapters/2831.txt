2832 Too much nonsense

Ling Huo moved.

He was the Source Fire of heaven and earth in human form, and now he had cultivated to the Ninth Heaven, so his first move was the highest grade of Regulations of Fire. As he delivered his punch, power condensed, turning into a giant flaming fist that descended on Rong Xinkuan.

“Party tricks!” Rong Xinkuan said disdainfully, stretching out a hand to parry this oncoming blow.

Peng!

The two men exchanged blows, and they were both shaken. Regulations turned into a violent force that spread out in all directions, turning into a terrifying shock wave.

Thankfully, this was the Ling Manor. Every single brick and stone had been refined, and was extremely sturdy, unafraid of this kind of powerful impact. Otherwise, not only would the Ling Manor be destroyed, even the whole Ling City would be ruined.

“Yi, you actually do have some strength?” Rong Xinkuan showed a hint of surprise. Originally, he had intended to subdue his opponent with a single blow; he had not imagined that Ling Huo would be unexpectedly powerful.

This was natural. He was a Source Power of heaven and earth in human form, and had cultivated to peak-stage Ninth Heaven at that, so how could he not be powerful?

Ling Huo roared, and instantly charged back towards Rong Xinkuan.

Peng, peng, peng! The two of them fought fiercely, yet it was hard to determine who was stronger.

Rong Xinkuan felt slightly embarrassed. He had always considered himself as a descendant of a super-powerful force, yet he was actually unable to suppress a mere guard of Ling City. How could he accept this?

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Several other figures shot over, yet they all practically looked the same.

They were Ling Mu, Ling Tu, and the other Source Powers of heaven and earth.

“Little Fire, do you need help?” Ling Shui asked smilingly.

“No need, I alone can suppress him!” Ling Huo declared. He had anger bottled up in him.

“What a joke. Even if you all attack together, how would you be able to suppress me!!” Rong Xinkuan was extremely furious. He inhaled softly, and his whole body immediately glowed as his battle prowess instantly spiked at least 10 times over, filled with a frightening oppressive power.

Instantly, the pressure on Ling Huo became extraordinarily heavy, and he fell into a disadvantage.

This was because Rong Xinkuan was using a Heavenly Venerate Technique, so his battle prowess naturally soared.

“We attack together!” Ling Tu and the others naturally would not just stand by and watch as Ling Huo was defeated or even killed, and they all charged.

This was not a fair one-on-one battle. Instead, it was Rong Xinkuan that had taken the initiative to come and provoke the Ling Manor. What need was there for them to be concerned about fair play?

They just had to kill him.

“So what if you are attacking together? In front of me, people like you are all trash!” Rong Xinkuan laughed loudly. His hands waved quickly, and boundless power surged out, turning into one mysterious seal after another. In a short period of time, his battle prowess had reached an extremely terrifying level.

There was no way a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could channel a Heavenly Venerate Technique for a long period of time. Ordinarily, it would be around two hours or so, but in this period of time, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could unleash battle prowess that was close to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

This was utterly terrifying.

Though Ling Huo and the others were working together, they were still being suppressed by Rong Xinkuan. They could not turn their disadvantage around no matter how hard they tried.

After several hundred moves, Rong Xinkuan threw out a heavy punch, and instantly sent Ling Huo and the others flying, causing them to throw up copious amounts of blood and lose the ability to battle any further.

Thankfully, they were all formed from the Source Powers of heaven and earth, and had incredibly tenacious vitality. They would not be dying so easily.

“Trash will be trash!” Rong Xinkuan sneered as he suppressed the boiling sensation in his chest. After using a Heavenly Venerate Technique for so long, the backlash on him was actually very serious as well, but he was stubbornly clinging to his pride, and would not show his weakness no matter the cost.

Ling Huo and the others could say nothing in response. A loss was a loss.

Rong Xinkuan laughed loudly. His eyes swept over his surroundings. At this time, a great many people had come out of the Ling Manor as well, but they were all servants of the manor. There were not even many Celestial Kings among them, so it was naturally impossible that they could be Rong Xinkuan’s match.

“Aren’t you going to tell Ling Han to come out and receive me on bent knee?” Rong Xinkuan regained his arrogant, overbearing demeanor.

“Father is still in seclusion, and has no time to meet any visitors.” A sweet voice rang out. An exquisite beauty had walked out, nine ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around her, showing that she was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

This was Ling Xi.

She had actually long since cultivated to the Ninth Heaven, but to strengthen her foundations, and walk the path that her parents had to become the strongest Heavenly Venerate, she was tempering her mindset, and when the time came, she would travel from one dimension to the next.

Rong Xinkuan glanced over, and his eyes involuntarily shone brilliantly.

Beautiful, too beautiful.

Though he had had a taste of various types of beautiful women, he had never seen one as beautiful as this woman that was in front of him now. Furthermore, this woman was as pure as a pool of clear water; the mere sight of her brought comfort.

“And who are you?” he asked. His attitude was still arrogant. Even the most beautiful woman was only something to add flavor to his life in his eyes. It was impossible that he would dote on any woman like a precious treasure.

Though Ling Xi was already angered, she did not display this outwardly, because she was naturally mild-tempered. She was extremely soft and quiet, and said, “My name is Ling Xi, and my father is Ling Han.”

“Oh!” Rong Xinkuan nodded. “This is truly unexpected. To think that Ling Han would actually have such a pretty daughter!” He showed an evil grin. It looked like Ling Han would not only be surrendering a single Heavenly Venerable Seal this time.

“Who am I? How high and noble am I? How precious is my time?” he asked in quick succession. “Tell Ling Han to immediately come out and receive me on bent knee, or I will rip apart this dilapidated city of yours!”

Too arrogant; he was really too arrogant.

To say nothing of how the servants of the Ling Manor all felt unrestrained anger, even someone with a quiet, soft personality like Ling Xi felt a ripple of fury. She looked evenly at Rong Xinkuan, and said, “Sir, you have come to our clan, killed and committed violence, and demand that my father receive you on bent knee. Do you really think that there is no one powerful in Ling Clan?”

When she said the last few words, she finally revealed the dominance that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King should possess.

Actually, while she might look soft, she was tough on the inside, having inherited the Empress’s pride and Ling Han’s tenacity. However, it was all concealed by her quiet, gentle nature, and it was rare that she would show these traits.

“Beauty, fighting and killing is not suited for you. You should be sitting on my lap, and begging for favor instead.” Rong Xinkuan laughed loudly, completely unconcerned that she was the daughter of two Heavenly Venerates.

No matter how good-tempered Ling Xi was, she could not possibly tolerate this kind of insult. Moreover, she had already decided to make a move.

Boom! She moved, stimulating the boundless power of Regulation as she charged towards Rong Xinkuan.

“What!?” The moment she moved, Rong Xinkuan was astounded.

The techniques Ling Xi used were indeed still within the range of the Celestial King Tier, but as she launched her attack, there were over a dozen top-tier Regulations being channeled at the same time. This was too terrifying. It was equivalent to having over a dozen peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings attacking simultaneously. Furthermore, they were all mentally connected, and had impeccable coordination at that.

This was not as simple an equation as one plus one, but had rather been raised to a completely new height.

Rong Xinkuan hurriedly retreated, and then channeled his Heavenly Venerate Technique. Otherwise, it was extremely possible that he wouldn’t be able to withstand even 10 strikes from his opponent.

He did not dare parry at all. It was only once he had completely channeled the Heavenly Venerate Technique that a frightening brilliance burst out of his body with a boom. His power instantly increased by over a dozen times, and only then did he exchange a single blow with Ling Xi.

Peng!

...

Ling Xi was instantly forced backwards. No matter how freakish she was, if she was still limited within the range of Regulations, there was no way she could match a Heavenly Venerate Technique.

…In the hands of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, this was a powerful move that surpassed the level of Regulations. Even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could possibly be killed by this.

“Hahaha, this is all you are capable of!” Rong Xinkuan exclaimed arrogantly. Channeling a Heavenly Venerate Technique, not only did he possess the battle prowess of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he had also become one of the stronger members in this level. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Beauty, you had best obediently follow me!”

Ling Xi raised an elegant brow, and suddenly sent out a palm strike. Peng! Rong Xinkuan was instantly sent flying from the impact.

“You are spouting too much nonsense!”
