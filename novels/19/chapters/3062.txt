3063 Killed with a single punch

“You’re courting death!!” Luo Guang couldn’t help but fly into a rage.

He was a core disciple of the Red Flame Sect, the successor of a mighty Celestial-King-Tier force, yet a nobody actually dared to ignore him?

‘Are you very strong?

‘However, looking at how young you are, you’re at most a Severing Mundane Tier. I’ll consider you a fourth severance, and how many such “elites” are there in the Red Flame Sect? At best, even if you’re a Dividing Soul Tier, the Red Flame Sect also has countless of them.’

Wang Quanhe glanced at him. “I have no enmity with you, and I don’t want to kill you. But if you continue to be so ungrateful, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

Luo Guang couldn’t help but laugh in anger. “Brat, do you know who I am? I’m Luo Guang, the Red Flame Sect’s Luo Guang! My grandfather is an elder of the Red Flame Sect, a great elite of Ascending Origin Tier, and my Red Flame Sect’s sect master is a Second Heaven Celestial King!”

If such a background was revealed before Wang Quanhe met Ling Han, it would definitely give this youth a huge fright.

To say nothing of Celestial Kings, even Ascending Origin Tiers and Immortal Palace Tiers were giants to the Wang Clan. They were simply invincible.

But now?

Wang Quanhe smiled faintly, and took the initiative to grab Luo Guang.

So what if Luo Guang was a member of a Celestial-King-Tier sect? Wang Quanhe would just stretch out his hand and kill him!

“Do you really want to defy the heavens?” Luo Guang sneered as he launched a palm strike at Wang Quanhe.

Peng! As soon as the force behind their respective strikes came into contact, Luo Guang’s expression changed.

Wang Quanhe was too strong, far exceeding Luo Guang’s limits.

Luo Guang didn’t dare to hesitate at all, and he immediately took out his treasures.

Xiu! A piece of yellow paper floated out. Golden light flickered on the paper, emitting a terrifying might.

This was a treasure bestowed upon him by the elders of the Luo Clan. It could unleash attacks at the level of Dividing Soul Tier, but it could only be used a limited number of times. It was considered an exhaustible item.

As the golden light surged, it transformed into an ancient character that pressed down on Wang Quanhe.

Wang Quanhe let out a long howl, and met the attack with a punch.

Peng!

The character immediately crumbled, but Wang Quanhe also staggered, and took more than 10 steps back. It was considered a draw.

Luo Guang was shocked. He had already overestimated his opponent, but he did not expect Wang Quanhe not to be a fourth severance, but a Dividing Soul Tier!

‘What should I do?’

Although the talisman in his hand could match the other party, it was an exhaustible item. It could only be used a limited number of times. Once the power of the talisman was exhausted, how could he stop him?

At this moment, his forehead was covered in cold sweat.

“Sir, you have to think carefully about the consequences of going against the Red Flame Sect!” he said sternly.

Wang Quanhe ignored him. Since they were already facing each other, he would definitely not show mercy. This was something Ling Han had taught him. Once he made a move, he would definitely not leave any future troubles behind. People like this would most likely seek revenge afterward, so he had to kill them.

Boom! He threw another punch.

Luo Guang had no choice. He could only continue to activate the talisman to block Wang Quanhe’s attack.

On the surface, the two of them seemed to be evenly matched. Luo Guang wasn’t at a disadvantage. In fact, he was even more relaxed. He only threw out a talisman, appearing to be at ease.

Thus, everyone from the Li Clan cheered loudly for him.

“As expected of Young Master Luo!”

“Of course, an important disciple of the Red Flame Sect is powerful.”

“Pei, what important disciple? He’s a core disciple!”

“Yes, yes, yes.”

Many people began to suck up to him. If they could build a good relationship with Luo Guang and enter the Red Flame Sect in the future, wouldn’t that be like a fish leaping through the dragon gate[1]?

However, there were also people with good eyesight who fell in deep thought and shock.

How long had it been?

Three years, just three years, but Wang Quanhe’s strength had shockingly reached a height that even the Li Clan looked up to. Who would believe that Wang Quanhe had cultivated to this level all by himself?

Thus, Wang Quanhe definitely had a great elite backing him, or even a super-powerful force.

To be able to nurture Wang Quanhe in three years, just how terrifying was this elite or this force?

Just the thought of it was terrifying.

The more Wang Quanhe fought, the fiercer he became. After another dozen punches, the golden light on the talisman began to dim.

‘Sh*t!’

The members of the Li Clan could clearly see it, and the cheers and shouts from before had all quieted down, and eventually disappeared.

How were they supposed to cheer?

They were about to lose.

Peng! As expected, after another three consecutive punches, the talisman shattered.

Wang Quanhe’s killing intent was already blazing as he threw a punch at Luo Guang. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Since he had made his move, he would not show any mercy.

“How dare you!!” Luo Guang roared. “I’m a disciple of the Red Flame Sect. If you kill me, it’s equivalent to—”

Peng! Wang Quanhe’s punch had already landed. Under the suppression of the power of Dividing Soul Tier, Luo Guang did not have the ability to retaliate at all, and was immediately blasted into a rain of blood.

Everyone was so shocked that they were speechless. Luo Guang died just like that?

That was a core disciple of the Red Flame Sect!

If he died here, Wang Quanhe would definitely not be able to escape death. However, the Li Clan would also be buried with him.

‘It’s over, it’s all over.’

The members of the Li Clan all glared at Wang Quanhe with hatred. This was all because of him.

He had to have done this on purpose. This guy wanted to drag the Li Clan down with him.

Weng! The rain of blood that Luo Guang had turned into suddenly glowed, forming a human face.

This face was clearly incomparably furious. He stared at Wang Quanhe. “How dare you kill my grandson!!”

“I’ve already killed him. What’s the point of spouting such nonsense?” Wang Quanhe said disdainfully.

“Damn it, I’ll come and take your life immediately!” the face said. Pa! The image shattered and completely dissipated.

Everyone in the Li Clan felt lucky. If Wang Quanhe took the initiative to draw hatred, it might save the Li Clan from being implicated.

“Wang, Quan, He!” Li Jingchu said word by word, throwing the red veil aside. The groom was already dead, so how could she get married now?

If Luo Guang was dead, she would definitely be the one who was most disappointed.

It wasn’t because she loved Luo Guang so much, but because Luo Guang was just a stepping stone for her to enter the Red Flame Sect. Without Luo Guang pulling the strings for her, how could she be qualified to enter a Celestial-King-Tier sect with her talent?

“You’re so ruthless!” She glared at Wang Quanhe with incomparable hatred.

“I’m ruthless?” Wang Quanhe sneered. “Li Jingchu, how forgetful are you? Don’t you remember how my Wang Clan died back then?

“Let me remind you that they died because you poisoned them!”

“So what?” Li Jingchu didn’t care at all. “The Li Clan and the Wang Clan have been enemies for generations. No amount of unscrupulous means is enough. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame the Wang Clan for being too stupid.”

Wang Quanhe revealed a sad smile. He hated himself for falling in love with such a vicious woman.

Previously, he still hadn’t understood why Li Jingchu would have done such a vicious thing. Was there some kind of difficulty that had forced her to do this? This was a sliver of hope that flashed through his mind.

But now he knew that he had always been too naive.

She had never fallen in love with him. It had all been an act to destroy the Wang Clan.
