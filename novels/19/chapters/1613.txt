Chapter 1614: Exchange condition

Ling Han similarly flicked a finger, and a flash of sword light surged out. Zhong Badu ‘s attack was suddenly erased.

“En?” Zhong Badu couldn’t help but look surprised. Though he had only struck casually, the power of a Saint was the strongest in this world. How could it be that he wouldn’t be able to kill a mere Eternal River Tier?

Yet the truth was as bizarre as that. Ling Han actually dissipated a strike from him.

‘How is this possible?!’

“Interesting!” Zhong Badu stated coldly. Though he was extremely shocked, a Saint naturally had the bearing of a Saint, and he did not panic in the slightest.

“It would not be polite just to receive and not give, so you should take a strike from me as well!” Ling Han struck out at Zhong Badu, using his fingers like he would a sword.

Zhong Badu swiped out his palm in front of him to block this strike, and peng, the two of them had again exchanged blows.

They did not make another move, and merely looked at each other.

Through this exchange, Zhong Badu could confirm that Ling Han had battle prowess on the level of a Saint. This caused him great confusion because no matter how freakish you were, without reaching the level of mastery over the Regulations, however strong your power was, it would only be empty.

Yet possessing battle prowess of a Saint, and having power that was a match for his were completely two different matters.

Zhong Badu had complete confidence that Ling Han could not possibly be a match for him, but he was definitely not an opponent that he could suppress in a few moves, either. If they really battled all out, the whole Long Tribe might possibly be completely destroyed.

Though he was arrogant, he was not so conceited that he would dare be so rash in the residence of a Medium Saint. Thus, he did not make another move.

“Truly interesting!” He switched to another line. “I am extremely curious. You are clearly only in the Eternal River Tier, yet how could you possess such strong power?”

Ling Han answered, “Where is the Open Clouds Forbidden Land? I will come pay a visit when I have the time.”

“Have you consumed some natural treasures?” Zhong Badu asked further.

“I don’t like how you look, so I plan to ruin this betrothal for you,” Ling Han retorted.

Neither of them were answering each other’s questions; this was completely meaningless.

Zhong Badu paused darkly, and said, “There must be an extremely big secret that you’re concealing. I will find out all of it!”

Ling Han broke into a grin. “If you’re not scared of death, bring it on. Just see how I will kill you!”

“Haha, hahahaha!” Zhong Badu laughed loudly. “I have never seen any Eternal River Tier like you; you truly are qualified to be arrogant. For the sake of this place being the Long Tribe, I will allow you to continue with your arrogance for a while longer.”

“You too, you too!” Ling Han turned and left. Since he already knew that this Open Clouds Forbidden Land was the lair of the Open Clouds King, he knew where he should go to find the Open Clouds King in future.

Zhong Badu looked at Ling Han’s back, his eyes narrowing slightly, and leaking out killing intent. Yet, he ultimately did not make a move. Just as he had said, this place was the Long Tribe. He was not sure that he could apprehend Ling Han without causing damage to the Long Tribe.

Ling Han walked out the doors, and both Jing Yi and Yang Zige showed expressions of pride. They did not know what had happened inside the courtyard, but according to their assumption, since the young master had made a move, Ling Han naturally could only obey.

“Scram further away, and don’t come back and be an irksome presence!” Yang Zige moked. He had suffered a punch from Ling Han, so he naturally hated Ling Han very much.

Peng!

Ling Han casually threw out a punch, which landed on Yang Zige’s face. He had put so much force in the strike that the latter was sent flying. Peng, the main doors were crashed open by the impact, and Yang Zige collapsed heavily onto the ground. He rolled around a good few times on the ground, and only stopped when he collided into a stone pillar.

He was angered, embarrassed, and shocked. Ling Han actually still dared to attack him? And he again embarrassed himself in front of the young master. This caused his face to be burning red, and he wanted nothing more than to rush up and strangle Ling Han to death.

“You are dead!” he shouted with his head held high as he got to his feet. To actually make a move on him right in front of his young master; didn’t one have to see who the master was before beating his dog?

Eh, why was there no sign of movement?

Yang Zige couldn’t help but turn around to look at Zhong Badu. His impression of Zhong Badu was that he was a man who was a strong defender of his own people, no matter whose fault it was. So all the while, it was only he who would be bullying others, and he would definitely not allow others to behave atrociously towards him.

Yet now he was actually only glaring at Ling Han. What was going on here?

This was a bit awkward.

Ling Han smiled slightly, turned around, and walked off. He stretched out a hand and waved before leaving boldly.

“Young Master, he’s too arrogant, we can’t—”

Pa!

Yang Zige hurriedly complained to Zhong Badu, yet did not expect that Zhong Badu would slap him heavily when he had not even finished speaking. He was completely stunned by this action.

“Scram!” Zhong Badu spat out. He was really an idiot; could it be that he did not know how to read expressions?

Jing Yi meanwhile was shocked. She had never seen Zhong Badu lose his composure to this extent. Just what abilities did that young man have to actually push Zhong Badu to actually vent his anger on his own subordinates?

***

Ling Han returned to his own courtyard, and began thinking, supporting his head with a hand. Since Zhong Badu really was a descendant of the Open Clouds King, then no matter what, he was determined to ruin this betrothal contract.

The question here was: how was he to do that? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The grand elder of the Long Tribe had not gone to Wood Figure Planet, so it was very possible that he had not heard of his name. In that case, his brand name would not be of much use here, and judging from Zhong Badu’s behavior, it seemed like the Open Clouds Forbidden Land was very remote, and similarly did not know who he was, which led to the fact that his mighty reputation was actually completely useless here.

‘I’ll just see how things are progressing on Long Xiangyue’s side first.’ Ling Han decided to first sit and wait. After all, all he could depend on was his glorious military successes as an intimidation factor, and his true abilities were only limited to Small Saint-level. If it was not intimidating enough, then just a Medium Saint would be enough to deal with him.

Not more than two days had passed, and Long Yushan suddenly came over.

“Did you really kill two Saint Kings?” she asked in disbelief.

Ling Han smilingly replied, “That’s right. You can ask around anywhere you like, and there is nothing exaggerated about it.”

Long Yushan stared at Ling Han, yet could not believe it however hard she tried to. No matter how she looked, he was only an Eternal River Tier, but how could Long Xiangyue possibly deceive her on this matter? She suddenly made a move, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han countered casually, and the killing formations inside his body activated, surging out with Small Saint-level battle prowess. Furthermore, it was the strength of the top level, and he easily blocked this strike from Long Yushan.

He did not press his attack, because Long Yushan was only testing his power.

Long Yushan was involuntarily stunned. Previously, Ling Han had definitely not used any kind of precious Tool, yet the burst of power from him was enough to match her. From this aspect, if he still had any trump card and used it, perhaps killing a Saint King was really not just a fantastical story.

She paused, and said, “Do something for me, and I will give you a dragon horn.”

Ling Han smiled slightly, and answered, “Tell me, what is it you want me to do?”

“I want you to think of a way to cancel the betrothal that I have with the Zhong Clan,” Long Yushan said.

Yi, this was really interesting. He was intending to ruin this betrothal in the first place, but he had not thought that Long Yushan would actually use this as her condition. This was equivalent to giving him the dragon horn for free.

He said, “Marrying or not, the right to choose is yours. Wouldn’t it be fine if you just directly refused?”

“No!” Long Yushan shook her head. “The Zhong Clan has a Saint King. If we directly refuse the betrothal, it would definitely anger this Saint King. The Long Tribe would be drowned in calamity. Thus, you have to be the one to do this task!”

She was meaning to have him become a fool here.
