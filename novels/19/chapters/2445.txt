Chapter 2446: Smelly insects

It was only the second fork, and seven paths had already appeared in front of them. Even if they completely split apart, it was still not enough to traverse every single path completely to the end.

And it could be imagined that there would definitely be other forks later, so how were they supposed to choose?

Ling Han thought for a while, and then said, “If we are not going back, we should choose one path and go on.”

They had more than enough time, and could explore for a while here. Furthermore, with their memory, it would be fine even if there were even more crossroads. They were completely capable of walking back.

The Rain Emperor said, “I will walk one path alone.”

He was not someone that needed others to take care of him, but a great and noble Monarch Star.

Ling Han was naturally unworried about the strength of his second brother. He nodded. “Be careful, Second Brother.”

“You guys too.” The Rain Emperor chose the leftmost path.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others took the rightmost path. When they encountered another fork, they would make the same choice. In this way, there would eventually come a day when they would meet back up again.

The five of them went their separate ways. After Ling Han and his group traveled for a while, as expected, they saw another crossroads ahead of them.

...

“I hate labyrinths; they’re no fun!” Hu Niu pouted, appearing very unhappy.

Ling Han was just about to speak, but he immediately waved a hand. “I hear something!”

All three women entered combat stance, and Little Terror also bared its fangs, exposing its ferocious nature.

Pa, pa, pa. There was indeed a light noise coming from ahead of them. Only a while later, they saw something the size of a water buffalo appear before them.

Upon first glance, Ling Han thought that he had gone to the Foreign Realm again. This gigantic creature looked very much like an insect. Its whole body was covered with an outer shell, and there were light hairs all over this shell, and it had short, slender legs beneath.

Right, it had legs all over. It was unlike the 100 legs of a centipede, but was rather more like wild grass, growing all over each other from its body. There were so many legs all over that a mere look was enough to cause disgust.

What kind of insect was this? It was too ugly!

Ling Han did not discover any eyes on this insect. True, if it had been living constantly in such conditions, what use did it have for eyes?

Though Little Terror had no hair, its armor-like skin was very tense, showing the extreme state of nervousness it was in.

This insect should be very extraordinary. Otherwise, there was no way that Little Terror would have such a reaction.

Ling Han spread out his divine sense, wanting to communicate with this insect. Even if there was a language barrier, it would not affect communication via divine sense.

However, when his divine sense touched the insect, he felt that the response from it was completely chaotic and vague, and they could not communicate at all.

Roar!

The insect released an attack. It opened its mouth, and a shock wave immediately reverberated out.

Ling Han and the others instantly felt a terrible pain in their eardrums, as if they were about to be ripped apart.

“Duo!” Ling Han shouted loudly. Regulations shot forth, turning into multiple sharp blades that streaked towards the shock wave. Shua, shua, shua, they tore the shock wave into pieces in just a few movements.

The insect opened its mouth again. Roar, a terrifying sound wave was launched again, turning into sharp blades that shot towards Ling Han and his group.

Ling Han was shocked. This guy would actually learn his tricks. He had turned his voice into a weapon, and this stupid insect actually learnt from his example?

The Empress shoved out Hu Niu. “Go!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It was not that she feared battle, but rather that this insect was really too hideous. It was not worthy of her noble self.

“Niu’s not going!” Hu Niu shouted in fury. She turned around to push the Empress instead.

Bewitching Maiden Rou could only feel speechless. These were the two main ladies of Ling Han’s harem. They would always be contending with one another, and could not stop.

Ling Han shook his head as well. He pounced out, and charged towards the insect.

Peng, peng, peng, he shot out a series of punches, the force of each punch growing in succession, pummeling this insect to the point that it could only retreat continuously.

After being hit consecutively with 17 punches, the insect retreated no further. It was like it had been punched silly. But after only a short while, pa, it was ripped apart from the inside out, and a green liquid instantly gushed out, spraying all over.

“So smelly!” All four of them covered their noses at the same time. This insect had practically been fished out of a cesspool; its blood carried a terrible stench.

They did not want to study the insect’s corpse at all. They hurriedly sped up their steps, and rapidly passed by the corpse.

But after they had walked for a while, the rustling sounds of footsteps rang out again. From behind them, at least three insects crawled out, immediately moving to consume the bits of dead flesh and blood on the ground, and after another while, four more insects arrived, joining the contest for food.

Naturally, Ling Han and the others did not know this. They rapidly walked for quite a while, and only when they could no longer smell that stench did they feel like a weight had been lifted from them. The fruit’s fragrance could once again be smelled.

“Just how far is this celestial fruit away from us?” All four of them were curious. Smelling the intensity of this fragrance, they were sure that this celestial fruit should be quite close, yet why had they not come upon it yet?

Right at this moment, the sound of footsteps was heard again.

“It’s here again!” Ling Han said.

True enough, in just a few breaths of time, two insects appeared ahead of them, as large as bulls.

Without saying another word, Ling Han directly rushed onwards. Peng, peng, peng, he solved the problem with over a dozen punches again.

This time, he had learned his lesson. The moment he killed them, he immediately stowed the bodies of the insects into his Spatial God Tool to prevent the harm to their noses. However, the substance inside the bodies of these insects was really too smelly. Even if just the slightest bit was exposed, even if it was just a really short amount of time, the intensity of stench would be unbearable.

More importantly, the number of these insects was astonishing. At first, they would only charge out from ahead of them, but later, they would charge out from behind them, and there were countless insects at the forks. By now, they had already encountered 379 insects.

The party of four looked livid. It should be known that they were all Pseudo-Celestial Kings, yet they were still feeling so horrible from the stench, which was proof enough of how smelly these insects were.

“Let’s just forget about the Celestial Seed.” Hu Niu was already beating the drums for retreat. Her pretty little face was scrunched up tightly.

Ling Han said, “If we retreat, we will only be trapped, but here we can perhaps find the way to leave.”

Hu Niu thought for a while. Ling Han was right, so she could only force herself to tolerate this.

They forged onwards for another while longer, and they discovered that the number of insects was soaring.

The strength of these insects was actually very weak. Their Vitality Index should be around 4700, which was stronger than even the majority of Pseudo-Celestial Kings. However, the person they were facing was Ling Han, whose Body Art was close to reaching Celestial King Tier. Naturally, they would be crushed in two to three moves.

But they were really too smelly, and this stench was very penetrating and stuck easily. Now, Ling Han and the others all felt as if their bodies had been infected with the stench. No matter where they went, their noses would be able to smell that extraordinarily nasty stench, and it could not be dispersed at all.

If it were not for the fact that they could still smell the fragrance of the celestial fruit, they would definitely have been unable to hold themselves back from throwing up.

“It’s come again!”

They had just finished killing a pack, and had not managed to walk too far yet when footsteps rang out again from ahead of them.

Ling Han did not want to use his fists again. No matter how he used the power of Regulation as a shield, he would still get a sliver of that stench attached to him. Hence, he summoned the Divine Demon Sword.

A figure appeared. Shua, Ling Han raised the Divine Demon Sword and delivered a slash.

Ding!

Unexpectedly, this figure actually sent out a flash of light as well, and even the darkness could not swallow this light.

The two flashes of light collided, instantly exploding in a terrifying shockwave. Peng, that figure was instantly sent backwards along with that flash of light before crashing into the cave wall behind him and bouncing back again.

“It’s you!”
