“Duo!” Ling Han roared loudly. Like a blossoming clap of spring thunder, it instantly dispersed Jia Ming’s oppressive presence.

“You must cultivate physical arts, right?” Jia Ming said to Ling Han, and without waiting for Ling Han to respond, he then continued on all by himself, “I also cultivate physical arts. Might as well tell you, everyone in the Earth Dragon Sect cultivates physical arts. This is what’s different about our sect.”

He paused shortly, then went on, “Telling you this is to let you know, if your confidence originates from physical arts, that’s an unrealistic delusion. The physical art I cultivate is Earth Dragon Chant—after mastering it, one would possess the power of an earth dragon, crushing everything!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and said, “When the world first came to be, tens of thousands of divine beasts evolved, and the strongest divine beast is the true dragon and true phoenix, so what rank’s the earth dragon?” He cultivated Nine Dragons Tyrant Art, and didn’t even boast of being able to possess the power of nine true dragons. You only possess the power of one earth dragon, so what heck does that even count for?

Moreover, it was also because no one mastered it, or else he’d be able to blow Jia Ming to the ends of earth with a breath.

Jia Ming snorted, and said, “Everyone assumes the true dragon to be superior, yet they don’t know that the earth dragon doesn’t lose out to the true dragon at all!”

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Now you’re changing to disputing the divine beast ranks with me?”

Jia Ming cracked a smile and revealed two rows of thick white teeth. The upper two canine teeth stuck out like the fangs of a beast, appearing quite shocking. He said, “Of course not, I only want you to know just how powerful the earth dragon is! And I possess the powerful earth dragon’s bloodline, and every other day, my ancestral blood will recover a little, becoming stronger and stronger.”

Hu Niu suddenly clapped her small hands and shouted in a realization, “Hmm, aren’t earth dragons earthworms?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “That’s right. We’re now listening to a small earthworm brag all the way to the heavens.”

Everyone smiled, while Hu Niu laughed loudly. She always gave Ling Han the most face.

Jia Ming reached out with his right hand, with veins pulsating and blood surging with a gurgling sound. Hong , his headful of black hair curled backwards, and blood-red Qi erupted from within his body as if something terrifying was about to awaken.

Ling Han was slightly shocked. This person’s blood surged like thunder, showing his surprising attainments in physical arts.

In terms of the level of arts, the Nine Dragons Tyrant Art was definitely higher than the Earth Dragon Chant, but before cultivating them to the extremes, it was hard to tell which of the two was better.

It was just like the extreme of one was one hundred and the other was one thousand—before reaching one hundred, the Earth Dragon Chant wouldn’t be inferior to the Nine Dragons Tyrant Art. The difference lay in that the Nine Dragons Tyrant Art could allow Ling Han to reach one hundred faster.

The two were both in the Spiritual Infant Tier, and obviously far from reaching the extreme, so Ling Han definitely couldn’t underestimate the other party.

Ling Han stepped out from the crowd and also twisted his neck and moved his hands and feet. Pa, pa, pa, the bones all over his body also let out loud crackles as his blood sped up in circulation, gurgling like thunder.

Body arts were different from Origin Power. Before using brute force, a “warm-up” process was needed so as to completely unleash the power.

“Battle in the skies,” Ling Han said faintly.

Unexpectedly, Jia Ming refused. “What, you still care about the lives of mere ants?” Xiu , he sprung, and his figure instantly accelerated to an extreme, punching at Ling Han.

Explosive power was a part of brute force, and the speed of this jump was really no inferior to Ling Han’s Thunderclap Ninth Heaven. Of course, precisely because this was an explosive burst, it was only momentary, and the high speed couldn’t possibly be maintained constantly; otherwise, Jia Ming’s bones, blood, and flesh would scatter, unable to bear the burden.

However, this wasn’t applicable to Ling Han, because he also cultivated Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and his physique was comparable to metal that was one tier higher, enough to endure countless such bursts.

Ling Han snorted, and also clenched his fist tightly, aiming it towards Jia Ming.

Peng!

The two fists collided, and the air instantly formed ripples, spreading in all directions. Peng, peng, peng , the ground seemed to have been rooted up as the terrifying power swirled and spread to the surroundings.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, Zhu Xuan Er and the others were all sent flying. Fortunately, Hu Niu and Wenren Qian Qian were looking after them, so everyone only appeared disorderly, but didn’t suffer injuries.

Wenren Qian Qian couldn’t help but look at Hu Niu a few times. Although she already knew that Hu Niu was freakish, but personally witnessing it was still shocking. A seven- to eight-year-old little girl was actually a Spiritual Infant Tier elite and had the ability to battle surpassing tiers... deeply unfathomable.

Amidst the smoke and dust, Ling Han and Jia Ming battled, clashing with punch after punch, and battling in close quarters, each move and style extremely critical.

Because there wasn’t the slightest buffer, once one fell short in power, one would be immediately struck, and break a bone at best, and at worse... die right away!

Everyone watched anxiously, but separated by dust and smoke, they couldn’t see anything. They had to keep retreating since the aftershock was too terrifying, enough to pose a threat to them.

Only Hu Niu was fully confident in Ling Han and began to eat carefreely, not at all worried.

The fierce battle continued for a few minutes, and suddenly there was no movement. Then, a figure soared into the sky, standing there loftily.

“Haha, exciting! Exciting!” It was Jia Ming. His headful of black hair fluttered wildly, fully displaying his wild and intractable presence. “You’re the first person to make me brawl so satisfyingly, so today I’ll spare your life. But, you have to improve faster. My ancestral blood is being restored every day; the speed of improvement in strength is beyond your imagination. Otherwise, you won’t be an opponent worthy of three punches next time.”

His figure soared back down, and xiu , entered a deep pit, instantly disappearing in that black space.

Amidst the smoke and dust, Ling Han also walked out in large strides. The pulsating Qi and blood all over his body slowly regained calm as if a roaming true dragon returned to its den, no longer displaying any peculiarities.

His expression was stern, while his gaze contained an intense fighting spirit.
