3006 Escape

A massive battle erupted between six powerful individuals possessing the battle prowess of the Seventh Tier. It was an astonishing sight.

Boom, boom, boom. The city walls crumbled one after another as the entire camp was reduced to rubble. Countless fissures blanketed the earth.

Despite being held back by the joint efforts of five Seventh-Tier-battle-prowess-wielding elites, Ling Han still had the upper hand and took most of the initiative.

He was unperturbed by the attacks of Xin Qihu and the others, focusing solely on Feng Wuding.

Peng, peng, peng. Every attack that landed on him would turn into specks of light. On the other hand, the five prodigies needed to focus all their efforts to face his attack.

This was a tough battle for Xin Qihu and the others. Against an enemy that they couldn’t kill or damage, there was nothing left to feel but despair.

Fortunately, their attacks were still capable of pushing Ling Han back. Else, Feng Wuding would have long perished by now.

Even so, Feng Wuding had also suffered several blows and sustained relatively severe injuries.

He spat out blood. This was too shocking. If things were to continue, there would be a high chance of him being killed by Ling Han.

‘What should I do?’

He wasn’t willing to die. After all, he already possessed a Seventh Tier’s battle prowess while at the Fifth Tier. Who would be able to challenge him once he advanced to the Sixth or Seventh Tier?

He had so much potential ahead of him. How could he die this early?

Feng Wuding clenched his teeth and ran away.

He could no longer continue with this battle. That would simply be suicidal.

Ling Han gave chase, but Lin Youlian and the others tried their best to stop him and help Feng Wuding seize the chance to survive.

“You cannot stop me!” Ling Han barked, releasing the power of the few hundred thousand dimensions stored inside him and generating a tremendous pressure.

Boom! The surrounding area sank several dozen kilometers into the ground, compressing the earth tightly together. Xin Qihu and the others grunted in pain as their faces paled.

After all, they were not true Seventh Tiers yet. Against such an overbearing pressure, it was normal for them to feel pain.

Ling Han rushed out and sent a punch.

Feng Wuding didn’t turn back to look. He quickly released all four types of fundamental powers to form four wings of dark steel. Condensing his Power of Dimension into thrust, he flapped his wings and sped up ahead.

Boom! Ling Han’s attack couldn’t catch up to him, and missed its mark.

With a scoff, Ling Han also charged full speed ahead behind Feng Wuding. He channeled all the power in his body and increased his speed.

Lin Youlian and the others were also hot on their heels behind them.

At this rate, in another hour or maybe even less, Ling Han would catch up with Feng Wuding.

Where could Feng Wuding possibly run off to?

The answer was simple.

Who else would be able to stop Ling Han in this entire universe?

That would be the true Seventh Tier elites. The only defense against an indestructible body and an insurmountable strength was someone who benefited from those same advantages.

Feng Wuding was trying to escape into a different spatial level and seek out Chong Yan and the others on the main battlefield. Only those five powerhouses would be able to save him now.

This was the Realm Battlefield, and even though there was a spatial barrier between the two places, the distance was not far.

In less than 15 minutes, Feng Wuding managed to reach the entrance to the next spatial level. He didn’t hesitate before diving headlong into the main battlefield.

Ling Han was right behind him. He also rushed in without any sort of hesitation.

After a while, Xin Qihu and the rest appeared. After taking a slight pause, the four of them ultimately decided to rush into the main battlefield as well.

This place was too dangerous as Hysteria’s main body could be found here. It possessed strength that surpassed even the pinnacle of Seventh Tiers because it had cultivated its Powers of Dimension to an impossibly high level. This allowed it to suppress the six types of fundamental powers. Without an indestructible body, no one would be able to receive a single blow.

Hence, those that were in the main battlefield were all Seventh Tiers in the truest sense.

But in order to stop Ling Han, Xin Qihu and the others didn’t have the time to worry about the dangers. They were mildly consoled by the fact that there were still 14 Seventh Tiers fighting back against Hysteria over here.

Feng Wuding was running as fast as he could. He was already able to sense the terrifying pressure of Hysteria. This meant that its main body was already close by, and with it Chong Yan and the others as well.

He sent out a signal with his spirit to ask the five elites to come and save him.

However, Ling Han had already closed in on him, and was launching a furious punch.

Feng Wuding had to parry this blow. Otherwise, before Chong Yan and the others could come save him, Ling Han would already put a hole in his chest.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them engaged in an intense battle. However, without Xin Qihu and the others holding Ling Han back, Feng Wuding quickly found himself on the precipice of life and death.

***

In the distance.

Chong Yan and the others were in shock. They all received the help signal from Feng Wuding.

“Not good!” Their expressions drastically changed as they immediately stopped what they were doing.

“What’s wrong with you all?” Bai Fan asked. Hysteria was even more powerful now. Even with 14 Seventh Tiers joining hands, they were having difficulty stopping its progression. And with the five of them suddenly stopping, the pressure felt by the rest instantly surged.

Chong Yan and the others didn’t bother to give a response, and just up and left.

As they departed, Lin Luo and the rest were immediately pushed back over 500 kilometers from their defensive line.

The five elites rushed off as though Feng Wuding was their own flesh and blood. No, not even their own child would see such preferential treatment. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They quickly rushed towards Feng Wuding. Given the vision of Seventh Tiers, they quickly noticed two people locked in battle up ahead. One of them was Feng Wuding, the other… was Ling Han.

Ling Han!

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was furious. Ling Han was the only person who ever left a mark of shame in his life.

And now, Ling Han was trying to kill Feng Wuding.

‘Do you know what Feng Wuding symbolizes?’

Boom! Not just Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, but even Chong Yan and the rest were speeding up as much as they could. They could see that Feng Wuding was already at the end of his ropes.

“Brat, stop at once!” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper yelled.

Boom! His voice carried a powerful wave of energy, causing the space to crumble and shatter.

Fortunately, this was the main area of conflict on the Two Realm Battlefield. As such, the heaven and earth had long been destroyed. Even if the space continued to shatter, no more damage could be inflicted.

Xin Qihu and the rest were also finally closing in from behind.

Feng Wuding was overjoyed to see help closing in from both sides. He was definitely safe now.

“Ling Han, you can’t kill me. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever!” he boasted. Giving lip was about the most he could do at this point.

“Is that so?” Ling Han scoffed. Releasing the energy from the several hundred thousand dimensions stored inside him, he formed a terrifying mass of power, and punched forth with all his anger and killing intent.

Peng!

The fist turned to light as it landed on Feng Wuding’s chest. A pillar of light then pierced through his chest, coming out from the back.

“Brat!!” Chong Yan and the others were already upon Ling Han, unleashing their strongest attacks on him.

Ling Han protected himself against their blows. Even though his defenses had already reached the Seventh Tier, he would still likely be suppressed when facing a Seventh Tier’s attack. This was not the result he wanted.

“You think too highly of yourself!” Chong Yan and the rest scoffed. How could a mere Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate dare to face all five of them alone and challenge their true Seventh Tier strength?

Was that not just courting death?

Peng, peng, peng.

However, when the attacks landed, the five ultimate elites couldn’t help revealing expressions of shock.

Ling Han blocked their attacks as though it was nothing. It didn’t seem like he took any damage at all.

Gasp!

Could this kid be a Seventh Tier already?
