Chapter 972: I Merely Have a Spatial God Tool

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Pu!

The tip of the sword pierced through the net, aiming at Ling Han’s chest.

The cruel smile on the old man’s face instantly transformed into a look of astonishment. His sword hadn’t been able to penetrate Ling Han’s body!

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Sorry for cultivating my physique to such a powerful state. I’ve disappointed you.”

‘F*ck! So smug!’

The old man from the Luo Clan continued to stab with his sword, yet his attacks were naturally useless against Ling Han’s powerful physique. How could he possibly wound Ling Han? The old man wore a look of shock and disbelief. They had already used the Crimson Ground Locking Net, yet they were still unable to dispose of this ant from the small world?

“I won’t hold back if you continue stabbing at me.” Ling Han chuckled.

“Hmph! You’re trapped by the Crimson Ground Locking Net, so how are you going to escape?” The old man forcefully calmed himself down. Even the Lava Beast King—which was at the peak stage of the high extreme—couldn’t break free from this net, much less Ling Han, who was only near the peak stage of the low extreme.

Otherwise, wouldn’t the Luo Clan be too foolish to spend so many resources?

“Hehe, there are countless underground lava lakes in this place. Moreover, they’re all extremely hot, and they’re even capable of melting Godly metal. Why don’t we toss him into one?” Luo Jian suggested.

“Brilliant idea! Brilliant!” The old man from the Luo Clan clapped in excitement.

The three people all looked at Ling Han and hoped to put some pressure onto him.

In reality, they were only making empty threats. What would they do if the Crimson Ground Locking Net melted after they tossed Ling Han into a lava lake? If the net melted and Ling Han also turned into dust, then wouldn’t the Luo Clan have suffered a double loss?

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Are you guys trying to scare me? Heh, I can’t be bothered messing around anymore.”

His figure flashed as he entered the Black Tower. Then, after a split-second, he immediately exited again.

His action was so rapid that those who didn’t have a keen eye definitely wouldn’t have been able to catch it. The huge net slammed into the ground.

‘What?!’

The three people’s eyes bulged in disbelief. This was completely beyond their comprehension. How could something like this happen?

‘He escaped from the Crimson Ground Locking Net that easily?’

“H-how did you do that?” They stared at Ling Han in absolute shock. They had to ask this question regardless of whether Ling Han answered or not. Otherwise, their shock would definitely continue to chew away at their minds.

“Oh,” Ling Han said casually, “I have a Spatial God Tool. Just then, I entered it momentarily, then came back out. Your net lost its target so it naturally fell to the ground. That’s all there is to it.”

‘Spatial God Tool!’

The three people from the Luo Clan almost bit their tongues off when they heard this.

‘Precious treasure... It’s definitely a precious treasure!’

Thump, thump, thump...

Their hearts beat in excitement. How was this ant from the small world in possession of such a valuable treasure? Well, this wasn’t important. What was important was that this treasure now belonged to the Luo Clan!

Ling Han raised his fist, and chuckled. “Do you think I’ll let you live after learning of my secret? You’ve even set your eyes on my treasure. There’s definitely something wrong with your brains.”

The three people shuddered. This ant from the small world was far too unpredictable. Not only did he possess a powerful tier-surpassing battle prowess, but even his physique alone was powerful enough to make one feel despair. Perhaps only Demonic Beasts at the high extreme would pose a threat to him.

“Flee!” The three people immediately turned around to run. As long as they left this Mystery Realm, the Luo Clan would definitely do everything in its ability to capture Ling Han—even if it meant having to flee from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

This was a treasure that could only be forged by great elites of the Genesis Tier, so perhaps they would even be able to obtain the method for reaching the Genesis Tier!

There was nothing wrong with this line of thought. After all, how could an ant from the small world possibly have become so strong?

As long as the Luo Clan could endure for a few thousand years, there would eventually come a day when the entire Joint Peace Planet submitted to their prowess! Even the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire would become their plaything!

One had to admit, the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire was far too enchanting, and the minds of these people would involuntarily wander to her even when they lusted in their minds.

Ling Han unleashed his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique, and Luo Jian instantly fell into daze. Then, he was dragged into the Black Tower and killed. Immediately afterward, Ling Han unleashed his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

Whoosh!

A dazzling streak of light flashed past and struck another youth of the Luo Clan, causing him to shriek in pain as he collapsed to the ground in agony.

Xiu!

Ling Han charged toward the old man.

Fear gripped at the old man’s heart as he glanced backward.

“Brat, you’re the enemy of our Luo Clan!” he shouted.

“What? You still wanted to drink tea with me?” Ling Han sneered. “You’re not worthy!”

He drew his bow and fired another arrow. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This wasn’t the Ultimate Arrow, yet with his current strength, it was still extremely terrifying. Most importantly, it was extremely quick!

The old man from the Luo Clan hurriedly tried to dodge. There were innumerable rock columns and corners in this cave, so there was no shortage of locations where he could hide.

“How long can you hide?” Ling Han continued to fire arrow after arrow.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Sparks flew all over the place as the Origin Power arrows collided with the rock columns. Fortunately, the environment here was extremely stable. Otherwise, the rock columns would be directly punctured when struck by the arrows.

The old man didn’t dare appear before Ling Han. This made him feel extremely distressed. He was a four-star genius at the peak stage of the low extreme—theoretically speaking, he was invincible among the cultivators in this Mystery Realm.

Now, however, he didn’t even have the right to battle Ling Han head on.

‘Why is it like this?’

Ling Han held onto his sword as he walked around. “Old dog, come and fight me.”

The old man hurriedly started fleeing again upon seeing that Ling Han had stopped shooting. However, Ling Han unleashed his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique and instantly sent pain rippling through his mind, causing him to stumble.

As expected of a cultivator at the peak stage of the low extreme and someone who had tempered his body hundreds of times with secret techniques, the old man’s spirit was extremely stable. Unlike the youth, he wasn’t stunned. This was also in part due to the relatively long distance between him and Ling Han. Otherwise, the effects of the technique would definitely have been more powerful.

Ling Han caught up and slashed with his sword.

It was also a Level One God Tool, and after he activated it, its divine patterns lit up and exuded an impressive might.

The old man had no desire to skirmish with Ling Han. He only had one thought right now, and that was to leave the Mystery Realm and report the secret of Ling Han’s Spatial God Tool to the Luo Clan.

Ling Han extended his hand and activated his divine patterns of gravity.

The old man from the Luo Clan instantly stumbled and almost fell to the ground.

Having gravity suddenly change while one was sprinting at full speed was extremely fatal.

Ling Han immediately caught up and slashed with his sword. There was a brilliant flash.

The Mysterious Three Thousand!

The old man had no choice but to turn around and parry with his Divine Sword.

His battle prowess wasn’t worse than Ling Han’s, and with his full-strength strike, he wasn’t suppressed by Ling Han at all. Rather, he even enjoyed a slight advantage.

After all, he was a specialized lackey whom the Luo Clan had raised using a huge amount of resources. If he couldn’t even resist for a while, then he would be far too trashy.

“You only forcefully advanced to the Immortal level by using Mountain River Stones, and you don’t know how to control Regulations at all!” The old man was extremely ferocious after being forced into a battle. Every strike from his sword was precise and deadly.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Regulations are only a part of battle prowess. However, battle prowess isn’t merely as simple as utilizing Regulations.” He continued to harass the old man with his divine patterns of gravity, forcing him to continuously adjust his movement techniques.
