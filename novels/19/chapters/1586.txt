Chapter 1587: Killing Hu Feng

Hu Feng only had one motive for taking such risks: he wanted to solely possess the Celestial King technique and the Celestial Tool.

Otherwise, would the nine Forbidden Lands of the Netherworld share this with their allies of the Immortal Realm?

What a joke. Since he only had to cultivate the Celestial King technique to be able to merge the Regulations of the two Realms, and enter into the Celestial Realm, then what need was there for the Heaven Crushing Alliance? What did it have to do with the Immortal Realm any longer?

Promoting the merging of the two Realms? None of my business! I only wanted myself to be able to enter into the Celestial Realm, and that was enough.

Xiu!

Hu Feng’s figure suddenly streaked out. His target was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Empress. Previously, he had already tried. Ling Han was protected by the Tool Spirit, and could not be wounded at all. As long as he managed to take these two women hostage... Only then would it be possible for him to turn the tides.

“I already said that you are only meat in this place, and can only wait to be killed at my leisure, so what are you going to so much trouble for?” Ling Han very casually delivered a slap, and pa, Hu Feng was suddenly sent flying by the force like a kite that had its string cut.

Pu!

Hu Feng spat out a mouthful of blood, his face filled with shock. He actually was no match for Ling Han!

He was a great Saint, and was actually no match for an Eternal River Tier? How was he supposed to believe that?

“Don’t have too high an opinion of yourself. Beneath Celestial Kings, anyone that enters into the Black Tower will only be trampled by me,” Ling Han said calmly.

“Master is wise! Master is imperious! Master will unify the whole world, that will last for eternity!” The Asura Demon Emperor made a timely appearance. At this time, he naturally had to flatter Ling Han like crazy.

He was really filled with incredible admiration. This time, it was a Demon Master that had come in, and he was still suppressed by his master just like all those before him. His master was really too strong! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hu Feng struggled to get to his feet. Ling Han did not deal him a fatal blow, or he would have been done for with a single strike. He was both envious and defiant. The reason why Ling Han could be so powerful was only because he had obtained a Celestial Tool!

It was not he himself that had such strength; he had only had good ******* luck!

“No, this is mine! I, Hu Feng, have natural talent that is nature-defying, and will definitely become a powerful figure in the Celestial Realm in future. Tool Spirit, did you hear that? Follow me, only I will be able to return you to glory!” Hu Feng shouted at the skies.

He already knew that he was indeed no match for Ling Han in this place. Thus, his only possibility of turning the tides was for the Tool Spirit to change sides.

Small Tower appeared, and said to Ling Han, “His words have some logic to them. Brat, quickly humbly urge me to stay at your side.”

Ling Han chuckled. He knew that this proud Tower was only joking around.

Yet it was as if Hu Feng had clutched a straw when drowning. “Tool Spirit, I promise you, as long as you follow me, I will make you my equal, and definitely will not command you!”

Small Tower scoffed slightly. He spoke as if Ling Han was able to command it now.

It was proud, and couldn’t even bother to take notice of Hu Feng. It was only teasing Ling Han by habit.

Ling Han clapped his hands, and said, “Hu Feng, don’t struggle any further. Accept your fate.”

“Humph, you’re just by depending on the Celestial Tool, what strength is that? Do you dare measure yourself against me in true abilities?” Hu Feng spurred him on. Otherwise, he really did not have a sliver of a chance.

“You are in the Genesis Tier, and you actually have the fact to ask my husband to measure himself against you? You truly are shameless!” Heavenly Phoenix Maiden rebuked.

Yet Hu Feng only acted as if he had not heard her words. For the sake of his life, and also to turn the tides, so what if he was a little shameless? Losers were always in the wrong; history was written by the victors.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I am not that senseless! Hu Feng, when you hunted me before, why did I not see you suppress your cultivation level to fight me? Hoho, in your eyes, I am only an ant, and you disdained to even cast another look at me. Then, that is also the case at present: in my eyes, you are not even an ant!

“I have already shown my respect for you by saying so much nonsense to you. You can think of this as your reward for pursuing me into the Netherworld to seek death, and now, you can be on your way!”

“No!” Hu Feng roared. He was not reconciled to this.

Hong, he ignited his life force, planning to put his life on the line.

When a Genesis Tier burned their life force and put their life on the line, just how frightening would that be? The present Hu Feng would probably be able to even fight a Black Demon for a while—inside the Black Tower, with the Regulations of both Realms complete, Hu Feng could completely exhibit the might of a Saint, and was in fact stronger than he was outside.

Too bad. The problem was that... Ling Han was even stronger in the Black Tower.

He tapped out a finger. Weng, endless power crushed Hu Feng, and he was suddenly pressed onto the ground, his limbs spread out. He no longer had the sligthest ability to resist.

Inside the Black Tower, just how strong could Ling Han be?

Beneath Celestial King, he would be able to suppress all!

A single breath of air from the Severing Mundane Ancestor would be able to kill a Saint King or Heaven Demon a few hundred times over, what more when it was power on the level of a Celestial King.

“I will not yield! I will not yield! I will not yield!” Hu Feng’s eye sockets were almost splitting in his extreme fury. He did not beg for mercy. When he had hunted Ling Han, he had also been absolutely merciless. If Ling Han still felt soft-hearted towards him, then he must definitely have gone out of his mind.

He was filled with hatred. Why had he walked right into this trap? Why hadn’t he killed Ling Han at an earlier time?

“You are only going first. Not long after this, I will return to the Immortal Realm, and raze the Eight Stones Forbidden Land to the ground!” Ling Han humphed, and lowered his hand slightly. Pa, Hu Feng was instantly crushed into dust. Not even the smallest stain of blood was left behind.

He waved his hand once more, and flipped through Hu Feng’s memories. He also retrieved a Spatial Spirit Tool.

Hu Feng was indeed capable of creating a Spatial God Tool, but its capacity was limited. Thus, even a Genesis Tier would mostly bring a Spatial Spirit Tool with them, for no other reason but it having a large capacity.

After flipping through Hu Feng’s memories, realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder Hu Feng had been able to catch up to him; so it was because there was a link of karma connecting them. Now that he had killed Hu Feng, he had again formed a link of karma with the Hu Clan, which could only be severed with one to three times of undergoing heavenly tribulation.

As for those places that touched on core secrets, like the celestial technique of the Hu Clan, there was a restriction placed on Hu Feng’s memories. It would be destroyed upon contact, and there was no way to go through them at all.

“That’s all right. At least I have found out where the Eight Stones Forbidden Land is. In future, I will charge over!” Ling Han mumbled.

“Now I just have to wait for that old geezer from the Tan Clan to come, and do something big!”

Ling Han paused, and then asked, “Small Tower, if I use the power boosts three separate times, what level could my battle prowess reach? Would I be able to defeat all Heaven Demons and Saint Kings?”

Small Tower appeared. “It can only allow you to reach the peak stage of the Genesis Tier. However, on the height of Regulations, you would be able to suppress any Heaven Demon or Saint King at the peak stage because they have only grasped a portion of the Regulations of Genesis Tier.”

“Which means I will be able to defeat them in a one-on-one battle?” Ling Han asked.

“Yes.”

“Then what in a battle of one against 100, or perhaps even more than that?”

“Then your only option would be to run,” Small Tower replied without any reservations. “Even if they have only grasped a portion of the Regulations, Heaven Demons and Saint Kings would not be too much weaker than you. You would only manage a tie in a battle against 10, at most. If there were more than 10, you would definitely die in a drawn out battle.”

Ling Han rolled his eyes. “These three power boosts from you are really a trap.”

“Take it or leave it!” Small Tower was proud.

Ling Han sighed, and calculated internally. If the number of peak stage Heaven Demons he had to kill was limited, then he would choose three power boosts used separately, and if there were 20-30 peak stage Heaven Demons, he would use a single power boost, and conduct a massacre.

However, there were definitely a limited number of peak stage Heaven Demons, and even the nine Forbidden Lands would not be able to produce too many of them, what more when it was definitely impossible that all the peak stage Heaven Demons would come. Thus, he chose to use a “small” power boost.
