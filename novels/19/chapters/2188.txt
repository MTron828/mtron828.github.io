Chapter 2189: Brothers join forces

In a battle of equals, king tiers could use numbers to overwhelm the opposing side, but it would be very difficult for emperor tiers to do so. Even if they could overwhelm their enemies with numbers, they would need the combined forces of a great many emperor tiers. And in the case of monarch tiers, it was practically impossible to kill that kind of opponent.

At the beginning, the six of them were brimming with confidence. Even if Ling Han and the Rain Emperor were both monarch tiers, they were six monarch tiers against two monarch tiers, so even if there were some additional pawn soldiers added to the equation, what could it do? They would only be crushed into dust.

However, when Yan Xianlu and the others walked out, the six people immediately looked stunned because the aura that these people were exuding was world-shaking. Which one of them was not a giant among men?

Monarch tiers, they were all f******* monarch tiers!

F***, how could this be possible?

Usually, it was very rare for even a great sect of the Celestial King Tier to have a monarch tier heir. Only those Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces and above could nurture this kind of prodigy, and only one such heir would exist in each era.

Only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier sect could simultaneously nurture a considerable number of monarch tier heirs.

For example… the Great Majestic Sect. Even among Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces, the Great Majestic Sect was one of the finest existences, practically the king of the entire Celestial Realm, an invincible great emperor.

But what was going on here now? With a simple tug, so many monarch tiers had popped out?

“Yi, you are Yan Xianlu!”

“You are Cheng Zixin!”

“Fu Zhou!”

“He Xinjue!”

These six people actually recognized Yan Xianlu and the others, though they were not familiar with the Empress, Hu Niu, and the other women.

“Zhan Fei.” Yan Xianlu nodded, looking at one of them.

“Feng Xingren.” Cheng Zixin also looked towards another person.

It looked like these people were all monarch tiers of the Eastern Celestial Realm, and they might have met each other before, or heard of them, or seen their memory images.

“Brother Yan, give me some face, and don’t get involved in this messy situation,” Zhan Fei stated solemnly.

In a one-on-one battle, he had the confidence to defeat Yan Xianlu, but in a battle royale, the Rain Emperor was too strong, so with the additional help of another monarch tier, the difficulty level of killing him would be multiplied several times over.

Yan Xianlu shook his head. “I would instead like to ask Brother Zhan to give me some face, and stop here, all right?”

On the other side, Feng Xingren was also asking Cheng Zixin for some face, and was similarly met with rejection from Cheng Zixin. The latter planned to play the role of mediator, and resolve the grudges between the two sides.

“Are you insisting on a battle?” Zhan Fei’s expression darkened. They were determined to kill the Rain Emperor today. This young man was too frightening. He had just joined the sect for 3,000 years, yet had already charged all the way from the position of an external disciple to the seat of Holy Son, and now was even showing off more of his ability, causing the other Holy Sons to pale in comparison.

If they did not kill him now, there couldn’t be any other chances for them to do so in another few years.

“Brother Zhan, harmony is to be prized in all situations.” Yan Xianlu only played mediator.

Yet Ling Han shook his head, and interrupted, “Brother Yan, you guys step down first. The reason I asked you guys to come out was merely so that they could see just how many people we brothers have on our side. However, in an actual battle, us two brothers are enough.”

The Rain Emperor laughed. “Fourth Brother, you are still as domineering as usual!”

“Isn’t Second Brother the same?” Ling Han laughed as well.

Two mad men!

This was the thought that Zhan Fei and his group shared, yet they were pleased with how arrogant these two people were. Otherwise, with so many monarch tiers on their side, and their cultivation levels being further weakened, they would not have much of an advantage, either, even if they were stronger.

It was better now. A battle of six against two was going to be a sure win for them no matter how they thought about it.

“Use your strongest moves from the start, and don’t give them any chance to back out.” The six people communicated through their divine senses.

No matter how arrogant a person was, they could not possibly be an idiot. If they were outmatched, they would definitely call for help, so they definitely could not give them that opportunity.

The Empress and Hu Niu were naturally filled with confidence in Ling Han. They both immediately stepped back, and Yan Xianlu and the others also stepped back after a slight hesitation. After all, Ling Han had previously battled three of them all by himself, to the extent that Cheng Zixin and the other had completely given up.

“Second Brother, it’s all right to kill this trash, right?” Ling Han asked. The lives of these six people were dependent only on the whims of the Rain Emperor.

“Just attack as you like.” The Rain Emperor waved a hand. The so-called monarch tiers were completely below his notice.

“All right!” Ling Han nodded. With this, he could really go all out.

“You two… are truly arrogant!” Zhan Fei exclaimed menacingly. He gave a signal, and the six great monarch tiers immediately moved simultaneously, launching an offensive at Ling Han and the Rain Emperor. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Their main target was the latter. There was not the slightest significance to killing Ling Han. Hence, one of them was in charge of tying up Ling Han, while the remaining five launched deadly attacks on the Rain Emperor.

“So weak!” Ling Han humphed, and burst out with his full power using Fists of Fury.?Boom, the fist intent reverberated out, causing everyone to feel the fury presently in Ling Han’s heart.

Fists of Fury naturally could only show its full power in a state of fury.

Peng, peng, peng.?As a fist shot out, three people were instantly sent flying outwards.

The Rain Emperor’s eyes involuntarily lit up, and he declared, “Fourth Brother, you have finally created your own path!” Though it had always been Ling Han that had been the strongest in the past, the Rain Emperor had always worried about him. With how Ling Han kept to the routine, his future accomplishments would not possibly surpass predecessors, and he would be confined within set boundaries.

Of course, this kind of confinement could possibly cause even most other Celestial Kings to be envious because it could possibly reach the Eighth Heaven, or even Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier. But just going along with how others walked, how could he possibly transcend, and leap out of the set boundaries of heaven and earth?

And now, seeing Ling Han use this kind of fist technique, he felt naturally gratified. Ling Han had finally created his own path.

“I am still no match for Second Brother.” Ling Han sighed. This second brother was a true natural and extraordinary prodigy. Long ago, when he was in the small world, he had already created his own Dao, and walked his own path.

The Rain Emperor was not like him, who had a Heavenly Venerable Tier treasure like the Black Tower. Instead, all that he possessed was gained through his own power, yet he had still advanced into the ranks of monarch tiers. This was what was truly heaven-defying about him.

Ling Han felt that he was inferior to his second brother if it was to be a fair competition.

The Rain Emperor laughed. “There is no precedent for my path. Fourth Brother, you have started later, but have surpassed me now.” He, too, brandished his fists, and it was similarly a fist technique. The might of his fist technique was inferior to Ling Han’s, and only managed to force Feng Xingren and the others to back down.

Yet Ling Han knew himself. This was because his Fists of Fury had a sliver of the Source Power of heaven and earth in them, so it was naturally heaven-defying.

After this punch, Zhan Fei and the others all bore ugly expressions.

One Rain Emperor just barely managed to match three of them, yet Ling Han was even stronger, sending three of them flying with a single punch! Furthermore, the latter still had a good few monarch tiers eyeing them covetously from the sidelines. How could they possibly succeed with this?

It would only be wishful thinking.

“Let’s go!” They immediately made their decision. Fighting here would be too disadvantageous for them. They were all already Heaven Souls, while the Rain Emperor was merely an Earth Soul. Once they left this place, it could not be claimed that any one of them would be able to kill the Rain Emperor easily, but at least the joined forces of two of them were definitely capable of achieving that goal.

The six of them raced towards the mountain peak. The restrictions of the heaven and earth here were too strong. Even a Celestial King would find it very difficult to catch up with them.

Ling Han wanted to pursue them, but was stopped by the Rain Emperor. “Don’t be concerned about that trash. They are just nice for me to practice my moves.”

In a battle of Earth Soul against Heaven Soul, he actually said six great Heaven Soul monarch tiers were only good enough for him to practice his moves? This second brother was really very ambitious.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and replied, “I’ll listen to Second Brother.” He naturally would not take Zhan Fei and his group to heart, either.

…A true monarch tier should have an invincible heart. How could they possibly join forces with others to kill another because of mere jealousy?

Merely because of this, he felt that these six people were completely beneath his notice.

“Come, let’s talk as we walk.”

The Rain Emperor slung an arm around Ling Han’s shoulders, and Ling Han did the same as well. The two brothers walked towards the mountain peak, and spoke of what they had experienced in these many years.
