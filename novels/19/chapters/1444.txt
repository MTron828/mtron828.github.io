Chapter 1445 Crushing Power

In fact, in this abyss, even Saint Tools would be suppressed, not being able to unleash their full power. Thus, it was only natural that Pseudo-Saint Tools would be suppressed even more.

However, Saintly Material was Saintly Material, after all. This was analogous to how rank three king tiers would still be slightly more powerful than rank two and rank one king tiers even when their cultivation level was suppressed. Nie Tiancheng’s three opponents had only been rank one king tiers, so how could they have opposed him, a rank two king tier? Moreover, the gap between them was only broadened by Nie Tiancheng’s Pseudo-Saint Tool.

The three rank one king tiers being defeated wasn’t surprising in the least. However, the fact that they had been defeated so quickly still caused Ling Han to feel slightly astonished. He couldn’t help but take an extra glance at the peach branch.

‘When can I dig the child tree up and move it into the Black Tower?’

He wanted to eat celestial peaches. Although these celestial peaches couldn’t live up to their name anymore—they could only be regarded as immortal peaches—Ling Han didn’t mind this.

The Flying Rain Saint would definitely howl in anger if he knew about Ling Han’s thoughts. ‘You might not mind, but I mind! That’s my celestial tree!’

After absorbing the three floating rocks, Ling Han and the others rose to a height of nine meters. Because the floating rocks had been evenly absorbed by them, they naturally couldn’t shoot to the same height as if one of them had absorbed all three of the floating rocks.

However, they didn’t mind this, and they continued to snatch the floating rocks of others.

After being defeated here, one wouldn’t lose the right to compete. Instead, they merely needed to start over again. Thus, the fallen team of three immediately found another three floating rocks and rose into the sky. They had only just begun anyway, so their losses hadn’t been big.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others came across a team of seven. This team approached them aggressively, yet their expressions changed drastically the instant that they laid their eyes on Empress Luan Xing. They frantically turned around to escape, not even daring to engage in battle.

Nie Tiancheng, the North Emperor, and the others were all extremely confused. What was going on? Were they already so powerful that they could scare others off with just their aura alone?

However, Ling Han and his companions smiled knowingly—Empress Luan Xing had the title of King Tier Assassin. Although most people were only aware of her title and not her appearance, it was evident that the fleeing team of seven did know about her looks. Moreover, it was extremely likely that they had suffered at her hands before. Thus, they had been petrified immediately upon seeing her, fleeing without even daring to engage in battle.

The empress was a rank three king tier! Even though her cultivation had been suppressed, she would still possess an overwhelming advantage over them. Not only that, but Ling Han’s team had also reached the maximum number of 12.

They continued to cruise upward. Most of the time, it was just Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi doing the hard work, each of them trying their best to impress Empress Luan Xing.

In fact, Shan Jingyi was also quite extraordinary, possessing a God Tool that was formed from several types of rare Godly stones. This God Tool was only the size of a palm, yet it was incredibly heavy. When it was tossed toward an opponent, it could definitely wound their flesh and break their bones, regardless of how powerful their defenses were.

It wasn’t forged from Saintly Material, but instead composed from Level 16 or so Godly stones. However, after being tempered by a Saint, it could be regarded as a top-notch God Tool, even among the Eternal River Tier.

This God Tool was called the “Six Elements Mountains”, a name that was very similar to the Six Mountains Saint’s title. In fact, this was indeed a replica of the Six Mountains Saint’s Saint Tool. Not only could it be used to smash people, but it could even expand into a mountain. When it fell, it would be able to flatten everything beneath it.

Shan Jingyi and Nie Tiancheng teamed up, relying on the might of their two treasures to defeat anyone who dared to stand in their way. Few people could withstand their formidable power.

Half a day passed, and they had already reached a height of 300 meters. However, this was only one-tenth of the way up the valley. They were still extremely far from the large boulder that was hovering above the valley.

Although there was always a victor for the competition in the Sunken Abyss Valley, no one had ever managed to reach the height of the giant boulder before.

This was directly related to the quality and number of competitors. Even if there were someone who was more talented than anyone in history and peerless in the world, they would still fail to reach the giant boulder if there weren’t enough competition to enable this. Only when talent was bountiful and the competition was intense would it be possible for a king among kings to emerge. This person would tread upon the heads of countless other king tiers as they gradually rose to the peak.

Right now, Gu Daoyi was gazing at the giant boulder in the sky, the images of the universe and heavenly bodies flashing across his eyes. Countless great stars were born and destroyed. If Ling Han saw this, he would definitely realize that this was the power of creation and destruction.

By possessing both of these powers at once, one would be able to tear apart the barrier in space and forge a path to the Celestial Realm.

Anyhow, this wasn’t strange. After all, Gu Daoyi had originally been a prodigy of the Celestial Realm, someone who had already surpassed the peak of the Immortal level. Right now, he had been reborn with a Divine Fetus, and this naturally sped his cultivation up even more. Thus, he would face no barrier between cultivation levels.

However, he would still be limited by his cultivation level, after all, so he couldn’t genuinely wield his power of creation and destruction. Even so, there was still a faint hint of Saintly might emanating from his body. It was also because of this that he was able to subdue so many king tiers.

Around him, there were a whopping 23 king tiers standing respectfully on their floating rocks. Although the maximum number for a team was 12 people, there was nothing stopping them from forming two teams. The king tiers all wore fervent expressions as they stood guard around Gu Daoyi, and it was as if they were gazing at a god.

Without him needing to move, Gu Daoyi’s two teams of guards easily disposed of any opponents in their way. In fact, there were even rank two king tiers among his followers!

When Gu Daoyi saw Ling Han and the others, his gaze lingered on Empress Luan Xing for a moment longer. However, he didn’t command his followers to attack them.

There was no need to rush. In any case, a fresh fruit like her should be personally captured by him.

Ling Han and the others rose up with surprisingly little resistance. After all, the competition had only just begun, so there were still many inferior prodigies who weren’t king tiers trying to test their luck. If they came across king tiers, their fate would generally be sealed.

As they rose higher and higher, it also became more and more difficult to find suitable opponents.

With the intensity of the competition, the weaker prodigies were completely unable to rise to great heights. Whenever they reached a great height, they would be ruthlessly defeated and knocked down, again and again. Those who could maintain their positions at great heights were all genuine elites.

Right now, there were almost 1000 teams in the first echelon. Meanwhile, there were countless cultivators beneath them, all trying to fight their way up. Since the defeated cultivators could start over again, there would naturally be an endless stream of cultivators rising up for them to defeat. Of course, this was given that there was still enough time. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Reaching the height of the valley signals the conclusion of the first stage. From thereon up, it’s forbidden to fight as a team.”

“Moreover, according to hearsay, no one has ever been able to ascend the final 300 meters.”

“According to the pattern of the previous competitions, when the first person or team reaches the same height as the valley, the competition of the Sunken Abyss Valley will also begin a countdown. From that point onward, the competition will only last for three more days.”

“When this time expires, the person standing at the greatest height will be crowned as the winner of the competition.”

“Anyhow, after all these years, everyone is extremely curious to find out what happens if someone manages to ascend the giant boulder at the top. Or in other words, everyone is curious to see whether they’ll receive some never-before-seen reward.”

“It’s a pity that no one had ever succeeded before.”

The North Emperor and Stone Emperor spoke in an alternating manner again. They had already reached a height of 2400 meters, and this was already not far from the peak of the valley.

This also signified that their alliance was about to come to an end.

“Someone’s coming!” Nie Tiancheng suddenly exclaimed. He gazed forward, killing intent oozing from his body.

Ling Han glanced over, yet he immediately reached over to stop Nie Tiancheng from attacking. “Those are my friends!”

This was a team of five people, four of whom Ling Han recognized—Faceless, Yang Lin, Yue Ying, and the Cloud Maiden.

“Brother Ling!” the four people immediately called in greeting.

Ling Han nodded in reply before starting to greet them one by one. In fact, their team of five wasn’t especially powerful. However, they had Yang Lin on their team! This was someone with the title of “Heaven’s Blessed Child”. Indeed, Yang Lin was someone who could casually find a Saint Tool when wandering around!

Thus, they had generally only come across weaker cultivators on their ascent to this height. In other words, they had actually managed to reach this height without much difficulty.

Ling Han felt that they should stop ascending after reaching a height of 3000 meters. Firstly, they could maintain their power as a team, looking out for and protecting each other. Secondly, they could avoid coming across any top-notch king tier.

When the time limit of three days was about to expire, they could then make the jump to the second stage, thereby gaining the right to receive the blessings of heaven and earth. In any case, the floating rocks only had a movement range of six meters in the up and down direction. Thus, they could easily achieve this goal if they calculated their positions carefully.
