Chapter 2325 Run!

You Yuan was naturally stunned. He had already emptied all his pockets, and had just obtained a portion of Ancestral King blood, yet Ling Han actually could produce another portion as well.

This...!’

If it was not for the fact that Ling Han’s bottle was really too full, he would suspect that Ling Han had used some kind of trick to steal that bottle inside his Spatial God Tool. Otherwise, how else would the latter have obtained a bottle of Ancestral King blood?

“No!” He shuddered.

With the pouring of this Ancestral King blood, aura soared from Ling Han’s entire person like a smoke signal, surging skywards and turning into various forms and seals. This image was too astonishing. It was like an Ancestral King was about to manifest from the blood.

This was, this was, this was...!

“Ancestral King blood essence!” You Yuan exclaimed in shock, feeling his heart throb wildly, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Good insight.”

You Yuan couldn’t help but feel bitter and hateful. Ancestral King blood essence was too precious, and could have extraordinary effects even on a Ninth Lotus! That was blood essence, and even an Ancestral King himself did not have much. It was equivalent to the very most valuable part of a celestial medicine,

He glared harshly at Ling Han. As he saw it, Ling Han had already fallen into his hands, so everything that Ling Han had actually belonged to him.

In other words, Ling Han had used the Ancestral King blood essence that belonged to You Yuan!

‘Damn it! Damn it 10,000 times over!’

Even for a Monarch Star like himself, every step further in the Ninth Lotus could not be accomplished without several hundred million years, or even several billion years, and if there was a bottle of Ancestral King blood essence, that could completely cut down that time by half or even more. So how could he not feel terrible?

“Hehe, you are truly worrying unnecessarily.” Ling Han shook his head, and with a casual wave of his hand, a great many bottles appeared on the ground. He uncorked them one after another, and then stowed them back into the Black Tower one by one.

You Yuan’s expression had already turned from shocked to complete numbness because these many bottles all contained Ancestral King blood, and there were even two bottles of blood essence!

When Ling Han stowed all the bottles back into the Black Tower, You Yuan’s eyes had become extremely heated.

There were actually still another two bottles of Ancestral King blood essence!

His, it was all his.

“Ba, I have to offer my thanks for gifting me such great fortune,” You Yuan said arrogantly.

“Sigh, though you very sincerely called me Father, I still have to leave all these things for my real son. I have no interest in someone like you,” Ling Han said smilingly, mocking You Yuan again without the slightest bit of concern.

You Yuan’s eyes were cold. “Winning a battle of words will not help you in the slightest!”

“Bite me?” Ling Han smiled.

“I’ll kill you!” You Yuan moved. He could not wait to kill Ling Han, and snatch all the treasures the latter possessed.

...Even without the Ancestral King blood essence, merely that large amount of Ancestral King blood was enough to drive him to madness.

This time, Ling Han did not fight head-on, but rather evaded with a movement technique.

He was absorbing the energy in the Ancestral King blood essence. When breaking through in a short while, Ancestral King blood was no longer capable of helping him much, because the Ancestral King blood he had refined was really too copious, so his body had developed a very strong immunity to it. But with how violent the Ancestral King blood essence was, only an Ascending Origin Tier could absorb it. Though he was freakish, he was only a Tenth Secret, after all. Under the barrage of the Ancestral King blood essence, the physique that he had taken pride in could not withstand a single blow at all.

His skin crackled, revealing bright red flesh, and then dropped piece after piece, revealing the eerie white bones within.

“Ah!” Ling Han roared. Though his body was cracking, he still felt an overbearing energy growing inside his body, and it was rapidly raising his cultivation level.

It was as if he had gone mad. His other hand held the Origin Magic Cube, extracting the power of Regulation from within, and increasing his cultivation level.

“You were the one who had auctioned off the first portion of Ancestral King blood!” You Yuan suddenly said. “No wonder you wanted to trade for the refinement technique of Ancestral King blood! Haha, all this is just paving the way for me!

“You have really overestimated yourself; you are but a mere Tenth Leaf, yet dare to refine the Ancestral King blood essence. I do not have to move at all, and you will be crushed by the power of the Ancestral King!”

He stopped. The Ancestral King blood essence on Ling Han released a majestic light, turning into swords, sabers, axes, spears, and other weapons. Every weapon was covered with frightening seals. He did not dare to attack at all, or he would only be committing suicide.

This was equivalent to an Ancestral King unleashing his might. Even if he was a Monarch Star, so what? Without having stepped onto this cultivation level, he was completely unqualified to be a match for one.

Ling Han bared his mouth in a grin. His whole body was bathed in blood, bones to be seen everywhere, looking terrifying and distorted, yet his fighting spirit was still soaring.

He dared to do this because his physique had already reached Ascending Origin Tier in level. Otherwise, how would he have been able to hold up to the previous mad barrage of attacks from You Yuan? This was the basis for his confidence in refining the Ancestral King blood essence.

...He liked taking risks, but all the risks he took were because either he had enough confidence, or he had an alternative plan.

Energy poured like an ocean into his body, and Ling Han howled in fury, feeling like he was about to explode, yet all the blood and flesh and his body had already been shed completely, and only a skeleton was left behind.

He wanted to drain this power.

Xiu, he charged out, clenching his fist and shot a punch at You Yuan.

You Yuan paled in shock, and did not dare take it head-on at all. He hurriedly bounced back in evasion.

He was not afraid of Ling Han’s battle prowess, but the present Ling Han was covered completely in Ancestral King blood essence, and it had been completely unleashed. That ferocity was like an Ancestral King had boosted Ling Han with a technique. Whoever unwisely attacked him would only be crushing himself to dust.

This guy was too despicable. He had clearly committed suicide, yet wanted to drag him into it as well.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “If you are so awesome, don’t run. Come, fight me, your father, for 300 exchanges.” He communicated these words through divine sense.

You Yuan responded with a sneer. “You want to die, but I have no interest in accompanying you in your madness.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The two of them battled again, but this actually could only be called a chase. Ling Han was pursuing, while You Yuan was running. He did not dare to confront his opponent at all. However, Ling Han had grasped both the Regulations of Time and Space. If You Yuan merely focused on evasion, it would be very disadvantageous to him. Ultimately, there would be one or two times that he would be hit, causing him to be covered with injuries.

If it were not for the fact that he was an Eleventh Leaf, and truly had strong battle prowess, he would have long since been caught up with by Ling Han and killed.

Though Ling Han was in incredible pain, his cultivation level was soaring madly, and the aura that radiated from him was also becoming more and more frightening, as if he was a primitive demon god that was about to awaken.

You Yuan had initially been waiting patiently for Ling Han to “commit suicide,” but the more he waited, the more anxious he became.

Strange, why had this person not turned into bits of blood yet?

With how terrifying the Ancestral King blood essence was, if one could not bear it, they would be crushed to death without need to wait for too long, yet though Ling Han made for an extremely terrible sight, his aura was madly soaring, looking like it was about to spike up to the Eleventh Leaf.

What kind of monster was this guy? Having been able to withstand the barrage of the Ancestral King blood essence, he still managed to break through in the midst of battle?

Though You Yuan was extraordinarily self-confident, he definitely would not do something so mad.

For an Eighth Lotus to use Ancestral King blood essence, and in battle at that? What else could this be but suicidal?

Yet against all odds, Ling Han had survived! Boom, right at this moment, dark clouds spread out in the skies, lightning flashing in their depths. The corners of You Yuan’s mouth twitched. He was already rendered completely speechless. Ling Han had really performed a miracle that others wouldn’t even dare to think about, and was about to break through to the Eleventh Leaf.

You Yuan had never felt fear, but now his legs were shaking as he felt an indescribable chill. How could there exist such a monster! How could it be!

Ling Han laughed loudly, and rushed up into the skies, leaving You Yuan behind. He wanted to first go through the heavenly tribulation.

You Yuan only hesitated slightly before immediately turning around and running.
