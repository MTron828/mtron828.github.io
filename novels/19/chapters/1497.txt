Chapter 1498 Deliberately Distorting the Truth

A mouthful of Celestial Source Power was used up, and Gu Daoyi had no choice but to use another mouthful.This seemed to have become a spell that hastened his death. When the three mouthfuls of Celestial Source Power were expended, that would be the time for his loss.

He did not want to lose! He could not!

He was a Divine Fetus. Even in the Celestial Realm, that was one of the very best physiques to have, and it was actually inhibited by someone in the Immortal Realm! If he did not have a Saint Royal Tool, and it was Ling Han who did, then even if he did lose, he would have an excuse, but the problem now was that it wasn’t the case.

No matter how he thought about it, it was completely illogical that he would lose, but he was still losing. And this was unacceptable to him.

Gu Daoyi gave a large shout, his mouth spitting out celestial light. His Divine Fetus exploded with blazing light, and it was actually even brighter than the Sun Physique.

He... was going to go all out!

He had also activated the last mouthful of Celestial Source Power. Rather than waiting slowly for his loss, why shouldn’t he throw everything in for a daring gamble? Who knew, there might still be a chance for him to win.

However, how frightening was Celestial Source Power? Even if he was a Divine Fetus, so what? He had not specifically cultivated his physique, so the terrifying power was bubbling inside his body, and as the Divine Fetus bore the brunt of it, multiple cracks appeared on it.

Gu Daoyi used his incredibly strong willpower to suppress his crumbling body. This was how a king tier should be—doing what others could not. He waved his sword in a slash. The might of the Saint Royal Tool also soared greatly, and surpassed the level of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier.

With a burst of celestial might, he instantly gained the upper hand, and began to beat down on Ling Han.

Ling Han’s expression was cool. This was definitely a short-lived burst from Gu Daoyi. Was it not clear that even his body was about to explode? If he could still last very long in a state like this... Ling Han would really not believe that.

Once he survived this round of attacks, it would be the time for him to begin his counterattack, and that would also be the moment of his victory.

However, the Gu Daoyi of this moment was really fierce. He had exploded with two mouthfuls of Celestial Source Power at the same time, and his battle prowess had shot through the roof, so he was extraordinarily powerful at present. He could easily suppress anyone in the low extreme, medium extreme, and high extreme, and might even be able to kill those at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier.

Everyone was watching with gaping mouths, unable to release the slightest sound.

The present Gu Daoyi’s battle prowess was comparable to that of one of the big shots, but he had just broken through to the Eternal River Tier.

Yet Ling Han was also so powerful that it struck them speechless.

No matter how furious Gu Daoyi’s attacks were, Ling Han still managed to parry them, and seemed completely calm and unruffled.

This was because Ling Han had already channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll—in its peak condition, he could even take a blow from a Saint. He naturally did not raise the level to the peak at present, and this would also allow him to last longer.

Gu Daoyi could clearly see that every time Ling Han took a blow from him, there would be a golden light flickering over him, and his Origin Power was being expended at an extremely rapid pace. Then, he merely had to last until Ling Han’s Origin Power was completely exhausted, and then he would naturally be able to defeat the latter.

But what if it was his Celestial Source Power that would be expended first... Then the one who would lose would be him.

There was no way out of this; his only option was to keep fighting!

He had gone berserk, and blasted Ling Han repeatedly. He did not want to lose; he definitely did not want to lose!

Ling Han was unmoved. This was only a competition. If it was really a true battle to the death, then he completely could “die” once, and allow his body to recover to its prime condition. And then Gu Daoyi would really be unable to do anything against him.

In truth, he had not yet channeled the Indestructible True Fluid. This one drop would allow his injuries to completely vanish; the only thing it could not replenish was his Origin Power. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He still had trump cards, but Gu Daoyi did not.

In this battle, he would be the final victor!

Fight, fight, fight. Gu Daoyi was almost about to go crazy. He was fully aware that the Celestial Source Power was rapidly being expended, and it could only support him for another 10 breaths’ time at most.

The victor would be decided in this little bit of time.

Boom!

He blasted his attack without any reservation, the Saint Royal Tool dancing. He completely did not care if this attack would kill Ling Han. In this instant, his mind was only filled with the desire to win, and that had surpassed all other thoughts.

But Ling Han’s defenses made him lose all hope.

One breath, two breath... nine breaths, 10 breaths!

Gu Daoyi’s power suddenly retreated like receding floodwaters. His Celestial Source Power was completely finished, and he had fallen from the higher plane back down to the mortal plane.

“Stop!” Just at this moment, a feminine rebuke was heard.

“Lady Saint Missus!” The students did not recognize this voice, but all the teachers knew, especially the few teachers from the Ancient Academy. They hurriedly shot out, and flew up onto the martial arts ring, putting an end to the battle.

To an extent, the Saint Missus’s words represented the will of the Star Sand Saint. Who dared to disobey her?

Saint Missus?

All the students were confused. Was it the wife of the Saint, or the mother of the Saint?

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled in a frown. Why was Zhu Xiu’er here?

Under the eyes of the masses, Zhu Xiu’er walked slowly and gracefully up the martial arts ring, and said, “The victor is already decided. Why is it still not announced?”

The victor was decided? Wasn’t the battle still progressing?

All the teachers did not know what was going on. Whom was the Lady Saint Missus siding with?

However, there was no lack of clever people here, and realization immediately dawned on them—she was definitely not helping Ling Han, because Ling Han would be winning in another few moves. Did he need the Lady Saint Missus to stand up for him?

“Cough!” Immediately, a teacher cleared his throat. “Let me announce. In the competition of new disciples, the champion is Gu Daoyi!”

The masses were completely stirred up. Everyone could clearly see, so how could they not tell that Ling Han was just about to turn the tables around? It would be his turn to fiercely counterattack soon after, so how could he be judged to have lost the battle?

Gu Daoyi was also startled. He did not know Zhu Xiu’er at all; why was she helping him?

But he naturally did not want to lose, even if it would be due to the help of another.

Thus, he simply decided not to say anything.

Ling Han naturally would not yield, and asked, “May I ask how have I lost?”

How had he lost? Err... The few teachers glanced at each other. It was evident to all that Gu Daoyi was completely spent, whereas Ling Han was like a fierce tiger that had just escaped its cage, and had been about to draw his sword.

“The time for the competition is limited to only a single day and night. Since the victor had not been decided in the time given, the battle would be decided based on whoever has the upper hand,” Zhu Xiu’er answered. “Anyone could clearly see that Gu Daoyi completely had the upper hand just now, so it naturally is his victory.”

There was nothing wrong with that explanation. Previously, it had indeed been Gu Daoyi who had the upper hand, but the problem was that their battle had not commenced for a whole day and night. At present, the moon hadn’t risen to the middle of the skies, and no matter what, there was still six or eight hours until the time limit of a day and night, so it was still very early.

But the Saint Missus had already said such, and who would dare refute her words?

If she said the sun was rectangular, then it was. If she claimed that ice was hot, then it was.

So what if she chose to deliberately misrepresent the facts?

More importantly, she had clearly expressed her stand on this matter. Who would dare not give her some face?

“What, she is actually the Star Sand Saint’s wife?”

“And birthed a son for the Great Saint?”

“F***, no wonder so many teachers treat her so respectfully when she has clearly only just broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier.”

Some among the spectators were well informed, and had already mingled closely with the students in the Ancient Academy in these short few days, so they naturally would not be unaware of an important character like Zhu Xiu’er. When her identity came to light, it immediately gave rise to an uproar.

This identity... was too freaking amazing!

A teacher said, “The Lady Saint Missus has already spoken; who else dares have disagreement? Dismissed. The first place winner this time is Gu Daoyi, and if anyone dares to spout nonsense, he will not be easily spared!”

Everyone was completely quiet with fear. That was the wife of the Great Saint, and it was not just an empty name, but a noble person who had given birth to his son. The identity of her son had increased her honor, and it was enough to guarantee her glory for all ages.

“I do!” Ling Han announced loudly. He would definitely not submit. Otherwise, what need was there for him to hold out against Zhu Xiu’er? At the beginning, if he had given in, none of the later events would have happened.

His words resonated loudly!
