Chapter 2091: Charge

When Ling Han found out about Lin Yongchang’s death, he was not surprised, because this had been his doing in the first place. However, when he heard that there was a Celestial King that had intervened, his expression became strange.

Celestial King?

Where did this Celestial King come from? Was it Lu Hairong?

He was a little suspicious, but if it had not been for the intervention of a Celestial King, how could an Ascending Origin Tier elite possibly have fallen by himself twice, and even broken his teeth and disfigured himself at that?

Strange.

At the moment, he was not in the mood to ponder this problem, but was more concerned about the final results.

Very soon, the results of the third round, and the final overall results were out.

First place of the third round, Ling Han, 100 points.

Second place, Wu Zixu, 98 points.

Then, it was the overall results. First place was Ling Han, 292 points, and second place was Wu Zixu, 289 points.

Ling Han came in first!

Everyone was more accepting of this result because Ling Han had managed to enter into the ranks of top 10 in history during the herb recognizing competition. He actually should also have been second in the second competition, and was first in the third. He was really and truly deserving of becoming the champion.

Because of Lin Yongchang’s death, the prize presentation ceremony was also rushed. It was over and done with by simply stuffing a map into Ling Han’s hands.

As for second place? There was no prize.

In the first place, this competition was meant for earning prestige, allowing one to have a chance of entering into the Ancient Alchemy Tower. Thus, even the prize for the first place was more of a formality.

The Celestial medicine was inside that Mystery Realm, but was it definite that you would be able to gain it?

“Dismissed.”

The prize presentation had already ended, so it was natural that everyone would go back home..

Ling Han, Xiao Gu, the Empress, and the others walked together. But they were not heading back to the inn. Instead, they planned to leave Hundred Dragons City altogether.

Their next destination was the Yin Soul Valley.

…They had all reached peak-stage Yang Soul, and if they did not break through, they would not be able to advance any further.

There were a considerable number of Yin Soul Valleys in the Western Celestial Realm, and unlike the Yang Soul Ocean, there was no such thing as opening or closing of the Yin Soul Valley. They could be entered at any time. Thus, there was no need for Ling Han and his party to deliberately seek it out. They only had to go to the Yin Soul Valley nearest to them.

Boom!

A terrifying aura surged out, and an elite arrived from the air. There was a black peacock spreading its wings behind him. Each of its 18 feathers was as sharp as a sword, as if they themselves were Celestial Tools.

“I am Yu Wenxin, and come from the Dhara Sect,” this elite said, his voice ringing out like thunder. His eyes swept over the surroundings. “The Holy Son of our sect, Tian Qingyue, has died here, and Lord Sect Master has commanded that I investigate the reason, so I request cooperation from the side of the Ancient Alchemy Tower.”

This was an Ascending Origin Tier elite. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I am Fei Qiang. Brother Yu, please come down for a meeting,” the Ascending Origin Tier on the Ancient Alchemy Tower’s side said. However, he lacked a pair of front teeth, and with his face covered with blood, his image was really quite bad.

Yu Wenxin looked at this Ascending Origin Tier elite, his expression becoming strange.

‘What had you been doing just now? Could it be that you were fighting with your wife? Why do you look so terrible?’

He was curious, but it would not be appropriate for him to ask. The curiosity in his heart was like a persistent itch, though. With a light cough, he said, “Brother Fei, I hope you can provide cooperation.”

Fei Qiang looked troubled, and after some thought, he finally said, “Brother Yu, to be honest with you, this matter possibly involves a Celestial King.”

“What is it?” Yu Wenxin was confused.

Fei Qiang gave an account of the previous happenings, and then said, “As I deduce it, this Celestial King must have relations with one of the contestants. Otherwise, how could a great Celestial King possibly lower themselves to make a move on a Dividing Soul Tier?”

“Brother Fei, you are worrying too much.” Yu Wenxin waved a hand dismissively. “The people I seek are prodigies of cultivation, freakish geniuses that were capable of killing a Holy Son of our sect. How could it possibly be related to alchemists?”

‘That’s right.’

Fei Qiang nodded slowly. There did not exist this kind of prodigy in this world.

“Brother Yu seems to already know who the criminal is?” he asked.

Yu Wenxin nodded, “There are a total of two criminals, one by the name of Ji Wuming, and the other is named Ling Han.”

Pu!

Fei Qiang immediately spluttered. Previously, he had just said that there was no such prodigy, but in the blink of an eye, reality had hit him harshly.

There really was!

“Yi, Brother Fei, could it be that you know of these two people?” Yu Wenxin asked.

“I don’t know of Ji Wuming, but I do know Ling Han.” Fei Qiang nodded.

“Humph, to actually dare to kill the Holy Son of our sect, I truly wish to see what he looks like. It is said that this person is 21 meters tall, and has a huge d***,” Yu Wenxin said.

They were not conversing in low voices, and Ling Han heard them clearly. Involuntarily, his expression darkened.

F***, just who was it that said that he had a large d***?

“Hahahaha!” On the other side, the large black dog was rolling around in raucous laughter. This naturally was his doing.

“He definitely does not have a height of 21 meters, and as for the size of his d***, that I would not know.” Fei Qiang pointed in Ling Han’s direction. “There, the person is there.”

Yu Wenxin’s gaze instantly pierced over. A frightening pressure assaulted, and even with Ling Han’s physique, he felt like he was about to explode.

The Ascending Origin Tier was really too powerful.

Xiao Gu moved, and stepped out in front of Ling Han, immediately canceling out that pressure.

“En?” Yu Wenxin appeared slightly surprised. He stared at Xiao Gu for a while. “Who might you be, sir?” This person actually looked exactly like Ling Han. If it were not for the fact that he had taken the initiative to move, others would definitely misunderstand, and think that he was Ling Han’s divided soul.

“En, who might you be, sir?” Xiao Gu was exhilarated. What he most enjoyed was having someone knew play the game of imitation with him.

‘Who am I?’

A hint of displeasure appeared on Yu Wenxin’s face. He had already announced his name and origins just now, and the other was still asking? Was he deliberately pretending to be deaf? Suppressing his anger, he declared, “I am Yu Wenxin, and come from Dhara Sect.”

“I am Yu Wenxin, and come from Dhara Sect!” Xiao Gu said in a deadpan tone.

“Sir, what do you mean by this?” Yu Wenxin’s voice raised a notch, showing a furious expression.

By now, Xiao Gu’s imitation was not just limited to words, but even tone and expression were an exact copy. He also showed an expression of fury, and loudly demanded, “Sir, what do you….”

Yu Wenxin was almost exploding with fury. ‘You impersonate me right in front of my face, do you think this is very funny?’

“You’ve gone too far!” he declared darkly.

“You’ve gone too far!” Xiao Gu also responded darkly.

Yu Wenxin could no longer tolerate it. He moved aggressively, and sent out a palm strike through the air at Xiao Gu. Immediately, a sharp black arrow shot out, covered with seals of great dao. This was a blow that could destroy the heaven and earth.

Xiao Gu’s expression was one completely at a loss, and he did not dodge, either, simply allowing this arrow to attack him.

Pu, the black arrow penetrated into his body.

Xiao Gu looked at Yu Wenxin with an astonished expression, his face filled with confusion. Just now, weren’t we still having fun playing? Why did you hit me suddenly? Moreover, why did you hit my chest? It would not cause the slightest bit of injury.

Yu Wenxin was also incredibly shocked. He had never seen any Ascending Origin Tier dare to take an attack from him head-on like this. He gave the matter some thought, and then realization suddenly dawned on him. “You have used a secret technique, and shrunk your body. This appearance… is merely an empty shell.”

No wonder he would look exactly like Ling Han; no wonder he could sustain a blow from him head-on. This was not an actual body at all.

“You have used a secret technique…” Xiao Gu copied again.

Yu Wenxin was infuriated. ‘You actually insist on doing this even at this point in time? Just how contemptuous are you of me?’ With a battle cry, he charged towards Xiao Gu, and with a shake of his right hand, a black sword appeared. Seals of great dao flickered, its sharpness on full display.

Xiao Gu greeted the incoming attack with his fists raised.?Peng, peng, peng, he confronted Yu Wenxin head-on.

In truth, he was just a bone, and did not have any flesh and blood body. His fists were manifested through the Regulations of heaven and earth, so he naturally was unafraid of clashing head-on with a sharp weapon.
