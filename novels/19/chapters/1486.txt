Chapter 1487 Unreasonable

This woman was only at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. Moreover, she had only just broken through to this level, so her aura was extremely unstable.This woman was truly arrogant and haughty. Even the Tranquil Heart Saint and the other Saints didn’t require others to kneel before them in greeting. Yet, this woman was actually furious that he hadn’t kneeled before her? In fact, she was so furious that she was even ignoring her son now.

Just as Mo Li had warned, this woman had an extremely bad temper.

In any case, this was easy to understand. Although the Star Sand Saint was the most powerful being in the hundreds of nearby galaxies, he was already nearing the end of his lifespan. In fact, he was old enough to be the ancestor of the ancestor of the ancestor of this woman.

However, the two of them had still ended up together. If she hadn’t been attracted by wealth and fame, how could she have ended up with this kind of “senile” old man? The Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was brimming with young king tiers, so could she not have found an outstanding man to accompany her for the rest of her life?

This was definitely a scheming woman. Otherwise, there was no way she could have enticed a Great Saint to marry her at such an old age. Not only that, but they had even had a son together.

Perhaps this was her aim. No one would dare to target her and risk offending the Star Sand Saint.

In any case, how had this woman managed to enter a relationship with the Star Sand Saint? Perhaps no one knew the answer to this question. However, it was almost a certainty that she had been extremely obedient and well-behaved in the beginning. Otherwise, there was simply no way that she could have attracted the Star Sand Saint. However, immediately after becoming his wife—and especially after giving birth to their son—she started to show her true colors.

“Hmm? You’re still not kneeling?” The woman glowered at Ling Han, a haughty expression on her face.

She indeed possessed the right to be haughty. She was the wife of a Great Saint, and it could be said that she was one of the most powerful beings in the hundreds of nearby galaxies. As such, what did she need to be afraid of?

She could act in a haughty manner now, and as the master’s wife of the nine Saints, she could still act like this even after the Star Sand Saint passed away. The nine Saints would still have to treat her with utmost respect. After all, respect for one’s master was incredibly important to cultivators—even Saints wouldn’t dare to challenge this notion. Otherwise, they would be criticized and condemned by the world.

Ling Han clasped his hands, and respectfully said, “Greetings, Madam.”

The woman was naturally unsatisfied by this. She looked to the side, and said, “Zhang Jian.”

The old man hurriedly stood up, and respectfully said, “This old servant is here.”

“Capture this audacious person!” the woman commanded.

“Mom, I want to take her as my wife!” the little boy in her arm shouted as he pointed at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

“Did you hear Young Master’s request?” the woman asked.

The old man wiped the sweat from his brows, and replied, “This old servant understands!” He activated his blood and Qi again.

Boom!

His vitality rose explosively. However, there were already few chances for him to experience such vitality ever again. His blood and Qi were already nearly exhausted, and he was forcefully activating and combusting them at this moment. Thus, he naturally couldn’t use this technique many more times.

Right now, however, he was genuinely an elite at the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier! His battle prowess was off the charts!

He lashed out, a gigantic Dao Manifestation appearing behind him as his thousands of large heavenly bodies orbited around his body. This Dao Manifestation looked indomitable, measuring at least tens of thousands of meters in height. Mimicking the old man’s movements, this Dao Manifestation also launched a strike at Ling Han.

Ling Han’s expression became serious. With a roar, he unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword and activated the 10 killing formations inside his body. He then activated the Lightning Sword Technique and unleashed his most powerful attack.

The Lightning Sword Technique had become even more terrifying now. Fused with the power of Tide of the Ages, heaven’s might, and his killing formations, it could definitely be considered as the most powerful sword technique of the Immortal Realm. It was only due to the limits of Ling Han’s cultivation level that the Lightning Sword Technique was still unable to reach its pinnacle power.

‘Go!’

The sword slashed down, intent on ripping open a bright and clear sky even if it were faced with a vast expanse of chaos.

Shua! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There was a flash of sword light, and the large hand of the Dao Manifestation was instantly obliterated into nothingness. Clear skies reappeared behind him.

The old man groaned in pain. A wound had appeared on his right hand—this was caused by the backlash of the Dao Manifestation. Fortunately, it was only his Dao Manifestation that had been struck. Otherwise, his situation would have definitely been direr if he’d been the one struck by the Divine Demon Sword. He would have needed to sever his entire hand in order to prevent the murderous aura of the Divine Demon Sword from entering his body. If he didn’t, he might lose his entire arm or even be killed.

The woman was astonished. Zhang Jian had actually failed to defeat Ling Han!

She was unclear about Ling Han’s cultivation level, but she knew that Zhang Jian was an elite at the peak stage of the high extreme. Yet, he was still unable to suppress Ling Han?

Gasp!

She was naturally familiar with those who came here on a pilgrimage. With her vanity, she would definitely have these people kneel down to greet her. Thus, she was certain that Ling Han was a new student who had come here to participate in the competition.

‘A new student... can also be this powerful?’

“Trash!” the woman spat in disdain as she glowered at the old man. She then chided, “Hurry up and piss off!”

The old man didn’t dare to speak back. All he could do was suppress his blood and Qi and obediently step back.

In fact, he had only suffered a slight disadvantage in his exchange with Ling Han. He was still far from being defeated. After all, unless Ling Han used the Nine Heavens Flame, that had already been his most powerful attack. Even so, he had only managed to leave a small gash on the old man’s hand. It was evident just how powerful the old man was.

The woman walked forward with the little boy in her arms. She then peered down at Ling Han with a haughty expression, and said, “Your skills are quite impressive. I’ll make an exception for you and take you as my servant. Hurry up and thank my benevolence!”

Ling Han was astonished. ‘Was she dropped on her head as a child? She wants me to thank her for taking me as her servant?

‘What a dumb c*nt!’

He shook his head, and said, “No one in the world can force me to become their servant!”

“I disagree!” the woman said as she twirled a lock of her hair. “You might be stubborn now, but I naturally have ways to make you lower your head!”

What a joke. She was the wife of the Great Saint, and she was more so the master’s wife to the nine Saints. With such a background, could she not force this measly Eternal River Tier cultivator to lower his head?

Ling Han chuckled before turning around to leave.

He was truly unfortunate to have come across this kind of ill-tempered woman. No, he couldn’t swallow her insults like this. He had to seek out the large black dog and have him mess with this woman.

“Mom, Mom, I want my wife! I want my wife!” The little boy was still sobbing, yet the woman paid no heed to his wails. Right now, all she wanted to do was to force Ling Han to lower his head. She needed to prove her might as the wife of the Great Saint.

After experiencing this, Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden weren’t in the mood to wander around anymore. They returned to their residence together.

Three days passed, and the students from the nine campuses had all arrived. The competition was about to begin.

Everyone drew lots, deciding who they would battle against. The losers would be eliminated.

However, the top-ranked seeds such as Ling Han and Gu Daoyi were all divided into the 16 different brackets. This way, they wouldn’t come across each other until the final group of 16.

The competition began, and everyone wanted to make a name for themselves. Each battle was of utmost importance, and each competitor fought with their full power. All kinds of secret techniques were unleashed, and high-level God Tools also appeared one after another. There were many cases of underdogs emerging as the final victor.

If they possessed a God Tool or Saint Tool, those at the Heavenly Body Tier could also unleash a battle prowess that was on par with the Eternal River Tier. Thus, if their opponents weren’t at the Eternal River Tier, or if they didn’t also possess a God Tool, they would naturally suffer defeat.

However, Ling Han didn’t come across any such opponent. He won the first battle with ease, and it was much the same for the second battle.

At this moment, the number of competitors had already been reduced to just 225 people.

They drew lots again. 31 people had no opponent, and could thus automatically advance to the next round. After this round, the number of competitors would be further reduced to just 128 people. At that time, there would be no weak competitors remaining. They would all be rank two or rank three king tiers. Meanwhile, most rank two king tiers possessed powerful God Tools, so they wouldn’t necessarily be afraid of the rank three king tiers, either.

Ling Han’s next opponent was one such a rank two king tier. They were at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, and they were more so holding a Pseudo-Saint Tool in their hands.

This person was none other than Nie Tiancheng.
