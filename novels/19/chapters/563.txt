Chapter 564: Knocked Out By A Brick

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“What are you guys staring at Hu Niu like that for? No matter how much you guys look, you guys won’t get any food!” Hu Niu swept everyone with a warning glance. Could these people be thinking of the food on her? They were too bad!

The experienced person began to judge again and concluded, “Middle state’s geniuses... adding this little girl should be all.”

He seemed to have quite the reputation, so despite being humiliatingly proven wrong once, those words still received the recognition of many people, who started expressing their agreement.

“Not bad, such a little girl is definitely hard to come by in ten millennia.”

“Too freakish, absolutely unimaginable!”

Ling Han listened, couldn’t help but laugh, and said, “Hai Niu, you go down to fight.”

As Helian Xun Xue heard it, her face instantly turned pale. She hurriedly shook her head, and said, “I can’t, I can’t.”

“I said you can, so you definitely can! Don’t forget, I gave you a brick, and you can smash with that!” Ling Han encouraged her.

Helian Xun Xue didn’t know the differences of tiers, or else if she thought she was a normal little girl, she would never dare fight with a Flower Blossom Tier opponent. However, now that she didn’t know, she was fearless, nodding ignorantly.

In her mind, Ling Han was the first person she saw when she opened her eyes, so she naturally felt close to him and would listen to him.

Ling Han nodded, and shouted towards the bottom, “We’ve won ninety quotas now, right?”

Bai Yuan nodded indifferently, and said, “Correct.”

“Then let’s win a bit more. Next, this big chick will battle.” Ling Han pointed at Helian Xun Xue.

Instantly, everyone’s gazes moved over; then, they shook their heads simultaneously.

No way!

This girl didn’t have a shred of Origin Power fluctuation; wouldn’t letting her take the field to battle just be feeding the opponent?

“You dare!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang could actually look and hear in all directions amidst a fierce battle, immediately yelling at Ling Han.

Ling Han picked his hears and muttered, “None of your damn business!”

Bai Yuan, however, stared at Helian Xun Xue, and revealed an expression of deep thought. He also couldn’t see through this girl, but compared to the little girl earlier, it was completely different. Hu Niu was a deep pit like a great sea that he couldn’t see the bottom of, while this girl was like she was covered by a layer of mist.

Strange, too strange.

Helian Xun Xue looked at the height of the city walls, and immediately said weakly, “I can’t go down. It’s too high, I’ll fall to my death.”

Everyone burst into laughter. You guys were definitely clowns invited by a monkey to come jest.

Ling Han grabbed onto Helian Xun Xue and brought her down the city walls. He then smiled and said, “Go on.”

He naturally wasn’t worried at all. Helian Xun Xue’s true cultivation was in the high stage of the Heaven Tier, and she had the bloodline of true dragon. If her battle prowess was fully unleashed, even Bai Yuan might be suppressed with a single hand.

Helian Xun Xue walked forward timidly while grabbing tightly onto a brick. Everyone couldn’t help but laugh at this look.

Another opponent that looked like they couldn’t stand a single blow.

Bai Yuan pondered, and said, “Fifth, you go.”

What!?

Bian Hao and the others were greatly shocked. The fifth, Sha Zhan, was third strongest elite amongst them, and he was going to be sent out now? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Sha Zhan, a dapper and handsome man. Divine light flashed across his body, looking extremely holy; he didn’t appear like a Thousand Corpse Sect disciple at all. He walked out and looked at Helian Xun Xue. Then, revealing a breathtaken expression, he said, “Beauty, be my dao companion and I will take you to the pinnacle of the world.”

“R-rascal!” Helian Xun Xue shivered as she scolded him.

“So pure, I like it!” He laughed loudly, leaping before her and reaching out towards Helian Xun Xue’s face.

“You dare!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang roared angrily. This was the lady he’d set his eyes on! He swore that he would definitely cut off Sha Zhan’s hand, and if Sha Zhan really touched Helian Xun Xue, he would break his bones into ash.

“Hmph, fighting against me, you still have the heart to look elsewhere?” Ju Tian Ge sneered, and launched consecutive deadly attacks, instantly suppressing Xuanyuan Zi Guang.

“Get lost, damn rascal!” Helian Xun Xue screamed, swinging the brick fiercely towards the other, and she actually closed her eyes and turned her head around, as if leaving it up to chance.

Peng!

The problem was that she actually landed the hit.

Wasn’t it Sha Xuan’s fault for being frivolous and touching her face? Face to face, once Helian Xun Xue’s brute force was mustered up, that terrifying power was such that Ling Han couldn’t block it, and even Hu Niu would have to surrender.

“Ah!” Sha Zhan screamed tragically and lay on the ground. A hole opened up on his forehead as he lay straight and still.

‘What!?’

Everyone’s faces twitched; this girl really knocked out a Flower Blossom Tier elite with a brick.

“Physical cultivator!” Bai Yuan blurted two words out. The finally knew why he couldn’t see through Helian Xun Xue—she was a physical cultivator. Her power was condensed in every inch of her flesh and couldn’t be sensed until the moment it was unleashed.

“So, she’s a physical cultivator with shocking brute force!”

“Yes, in close combat, physical cultivators have the absolute advantage.”

“Haha, it’s that guy’s fault for being lustful, wanting to take advantage of her but ending up knocked out by a brick.”

“Yes, If Flower Blossom Tier warriors don’t guard their bodies with Origin Power, their defense isn’t much higher than normal people’s.”

Everyone nodded one after another, thinking that Sha Xuan lost truly wrongly—he really lost to his own lust.

“Hmph, since you’re an expert, why pretend to be in such a delicate state?” A girl from the Thousand Corpse Sect stepped out. She was the ninth, and her name was Han Gu Yun. Although the seventh was defeated, it wasn’t because Sha Xuan’s strength fell short.

She was also remarkably beautiful, but was far inferior compared to Helian Xun Xue. It couldn’t be helped; even if their looks were on the same level, Helian Xun Xue was a genuine Heaven Tier elite, after all; how could a Flower Blossom Tier warrior possibly rival that natural temperament?

Han Gu Yun immediately let out a battle cry and summoned her Corpse Soldiers. While she also had four of them, they were a little stronger than Bian Hao’s Corpse Soldiers, at least possessing fourteen stars in battle prowess.

Despite it being only a difference of one star, on top of this amount, Bian Hao would definitely be crushed by her.

Helian Xun Xue trembled; what the hell were these skeletons... it made her scared.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, the four Corpse Soldiers came attacking noisily with monstrous viciousness.

“Ah...” Helian Xun Xue let out a scream, waving the brick in her hand to swat the Corpse Soldiers. Pa, pa, pa, pa , the four corpses were instantly sent flying, losing their heads and limbs. In short, the four Corpse Soldiers were all incapacitated at once.

Pu , everyone spurted out again.

...A, a great expert!

This was too ridiculous. Sending four Corpse Soldiers flying with a few casual palms, she was even scarier than the little girl earlier.

Looking at her age; she seemed just about twenty years old, so how could she be so strong?

Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s face twitched. He’d originally thought Helian Xun Xue was just a delicate and weak lady, but never thought that her brute force was terrifying to such a degree. The four Corpse Soldiers were instantly smashed into dregs, something he might not even be able to do.

“G-genius, she’s even more freakish than Xuanyuan Zi Guang and Yao Hui Yue!”
