Chapter 2208: Fifth pinnacle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The identities of Ling Han and his group drew the curiosity of the masses, and also led to more monarch tiers stepping out, wanting to force out the trump cards of Ling Han and his group.

However, there was also an endless stream of monarch tiers that stepped out for Ling Han. It couldn’t be helped; he’d just happened to recruit 10 monarch tiers some days ago.

When these 10 people had all stepped out, Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. He had gained new helpers.

Yi, Yan Xianlu, Cheng Zixin, and the others were all monarch tiers that were allied with him.

Without any need for Ling Han to speak up, these people took the initiative to move, helping to feed Ling Han’s momentum.

At first, the spectators at the gates were only curious, but as they continued watching, they became stunned.

So many monarch tiers had moved out, all just for the sake of Ling Han and his group! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If this power could be mobilized by Ling Han and his group, just how terrifying would that be? He could instantly become the fifth pinnacle of the academy, establishing a force that was not inferior to the forces established by Ji Wuming, Shi Chanzi, and the others.

What was even more overwhelming was that this didn’t show the true strength of Ling Han and his group yet. Who knew exactly how many monarch tiers there were under his command.

However, when more and more monarch tiers were intrigued with this, the cards that belonged to Ling Han were finally all played. When the 37th monarch tier appeared, no new monarch tier came out to keep off fights for Ling Han and his group.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. It looked like there were just 36 monarch tiers under Ling Han and his group’s “command.”

But upon further thought, they were internally aghast.

36 monarch tiers, what kind of concept was this?

As long as these people didn’t die, they would all be capable of becoming Celestial Kings in the future, and their lowest achievement would be Fourth Heaven, at least, or even Fifth Heaven. What kind of terrifying power was this?

In the skies, the 36 battles were all progressing heatedly, and as many as 72 monarch tiers were battling fiercely. This kind of scene was definitely a rarity.

“Han Lin, right?” The 37th monarch tier looked at Ling Han. So long had passed, and with the means of a monarch tier, he had naturally “clearly” investigated the origins of Ling Han and his group. Of course, that was only limited to the information that Ling Han allowed them to find out.

“Care for a spar?” He did not dare go too far. Though not one of Ling Han or his group had moved, they were able to mobilize 36 monarch tiers. Who dared to underestimate them?

The Empress leaped out, but did not answer. She merely crooked her finger at that person, showing clearly her pride.

That monarch tier couldn’t help but feel angered. ‘You are indeed beautiful, but this is the world that belongs to cultivators. Beauty is only the prize of elites.’ He humphed, and immediately charged towards the Empress.

The Empress was incredibly aggressive. That was how her personality was, and her style of attack was the same.

Boom!

A great battle broke out. The two of them did not take their battle into the skies, but rather stayed on the ground. Because the Empress had not soared into the skies, the other naturally would not be going skywards all alone and put on a one-man show.

Everyone soon looked shocked.

Unlike the battles in the skies—though the 72 monarch tiers all had varying differences in their strength, deciding the victory in battle was definitely not a matter that would happen quickly—the moment the Empress moved, she was overbearing. In just over a dozen moves, she was completely on the active side. After 100 moves, she had already built up an upper hand, and victory was within her grasp.

This was really horrifying. They were both monarch tiers, but why was there such a huge gap between the two of them?

It should be known that monarch tier meant that one could be strongest in a battle of equals. Since they were already the strongest, their abilities should be quite close to one another’s. How could such an obvious disparity appear?

Another 100 moves later, the Empress pushed out a palm, and?peng, that monarch tier was sent flying, and sprawled out on the ground, unable to catch his breath for a long while.

In this instant, the area was completely dead silent.

Though they had predicted that the Empress would win, when they really witnessed this scene, everyone was still numb with shock.

A monarch tier had lost just like that.

Was there anyone left that could defeat Ling Han and his group?

Could it be that there were not many that could fight in the giant Saintly Origin Academy, and these four people were allowed to continue blocking the gates in their arrogance?

“Let’s get an Immortal Palace Tier,” someone suggested.

Immortal Palace Tier?

Ling Han and his group were all only Heaven Souls. If they got an Immortal Palace Tier to help, wouldn’t that be just the act of a bully?

But Heaven Soul monarch tiers had all lost so “frankly.” Without an Immortal Palace Tier, was there anyone left that could suppress these four people?

“It’s too bad that Ji Wuming, Shi Chanzi, Hong Huang, and Jia Lan have all broken through to the Immortal Palace Tier. Otherwise, they would be the strongest Heaven Souls!” someone mused with regret.

“That’s right.” This won everyone’s agreement.

Ji Wuming and the others were really too strong, completely suppressing every other monarch tier to the point that they paled in comparison.

If there was a hierarchy of monarch tiers, the four of them would definitely be the pinnacle, and there was no one that could be their equal.

“I heard a few troublesome characters have come?” A young man appeared, dressed in snow white robes, appearing incredibly confident.

“Senior Brother Ji!”

When they saw this person, everyone in the vicinity paid their respects.

Ji Yutang, a disciple of the academy… and a First Secret monarch tier!

Though the true starting line of the race among monarch tiers was the Celestial King Tier, cultivation level was also a realistic comparison. He was presently a First Secret elite, and that was stronger than the Heaven Soul, and it was not just by a bit, either—there was a completely overwhelming advantage. Hence, there was a need to maintain respect.

Ji Yutang walked towards Ling Han and his group. As he walked, he released his own aura.?Boom, the mystical power of the Immortal Palace Tier spread out, shaking the heavens.

In the skies, all 36 battles had stopped, and the 72 monarch tiers all descended back to the ground, looking at Ji Yutang reverently.

Even though they were just one step behind Ji Yutang, this one step had led to a massive gap appearing between the strength of both sides. It was a gap that could not be compensated with any amount of talent.

Without entering the Immortal Palace Tier, even the strongest Heaven Soul was still just a Dividing Soul Tier.

Hong, long, long,?the ground trembled continuously, as if it could not bear Ji Yutang’s domineering air.

The Rain Emperor’s eyes lit up. He stood up. “Fourth Brother, leave this opponent to me.”

“All right.” Ling Han nodded. He knew that the Rain Emperor had just attained Dividing Nine Souls, and was just wanting to test out his strength.

“A mere Dividing Soul Tier, and you actually dare to oppose me?” Ji Yutang demanded in disdain. What did a First Secret monarch tier signify? He could have invincible battle prowess even against an opponent of Third Secret!

Ordinarily, when 10 Heaven Soul monarch tiers joined forces, they could match a First Secret opponent, but that was only an ordinary First Secret. Against a First Secret monarch tier, they would only be defeated, and the Rain Emperor was only one person at that. There was no way that he could defeat even an ordinary First Secret opponent, and he still wanted to fight him?

He had to be joking!

The Rain Emperor stared at Ji Yutang for a while, and said, “Use your full prowess, or I will kill you!”

Ji Yutang was practically exploding in fury. A mere Dividing Soul Tier actually dared demand that he use his full prowess. He could not help but laugh in his extreme fury. “Fine, then I will oblige!”

In any case, this person was not a disciple of the academy, so it would be fine even if he killed him.

The Rain Emperor moved.?Xiu, he appeared in front of Ji Yutang with a flash. He shot out a punch, and?boom, it was like a star was falling, unmatched in its dominance.

Ji Yutang couldn’t help but be astonished, and hurriedly moved to parry.

Peng!

He retreated backwards in a hurry, feeling all the bones in his body were trembling, which was extremely uncomfortable. Though the Rain Emperor had also taken a few steps back, the distance he had retreated was clearly shorter than Ji Yutang.

It could not be any more obvious; Ji Yutang was inferior to the Rain Emperor!

Everyone was dumbfounded. A mere Heaven Soul actually managed to get the upper hand in a clash with a First Secret monarch tier.

Who would have believed this?

Hiss, this was a monster that was capable of being equal to Ji Wuming, Hong Huang, and other such supreme monarch tiers!

Yet Ling Han shook his head slightly. Though the Rain Emperor had heaven-defying good fortune, and had refined the corpse of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, this clearly was not comparable to Ji Wuming, who was the direct reincarnation of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

If the Rain Emperor was only this strong, then in a battle of equals, the Rain Emperor was definitely not Ji Wuming’s match..
