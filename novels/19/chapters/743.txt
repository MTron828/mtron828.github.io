Chapter 744: Hidden Formidable Enemy

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

Helian Xun Xue nursed her son, but as she did, she wondered that if she was in Ling Han’s company for the whole day, would that bastard annoy her to death?

“Hey, they’ve caught up to us,” Ling Han suddenly said. “You stay here first. I will bring the other people in.”

He flashed out of the Black Tower. Hu Niu and Rabbit had already caught up to them.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu immediately jumped into Ling Han’s embrace.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Where’s Xuan Er?”

Hu Niu shrugged, and said, “She doesn’t want Ling Han and ran off! Quick, let’s go! Don’t want that heartless woman already!” All day long, she was only of thinking how to get rid of that beguiling woman, Zhu Xuan Er.

Ling Han laughed heartily, his eyes revealing mirth. Activating the Eye of Truth, he had just seen Zhu Xuan Er approaching them quickly, and went up to greet her. As for Zhu Xuan Er, when she saw Ling Han, she calmed down and expressed her relief as if a huge burden had been lifted off her shoulders.

“Ai, so not fun!” Hu Niu spread out her hands and bit her fingers, secretly blaming herself for not making a move to kill Zhu Xuan Er just a moment ago.

“Where is Miss Helian?” asked Zhu Xuan Er.

“Inside the Black Tower. I will take all of you to see her and also... my son,” Ling Han said.

What!?

Both Zhu Xuan Er and Hu Niu dropped their jaws. When did he have a son? How come they didn’t know about it? Rabbit, having no idea about the issue with Helian Xun Xue, said, “Congratulations! Red packets, please 1 .”

Ling Han didn’t know how to explain; he had also just gotten to know about it. With a wave of his hand, everyone was brought into the Black Tower.

As his divine sense swept through the place, he found that Helian Xun Xue had already fed his son. He then brought the group of people to her side.

“Big silly girl!” Hu Niu glared at Helian Xun Xue. Really too hateful. This big silly girl had actually given birth to Ling Han’s child in secret.

Helian Xun Xue naturally had already experienced Hu Niu’s jealousy. She just smiled, and said, “Little girl!” This was considered a tit for tat.

“What a cute baby.” Naturally, Zhu Xuan Er’s emotional intelligence was not something that Hu Niu could match. “Can I hold him?”

“Yes!” Helian Xun Xue handed her son over to Zhu Xuan Er.

The little guy turned over, opened his mouth and leaned towards Zhu Xuan Er’s bosom and bit.

Bashful, Zhu Xuan Er quickly held the little guy further away. The little guy did not manage to get a bite and immediately began to wail.

Ling Han burst out laughing, and said, “Hai Niu, you see, even our son turned his back against your flat chest! Oh, I really pity my son. It’s probably because he usually didn’t eat to his fill?”

“Ling Han, do you want to die?” Helian Xun Xue couldn’t help but be furious as he had touched her sore spot.

Ling Han took his son into his arms, asking, “Does the little guy have a name yet?”

“No.” Helian Xun Xue shook her head.

“Smart of you. Otherwise, I’d smack your behind!” said Ling Han. He pondered for a while and said, “What should I name him? Since he is the son of me, Ling Han, in the future he will definitely be the world’s most awesome person.”

“Then, let’s call him Ling Niu Bi 2 !” Hu Niu suggested.

“Well, although it sounds awesome, but such a high-profile name wouldn’t be good.” Ling Han shook his head.

“Then let’s call him Ling Gao Shou 3 .” Hu Niu was simply unreliable.

Zhu Xuan Er interrupted, “How about Ling Jian Xue?”

He Lian Xun Xue snorted. Actually, “Ling Jian Xue” did have quite a special meaning. “Ling” represented Ling Han, whereas “Xue” represented her. The word “Jian” thus added the finishing touch to the name. It was just that, did she actually like to see Ling Han 4 ?

“Probably it would be better to call him Ling Da Bao 5 ,” said the Rabbit.

Helian Xun Xue rolled her eyes. These people, how could one be less reliable than the other? She said, “Better to call him ‘Ling Jian Xue’ then.” At least this was still a normal name.

Ling Han became quite upset. This was his first-born son. How could his son’s name be decided just like that without seeking his opinion first?

“Then what do you suggest?” Helian Xun Xue glared at him, and said, “The names that you have given like Hu Niu, Xiao Shi[TL.N: ‘Xiao Shi’ = direct chinese translation for ‘Small Rock.], Hai Niu... Honestly, it’s better that you stay out of it!”

Hu Niu immediately became dissatisfied, and said, “Niu’s name is very good!”

“Haha!” Helian Xun Xue and Zhu Xuan Er both put on a fake smile; they naturally wouldn’t agree.

Hu Niu bared her teeth, revealing two rows of small white teeth threateningly, and said, “What are you laughing at? Do you think Niu’s name is not good?”

“Good! Of course, it is good!” Ling Han lifted up Hu Niu. “Our Hu Niu not only has a good name, but will also be a beautiful woman in the future. Everyone will love her, and even flowers will bloom for her!”

Hu Niu smiled proudly at once, holding Ling Han’s neck. “Ling Han is the best!”

Ling Han’s heart felt moved, and he asked Helian Xun Xue, “How did you come over? Wasn’t there a regional barrier?”

Helian Xun Xue answered disdainfully, “That was just an obstacle created by the Shattering Void Tier. One could easily cross over as long as one held a Level Ten Spirit Tool.”

“Oh, do you have a Level Ten Spirit Tool?”

“The genetics of the Sea Race are absolutely beyond your imagination,” Helian Xun Xue replied arrogantly.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then, did the Sea Race have a record of a reckoning every ten thousand years?”

“Hey, how do you know?” Helian Xun Xue asked in shock.

“I am your man. How can I not be awesome?” Ling Han said.

Helian Xun Xue didn’t object to this point, and said, “I intend to search for the Vial of Curses and unify the Northern Sea, gathering all the powers of the sea region to fight against the Reckoning in the future.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It seems that you still don’t know the real purpose of the Reckoning.”

“And what would that be?” Helian Xun Xue asked.

As Ling Han told her about the Realm Pill, Helian Xun Xue could not help but feel shocked beyond words.

After quite a while, she said, “No wonder there are often lapses in history. I’ve only managed to piece together a rough idea through the tracing of clues, and poring over countless tattered ancient books. So this is the case!”

Suddenly, her expression changed, and she said, “The Imperial Clan! The Imperial Clan has survived for thousands of years and could exist forever! Did they actually take part in it as well?”

Furrowing his brows, Ling Han said, “If they could exist forever, then wouldn’t they be accomplices of the Immortal Realm? If not, then they would be an existence on a different level, so they could avoid the Reckoning.”

Helian Xun Xue shook her head, and said, “I am afraid that the possibility of them being accomplices may be higher. I have proposed several times to fight against the Reckoning, but it has all been suppressed by the Imperial Clan. Obviously, they don’t want any issues to keep arising.”

“In other words, our enemies are not only the five great sects, but also the Imperial Clan of the Sea Race!” Ling Han held his chin. “What is the strength of the Imperial Clan?”

“Extremely strong!” Helian Xun Xue nodded. “It is said that there are hundreds of Shattering Void Tier elites within the Imperial Clan. Furthermore, it holds a well-established position, worshipped by the Four Seas. It is capable of mobilizing the power of the entire sea region.”

The sea was a three-dimensional structure. Coupled with larger areas of sea area, there were actually more living creatures there. There were also many kinds of Spirit Herbs in the sea, so the overall strength was actually above the human race’s. If it wasn’t because the Sea Race had preferred the water environment, in the event they attacked the mainland, then the well-established position of the human race would no longer be guaranteed.

Ling Han couldn’t help but appear solemn. Originally, the Purple Moon Empire needed only face the five great sects, but now there might be an additional Sea Race.

At it had much stronger power!
