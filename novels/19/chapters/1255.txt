Chapter 1256: Partial Success

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Rising From The Ashes was the ultimate secret technique of the Immortal Phoenix Tribe. Only those who possessed the purest of Immortal Phoenix blood would be able to unleash this secret technique, defying heaven and achieving rebirth in the process.

Ling Han obviously didn’t possess pure Immortal Phoenix blood.

However, the Black Tower provided him with all kinds of unique abilities. Thus, he succeeded in rising from the ashes after comprehending the profound mystery of the corresponding section in the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Crucially, however, he still hadn’t grasped the entirety of the secret technique. As a result, his rebirth had only returned him to an infant state.

“F*ck! Why is it like this?” Ling Han grimaced as he looked at his miniature arms and legs.

His power and cultivation still remained the same as before, yet his body had shrunk to the size of an infant. No, no, no, he had genuinely become an infant! How could he accept this?

Could he still use his willy?!

Fortunately, both Helian Xun Xue and Shui Yanyu had been taken to the Celestial Realm. Otherwise, how could they not cry to death if they saw his current state?

Ling Han grimaced, and asked, “Small Tower, how can I return to normal?”

“That’s easy. Just wait 17 or 18 years. After aging for that long, you’ll have naturally returned to your normal appearance,” Small Tower answered in mock seriousness. However, even an idiot could detect the hint of teasing in its voice.

F*ck, even the proud tower couldn’t resist laughing at him. It was evident just how terrible Ling Han’s situation was.

Although there was a wide variety of clothes in the Black Tower, none of them were suitable for an infant Ling Han. In the end, he could only tear off a few pieces of cloth to wrap himself up.

“Are there any other methods?” Ling Han asked.

“Yes!” Small Tower finally became serious this time, saying, “You’ve become an infant because you still haven’t achieved a thorough comprehension of Rising From The Ashes. In other words, you’ll naturally return to normal once you fully comprehend the corresponding section of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.”

Ling Han was both delighted and worried, and he said, “Fine, then open the cauldron. I’ll jump back in for a while.”

“Impossible!” Small Tower shook its head, and said, “With the current state of the Black Tower, it can only squeeze a tiny amount of immortal flames for you to use every three months. The amount of time you used just now already surpassed my expectations. In fact, you’ve delayed my repairs by 300,000 years!”

Ling Han’s expression became dark, and he said, “So you’re saying that I have to stay like this for three months?”

“Three months is my most optimistic estimation,” Small Tower replied. “After all, you might not succeed in fully comprehending that section next time. I’m not belittling you, but with your comprehension abilities, it’ll take you at least several hundred times to fully comprehend it.

“So... I suggest you patiently wait for 17 or 18 years. By then, you’ll have naturally become a young man again.” The proud tower couldn’t help but laugh as it said this.

‘F*ck! My reputation!’

If he hadn’t found the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, Ling Han wouldn’t have minded cultivating in seclusion for 17 or 18 years. This was the Immortal Realm, after all, and everyone’s lifespan was incredibly long. Cultivating for 17 or 18 years wouldn’t really affect anything.

However, he had found the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden now, so she would definitely become anxious if he didn’t appear for so many years. In fact, she might even think that he had died in the Two Realm Battlefield. What would he do if she became neglectful of herself?

Ling Han channeled his Origin Power.

Pa, pa, pa!

His body immediately began to grow larger. At his cultivation level, changing the shape of his body was a simple task. It wasn’t long before he returned to his normal appearance. However, this appearance was only a facade. If he came across someone much stronger than him, they would see through him with a single glance.

Unfortunately, the cultivation level of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was far above his.

“I’ll eat pills and eat more pills! I have to reach the consummate level as quickly as possible!” Ling Han shouted.

He retrieved a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill and tossed it into his mouth. He then ran over to the Reincarnation Tree, where he would comprehend the Regulations as he absorbed the effects of the pill.

His body was completely new at this moment, so it naturally didn’t have any traces of alchemic poisoning. As a result, he could ingest Berserk Blood Spirit Pills again.

While he was at it, he also tossed a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill to Rabbit. He had reached the Sun Moon Tier, and this was also inside the Black Tower. Thus, Ling Han could easily suppress any side effects that the pill had on Rabbit. At the very least, he could prevent Rabbit from exploding to death.

The old ginseng was extremely envious. He hadn’t reached the Sun Moon Tier yet, so he would definitely die if he dared to ingest the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

However, it wouldn’t be too long before he reached the Sun Moon Tier. He had buried his roots in the Black Tower, and there was also the Reincarnation Tree to speed up his comprehension. The speed of his cultivation couldn’t be any quicker.

“Pu!” Notionless Saint, who was wrapped around a branch of the Reincarnation Tree, couldn’t help but burst into laughter when he saw Ling Han’s appearance.

Rabbit and the old ginseng couldn’t see through Ling Han’s disguise, but how could a Saint not see through it?

“Big Brother, what are you laughing about?” Rabbit asked shamelessly. After learning that this orb of light was a Saint, he had started to refer to him as big brother. If he were looked after by a Saint in the future, he would be able to do as he pleased in the Immortal Realm.

“Don’t say!” Ling Han said in irritation. After learning about the Celestial Realm, his respect and fear for Saints had fallen drastically.

If Notionless Saint had a body, he would definitely be bending over in laughter. In fact, he had almost fallen from the Reincarnation Tree just then. However, he was living in Ling Han’s Spatial God Tool, so he had no option but to listen to him. He naturally wouldn’t reveal Ling Han’s secret. This made both Rabbit and the old ginseng itchy with curiosity.

“Calm down and cultivate earnestly!” Ling Han shouted. He then sat down and started to digest the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

After absorbing the effects of the pill, he instantly noticed a difference from the last time.

He had almost exploded the first time that he ingested a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. This time, however, he was able to tolerate its effects much better, even though he hadn’t advanced a minor level.

Sure enough, his physique had grown stronger after he rose from the ashes.

If he had taken a path of hardness before, then he was taking a path of toughness now. When enduring damage, he wouldn’t brute-force through it as he had before. Instead, he would absorb it like the ocean.

Water possessed unlimited endurance. Fire did too.

“Ahhh...!” Next to him, Rabbit wailed in agony. He had also ingested a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. However, even though Small Tower had used the power of the Black Tower to suppress the pill’s side effects, this was only enough to prevent Rabbit from dying. Flesh that should explode would still explode; pain that should be tolerated would still need to be tolerated.

Meanwhile, Ling Han didn’t make a peep. First of all, he had already ingested a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill before. Second of all, his physique had been elevated to a new height. As such, the pain caused by the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill was already within tolerable limits.

His power soared explosively, and thanks to the effects of the Reincarnation Tree, his comprehension of Regulations was also able to keep up with the rise of his cultivation level.

Three days later, Ling Han suddenly opened his eyes.

Low extreme of the late stage! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Very well! Apart from the fact that he was an infant, everything else was going smoothly.

“Sigh!” Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. Now that no one was around, he naturally reverted back to his ‘original’ appearance. However, he couldn’t get used to his short arms and legs.

‘Moreover, it looks like that function has devolved as well.’ Ling Han grimaced as he looked down at his little buddy. ‘If that savage woman wants to ride me, doesn’t this mean that I won’t even have the ability to be ridden?’

Ling Han sighed again. He decided to go out for a stroll. After all, there were still three months before he could enter the cauldron of immortal flames for a second time.

“F*ck! What kind of luck is this?” he exclaimed. He discovered a palm-sized crystal before him the moment that he exited the Black Tower.

This was... a Realm Spirit Stone!
