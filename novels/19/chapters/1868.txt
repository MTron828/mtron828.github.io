Chapter 1869: Arrogance without bounds

Ling Han and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden went to the fourth level via the Transfer Formation.

As the victors of the tournament, the four still had some slight privileges. They were allowed to bring one or two people with them into the fourth level, but it was only limited to the tournament period. After it ended, they would have to leave within three days.

Those who wanted to watch the tournament did not have that good luck. They could only pay to travel through the Transfer Formation.

Not going to use it?

With how colossal the space was in every level, would you manage to arrive in time if you ran?

This Transfer Formation charged a Star Stone for each trip, and furthermore, it could not stop at the fourth level. You would have to return on the same day that you had come. Back and forth, that would be two Star Stones.

It was rumored that Alchemist Zi Cheng also had a share in the Transfer Formation.

He really had a good business acumen.

After arriving on the fourth level, Ling Han and his group had their accommodations arranged. At most, they could only stay here for three days. Additionally, the victors from the second and third levels would also be staying here. They were basically the “natives” of the city, and would directly return once they had finished the tournament.

Meanwhile, the victors of the fourth level were not here. They would only appear on the next day.

However, when it was midnight, a frightening aura rolled out, causing the 12 people who had qualified for the next round in this courtyard to wake and become alert.

‘So powerful!’

They all opened their doors and exited, and saw that there was a man standing proudly in the skies. He was like a divine god, exuding an aura that ruled supreme over the whole world.

“Zh-Zhao Qingfeng!” Someone recognized this person, and called out his name, but his voice was actually trembling.

Being able to qualify for the final rounds, which of them were not king tiers? But to actually tremble all over just by speaking a name, that showed how vicious Zhao Qingfeng was, and how frighteningly strong he was.

“Zhao Qingfeng!” Clearly, there were a considerable number that had heard his name before. The other king tiers all frowned, looking wary.

It was rumored that not only was Zhao Qingfeng overwhelmingly strong, he also had a cruel nature, and had a fondness for killing prodigies.

One should pray not to become the target of his attention, or he would have to pray for good fortune after he left Alchemy City.

Zhao Qingfeng clasped his hands behind his back, looking down on everyone from his lofty position, strong contempt in his eyes. “A bunch of trash, really rubbish, not even capable of making me interested in making a move!”

Everyone couldn’t help but feel furious. Which one of them was not a king tier? There were one or two in fact that were so strong that they had reached the level of emperor tier, and you actually said that they were trash and rubbish? Who could tolerate that?

“Dissatisfied?” Zhao Qingfeng scoffed, stretched out a hand, and pressed down. Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu. Innumerable green rays of light shot down from the skies. Those were multiple green swords, and they were all formed from seals of great dao, filling the skies in their descent.

Weng, it was as if the great dao itself was suppressing them, which was astonishingly frightening.

Everyone hurriedly moved to parry the incoming attack. Peng, peng, peng. The whole courtyard was practically obliterated in an instant, and when the clouds of dust dispersed, the majority of people were lying on the ground. Even if there were a few that had not lain down, they still bore some injuries.

A casual move, but it was capable of wounding over a dozen king tiers, and even emperor tiers, with a single strike. Just what kind of terrifying strength was this?

This was Zhao Qingfeng!

What was more frightening was that he was clearly already so strong, yet was still one of the Four Heavenly Kings under Yan Xianlu, and Yan Xianlu... he was not even the hair of a Nine Heavens Celestial King Tier!

“I already said that you were trash!” Zhao Qingfeng scoffed. “I came this time just to tell you all not to waste my time. Tomorrow, there will only be one tournament battle!”

His eyes were set on the only person who was still standing and unwounded in the area.

Ling Han!

...Ling Han had already drawn Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden into the Black Tower.

“Ling Han?” Zhao Qingfeng asked calmly, two balls of fire erupting in his eyes. That was a blazing fighting spirit.

Ling Han was slightly surprised. The other party actually knew his name? He also looked back at him. Though he was looking upwards, he had a certain pride about his posture, and was not at the slightest bit of advantage in terms of aura.

“That’s right. I am Ling Han,” he stated evenly.

This Zhao Qingfeng was really very strong. Perhaps he was even stronger than Ling Han had been before he had been tempered by the Celestial King Tier flames. But now, Ling Han had absolute confidence in himself.

Ling Han did not dare underestimate any prodigy in this world, but he similarly would still have absolute confidence in himself.

Zhao Qingfeng bared his teeth in a grin, and declared, “You are very interesting! Tomorrow will be the finals between you and me!”

Was this reasonable?

There were a total of 16 people who had qualified for the final rounds, and eight would win, then four out of that, and then the last two would remain. Only then would the final battle be held, and now he had directly skipped over three days of battles. Wasn’t he afraid that Alchemist Zi Cheng would seek him out for an accounting?

Though Ling Han had never met this alchemist before, he was already capable of saying for certain that he was definitely an old money grubber.

“Heh, let’s talk about this later,” Ling Han said carelessly. Whether it was fighting slowly all the way to the finals, or immediately beginning the battle, he was unafraid.

Zhao Qingfeng’s eyes swept over him, and he said, “If you people do not automatically forfeit tomorrow, then none of you need even dream of returning alive! Whatever I, Zhao Qingfeng, have said... I promise it will be done!”

He was arrogant enough, domineering enough, and haughty enough, but he had enough strength too. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone was silent. At first, some people had had some hope, but just now, they had been defeated with a single move from Zhao Qingfeng, which naturally was a blow strong enough to destroy all their confidence.

In any case, they couldn’t possibly win, so what did it matter if they retreated earlier or later?

That was Zhao Qingfeng, and they could not afford to trifle with him.

The unluckier one was Ling Han. He had become Zhao Qingfeng’s target, and he would definitely be killed tomorrow.

“Ling Han, I anticipate the battle tomorrow. You definitely must not disappoint me, or else...” Zhao Qingfeng only looked deeply at Ling Han before leaving with a flutter of his sleeve.

This arrogance of his had reached a completely different level.

Ling Han propped up his chin and reflected on himself. Had he been too modest? You see, Zhao Qingfeng was only the subordinate of a Holy Son, yet could actually be arrogant to this extent in Alchemy City.

Tomorrow... he was going to crush this guy!

Ling Han made his decision. Who cared how freakish a prodigy Yan Xianlu was? That was something to be considered later. Now he very much disliked the look of Zhao Qingfeng, and if he did not crush him, irritation would continue to be stifled in his heart.

The courtyard was razed to the ground. However, the other 15 people had no plans to continue the tournament, so they were not so concerned. Some immediately left, while others were still not willing to give up, and placed their bets on Ling Han.

They hoped to see Ling Han make a great comeback, and suppress Zhao Qingfeng.

Ultimately, this night had still passed.

Early in the morning of the second day, Ling Han and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden set out, heading to the arena here. It was very close.

“What, all the other contestants have forfeited, and now only two are left?” In the arena, one of the persons-in-charge couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat as he listened to the report from his subordinate.

The tickets had already been sold, yet such a problem had actually cropped up now?

“Zhao Qingfeng!” he exclaimed through gritted teeth. ‘Would you die if you fought a few more rounds? To actually threaten the other contestants so that they would take their own initiative to forfeit.’

Thankfully, thankfully, there was at least one that had stayed behind. Otherwise, after working hard for 10 days to half a month, the finals would have actually fizzled out. That would really be too much of a joke.

“It can’t be helped, we can only directly follow up with the finals,” this person-in-charge said with a sigh.

Though Zhao Qingfeng was despicable, who would dare to directly reprimand him?

As he was a person that had walked out from an Eighth heaven Celestial King Tier-level force, even a finger of his was incredibly precious! Moreover, he was also Yan Xianlu’s follower, and as the saying went, when one beat a dog, one had to answer to its master. That was a supreme genius that would definitely become a Celestial King!

Who dared to offend him?

“I hope that this Ling Han is not disappointing, and will teach Zhao Qingfeng a good lesson!” this person-in-charge exclaimed, but then he shook his head.

This was an impossible feat. Even the Holy Sons of Celestial King Tier-level sects had all been easily defeated by Zhao Qingfeng, so how could Ling Han possibly defy the heavens?
