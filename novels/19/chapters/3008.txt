3009 Safety Line

Ling Han leaped up and unleashed his full Power of Dimension at this instant, forming a formidable shield.

Peng!

Even though he took the best course of action, he was still struck by Hysteria’s tentacle and immediately sent flying.

Fortunately, he flew toward the exit of the Realm Battlefield.

Ling Han bared his teeth. After facing this strike, fractures appeared on all of his hundreds of thousands of low-tier high-level dimensions. They were severely damaged, and it was necessary for him to repair them as soon as possible. Otherwise, it was possible that they would all collapse and disappear.

Even though he could already regrow these dimensions now, just how long would it take to nurture these many low-tier high-level dimensions?

Moreover, the Genesis World of the last era had completely disappeared already, so where would he find so much energy to extract?

Whoosh!

Hysteria launched another attack at Ling Han, and Ling Han also unleashed his own power.

Peng!

Ling Han radiated with a brilliant glow as he was sent tumbling out of the Realm Battlefield.

Hysteria’s tentacles flew out after him, yet they were forcefully suppressed by the Profound Negative Realm, which caused their might to fall drastically.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Lin Youlian and three other elites were waiting at this exit, and they all unleashed a barrage of attacks at Hysteria.

In normal circumstances, they wouldn’t have been able to withstand even a single strike from Hysteria. With the help of the Profound Negative Realm, however, a large majority of Hysteria’s power was suppressed, allowing them to just barely block its strikes. However, the four powerful elites were still sent flying, with their faces becoming pale and their bodies shaking with exertion.

Rumble…

Thunder furiously rolled across the sky, and it was as if a mysterious power were being wielded.

This was the will of the Profound Negative Realm. If Hysteria had been only an ordinary elite, then this will of heaven and earth would have only suppressed it, and not directly targeted it. However, since Hysteria was also a dimension, this was a completely different story altogether.

This was a battle between dimensions, so the Profound Negative Realm would naturally unleash its full power.

Hysteria didn’t attack again, and it lightly waved its tentacles before shrinking back. With a whoosh, it vanished without a trace.

Ling Han picked himself up with great difficulty. At the same time, the will of the Profound Negative Realm also started to dissipate. This will barely had any consciousness, and it would only appear for a short while when Hysteria ran over to provoke it.

Ling Han possessed a wisp of power that was unique to this world, and he had already cultivated this power into a low-tier high-level dimension. This was a dimension that was directly related to the Profound Negative Realm. Thus, he was also able to sense the fluctuations of the dimension’s will.

He couldn’t help but find this strange. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Why did the Power of Dimension only activate when a dimension was facing a life-threatening danger? Otherwise, with how much dimensions detested Heavenly Venerates, who could become a Heavenly Venerate if the dimensions were hellbent on interfering with them?

It felt as if there were an intangible matter transcendent above the Regulations that suppressed these dimensions, and forced them to act according to a certain set of rules.

‘There are more Regulations above the Regulations?’

Ling Han involuntarily fell into deep thought. Then what force was binding the dimensions to these Regulations?

If such a force truly existed, then wouldn’t it be even more powerful?

Chong Yan and the four other elites were already at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, and they would be unable to take another step forward. Theoretically speaking, they should have already been without desire. However, they still cared so deeply about Feng Wuding. Why was this?

In order to exterminate Hysteria? Ling Han naturally wouldn’t believe such an answer.

Moreover, Chong Yan and the others were definitely scheming something by purposely withholding information from others. What big secret were they hiding?

Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and the others stood up and flew back to their original positions. Their wounds weren’t severe, and they were far better off than Ling Han.

There was admiration and apprehension in the four supreme prodigies’ eyes as they looked at Ling Han.

After all, who told Ling Han to kill Feng Wuding?

If he was able to kill Feng Wuding, then he would naturally be able to kill them as well. This caused the four prodigies to involuntarily raise their guard against him.

Ling Han looked at Xin Qihu, and said calmly, “Little Hu, do you dare to attack me?”

He was riddled with wounds right now, and his energy levels also appeared to be extremely low. However, he was filled with fighting spirit.

Xin Qihu humphed, flicking his sleeve, and saying, “I’ll consider whether I should play around with you after your wounds heal. As for right now? I can’t be bothered picking on a wounded soldier.”

‘F*ck! Since when did he become so upstanding and righteous?’

Ling Han was astonished. Xin Qihu was actually uttering such words?

In the past, who had shamelessly pushed him to carry out the decapitation operation? Who had purposely smeared him and tried to push him toward death?

Xin Qihu’s actions were indeed in conflict with his actions from before. When Ling Han was attacking Feng Wuding just then, the four supreme prodigies had tried to block him together. However, Ling Han didn’t put up any defenses, and this caused the four supreme prodigies to hold back their power lest they accidentally wounded or even killed him.

In Ling Han’s memory, Xin Qihu shouldn’t have been such a “kind” person.

Weng!

A terrifying power suddenly fluctuated at this moment, and a person walked in from the entrance of the Realm Battlefield.

Shatter Mountains.

He immediately locked his gaze on Ling Han, and a cold smile faintly tugged at the corners of his lips.

What a lucky coincidence! Ling Han was severely wounded right now, so he would definitely lose the ability to heal if Shatter Mountains attacked him with his full strength. As the battle dragged on, Ling Han would definitely become exhausted and eventually fail to maintain his defenses. At that time, he could deliver the killing blow.

“Brat, you’re dead meat!” Shatter Mountains roared as he charged at Ling Han.

“Lord, please show mercy!” Lin Youlian, Wu Haoyang, and Bai Mifan exclaimed as they stepped forward to block Shatter Mountains. To their surprise, Xin Qihu also stepped forward to help.

Boom!

The four prodigies were no match for Shatter Mountains, and they were all sent flying after just a single exchange.

The gulf between the late stage of the Seventh Tier and the peak stage of the Seventh Tier was still quite significant. In terms of physique, the four prodigies were more so far inferior to Shatter Mountains. After facing a single strike, their qi and blood became tumultuous and disarrayed, causing them to feel as uncomfortable as could be.

Shatter Mountains paid no heed to this. His physique was indestructible, so he continued to charge toward Ling Han after facing a slight delay to deal with the Seventh-Tier attacks.

Ling Han replied with an attack of his own.

He also activated his near-invincible defense, one that couldn’t be broken by anyone apart from Hysteria. Even those at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier wouldn’t be able to penetrate it.

However, Ling Han was severely wounded after clashing with Hysteria several times, and the dimensions inside him had also been severely damaged. He desperately needed to heal. Otherwise, if he continued to battle, the fractures on each dimension would continue to grow and eventually cause them to shatter.

He couldn’t continue like this.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Even more elites arrived at this moment.

Chong Yan, Big Dipper, Mysterious Feather, and Half Moon all gazed at Ling Han with cold expressions on their faces. It was as if they were looking at a dead person.

Had Feng Wuding’s death caused them to go crazy? They were even going to ignore Hysteria now?

Ling Han continued to mull over this as he exchanged blows with Shatter Mountains. What was so special about Feng Wuding? Why was he so highly valued by Chong Yan and the others?

If their aim was to kill Hysteria…

Ling Han would be more powerful than Feng Wuding if they were both at the same cultivation level, so shouldn’t they have valued him more?

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Lin Luo and the others also arrived.

If Chong Yan and the others valued Feng Wuding, then Lin Luo and the others equally valued Ling Han. He was possibly the only person who could kill Hysteria.

“Leave,” Lin Luo said to Ling Han.

Ling Han was a flashpoint right now, so Chong Yan and the others definitely wouldn’t relent if he remained.

Ling Han nodded in reply. He also needed time to recover from his wounds.
