Chapter 2364: A unique power

F***, so serious?

Ling Han grimaced, and said, “Senior, this junior has just advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier, and has very fragile shoulders still. I fear I cannot shoulder such heavy responsibility!”

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le shook his head. “Young man, you still do not know the seriousness of this matter!” He sighed, and continued, “Over a dozen epochs ago, the Foreign Realm invaded, and Jiuwu, Sealed Emotion, Green Flames, and I worked together to battle the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerates, but close to the end, those three selfish guys were actually persuaded by the beings of the Foreign Realm, and joined in alliance with the Foreign Realm for the sake of transcendence!”

“What is transcendence?” Ling Han was curious.

Wu Le was speechless. What time was it now, and what this brat was concerned about was actually such trivial matters? However, looking at the curious expression on Ling Han’s face, he knew that it was best for him to satisfy this guy’s curiosity first. Otherwise, the latter would be completely absent-minded.

“Firstly, do you know how Heavenly Venerate Tier surpasses Regulations?” he asked instead.

This question was huge, and probably only those rare few people in this entire world could actually answer this question. However, Ling Han was precisely one of them. Because he had once been the overlord of a realm, and had also obtained Wally’s models and formulae, he knew how to extract the power of heaven and earth.

“By extracting the essence power of heaven and earth to nurture oneself, and turning it into the source of motivation instead of drawing on Regulations,” Ling Han answered.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le appeared slightly surprised. Though he had asked this question, he had not thought a mere Ascending Origin Tier would be capable of answering. He faltered slightly, and only then continued, “Though your understanding cannot be considered completely correct, it is not too far off, either.

“However, every realm would have a unique power. This is the precondition for the emergence of a realm, and for a Heavenly Venerate to ascend Dao, what they could grasp would definitely be this kind of unique power.

“Once they leave this realm, their power will slowly dry up, and they will leap down from the Heavenly Venerate Tier.”

Ling Han was surprised. Wally had not mentioned this to him before. He nodded. “This is just like how an ordinary person whose body would slowly weaken when he has lost the replenishment of energy through food.”

“This is a very realistic analogy.” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le nodded. “However, Heavenly Venerate Tier is too strong. This process would be endlessly long, but no matter how long it is, as long as he still relies on this kind of power, it is inevitable. Heavenly Venerate Tier is like a tree which still needs to be rooted in its own realm, and they are closely linked.”

Ling Han was confused, and asked, “Since that is the case, shouldn’t Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and the others have a larger reason to protect the Celestial Realm?”

If the Celestial Realm was destroyed, the unique power of the Celestial Realm would disappear. How would the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerate, and Green Flames Heavenly Venerate continue to rule the world?

“Though Heavenly Venerate Tier is synonym for the strongest, there are actually still differences in strength and level among Heavenly Venerates,” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le said slowly.

Ling Han knew this because the Vitality Index of a Heavenly Venerate should be 15,000 points, but Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was close to 16,000 points, which even Wally thought was terrifying.

“Dare I ask, Senior, how many levels are there in Heavenly Venerate Tier?” he asked.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le shook his head. “I don’t know, either.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel speechless, thinking that this Heavenly Venerate was really quite humorous.

“I have only ventured to the two realms of Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm, but as far as I know, there are a great many other realms, which contain countless powerful beings,” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le said. “Next, these are all my deductions.

“Grasping the unique power of a realm should be the first step for a Heavenly Venerate.

“But aside from this kind of power, there are still other powers in the realm, and this is what makes up the foundations of the entire realm. That unique power can only be considered the unique trait of a realm.

“Further grasping another basic power should be the second tier of a Heavenly Venerate.

“And once they took this second step, a Heavenly Venerate would be able to truly transcend, no longer trapped in their own realm, and could be powerful and lofty in any other realm as well.”

Ling Han nodded. Aside from that unique power, other powers would be universal. Then, it was natural that they would extract the power of heaven and earth of any realm they ventured to. There was no need to worry that they would dry up one day.

“The agreement that Jiuwu and the others reached with the Foreign Realm is that when the Celestial Realm is devoured, the Heavenly Venerates will be able to extract the core power of the Celestial Realm together,” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le explained.

“There are only two methods to absorb this kind of power. Firstly, when the realm first comes into being, and everything is still in its “beginning” state, these powers would be exposed. However, when a realm first comes into being, there is no living being that can reach the height of Heavenly Venerate Tier, so it naturally could not be done.

“Secondly, when a realm is destroyed.”

Ling Han’s body shook, and he asked, “Those three Heavenly Venerates would destroy the entire Celestial Realm for the sake of their own transcendence?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le sighed. “Previously, it was because of this that we split ways. People who walk different paths cannot make plans together!”

It was not just him; there was also the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerate who came later. He had also met the incoming invasion of the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerates on his own, and in the end had no choice but to fuse himself with Heavenly Dao, damaging the connecting point of the two realms. Otherwise, the Celestial Realm probably would have long since ceased existing.

A thought sparked in Ling Han’s mind. “Then now, if the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity takes another step further, he would become a… Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?”

The old geezer’s Vitality Index was close to 16,000 points, and once he reached that, wouldn’t he then become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le shook his head. “That is impossible, but if he refined me completely, he would be able to obtain that unique power of the Celestial Realm, and would then be able to penetrate deeply into the Celestial Realm, committing mass slaughter.”

The strength of a realm was not based on one or two elites, but rather countless living beings. If the Foreign Realm wanted to devour the Celestial Realm, it was very simple to accomplish, and that was by eliminating a great majority of the living creatures there. In that case, the heaven and earth would be severely damaged, and would become incredibly weak, and thus easily devoured and fused.

If the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was no longer restrained by the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm—or at least not so seriously—he would be able to commit mass slaughter. In any case, those three Heavenly Venerates of the Celestial Realm would not move to stop him. He alone could kill most beings of the Celestial Realm.

By then, it would be doomsday for the Celestial Realm.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had said that it was a very serious matter; clearly, he had not been deliberately exaggerating.

Yet Ling Han was stunned as he asked, “Senior… you wish to be refined by the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity?”

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le nodded. “In the past, I faced off against multiple enemies all on my own, shattering the connecting point of the two realms even if it meant my death. I have indeed succeeded, but I am also severely wounded, and was thus captured by the Foreign Realm.

“Desolate Eternity… is one of the most powerful even among the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm. He has great ambitions and superior intelligence.

“He wants to refine me to gain the power of heaven and earth within me. If he succeeds, he will be able to cultivate the First Tier to the consummate level, and will no longer fear the restrictions of the Celestial Realm.”

Ling Han nodded. Having grasped that unique power of the Celestial Realm, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity would be equivalent to a being of the Celestial Realm himself. Though a Heavenly Venerate would still be targeted by the heaven and earth, the situation would be completely different from having a Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerate invade.

“Being capable of becoming a Heavenly Venerate, which of us is not a supreme prodigy, a supreme elite? Desolate Eternity wishes to refine me, and this is a double-edged sword. It is also possible that I could turn the tables on him and refine him instead,” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le said. “But with the restraints of this realm, I can just barely preserve myself, and prevent Desolate Eternity from succeeding.

“However, after resisting for so long, my power is already becoming weaker and weaker, and I am close to losing out.”

It was because Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had only walked the first step. After leaving the Celestial Realm, he was no longer able to extract that unique power, and it was certain that he would become increasingly weaker, especially when he still had to contend with an elite like Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity.
