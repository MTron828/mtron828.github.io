Chapter 1882: I’ve hit you, but so what?

“I am.” Ling Han smiled slightly.

A little lazily, the alchemy apprentice said, “My lord would like to see you.”

“And who is your lord?” Ling Han asked. He did not recognize this alchemy apprentice.

That alchemy apprentice showed an expression of pride, and declared, “You don’t even know my lord, and you could actually still become an alchemist?”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel angered. ‘Whether I can become an alchemist or not is something that can be decided with a single word of nonsense from you? Just who do you think you are?’ He crossed his hands behind him, and said, “Heh, indeed, I do not know who your lord is. Furthermore, just who do you think you are that you can talk to me in this manner?”

In terms of martial strength, he could practically crush all other Severing Mundane Tiers, and in terms of alchemy, he was already a One-Star Alchemist.

As for this alchemy apprentice? His martial strength was the third severance, and he was only a mere alchemy apprentice. At most, he could only be a high-grade trainee, and he thought he had the right to be arrogant in front of Ling Han?

‘F*ck off!’

The alchemy apprentice couldn’t help but tremble in fury. Pointing at Ling Han, he exclaimed, “How dare you, you actually dare to insult me!!”

“Can’t I? You are nothing in the first place, and you dare strut around in front of me!” Ling Han said carelessly. “Let me ask you this: what right do you have to be my equal?”

“I, I...” The alchemy apprentice was rendered speechless. The fact he could be so arrogant was naturally because of Alchemist Zi Cheng, and he himself, well, he could not be said to be worth nothing, but at least there was really nothing too awesome about him, either.

It was primarily because he was used to being arrogant. After he had become Alchemist Zi Cheng’s personal alchemy apprentice, who would not be polite towards him wherever he went? Even when Immortal Palace Tier elites saw him, they would cordially call him Little Mo.

Alchemists naturally were no exception. Alchemist Zi Cheng was one of the only three Four-Star Alchemists of Alchemy City. Thus, even when Three-Star Alchemists saw him, they would also be very polite, and would always have something to ask of him. For example, if they wanted to see Alchemist Zi Cheng, they would need him to make a report.

But now? A mere newly promoted One-Star Alchemist at the fourth severance actually dared insult him straight to his face.

‘Th-th-this, are you planning to rebel?’

“Ling Han, you have gone too far!!” the alchemy apprentice exclaimed in a high-pitched voice. “If you offend me, you will not be able to move a single step in Alchemy City.”

Seeing this scene, everyone shook their heads.

This alchemy apprentice had the surname of Mo, and was usually addressed as Alchemist Mo—even if he was actually not an alchemist, everyone would still give him some face. As the trusted aide of Alchemist Zi Cheng, this Alchemy Apprentice Mo possessed very strong authority, and practically no one dared to offend him.

Even for those like Lu Xianming, they would be very polite in front of this person.

This brat was really a hot-tempered youngster. Why were you squabbling with Alchemy Apprentice Mo? If he said a few derogatory words about you in front of Alchemist Zi Cheng, you would be in a lot of trouble.

Ou Kan’s anger finally dissipated somewhat. That was because he was not the only person Ling Han had driven to exploding in fury. Just see, even he did not wish to offend Alchemy Apprentice Mo, but Ling Han actually confronted him directly without a single bit of hesitation.

Though he still hated Ling Han, he could not help but admit that he was impressed.

Ling Han scoffed, and declared, “You are but a lackey. What are you calling out for? Don’t forget, everything that is yours is bestowed by another. Since he could bestow... he naturally could also withdraw!”

“You think you are qualified!?” Alchemy Apprentice Mo exclaimed sharply. He had never been treated with such contempt before. He was determined to make Ling Han bow his head in front of him.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I will not lower myself to the level of trash. Step aside, don’t block the way.”

Seeing Ling Han was about to leave, Alchemy Apprentice Mo hurriedly jumped out, raised his arm to stop his advance, and exclaimed, “You can’t leave!”

“What is it? Want to come to blows with me?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you!?” In the first place, Alchemy Apprentice Mo treated everything as below his notice. Furthemore, he was walking the path of alchemy, so he naturally did not know much about Ling Han’s situation. In his eyes, while he himself was only a third severance, because he was not that skilled in alchemy, he had placed more of his concentration on martial arts. Thus, he, a third severance, would not lose to a fourth severance alchemist.

Pu, a considerable number of people spluttered out in laughter. Really, one who was ignorant had nothing to fear.

This was quite interesting. They heard that Ling Han was going to take the alchemist test, and were incredibly stunned. On the other hand, Alchemy Apprentice Mo thought that Ling Han was only a prodigy of alchemy, and when he heard Ling Han speak of coming to blows, he naturally scoffed derisively.

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that there would actually be such a prodigy in this world?

“Alchemist Mo, you can’t!” Someone wanted to curry favor, and hurriedly explained Ling Han’s background.

My gods!

Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s mouth suddenly twitched. ‘Are you even still human! It’s already enough that you are so powerful in martial arts and strength, but you are actually a prodigy of alchemy as well. Won’t you let others live?’

His aura immediately wealened, but because he was used to being arrogant and overbearing, he immediately puffed up his chest again, and said, “I will not come to blows with a barbarian like you. You insulting me is equivalent to insulting Alchemist Zi Cheng, and that is insulting the whole Alchemy City! Who would agree for you to be so willful here!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile in spite of himself, and said, “You are really quite thick-skinned. A mere alchemy apprentice, who is only a high-grade trainee at most, a mere third severance, and you actually say that insulting you is insulting the whole Alchemy City? There’s no way I can actually believe that.”

“Humph, now you know!” Alchemy Apprentice Mo was a little proud. This was not the first time that he had used his powerful connection as an intimidation tactic. Even a great many king tiers had bowed their heads in front of him.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “If you think you can, you can try insulting me?”

“So what if I insult you? For a bastard like you, I can insult you 100—”

Pa!

Alchemy Apprentice Mo had not even finished his words when Ling Han had picked him up by the neck. Naturally, the former could not speak further like this. His legs were kicking around in panic, and even his face had turned green.

“Everyone has heard. It was he who insulted me.” Ling Han shrugged, seeming to be very innocent. “I am a One-Star Alchemist, and this little alchemy apprentice actually dared to insult me. You say, does he deserve to be beaten?

“Of course he does!” He did not even wait for others to answer, and pa, he delivered a slap.

This slap carried a lot of force. Alchemy Apprentice Mo directly opened his mouth, and spat out a mouthful of blood as well as a few broken teeth. One side of his face was swelling up at a visible rate.

Hiss, everyone sucked in a sharp breath.

As the saying went, before you hit the dog, look at the master. His master was Alchemist Zi Cheng, one of the top-tier characters of Alchemist Zi Cheng, so was he anyone you could teach a lesson to? But the problem here was that Ling Han was very much in the right.

You, a mere high-grade trainee, actually dared to insult a One-Star Alchemist. Just what was the hierarchy worth like this?

Without norms or standards, how could anything be accomplished?

Pa, pa, pa, pa. Ling Han delivered a series of slaps until he vented all his pent-up anger, and he finally tossed Alchemy Apprentice Mo casually to the side.

To dare make a move like this, he naturally had his own consideration, and it was not completely because he was rash.

Firstly, Alchemist Zi Cheng had to have a very high opinion of him, and that was why he sent someone to invite him over. Then, as long as this great alchemist was a more reasonable person, he would not just listen to Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s side of the story.

Secondly, even if Alchemist Zi Cheng was deceived, weren’t there still two other Four-Star Alchemists?

On one side, it was a frighteningly young alchemist prodigy, and on the other side, it was only a lackey. Whom would the two great alchemists side with, then?

If the scales were still tipped in Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s favor with this, then there would be no more significance for Ling Han to stay here. He would not want such a decayed place, even if it was given to him.

With a flutter of his sleeve, Ling Han strode off. Judging by Lu Xianming’s expression, there was no possible way for him to continue staying at the latter’s home, so he had best not wait for the latter to speak up, and take his leave of his own volition.

Everyone looked at Ling Han’s receding back, and then turned to look at Alchemy Apprentice Mo who was still moaning on the ground. They all felt an admiration rise up from the bottoms of their hearts.

This brat was really awesome.
