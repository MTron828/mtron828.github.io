Chapter 2144: Insect sting

“I had never thought that this place was actually a Lost Land from the Ancient Age!” The Great Clouds Celestial King spoke the same words as the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King. “This Eight Truths Spiritual Beast should have long since gone extinct, right? I never imagined that I would be able to see it again here.”

He extended a hand carelessly, and as Origin Power surged, a massive beast was instantly grabbed by a colossal eight-colored hand. No matter how hard it struggled, it was all wasted effort, and when it had been dragged in front of these two Celestial Kings, it was so scared that its tail was tightly clamped between its legs[1].

In front of this kind of high-level Celestial King, no matter how untamable and wild it was, it would still instinctively feel fear.

A Celestial King represented the heaven and earth!

“Indeed, these eight celestial patterns have been infused with eight kinds of Regulations of heaven and earth.” The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King waved a hand, and an extremely complex seal immediately appeared on that massive beast.

“Though the original Eight Truths Spiritual Beast has not advanced into Ninth Heaven, with these eight celestial patterns, it still practically conquered all its peers of Eighth Heaven.”

Ling Han heard this, and then sensed for himself. Involuntarily, he nodded inwardly.

At present, he possessed eight Source Powers of heaven and earth, but these eight Regulations were the closest to their Source, so he was also most sensitive towards these eight Regulations. He could sense that there were five Regulations on that seal that could resonate with him.

Once the Eight Truths Spiritual Beast advanced into Severing Mundane Tier, it would grasp eight Regulations, so its battle prowess was definitely incredibly strong, and it would be a cinch for it to suppress all its peers.

“Initially, I had only made this trip on a spontaneous impulse due to extreme boredom, but I never thought that I would discover a Lost Land from the Ancient Age.” The Great Clouds Celestial King casually tossed the Eight Truths Spiritual Beast away, and this giant beast hurriedly broke into a run and fled. It was practically scared out of its wits.

“Who knows what great fortune there would be,” the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King stated calmly, but there was a dominance in his tone that spoke of willingness to battle the heaven and earth itself.

This was a way of expression, and also a kind of confidence. Even if the other was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, he would not give in to him or fear him.

“Let the juniors go for their adventure while we take a walk, all right?” the Great Clouds Celestial King asked, smiling.

“Sure.” The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King immediately accepted. With him and the Great Clouds Celestial King, how would Ling Han and the rest be able to die?

With a wave of his hand, the Great Clouds Celestial King sent the five juniors by his side into the Mystery Realm, and the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King also waved his hand, and delivered Ling Han and the others inside. They were practically right next to Yulan Fenghua and his group.

The two Celestial Kings laughed, and strode off. Their target was a tall peak that pierced through the clouds in the distance. There were divine clouds immersing the skies, and possessed a primitive air.

Ling Han understood inwardly. The reason that the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King had escorted them here was not just to ensure the safety of their group, but also for the purpose of monitoring him, naturally for Hu Niu’s sake.

…How could Shang Zhiwei possibly let him go so easily?

And now that the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King had left, both An Ran and Lin Xuan should be taking over this duty then?

In fact, the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King still had a sliver of thought following him. Hu Niu only had to appear, and this thread of thought would immediately take form, and capture Hu Niu.

Even a thread of thought from a Celestial King could suppress Ascending Origin Tier, and this was an unquestionable fact.

Ling Han still could not let Hu Niu out now, and had to find a chance to flee. He had no intention of returning to Four Seas City.

“Holy Daughter An Ran, Brother Lin Xuan.” Yulan Fenghua and the others all greeted An Ran and Lin Xuan. Previously, all of them appeared slightly reserved in the presence of Celestial Kings.

Among these five of them, aside from Yulan Fenghua who was still a Heaven Soul, the other four had all advanced into the Immortal Palace Tier, and were the other Holy Sons and Holy Daughter of the Imperial Void Sect. However, four of these were men, with only one that was a woman.

Lin Xuan and An Ran clearly knew them, and greeted them back.

“This is…” The man named Ai Kaifeng looked towards Ling Han, and showed an expression of ponderment.

“Ling Han.” Ling Han smiled slightly.

Ai Kaifeng responded with a reserved smile, though a hint of disdain was revealed in the corners of his lips. He was a First Secret monarch tier, while the other was only a Heavenly Emperor. The gap in strength between the two of them was like the gap between heaven and earth, so he naturally disdained even talking to Ling Han. This would degrade his own status.

He was not the only one, for the other three were the same. Their names were Lao Liang, Bie Ziwen, and Di Tongxin, respectively. They merely conversed cordially with Lin Xuan and An Ran, but did not cast a second look at Ling Han.

The truth was the fact that they even bothered to ask Ling Han’s name was already giving him enough credit.

Neither An Ran nor Lin Xuan had the intention to explain who Ling Han was. The eight of them set out, and began walking in the forest. They were not Celestial Kings, so how could they possibly dare to act rash in this land from the Ancient Age, and fly in the air without restraint?

This dense forest was very dark, and the great trees were several thousand meters tall, with large, dense, thick leaves that blocked all light. Thankfully, they were all at the Dividing Soul Tier at the very least, so this was naturally not much of a problem.

“Aiya!” Bie Ziwen suddenly exclaimed, and stopped walking.

“What is it?” Lao Liang asked.

Bie Ziwen raised his leg, and saw that blood was actually dripping from his foot.

Everyone was stunned. Though they had not encountered enemies yet, having come to such a place, who would dare be careless? They would all definitely have covered their bodies with Origin Power, but Bie Ziwen had actually bled for no reason, which both confused and shocked them.

‘What’s going on?’

Bie Ziwen removed his sock and shoe, and saw that there was actually an insect’s sting stabbing into the sole of his left foot, exuding an eerily blue luster.

It was just an insect’s sting, and had not been actively used. Bie Ziwen had only stepped on it, and it had actually pierced through his shoe and sock, and penetrated his defense of Origin Power and Regulations, stabbing into the sole of foot?

Tu, tu, tu.?Bie Ziwen’s body suddenly trembled, as if he was in a sudden seizure. His eyes rolled upwards, and there was white foam gushing from the corners of his lips.

“Oh no, this insect sting is poisonous!” With who they all were, they immediately guessed the reason.

This was too terrifying, wasn’t it? A great, noble Immortal Palace Tier elite actually could not block an insect’s sting that had been broken off, and the strong poison had entered his body, further causing a monarch tier like Bie Ziwen to be unable to resist it at all.

Lao Liang and the others quickly took out antidote alchemical pills, and forced them into Bie Ziwen. Not long after, Bie Ziwen finally calmed down, but he had also passed out, releasing very deep breathing sounds.

At the very least, they had finally suppressed the poison.

“As expected of a Lost Land from the Ancient Age, where there is danger at every step.” Ai Kaifeng felt lingering fear. He, Lao Liang, and Di Tongxin were all First Secret monarch tiers like Bie Ziwen. SInce Bie Ziwen had been struck, then they definitely could not be spared, either. However, they were luckier, and had not stepped on that broken insect’s sting.

But who knew if there would be other insect stings or something similar in this place.

Meanwhile, Ling Han glanced at Bie Ziwen, and stated, “There is something off with his condition. It does not seem like the poison has been dispelled.”

“What do you know?” Ai Kaifeng immediately retorted. He had just spoken, and Ling Han replied like this. Wasn’t that just purposely undermining him? “The Highest Change Antidote Pill Senior Brother Bie ingested had been personally concocted by the Four-Star Grandmaster Zhong Qi, capable of easily curing all poisons beneath Celestial King Tier.”

“En!” Both Lao Liang and Di Tongxin nodded in unison. They naturally were absolutely trusting and reassured about Grandmaster Zhong Qi.

Ling Han’s mouth twitched, and he did not speak any further.

He was also a Four-Star Grandmaster, all right? But since these three people did not appreciate his kindness, there was no need for him to be snubbed despite his good intentions. In any case, he was not very close with Bie Ziwen, either, nor did they have any kind of relations, so what business was it of his whether the other man lived or died?

“E…” Bie Ziwen suddenly opened his mouth, and released a strange sound. It sounded like it had been forced out from a dead tree.

When everyone’s attention was drawn to him, Bie Ziwen’s eyes suddenly snapped open. The whites of his eyes had become blue, while his pupils had become deathly pale, looking horrifyingly eerie.
