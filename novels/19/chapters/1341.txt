1342 Teaching Good Behavior

The seven Mountain River Tiers attacked Ling Han furiously, but Ling Han caused chaos in the course of attacks of these seven people merely through simple movements. They were endlessly attacking each other, and in this moment, the atmosphere was quite lively.

Jiang Qiaoling couldn’t help but be surprised. If one said that Ling Han had just been lucky, it could not have been that he would have been lucky so many times, but if one was saying that Ling Han was very strong, she was not one to believe that, either.

Firstly, there was not the slightest bit of the aura of an elite to feel from Ling Han, and secondly, if he was really an elite, why would he have to come here to rely on her father’s help?

But the truth of the matter was that the Red Headscarf and his companions were becoming more and more disorderly. Finally, they were punching and striking each other, and the worst victim had even been struck by a saber—even his stomach had been split open.

By now, they finally dared not make another move. Instead, they looked at Ling Han with incredible wariness, feeling that this young man was really too unusual.

“Done playing around?” Ling Han asked with a beaming smile.

When Jiang Qiaoling saw this, she immediately loudly exclaimed, “How could we be done playing? Of course we’ll continue to play, and we’re going to play a big game too!”

If she could use this chance to completely scare Ling Yuefeng off, then she would be able to get more peace.

The Red Headscarf and his companions hurriedly shook their heads, though. They did not want to continue to play. Couldn’t it be seen that they were all now battered and bruised by now? Moreover, the one worst off could even see his intestines spilling out of his stomach.

“Quick, go get reinforcements!” The Red Headscarf delivered a kick to the person next to him.

“Yes! Yes!” The man hurriedly nodded, and ran off like the wind.

“If you have the guts, don’t run!” the Red Headscarf said. He was afraid that Ling Han would run. Then, even if they managed to get reinforcements, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to Ling Han, either. After all, the faction of Great Ancestor Yang was also very strong.

“Of course we’re not running, what do we have to fear!”Jiang Qiaoling placed her hands at her hips. “Go and call Ling Yuefeng over, and we’ll see how my uncle will teach him good behavior!”

Ling Han simply chose to remain silent, allowing Jiang Qiaoling to be his spokesperson.

After a while, the reinforcements came.

These were three people in the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, exuding a powerful aura.

“Senior Brother Liu, Senior Brother Zhao, Senior Brother Ma!” The Red Headscarf was overjoyed at their unexpected arrival, and hurriedly greeted the three newcomers. “It’s this brat that actually dared to disrespect Young Master Ling!”

“Oh?” Senior Brother Liu took a few steps forward, swept an eye over Ling Han, and involuntarily revealed an expression of disdain. He gave a humph, and said, “You can’t even deal with this kind of person, and still need the three of us to move?”

HIs eyes looked over the bruises and wounds on the Red Headscarf and his companions, and his expression became even more displeased.

Every sect would definitely be divided into several factions. For instance, they all belonged to the Ling Faction, whereas Ling Han and Jiang Qiaoling were obviously from the Yang Faction. Now, the people of the Ling Faction had actually been beaten by people from the Yang Faction, so they would naturally feel embarrassed.

“Senior Brother Liu...” the Red Headscarf said weakly. He also felt quite aggrieved. It was obvious that Ling Han was really not that strong, but just by moving his feet, he had caused them to be in complete chaos. He felt ashamed just by talking about it.

Senior Brother Liu waved him off, and stopped the Red Headscarf from saying whatever he was going to say. No matter how it was, since people of the Ling Faction had been beaten, he was naturally not just going to sit by and watch.

“You, kneel down!” He pointed at Ling Han, giving out pressure that came from one used to a lofty position. “I’ll give you a chance. As long as you kneel for three days and nights, I will spare you this once.”

“Liu Dongdong, why are you acting so proud? Do you think that you are so very awesome?” Jiang Qiaoling could not stop herself from fanning the fires again. “Uncle, you don’t have to mind me. Beat them, beat him until even his own mother wouldn’t be able to recognize him!”

“My name is Liu Dongming!” Senior Brother Liu called out loudly, a vein popping on his forehead.

“Don’t you think that Liu Dongdong sounds nicer?” Jiang Qiaoling’s whole expression was completely innocent and naive, but whoever believed that she was really so innocent would definitely be fooled dizzy.

“Damn it!” Liu Dongming couldn’t help but make a move, and snatched at Jiang Qiaoling.

Jiang Qiaoling was very agile. Since she had deliberately fanned the fires, how could she have been unguarded? She stayed beside Ling Han all this while, and the moment Liu Dongming made his move, she immediatley ducked behind Ling Han, completely making Ling Han into her human shield.

“Out of the way!” Liu Dongming shouted loudly.

Ling Han did not answer, but neither did he move out of the way. To Liu Dongming, this was naturally seen as a challenge, and he pressed down his palm towards him. Four Mountain Rivers appeared around him and formed a frightening pressure.

The release of the Mountain Rivers would boost destructive power.

Ling Han moved one step to the side, and then very casually sent out a palm strike of his own. However, whether it was in terms of timing or power, it was controlled strictly. There was obviously not much power, but Liu Dongming involuntarily charged forwards, and with a bang, also fell pathetically onto the ground.

The Red Headscarf almost laughed out loud. Just now, you had even called me trash, but didn’t you end up just like I had? But they were still on the same side, after all, so he couldn’t possibly favor an outsider instead of his own side.

Jiang Qiaoling did not have such qualms, and erupted into laughter. She even began applauding, and said, “Uncle, you’re great. Now I believe that you are my father’s friend because you are as treacherous as my father!”

Would anyone give their father such an assessment?

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. Furthermore, there was absolutely no similarity in personality that he shared with Jiang Yuefeng.

Liu Dongming got back up, and looked at Ling Han with shock and suspicion.

He couldn’t understand. Ling Han had obviously not used much power in that strike, and he hadn’t moved very fast, either, so why had he involuntarily fallen to the ground from such a light strike? He put himself in Ling Han’s shoes, but no matter how hard he thought about it, he did not think that he could do it himself.

It was precisely because this confusion that caused him not to dare to make another move.

His thinking was correct. No Mountain River Tier could possibly deliver a heavy strike so lightly like how Ling Han had done so previously. That was because Ling Han had not used brute force. Instead, he had used the power of Regulations, Regulations of a higher level, and that was why he could easily pummel a Mountain River Tier while not showing any obvious power.

“Quick, go get reinforcements!” Liu Dongming said to the Red Headscarf.

The Red Headscarf involuntarily broke out in a cold sweat. Why did these words sound so familiar? Weren’t they the exact words he had said to his lackey just now? Now the speaker was another person, but there was no change to his lines. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He hurriedly turned around and ran, going off to look for someone even stronger.

...If even consummate level was not an equal match, then he could only bring a senior of the Sun Moon Tier.

“How should I address you, Sir?” Liu Dongming asked darkly.

Ling Han waved his hand dismissively, and said, “You are still not qualified to find out!”

Liu Dongming almost exploded in fury. He was just a step away from becoming a higher level elite by reaching the Sun Moon Tier, yet had actually been waved off and reprimanded by another so dismissively as if he was just any ordinary person. How could he take that?

‘Wait, wait until the elites of the Ling Faction come, and we’ll see if you won’t be suppressed like a dog!’

After a while, a middle-aged man walked quickly over, the Red Headscarf following behind him.

There was a red sun above the head of this middle-aged man, his attitude disdainful, seeming extremely arrogant. In the Heaven’s Sword Palace, the Sun Moon Tier was an undisputed elite, so it was normal for him to be arrogant.

This man’s surname was Cheng, with the name of Yuan, and he belonged to the faction of the Ling Clan.

“Who is the— f***!” At first, Cheng Yuan had been completely relaxed, but when his eyes caught sight of Ling Han, he couldn’t help but call out loudly in spite of himself.

Why was this bringer of misfortune here!?
