Chapter 3489: Business of robbery

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han thought so, and felt that if he just stayed here like this, it would be a great loss.

He was the champion of the Young Dragon Trial, and this was something that could not possibly be concealed. Furthermore, in the trial grounds, there were a great many forces that had made a move on him, wanting to snatch his good fortune by force.

Now, an elite of the Cauldron Forging Tier had brought a dozen or so Foundation Building elites into the Imperial City. It was clear that he wanted to make an enemy out of Chen Fengyan. Under such conditions, he would obviously become a target as well.

Whether it was the secret of the mural, or the Three Styles of the God of War, they could all drive one crazy.

Even if elites above Celestial Path didn’t make a move, Ling Han was still unable to oppose Mystery Realm Tier elites.

Could it be that he was just going to sit here and allow others to come and provoke him?

“Wu!” A fat little pig quietly crawled in, looking like it was poking its head out, as if it was a thief.

Ling Han shot forwards like an arrow, and picked up the fat pig, “Damn pig, I was just wondering if you had discovered your conscience and finally decided not to swindle food and drink from me. I never thought that you would have returned.”

The fat pig’s eyes widened in shock.

Ling Han nodded, “That’s right, I’m back! You, have you done anything bad in these few days?”

The fat pig bared its mouth in a grin. Pa, a bead fell out of its mouth, and instantly, it was so anxious that its limbs danced wildly, struggling to jump out of Ling Han’s grasp.

Ling Han glanced at it. This was a dark green bead, and even if it was stained with saliva, it was still exuding a gentle lustre.

A precious pearl, this was definitely priceless.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Sure, so you’ve really gone off to become a thief.”

The fat pig smiled guiltily at him, looking like he wanted to discuss things peacefully, but he definitely didn’t want him to tell on him.

Ling Han thought for a moment, “For a greedy and lecherous pig like you, this is definitely not the first time you have done a crime. Are you treating my place like a den of thieves?”

This pervert pig’s eyes blinked madly, as if he was thinking of how to lie.

“Forget it, forget it. I can’t be bothered with you either.” Ling Han shook his head. This was only a treasure in the eyes of ordinary people, and not a cultivation resource. Thus, the chances of the pervert pig encountering cultivators were not high.

Moreover, the fat pig was a little like a combination of Third Baby and Seventh Baby. It could not be harmed by any kind of power, but its own battle prowess was too weak. Ordinary people would be able to easily catch it, and it could be placed on a steamer to be roasted like a suckling pig at any moment.

Only then did the pervert feel as if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulders, and showed a flattering smile at Ling Han.

Ling Han tossed aside the perverted pig, and a thought flashed through his mind.

Could he take the initiative to attack, and rob the descendants of those Celestial Path elites?

These forces had now occupied the Mystery Realms and there was definitely no shortage of Treasured Fruits of Life in their possession. If he could rob a few more of them, then wouldn’t this be able to resolve his present pressing needs?

It should be known that he was not too far from the peak stage of Seventh Extreme.

Fine, I’ll do it then. I can’t always let you guys bully me, right?

“Father, why are you smiling like this?” Second Baby had sharp eyes.

“Yo, so vulgar! Father must be planning to screw someone over.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Father, should we commit murder or arson?”

The eyes of the babies all lit up, looking very excited.

Could you guys not be so violent, thinking of murder and arson at the drop of a hat?

Ling Han sighed upon hearing this. His teachings were far too poor. In any case, he was already the father of several children, so why had he failed in teaching these seven children?

He summarized. These seven children had long since developed intelligence, and their outlook on life was already preliminary. Added with the fact that they were either fighting with him, or about to start fighting, how could they not be violent?

Forget it. The babies only had to remember one thing. If they wanted to fight or kill, they just had to focus on the bad guys.

“We’re not going to commit murder, nor are we going to commit arson. We’re going to commit robbery,” Ling Han said.

“Good, good!” The seven babies all clapped their hands. Though they had only returned for two days, they were already bored out of their minds.

“Father, when are we setting off?” Eldest Baby rubbed her hands in anticipation. She was a violent maniac, and she was already feeling an unbearable thirst.

“There’s no rush. We have to get to the bottom of the situation first,” Ling Han said.

Though over a dozen Celestial Path elites had come, high and noble, they had previously been in prison all this while, and what kind of entertainment venue could there be in a prison? It was definitely either cultivating or slaughtering. Thus, after entering into the colorful world of the Imperial City, perhaps those Celestial Path elites could still restrain themselves, but what about their descendants?

Ling Han contacted Xuanyuan Dingguo and asked him to help him keep an eye on places like brothels and casinos. He was sure that he would definitely discover something.

In less than two days, Xuanyuan Dingguo gave him detailed information.

So-and-so was always reluctant to leave the brothel, so-and-so was addicted to gambling, so-and-so liked to hook up with married women… their tastes really varied.

Ling Han counted, and the majority still preferred to go to brothels.

Sigh, men.

At night, Ling Han and his group moved out.

He arrived near the most luxurious brothel in the Imperial Capital. He stood on a tall building, which had over 40 floors. Standing on the top floor, he could clearly see every street in the vicinity.

With Ling Han’s eye technique, he could clearly see even an ant on the ground.

“Come, come, come, let’s play cards!” Eldest Baby said.

The four of them sat at the same table, but none of the children wanted to be in the same group as Sixth Baby and Seventh Baby. Sixth Baby was always invisible, so who knew when she would come over to peek at your cards. As for Seventh Baby, she would fall asleep in the middle of playing cards.

How could this be tolerated?

Thus, Eldest Baby, Second Baby, Fourth Baby, Fifth Baby were in one group, Ling Han and the proud Third Baby were thrown into Sixth Baby and Seventh Baby’s group, and the game of cards began. As expected, Sixth Baby won madly without losing, unless the cards were really too bad.

When it was past three in the morning, Ling Han finally discovered that his target had appeared.

This time, the person he targeted was the legitimate son of a Celestial Path elite. His name was Fan Taihe, and Xuanyuan Dingguo had already investigated clearly. This person was in Enlightenment Tier, and was in the early stage of Enlightenment Tier.

Ling Han quietly climbed down from upstairs, while seven excited toddlers followed behind him. All of them were standing on tiptoes, wanting nothing more than to make a move for Ling Han.

Fan Taihe was a little drunk, and his steps were unsteady. He was very at ease. At present, in the Imperial Capital, who would dare make a move on him?

Was he not afraid of death?

Moreover, no matter how drunk he was, he was still an elite of the Enlightenment Tier. Aside from a few Imperial Princes or Hong Tianbu, who else could wound him?

He was humming a tune under his breath, and as he thought back to how they had made love just now, he couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. What kind of life had he been living in the prison previously?

If it was not for the fact that the elites had broken through the formation, allowing them to escape, he was sure that in a few hundred years, he would have turned into a pile of bones in that damn place.

He had really been born at the right time, just in time for a good life.

Tomorrow, he would come again, and play with a few new little imps.

Ling Han made a judgement based on the terrain, circled around, and rushed ahead of Fan Taihe.

In a short while, Fan Taihe had already arrived.

When he passed by, Ling Han stealthily hid himself in the alley. He raised the battle hammer in his hand and smashed it at the back of Fan Taihe’s head..
