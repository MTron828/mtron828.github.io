2890 Desiring to test battle prowess

Ling Han’s progress was slow, but that depended on whom he was being compared with.

How many people were capable of breaking through to the Third Tier in just a billion years?

In terms of natural talent in cultivation, Ling Han admitted that he was not the best, but his opportunities and fortunes had surpassed anyone’s. For example, could there be a second person who could accommodate the Powers of Dimension of the whole Genesis World inside his body?

With high natural talent, their progress was slightly faster. However, even when it came to the likes of Lin Youlian, the greatest prodigy of all eternity, wasn’t she still stuck at the Fourth Tier?

Moreover, even if they could cross over to the next threshold now, the Sixth Tier and Seventh Tier were both huge hurdles, and the time required would be even longer. Furthermore, the Seventh Tier was the end of the line. If Ling Han could also cross over to the Seventh Tier, who could rival him?

Perhaps he would already be invincible upon reaching the Sixth Tier.

After breaking through to the Third Tier, heavenly tribulation naturally descended on Ling Han, but he ignored it. This little barrage couldn’t even be considered as a massage for him.

He guided the Constant Particles, continuously tempering his body with them from within, and strengthening his cultivation of the Third Tier. Otherwise, having just broken through, it would be impossible to increase his battle prowess.

Ling Han took out the single remaining Great Herb, and swallowed it all in a few mouthfuls.

He had just broken through, and needed the Great Herb to build his foundations.

Even with the help of a Great Herb, Ling Han still spent another 100,000,000 years to completely stabilize his cultivation level at the Third Tier.

It couldn’t be helped. He had too many Powers of Dimension in his body. A Great Herb was simply a drop in the bucket.

At the same time when he advanced to the Third Tier, a Heavenly Venerable Seal appeared within his body automatically.

It was still incomplete, but the power boost had shockingly reached more than 40 times.

If it was complete, how many times could power be enhanced?

While stabilizing his cultivation level, Ling Han was also repairing this seal. There were millions and millions of Powers of Dimension circulating within his body, which actually gave rise to a miraculous effect, nourishing this seal and making it more complete.

‘The Power of Dimension actually has such an effect?’

Ling Han was puzzled at first, but then came to a sudden realization. He himself was an equivalent of the Genesis World, so why couldn’t he nurture the Heavenly Venerable Seals?

A complete Third Tier’s seal… was a fourth-grade seal, which would give a boost of power by a total of 64 times.

“What level has my current battle prowess reached?” Ling Han muttered to himself. “Can I surpass the Fifth Tier?”

If it was possible, then he was truly too terrifying.

Fifth Tier would completely crush Fourth Tier, and the gap between these two cultivation levels was simply too great. Moreover, Ling Han was now only in the early stage of the Third Tier. If he possessed the battle prowess of a Fifth Tier, then that would truly be incredible.

Take the Empress for example. The higher her cultivation level, the weaker her battle prowess. For example, she was currently in the early stage of the Third Tier, but her battle prowess was only at the peak stage of the Third Tier, yet to even break through to the Fourth Tier.

It was different with Ling Han. The Powers of Dimension in his body were all “alive,” and their growth rate was too terrifying.

‘I really want to find someone to spar with.’

Ling Han stood up and took a step forward, chasing after the Empress and Hu Niu.

He had left his Power of Dimension on the two women. As long as he sensed them, he would be able to find them no matter how far away they were.

To his surprise, the two women were no longer on this level. Instead, they had gone further downward again.

He didn’t stay here for long, and followed them underground.

Deep underground, he immediately discovered that the fundamental particles here were even denser. The pressure of the dimensional layers seemed to create a huge pressure, causing the fundamental particles to become extremely packed.

Here, the collision of fundamental particles was undoubtedly even more intense. Terrifying flames spread everywhere. To say nothing of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, even First Tier Heavenly Venerates didn’t dare to force their way in, or else they would be easily incinerated.

If there were still a few more dimensions overlapped, would anyone be able to go there?

With this thought in mind, Ling Han easily charged through. With his current battle prowess of the Fifth Tier, this was naturally not a big deal for him.

Soon, he broke through the ground layer, and entered the fourth dimension.

He followed the tracks of the two women. A few days later, his figure landed.

The Empress and Hu Niu were currently together with many other people. He had no idea what they were talking about, but the atmosphere seemed to be extremely tense.

Ling Han immediately said, “Is there going to be a fight? That’s great.”

The Empress couldn’t help but be rendered speechless. Why did this guy only think about fighting all day long? Hu Niu, on the other hand, said, “No, we were just discussing whether we should enter a cave, not planning to get into a fight.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel disappointed. “Oh, so there’s no fight.”

He still wanted to fight against a Fifth Tier in order to test his battle prowess. However, even if there was a conflict here, there wasn’t any Fifth Tier to battle with; those here were all Fourth Tiers.

With Ling Han’s presence, the Empress and Hu Niu naturally became bolder. They strongly advocated entering the cave for exploration. Some chose to retreat, while others chose to enter.

In the end, they discovered an astonishingly valuable raw stone mine in the cave. Everyone who entered made a fortune.

Ling Han had the special ability to “see” stones, so the three of them naturally earned the most. There were nearly 30 Great Herbs and seven Heavenly Venerable Seals, which made the three of them very happy.

They left in search of new veins of ore.

It was truly interesting. In the past, when Ling Han was still at Second Tier and did not want to encounter any Fifth Tier, he would always meet such an elite, or at least meet a descendant of a Fifth Tier, and both sides would inevitably become enemies.

However, now that he wasn’t afraid of Fifth Tier, and was in fact wanting to find one to fight with, all the Fifth Tier elites seemed to have disappeared in an instant. It wasn’t just them; even their descendants seemed to have all vanished.

This made Ling Han extremely depressed, and even his spirit became sluggish.

Several years later, they found a new vein of ore. Just as they were mining it, a group of people appeared.

“This place belongs to us now. If you don’t want to die, scram!” There were a total of 12 people in this group, and all of them were Heavenly Venerates—those who could appear here now were at least Second Tiers as it was already impossible for First Tiers to come here.

Hearing this, Ling Han was not angry, but delighted instead. He sized up these 12 people, but was greatly disappointed because all these 12 people were actually only at the Second Tier.

He held onto a sliver of hope, and said, “Looking at how arrogant all of you are, is there a Fifth Tier senior backing you?”

The 12 people on the other side looked at each other. What was going on?

Was this guy so scared that he directly asked about their background?

These people laughed loudly. As long as one could become a Heavenly Venerates, which one wasn’t a naturally talented genius, proud to the core? Who would be like this, cowering in an instant?

...

“Now that you know we’re not to be trifled with, hurry up and scram!” these people all shouted at Ling Han.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and charged forwards to unleash a barrage of punches and kicks. Peng, peng, peng! What sort of strength did he possess? After a series of chaotic attacks, the 12 people all let out blood-curdling screams. Their limbs were broken, and they were in an extremely miserable state.

“You…” These people were both shocked and furious.

Ling Han laughed out loud, and said, “Quickly go back and call your lord over. I’ll wait here.”

Those people were both furious and shocked. Wasn’t this guy a coward? Why did he suddenly become so fierce?

However, they knew that they were far from being Ling Han’s match, so they all fled quickly, afraid that they would be blasted into pieces by Ling Han if they said another word.

Watching these 12 people leave, Ling Han rubbed his hands together, appearing rather excited.

“Is that necessary?” the Empress asked with a knowing smile.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I have nothing better to do anyway.”

Although he said that, the anticipation in his eyes had already betrayed him.

After almost a day, Ling Han finally saw the return of those 12 people. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

...

“Yi?” His gaze swept over them, and he couldn’t help but reveal an expression of disappointment—although these 12 people had brought reinforcements consisting of five people, these five people were all merely Fourth Tiers.

What happened to the Fifth Tier he was expecting?
