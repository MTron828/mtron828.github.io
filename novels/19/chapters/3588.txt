Chapter 3589: Victory

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

The Battle Armor had two functions. The first was to increase defense, and in two different aspects at that.

Firstly, the armor itself was very hard to break, so it would be very hard to kill the wearer with sharp weapons. Secondly, even if it was struck by shockwaves, the Battle Armor would be able to disperse a considerable portion of the

impact.

On another aspect, the Battle Armorr itself could also provide power, increasing the battle prowess of the user.

Ling Han pounced down from a great height, like a golden condor. After being boosted with the power of the Battle Armor, it was as if his blood was boiling, and his battle prowess had increased greatly.

“I will slash open your tortoise shell!” Liu Jun declared proudly, brandishing

the Carefree Sword in a slash towards Ling Han.

Ling Han raised his arm, and zi, the blade of the sword slashed onto the armour. Instantly, dazzling sparks flickered, and the veined patterns on the armour itself were also glowing, as if it was about to come to life.

This kind of collision was not only a clash of power and techniques between the two cultivators, but also the collision of the materials used to forge the two Spirit Tools and the formation patterns carved on them.

In the end… neither was superior to the other.

Liu Jun was astonished. His Spirit Tool was unable to suppress his opponent’s Battle Armor. He could accept this fact, but in terms of power, he didn’t have the upper hand either?

How was this possible?

“You think too highly of yourself!” Ling Han exclaimed lightly. Power exploded

from his body. Peng! He had sent Liu Jun flying.

Just now, he had not used his full strength.

What!

Everyone’s mouths were wide open, completely rendered speechless.

It should be known that Liu Jun was the Eldest Senior Brother of the Primordial Sect, and was known to be the strongest below Celestial Path. And in the end.

In the most direct clash of power, he was actually sent flying.

This… was unbelievable.

“No, no, no. It’s not that Senior Brother Liu is inferior to him, but rather that person is wearing a Battle Armor, and can receive the power boost of the Battle Armor,” someone immediately explained. No matter what, they could not detract from Liu Jun’s reputation.

“En, this is the reason.”

“This Battle Armor has increased that person’s power by at least tenfold!”

“Ten times? You can be even bolder in your guesses.

“A hundred times?”

“Definitely. Otherwise, how could Senior Brother Liu have been sent flying?” Everyone discussed spiritedly, absolutely not believing that anyone could be stronger than Liu Jun. In fact, they couldn’t even be his equal. Thus, they attributed everything to the Battle Armor’s strength.

Liu Jun turned around, and landed steadily on the ground. He had only been sent flying, and was not injured.

“The might of this Battle Armor is above my expectations!” he stated calmly, naturally attributed Ling Han’s strength to the Battle Armor.

Ling Han couldn’t even bother to explain. He charged over and delivered a claw strike. Golden light dazzled, and there were seals all over the place.

This was a celestial technique. Logically speaking, it should not have been mastered by anyone below Celestial Path, but Ling Han was a freak, and a lot of the common knowledge of martial arts was not applicable to him.

Amidst the dazzling golden light, Ling Han attacked aggressively. In any case, with the Battle Armor protecting him, he was completely unafraid of the

Celestial Tool’s attacks.

Liu Jun shouted lightly, and clashed with Ling Han.

One could exert the might of the Celestial Tool extraordinarily, while the other could use the celestial technique, so both had their own strengths, which could more or less cancel each other out. At this time, the effects of the Battle Armor were fully displayed.

-This could provide Ling Han with even stronger power, a defense that was practically unsolvable.

Was that not enough?

Liu Jun soon fell into a disadvantage. He had to completely disperse Ling Han’s attack Otherwise, if he took a hit from Ling Han’s attack, he would definitely be at a great disadvantage, but when he struck Ling Han, though he could also cause damage to the latter, the effects were much too different.

This caused him to be completely helpless. He had all this strength, yet could not use it to the fullest.

“Ah, ah, ah!” he roared in fury. This kind of battle was too depressing.

“Die!”

He gave a violent shout, and a streak of light flew out from the top of his head, shooting towards Ling Han.

Spiritual attack.

HOW fast was this? As soon as it was shot out, it immediately charged towards

Ling Han’s mind.

Although the Battle Armor was powerful, it couldn’t block Spiritual Power. In fact, it was completely ineffective.

But when it came to Spiritual Power, who would Ling Han be afraid of?

He was nurtured daily with the Essence Nurturing Gourd, a treasure that even

Spirit Transformation True Lords would covet!

However, did he have to appear so powerful?

Ling Han deliberately concealed his identity, not even using the Heavenly Pattern Jade. Otherwise, if he threw it out, he didn’t believe that Liu Jun could block it.

Forget it. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He immediately shook his head internally. He merely guarded his mind closely, not allowing Liu Jun to damage it, while he himself strengthened the rhythm of his attacks.

When Liu Jun saw that Ling Han merely defended and did not attack on the level of divine sense, he thought that Ling Han’s Spiritual Power was not as strong as his, which instantly made him feel like he had discovered an opening. The offensive in his hands completely stopped, and he merely defended and did not attack. He turned his attention to the offensive side, wanting to use Spiritual Power to shatter Ling Han’s mind.

The two of them attacked fiercely, but the attacks of only one side was visible, while the other side’s attacks could not be seen.

But Ling Han’s attacks were effective, and exerted substantial pressure on Liu Jun On the other hand, Liu Jun’s attacks… Ling Han merely defended and did not attack in order not to expose his identity, yet Liu Jun thought that Ling Han was not skilled in Spiritual Power, and seized this opportunity to attack madly. If he discovered this, who knew what he would think?

This result was naturally destined.

Liu Jun was continuously injured, but the counterattack that he had placed high hopes on was still ineffective. To say nothing of shattering his mind, he couldn’t even enter into the mind, and kept circling around outside.

Only now did he realize that if it was not for the fact that his spirit was incredibly strong, it must be that the other had a rare treasure that could protect his spirit.

■F*ck!’

■What the f*ck are you doing? How can you possibly have so many Spirit Tools in your possession?’ Moreover, Spiritual Power Spirit Tools were even more valuable. The reason for this was very simple-there were very few of them.

How were they supposed to continue fighting like this?

However, he definitely couldn’t forfeit. He, the dignified Eldest Senior Brother of the Primordial Sect below the Celestial Path, was actually outmatched and forfeited? Would he still have the face to sit in this position in the future?

He could only grit his teeth and hold on, hoping for a miracle to happen.

” Why hasn’t Eldest Senior Brother counterattacked yet?” A thirteen to fourteen year old youngster couldn’t understand the situation, and called out anxiously from the sidelines.

■■Senior Brother, hurry up and counterattack!” the youth beside him also shouted.

“Eldest Senior Brother, go!” Even more youths called out.

in the eyes of these young and naive youths, Liu Jun was an invincible God of War, but now, their God of War was being beaten down on, which made them feel incredibly anxious.

However, even more people saw how Liu Jun was destined to fail, and they were all feeling down.

“It’s all because of that Battle Armor!”

“This is too unjust. How can a Celestial Tool be used?

“That’s right, this is not fair!”

They all called out, yet had gone selectively blind. They did not say that Liu Jun actually also held a Celestial Tool in his hands.

But no matter how much they shouted, what was the use?

Liu Jun unleashed all of his ultimate moves, yet he was completely unable to break through the Battle Armor. In the end, he could only admit defeat.

-Good! Good! Good!” Liu Jun gritted his teeth, his expression twisted. He stared at Ling Han for a while, then suddenly turned around and left.

The Foundation Building elite sighed. He wouldn’t have expected that the final victor wouldn’t be Liu Jun, but rather this extremely two-faced and shameless guy in front of him.

However, he had no choice but to announce, “The champion of this martial arts competition is… Can Ye!”
