Chapter 1208: A Gathering of Villains

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Hua Yangwen, why are you here?” Gao Huang asked with a humph.

“Heh, this isn’t your house, so why can’t I be here?” Hua Yangwen was naturally unafraid of Gao Huang. They were both descendants of disciples of an Eternal River Tier elite, and they were both the young master of their respective faction. Their status was identical, their cultivation level was identical, and their strength was also identical.

Gao Huang stared at Hua Yangwen. He had already lost the Thousand Source True Fluid, so he was naturally beside himself with fury. Right now, he wanted to take his anger out on Ling Han. Thus, the worst thing that could happen was if someone stepped out to protect Ling Han.

Hua Yangwen pointed at Ling Han, and said, “Don’t worry, I didn’t come to protect him.” Killing intent flashed across his eyes.

Gao Huang instantly came to a realization. The Hua Faction had evidently made a deal with Ling Han before, and it was because of this deal that they had helped him. The Thousand Source True Fluid had most likely been an integral part of this deal. Otherwise, why would Hua Yangwen have been so fervent?

However, after a while, the Hua Faction had suddenly stopped helping him. This was undoubtedly because their deal had fallen through. In other words, the Hua Faction had given up on Ling Han.

Thinking carefully, the Hua Faction hadn’t prevented them from listing Ling Han on the interrogation list. In fact, they had even encouraged this. From this, it could be seen that the Hua Faction also wanted to capture Ling Han. It was just that they were hiding in the background and out of sight.

In order to interrogate a seed, they needed support from over half of the 24 Heavenly Body Tier elites. Thus, if the Hua Faction wanted to protect Ling Han, they could have easily prevented him from entering the White Jade Palace. Of course, they would definitely have to pay a price for this.

Anyhow, everyone had wanted to snatch the Thousand Source True Fluid from Ling Han’s hands. It was just that the Gao Faction had been the most active and fervent.

If the Gao Faction had succeeded in obtaining the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid, the Hua Faction, Hu Faction, and other factions definitely wouldn’t have sat on their hands. They would have all stepped in to take a slice of the cake.

This was inevitable. After all, Ling Han was a soft target.

‘Brilliant. It’s fine as long as he’s not here to protect Ling Han.’

Gao Huang nodded, and said, “We already have all the witnesses and evidence, so hurry up and deliver the judgment! Strip him of his identity as a seed!”

Hua Yangwen wore a faint smile as he watched on. This measly Mountain River Tier cultivator had actually dared to reject him... How foolish! He had especially come here to witness Ling Han’s suffering. He wanted to see his expression of anger and remorse.

Ling Han looked at them coldly. This was a gathering of rats and snakes1, so it would be useless no matter how he explained himself. All he could do was speak a few words of ridicule. However, nothing he did would change the end result.

Of course, this was unless a powerful elite stepped in to help him. However, such a possibility was incredibly slim.

“Ahem!” There was an awkward expression on Shen Kuo’s face. He was the main judge, yet he was being commanded like a dog by Gao Huang. He forced a serious expression onto his face, and said, “Han Lin, there’s irrefutable evidence that you killed your fellow disciples! I hereby announce that, from this moment on, you’re stripped of your identity as a seed and stripped of your identity as a disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect!”

Pa!

He slammed the table heavily.

“You committed the abhorrent crime of killing fellow disciples. According to the rules of the sect—”

“Hahahaha!” Shen Kuo was just about to announce further punishment, yet Gao Huang had already started to laugh loudly. Gao Huang’s laughter cut him off, and he could only shut his mouth awkwardly.

“Han Lin, do you regret your decisions now?” Gao Huang’s voice was cold, and he continued, “You’re a measly Mountain River Tier cultivator, and you’re more so a bumpkin from a small world. Yet, you actually dared to oppose me? Are you worthy? Do you have the right?

“I’m going to give you one final chance. Kneel down and beg me for forgiveness. Perhaps I’ll be lenient and spare your life!”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Gao Huang, you truly haven’t disappointed me. You really are a cold and heartless person. Didn’t you say that I killed Shi Ming? Yet, you’ll actually spare me if I kneel down and kowtow to you. Aren’t you afraid of alienating your subordinates?”

Sure enough, the expressions of Shen Kuo and the others changed when they heard this.

Gao Huang paid no heed to this. In his mind, apart from his father, other people were all lackeys and dogs that acted on his command. If they were disobedient... he would simply kill them. The most abundant resource in this world was lackeys. So, why did he need to care?

He laughed loudly, and said, “This is your only way to avoid death. Become my dog, and I’ll spare your life!”

“Keep dreaming!” Ling Han shook his head, and said, “The only person who’ll be kneeling and kowtowing is you!”

“Preposterous!” Gao Huang seethed. He truly didn’t understand where Ling Han was getting his confidence from. He had already lost his identity as a seed, and he was a mere lamb for slaughter.

Ling Han swept his gaze over Gao Huang and Hua Yangwen, and then said, “I’ve already remembered your appearances. It’s best that you remember what happened today. I’ll return within 10 years to repay this debt!”

He had already decided to enter the Black Tower and leave the Majestic Heaven Sect.

After 10 years, he could perhaps become a Heavenly Body Tier elite. At that time, he would return to exact revenge. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He wasn’t overly worried about Ding Ping, Shui Yanyu, and the others. After all, they were all disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect. Even if Gao Huang wanted to target them, he would need to frame them first, just as he had done with Ling Han.

However, timing and opportunities were integral when trying to frame someone. Ling Han wouldn’t give them this chance. He had already discussed this with Shui Yanyu and the others, and they had all gathered at the Mo Clan Establishment today. If things went awry, they would immediately leave together.

He was only one step away from reaching the Sun Moon Tier, so it was about time that he went to search for the Roc Palace, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and the others. This was a decent opportunity to leave.

Moreover, he had already asked the Mo Clan Establishment to help him search for the Roc Palace and the Five Sects. Once there was information, he would immediately set off.

“Heh, you’re still as arrogant as ever!” Another voice traveled over, and a deity-like man walked into the palace. A long shadow was cast by his tall figure, and it was as if people could only kowtow under his shadows.

It was Yang Hao!

“O-our respects to Uncle Yang!” Gao Huang and Hua Yangwen exchanged a glance before greeting Yang Hao respectfully.

‘What? Uncle Yang?’

One had to realize that Gao Huang and Yang Hao were both at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. Meanwhile, Yang Hao was only the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. So, why were they referring to him as a senior? Unless...

“Uncle Yang officially became the 10th disciple of the grandmaster yesterday!” Gao Huang explained. He was someone who cared about face, so he naturally explained why he had referred to Yang Hao as “Uncle Yang”.

Now that he had become the 10th disciple of the Venerable Trinity, Yang Hao’s status had changed completely. Even though his cultivation level was still low, even Heavenly Body Tier elites would have to treat him with the utmost respect.

One could disrespect Yang Hao, but could they disrespect Venerable Trinity? If one held themself in higher regard than Yang Hao, wouldn’t they be claiming to be on the same level as Venerable Trinity? Who in this galaxy had the right to claim this?

Everyone was stunned by this sudden turn of events. Although there had been rumors floating around, who could read the mind of an Eternal River Tier elite? Now that Yang Hao’s status had been confirmed, everyone was naturally stunned. Sure enough, Yang Hao had become the 10th disciple of Venerable Trinity.

Yang Hao’s status rose so dramatically that he was on equal standing with Heavenly Body Tier elites.

A faint smile appeared on Yang Hao’s face as he looked at Ling Han. However, there was terrifying killing intent hidden in the depths of his eyes.
