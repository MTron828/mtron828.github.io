Chapter 2352: Beaten until bursting

This was really too shameless!

What was Feng Hailuan’s cultivation level?

He was a Ninth Lotus First Leaf, and a monarch star at that. As for Ling Han? An Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf. Even if they were both monarch stars, wasn’t there still a gap of a major tier between the two of them? Even if the Eleventh Leaf could barely be considered a Ninth Lotus, Feng Hailuan would still have the advantage of a minor level.

What monarch star could defeat another monarch star with the gap of a minor level between them, especially when they were both on the level of the Ninth Lotus?

Wasn’t this clearly snatching the Battle Beast by force?

Huai Jian also faltered. ‘You are also a monarch star yourself, and still act so brazenly. So shameless!’

“Senior Brother Feng, this is Ba. I have deliberately brought him here to introduce him to Lord Desolate Eternity!” Huai Jian’s expression darkened.

Feng Hailuan smiled faintly in response. If the Battle Beast was in Huai Jian’s possession, he would definitely not dare to snatch it by force. This was the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s arrangements. Who would dare go against the will of a Heavenly Venerate?

But Ling Han was a different story altogether.

Even if he really became the disciple of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, that was still a future matter. Moreover, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s attitude towards his disciples had always been “leaving them alone.” If you were strong enough, you could win what belonged to you.

Ling Han had also snatched this Battle Beast from Huai Jian’s possession, so it was natural that Feng Hailuan could snatch it over for himself as well. In the future, if Ling Han had the ability, he could snatch it back as well.

Of course, he would definitely suppress Ling Han continuously, not allowing him the opportunity to surpass himself.

“Junior Brother Huai Jian, you still do not know the rules of our line of Desolate Eternity. I don’t blame you, but you should not interfere in this matter!” Feng Hailuan said, his tone slightly severe. He was already putting on airs as a senior brother.

Right at this moment, a commotion was actually heard from behind him, and very soon, the fog visibly parted, giving way to three people.

They were Jing Zhongyue, Xu Xing, and Xue Ge. They, too, held a small pendant, which was emanating light, dispelling the fog.

Clearly, they had also gained the notice of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, who had given them the “key” to ascend the Divine Desolate Mountain.

Why didn’t Ling Han have one too?

“Yi!” When they spotted Ling Han and Huai Jian, Jing Zhongyue and the others were also extremely surprised.

“You guys are…” Feng Hailuan’s eyes swept over them. These three people were actually holding the token of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, which meant that he had another three junior brothers and junior sister, which also meant that the competition was becoming more intense.

“I am Xue Ge.”

“I am Xu Xing.”

“I am Jing Zhongyue.”

Jing Zhongyue and the others introduced themselves, but their expressions were all proud, holding no hint of respect.

This was the pride that belonged to a supreme monarch star!

Feng Hailuan’s brow wrinkled in a frown, but he very soon set this matter aside, and turned his attention back to Ling Han. “If you dare not fight me, scram off the mountain!”

Without the token of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity in Ling Han’s possession, Feng Hailuan absolutely had no need to show Ling Han any cordiality.

Yet Huai Jian frowned, thinking that it was possible that he had accidentally caused a problem despite his good intentions.

Since Jing Zhongyue and the others had all gotten the favor of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, then it was impossible that Ling Han, who was even stronger, had not. That only meant one thing, and that was the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity already knew that Huai Jian had brought Ling Han here, so he did not bother to manifest again just to bestow his token.

But now that things had progressed to this point, it was too late for him to have any regrets.

Jing Zhongyue and the others had not expected that they would encounter the scene of Ling Han facing off against the disciples of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity at their arrival, and couldn’t help but feel greatly intrigued. But no matter how high their opinion of Ling Han was, they did not think that he could possibly be a match for Feng Hailuan.

It could not be helped; the gap in cultivation level was clearly obvious.

Ling Han chuckled, yet the expression on his face became menacing. “Since you are asking for a beating, I will just have to oblige you!”

“Hahahaha, what shameless boasting!” Feng Hailuan grinned in his fury. A mere Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf actually dared to declare he was going to beat him up. Where did he get his courage from?

Ling Han stretched out his right hand, and crooked a finger. “If you want a beating, bring it on!”

Feng Hailuan released a roar. Like a primordial monster emerging, it shook millions and millions of kilometers.

He moved aggressively, and sent out a punch. Instantly, millions and millions of shooting stars crashed down from the skies, intending to kill Ling Han forcefully.

In any case, Ling Han was not of their line; so what if he killed him?

Did the disciple of a Heavenly Venerate need any reason to commit murder?

Ling Han’s eyes turned cold. Bending his legs slightly, he suddenly bounced, instantly exploding with a frightening speed.

Peng, peng, peng. One after another, the shooting stars crashed down, yet they were all shattered with a single punch from him.

Huai Jian, Xue Ge, and the others all looked stunned. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They knew that Ling Han was very strong, but no matter how strong he was, there had to be a limit. After all, he was only an Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf. At maximum, his battle prowess would only be at the peak stage of the Ninth Lotus First Leaf, but Feng Hailuan’s battle prowess had definitely reached Ninth Lotus Second Leaf.

This was a massive gulf that could not be breached.

Yet Ling Han did not care what they were thinking. With him brandishing his fists continuously, the shooting stars that fell were all shattered with a single punch. He had already charged towards Feng Hailuan, a fist aimed straight for the latter’s face.

Feng Hailuan was also stunned and confused. In fact, he even felt an inconceivable chill. This kind of might was inconceivable in the eyes of a monarch star like him.

However, he naturally couldn’t possibly just receive this punch from Ling Han. He hurriedly shouted, and made his right hand’s fingers bend like claws, which stabbed towards Ling Han.

Boom!

The two fighters’ hands clashed together, instantly causing a frightening storm of energy that assaulted the skies, which turned into what seemed like furious dragons.

Jing Zhongyue and the others couldn’t help but widen their eyes. That was because Ling Han was really not at a disadvantage in this exchange. In fact…. he was slightly enjoying the upper hand.

“There is no power of Regulation!”

“This is purely brute force!”

“But how could that be? Without Regulations, no matter how strong you were, it would still be useless, as it could not cause much damage.”

Huai Jian pondered quietly for a long while, and finally said, “No, he has still used Regulations, yet it is a kind of Regulation that we cannot comprehend.”

Were there any Regulations like that?

Jing Zhongyue exchanged looks with the others. But if that was not the case, they really could not accept the fact that pure brute force could actually contend against a Ninth Lotus First Leaf Monarch Star. It should be known that even if the power of Regulation was removed from an Ancestral King, his battle prowess would only be at the level of the Sixth Lotus.

Amidst their utter shock, Ling Han had already sent out a barrage of Fists of Fury, pummeling Feng Hailuan endlessly.

What had he done?

First, it was Sihuang Yun, and now it was Feng Hailuan. Did they all think that he was an easy target to bully?

If so, he would have to burst out!

Huai Jian and the others had all gone mad. Feng Hailuan had actually fallen into a disadvantage, and it was an absolute disadvantage at that, with Ling Han suppressing him completely in battle.

This kind of battle prowess… had to be about the peak stage of the Ninth Lotus Second Leaf, right?

Huai Jian swallowed with much difficulty. He was a Ninth Lotus First Leaf Monarch Star, and was a supreme monarch star at that. Even if he had just advanced into this level, he only possessed the battle prowess of the early stage Ninth Lotus Second Leaf.

But this was also his limit. To explode with even stronger battle prowess, he could only use powerful moves.

As for Ling Han?

Even if he was constantly using powerful moves, he should not be so powerful still.

And to think that he actually said that he did not want to suppress Ling Han with his superior cultivation level, but from the look of things now, if the two of them really were to fight, would he be able to withstand 100 moves from Ling Han?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han exploded. He drew close to Feng Hailuan, and every punch he delivered was like the intense collision of endless great stars, blasting Feng Hailuan to the point of throwing up blood nonstop.

Crack, his fist landed on Feng Hailuan’s face, and forcefully crushed half of his face. Even his bones had been crushed into dust. The man’s countenance completely turned into a mess of blood and flesh. What bit of the dashing and handsome good looks that a member of the Angel Race had was left on him?

Ling Han continued the attack with a knee.?Peng, a muffled sound was heard from within Feng Hailuan’s body. That was the sound of various internal organs inside his body being crushed.
