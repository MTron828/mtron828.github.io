Chapter 872: My Master, Ling Han

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

All the important people of the clan were offering their congratulations, and so was the lord city master, which caused Ding Feiwen to become so smug and conceited that he was practically about to forget his own name.

That should be the case, right? He had gained the favor of some major figure of the Crimson Sun Sect, and had been taken as disciple, just that he had yet to get the news. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

‘Hoho, that must be it!

‘F*ck, Ding Ping, that bastard, actually dared to give me a punch. I’m definitely going to make him pay dearly for it this time!’

“Lord City Master, this way, please!” the patriarch of the Ding Clan hurriedly said. This was no place for conversation.

“Please!”

“Please!”

They all moved to the main hall, and sat in the respective seats for hosts and guests. Because Liu Zhenshi’s status was much too high, they still felt ill at ease even though he had been offered the high seat of the host, fearing that they would have treated this noble guest too lightly.

“Lord Patriarch, Elders!” Ding Feiwen smirked as he looked at Ding Ping. “How do you plan on dealing with this person?”

“We have already come to a decision. We shall abolish his status as the first heir of the clan, and will give him a harsh punishment with three hundred heavy strikes of the staff!” the patriarch of the Ding Clan said. Although Ding Feiwen’s tone had suddenly become lofty and proud, which caused him slight displeasure, when he recalled that even the lord city master humbled himself, what right did he have to complain?

“Such a light punishment?” Ding Feiwen’s self-satisfaction was close to exploding. Even the lord city master acted like he would do anything as long as there was a word from him, so what need was there for him to continue to take the elites of the clan to heart?

‘I am an actual True Disciple of the Crimson Sun Sect!’

However arrogant, however tyrannical he acted, it would be accepted as natural.

“Then, according to Feiwen, how should we deal with him?” the patriarch of the Ding Clan asked, slightly displeased, though he did not dare to express his dissatisfaction. He was certain that if he dared to present a poor attitude to Ding Feiwen, Liu Zhenshi would dare move against him.

Lord City Master was an elite of Flower Blossom Tier, what would he dare not do?

“Cripple both his arms!” Ding Feiwen declared icily. He actually dared beat him, so how could he vent his anger without crippling Ding Ping’s arms?

“Report!” Right at this moment, another servant entered, knelt, and announced, “The patriarch of the Ye Clan seeks an audience!”

Ye Clan?

“Yuanyuan is here?” Ding Feiwen could not help but break into a grin. “Let them in!” Ye Yuan had come just on time—she could clearly see how impressive and amazing he was now. Furthermore, with Ye Yuan watching from the side, this would give Ding Ping the greatest blow.

That servant would naturally not obey Ding Feiwen’s command, and immediately turned to look at the patriarch of the Ding Clan.

The patriarch of the Ding Clan was even more displeased; who was calling the shots in the Ding Clan now? Even if you, Ding Feiwen, would be a great elite in the future, that was only something that would happen in the future. His expression black, he humphed before commanding, “Invite them in!”

In a short while, the servant led three people in, two men and a woman. The two men were the patriarch and the first elder of the Ye Clan, whereas the woman was naturally Ye Yuan.

“Yuanyuan, you’re here!” Ding Feiwen said, smiling. He was completely acting like he was the patriarch of the Ding Clan, and said, “Come, let me introduce to you, this is the city master, Lord Liu!”

‘City Master!’

The three members of the Ye Clan all looked stunned. Lord City Master? What noble, prestigious person was that? But looking at the attitude of Ding Feiwen, he seemed capable of being on equal stand with the lord city master.

That was too awesome, wasn’t it?

“Brother Feiwen, why has Lord City Master come?” Ye Yuan asked in a whisper.

Ding Feiwen was feeling particularly pleased with himself, and said, “I have been taken as True Disciple by a great figure of the Crimson Sun Sect, and thus, even Lord City Master himself has personally come to offer his congratulations!” He deliberately leaned close to Ye Yuan and lowered his voice as if putting up a pretense of profound mystery.

The Ye Clan naturally knew that the lord city master had come, and thus the patriarch and first elder had come personally, wanting to get to the bottom of this matter.

Even so, Ye Yuan was still stunned, and said, “Then, I truly congratulate you, Brother Fei Wen!” When she saw Ding Ping’s punch previously, she had thought that this might be related to him, but now, she had completely tossed this idea aside.

Now that she thought about it, it was funny. That person had a crippled Spirit Base, and his achievements in this lifetime were already destined.

Ding Feiwen was feeling particularly pleased. He looked coldly at Ding Ping, and said, “Come, take him away quickly and break his arms!” He had directly exceeded his authority, acting like he was the patriarch.

“Report...!” It was really lively today; again, a servant had entered, “Informing Patriarch, the sect master of the Crimson Sun Sect has come to visit.” Even his voice was trembling. The sect master of the Crimson Sun Sect, what great elite was that? He was a few hundred times stronger than even the lord city master!

The elites of the Ding Clan all looked at each other, slightly confused.

Even if Ding Feiwen had been taken in as disciple by that great elite of the Spiritual Infant Tier from the Crimson Sun Sect, there was still no need for the sect master himself to make a personal visit, right?

What was going on here?

‘So Lord Jie has also gotten the news.’ Only Liu Zhenshi understood. That great lord had taken in a disciple, so putting aside the personal visit of the sect master of the Crimson Sun Sect, even if even more powerful figures came, that would not be the slightest bit strange.

However, he was a bit confused. This Ding Feiwen, at best, could only be called talented; furthermore, his temperament was really not all too impressive. Why would he have been chosen by that great lord?

But Ling Han had clearly said that he was to go to the Ding Clan to offer his congratulations; could it be that the members of the Ding Clan had made some kind of mistake here?

Everyone hurriedly went out to receive the other newcomer. The sect master of the Crimson Sun Sect had the surname of Jie, with the given name of Wu. He had a long-established reputation, and was the greatest elite in this area. When one mentioned this lord, everyone would be filled with heartfelt reverence.

“Greetings, Lord Jie!” Everyone knelt and paid their greetings to this great elite.

Jie Wu raised his hands with a smile, and asked, “Who is the disciple of that lord?”

Hearing his words, the members of the Ding Clan were all at a loss, and practically at the same time, they asked, “What lord?”

They had all thought that Ding Feiwen had been taken as disciple by some great elite of the Crimson Sun Sect, which was why Liu Zhenshi had come to offer his congratulations, but now that Jie Wu had come, there seemed to be something strange going on here, what more when the latter had even used an astonishing form of address: that lord!

Hiss, that lord!

Even Jie Wu had to address him as lord, so what kind of person would that be?

The members of the Ding Clan were all trembling. Things... were becoming strange, and did not seem to be as they had imagined!

Ding Ping suddenly opened his mouth, and asked, “May I ask, is that lord’s surname Ling?”

“Silence, what right do you have to speak here?” Seventh Elder immediately rebuked him. Couldn’t he see that they were feeling troubled here?

Yet Jie Wu and Liu Zhenshi both raised their brows at the same time, turned to look at Ding Ping, nodded, and replied, “Precisely!”

‘Sh*t, what’s this situation?’

None of them were idiots, and a guess appeared inside their hearts. Furthermore, this guess caused great emotional waves inside their hearts.

“My master’s surname is Ling, and his given name is Han,” Ding Ping said. He was finally certain that these two people had come for his sake—strictly speaking, they had come for Ling Han.

“Greetings, Young Master!” Jie Wu and Liu Zhenshi both went down on bent knee, their expressions respectful.

‘What!?’

All the members of the Ding Clan were so stunned there was a shiver running up their spines. That was the lord city master, and there was another person who was even the sect master of the Crimson Sun Sect. These two, in their eyes, were gods—beings that could bear the weight even if the sky collapsed!

But, these two people actually now half-knelt in front of Ding Ping to pay their respects, and called him young master.

Heavens, what kind of f*cking good fortune had hit Ding Ping that he had taken some great lord as his master?

Pa , Ding Feiwen meanwhile slumped down onto the ground, his face ashen.
