Chapter 3495: Ling Han’s Inscription

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You want to counterattack?” Bai Hongcai smirked coldly. He naturally knew that Ling Han had at least two techniques that he had yet to use. The first was the boiling of his blood and Qi, and the second was the inscription.

He also left his boiling of blood and Qi to deal with Ling Han. Thus, the only thing he had to take note of was Ling Han’s inscribed pattern.

It was said that when someone advanced into the Inscription Tier, they received great favor from the heavens, and could form a special inscrription, whose might surpassed ordinary inscribed patterns.

This was the only thing that Ling Han could do to turn the tables.

However, this person had just broken through to the level of Inscription Tier, so he was definitely not proficient enough in the application of inscriptions. Thus, he only needed to take note.

“Let me tell you, in front of absolute power, no matter how much you struggle, it would only be a waste of effort!” Bai Hongcai declared proudly, appearing to be bursting with confidence.

The spectators were also worried for Ling Han. This Bai Hongcai was really too confident, influencing them. Furthermore, it was indeed Bai Hongcai that had the complete upper hand just now, so his words naturally had weight.

Ling Han smiled and raised his fist. The inscription was activated, and instantly, the word “one” appeared on the tip of his fist.

When Bai Hongcai saw this, he couldn’t help but be “frightened”, and even his attacks stopped.

Wang Yu:”…”

Pei Yunfei: “…”

Xiang Teng:”…”

They all knew very well that the might of the inscribed pattern was determined by the number of veined patterns they formed. The more veined patterns there were, the more might there would be. An ordinary person would have around 10,000 inscribed patterns, and they were all over the place, without any pattern at all. Thus, they could not be seen clearly at all.

For people like them, the first inscription was only around 10,000, but the second inscription was not gifted by the heavens. They had all observed their master’s inscriptions, and then developed it on the basis of their own inscriptions, so they could increase the number of veined patterns in the second inscription.

Thus, the more complicated and veined patterns formed later, the more powerful they would be.

Even so, it was still very difficult for even the fifth inscription to reach the limit of 100,000 veined patterns.

However, in the case of special inscribed patterns, the number of veined patterns would be around 100,000, and the limit could reach 200,000, or even as much as 300,000.

Setting this aside first, what surprised them now was Ling Han’s inscribed pattern.

One!

F***, just a vein-like pattern, it really was a “one”.

“Pu!”

“Hahaha!”

It was unknown who was the first to laugh, which then led to loud laughter.

Ordinary people could form ten thousand patterns, but Ling Han actually only had one veined pattern. Wasn’t that the biggest joke in the world?

This was a four-star genius?

“He’s probably envied by the heavens, so they deliberately gave him only this one inscribed pattern.”

“I’m about to laugh myself to death. I’ve never seen such an inscribed pattern.”

“So weak!”

“Can this be considered the weakest inscription in history?”

“Definitely, definitely.”

Wang Yu and the others all laughed loudly, shaking their heads, disdainful to the extreme.

The spectators were confused, but when they heard the “kind” explanations from Tu Liang, Wu Jiashan and the others, they finally understood. Immediately, their expressions also became strange.

How could someone as strong as Ling Han form such a simple inscribed pattern?

Just a “one”, a mere one!

Could you have any less than that?

“What are you laughing at? Father is returning to his true self. In the ways of the world, all of you are pursuing that evasive one, understand?” The proud Third Baby immediately rebuked. She had a kind of blind admiration for Ling Han.

“Pu!” Bai Hongcai mocked, “Little girl, you’re blind!”

Ling Han had initially been all smiles, but when he heard these words, he was enraged.

He actually dared to insult his daughter?

‘F*ck!’

He leaped out, and shot out a punch.

The inscription glowed, dazzling and resplendent.

“Ling Han, I have to admit that I had overestimated you previously,” Bai Hongcai said disdainfully. With this kind of inscribed pattern, what difference did it make whether he enhanced his attack with it or not?

Just see how I will shatter you with a single palm strike.

He raised his palm in response, and as if on purpose, the five inscribed patterns lit up, and the veined patterns were clearly visible.

Peng!

The fist and palm crashed into each other. This wasn’t just a clash of power, but also a clash of high-level energy and the barrage of inscribed patterns.

Bai Hongcai had initially been filled with confidence, but all of a sudden, his expression changed drastically.

An indescribably terrifying power surged over. Pa, pa, pa! His inscribed patterns shattered one after another, completely unable to attack or protect him, and this power rampaged madly, as if there was no expenditure at all.

Pa, his whole fist exploded. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and then his bones. Even if he had evolved them five times before, and the hardness of his bones had surpassed the majority of refined metals, it was still not enough in the face of this power, and was easily broken through.

Bone scraps and blood and flesh flew in unison. Only then did Bai Hongcai let out a pained cry, and stumbled, retreating continuously.

In truth, his power was not inferior to Ling Han at all. In fact, he had even surpassed Ling Han, but it was as if his power was only that of a lone soldier. In terms of quality, the gap was too wide, and that was why he had collapsed with a single strike.

Instantly, a dead silence fell. No one had expected this kind of scene.

Wang Yu and the others were both stunned and embarrassed. They had just mocked Ling Han’s inscription as being considered the weakest in history, but in the blink of an eye, this weakest inscribed pattern exploded with boundless might.

What else could they say?

Everyone was dumbfounded as they looked at Ling Han, only to see that the “1” inscribed on Ling Han’s fist was radiating with light. It was clearly very simple and ordinary, yet it seemed like an emperor that could suppress the ages and destroy the heavens.

Was this really the weakest inscription?

Nonsense, if this was the weakest, then what else could be considered strong?

“How is it?” Third Baby was extremely proud. This was her father, awesome, wasn’t he?

Even Eldest Baby and Second Baby were astonished. They hadn’t imagined that Ling Han’s seemingly ordinary inscription would be so terrifying.

Was this really the simplicity of great dao, returning to one’s true self?

“As expected of the Twin Prodigies of our Imperial City, too awesome!” After the shock, everyone became excited.

“Who would dare to underestimate Ling Han’s inscribed pattern again?”

“Who said that the more complicated the inscriptions, the better?”

Wang Yu and the others wanted to refute him. Countless facts had long since proven that the more complex an inscription was, the stronger it would be. However, in front of Ling Han, this kind of explanation was too weak.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t say that his inscribed pattern looked simple, but the number of veined patterns wasn’t decreasing at all. Instead, it surpassed one million patterns, and more than ten times the number in a special inscribed pattern. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He merely smiled faintly, appearing very cool.

“This is the bearing that a prodigy should have.”

“To be unfazed by honour and favour.”

“Unlike that Bai guy, who jumps up and down, making a complete clown of himself.”

Everyone commented, giving Ling Han a very high assessment.

Bai Hongcai couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood, passing out.

He had fainted from anger.

Pa, pa, pa! Applause rang out, and Ceng Ruixuan walked out. “As expected of a four-star geniu. You are indeed extraordinary. Let me try it out.”

Ling Han really wanted to slap her. You are a Mystery Realm Tier, so what the hell are you sparring with me for?

She was clearly using her high cultivation level to bully Ling Han, so why did it sound like Ling Han was the one who had provoked her, forcing her to accept the challenge?

“Alright, let me spar with you.” A melodious voice rang out..
