Chapter 2599: Defeated in 10 strikes

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

When Wang Dongsen’s words fell, a Sixth Heaven Celestial King walked out.

The Yin River Celestial King immediately frowned. Aside from himself, the strongest in their group were three Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings, and they were Ling Han, A’Yuan, and Yang Xiaoling, respectively. It was impossible that any of the three of them could be a match for He Yi.

Could it be that he would have to fight in the very first battle?

But if he did not step out, that would only result in horrible defeat.

He stepped out. “I alone am enough!”

He Yi bared his teeth in a grin. “If you can withstand 10 strikes from me, I’ll count it as your win.”

The Yin River Celestial King almost exploded in fury. ‘I am a Seventh Heaven Celestial King monarch tier, and you are but at the Sixth Heaven. Now you’re actually saying that you will defeat me in 10 strikes. Where did you get this courage and confidence from?’

He calmed down abruptly, and stated calmly, “Fine then. I really wish to see how you will defeat me within 10 strikes.”

He Yi clasped his hands behind his back. “Easily.”

“Absolute nonsense!” The Yin River Celestial King moved, launching an offensive at He Yi.

He Yi smiled slightly, and moved to counterattack. It was clear that he was inferior by a cultivation level, yet was completely unafraid of battling the Yin River Celestial King.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow; at the same time, their bodies shuddered before taking a few steps back.?Teng, teng, teng.?They both took seven steps back before they steadied their footing again. Their exchange had actually resulted in a tie.

This…

On the side of Ghost King City, everyone looked shocked.

This was inconceivable. A Sixth Heaven Celestial King actually did not fall into a disadvantage in a clash with a Seventh Heaven Celestial King. It should be known that the Yin River Celestial King was also a monarch tier at that!

Zhao Shuang couldn’t help but turn to look towards Ling Han. Aside from Ling Han, there actually were other such monstrous freaks?

The Yin River Celestial King’s expression was cool. “You do indeed have some slight strength, but don’t even think of being capable of defeating me within 10 strikes.”

“Oh, then let’s put it to the test!” He Yi continued to move. With him tapping out a finger, boundless brilliance dazzled their eyes.

“Yi, the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll!” Everyone felt a familiar wave.

By now, there was practically no one that did not cultivate the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, but the advancement of every single person was completely different.

There were some dumb and rash people that had not managed to master even a single part of the Divine Scroll, but those with good aptitude had completed this step. Monarch tier elites were already cultivating the second part, and had even begun to meld the two parts together.

Yet the might of this blow from He Yi had far surpassed the level of having fused two parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll together, and was of the strength of having fused all three parts together.

What kind of aptitude was this? This was really too astonishing!

Even the Yin River Celestial King’s expression shifted. He was a monarch tier, but he was still in the midst of fusing the two parts of Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, yet not only had the other party completed this step, he had even fused all three parts of the Divine Scroll into one.

In comparison, the Yin River was basically trash.

He was internally stunned, yet forcefully suppressed this shock. So what about it? He still had the advantage of a single cultivation level, after all. How could this gap be so easily compensated?

“Three Yin Tap!” With a light exclamation, his index, middle, and ring fingers formed a strange gesture, and stabbed towards He Yi. There was a black shadowy light entwined around the three fingers, bearing a cold feeling of eeriness.

This was a powerful move, and had been further boosted with the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, so its might was increased.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged another blow, but they were still both sent backwards. It was hard to determine who was stronger between the two of them.

He Yi exclaimed lightly, and his figure flashed. Waving both fists in fury, he exuded a grand and magnificent feeling. It was clear that his battle prowess was equal to the Yin River Celestial King’s, but the aura he exuded was incredibly domineering, as if he could crush the Yin River Celestial King.

This was an incomparable confidence, and it was that unreasonable, overwhelming his opponent in terms of presence.

Everyone was sure that if this was a battle of equal cultivation levels, He Yi would definitely be capable of defeating the Yin River Celestial King within 10 strikes, but if there was a gap of a single cultivation level, how could this be achieved?

Three strikes, four, five… The two of them battled intensely. He Yi indeed had a slight advantage, but to speak of defeating the Yin River Celestial King in the next few strikes, this was still too far away.

Eight strikes, nine, and there was only one strike left.

He Yi suddenly shouted loudly, and his whole person suddenly shrank greatly, but one of his fists became bigger many times over. It was enshrouded in green light, with multiple seals flickering within. His aura suddenly soared to an unmatchable height.

He threw out this punch, which descended harshly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Peng!

A loud bang rang out, and the Yin River Celestial King was visibly sent flying. He opened his mouth, and a gust of blood spurted out.

He forcefully turned himself around, and landed on the ground. His feet stood steady, but his figure was trembling slightly. His whole face had instantly turned completely red, and there was actually blood seeping from the corners of his eyes.

This was due to his having forcefully suppressed the blood that had been about to escape from his mouth, but the impact that he sustained was really too great. It was actually flowing out of his eyes, and this made the situation become even more frightening.

Though the Yin River Celestial King was still standing, and could still fight, everyone was aware that he had already lost.

True enough, defeat in 10 strikes.

He Yi took a deep breath as well. In the last strike, he had used an ultimate move. Though he had defeated the Yin River Celestial King, to him, it was also an extremely great depletion. There was no way he could use it continuously.

With this inhalation of air, his body also puffed up, as if his body was being inflated with air.

“You really can’t withstand a single blow!” Wang Dongsen laughed loudly, seeming extremely proud.

The people from Ghost King City could say nothing in response. What else could be done when one had inferior skills? If it really came down to a battle, they would only be facing a one-sided massacre.

Ling Han did not interfere. What did this have to do with him?

He Yi swept an eye over the masses, and then pointed a finger at one person. “You, tell me about that Li Long, and not the slightest bit should be hidden from me!”

That person adhered to the Yin River Celestial King, and was a Second Heaven Celestial King. Though he very much wanted to stay stubborn, and put on a fine performance of loyalty in front of his master, when he saw that cold, expressionless face of He Yi, his heart jolted. Hurriedly, he blurted out all he knew about the topic.

He Yi humphed.?Pa, he sent out a palm strike, and killed that person with brute force. “Knowing nothing, what use are you?”

“You…” The Yin River Celestial King was infuriated, and tossed a glare at him.

“Do you, too, want to die?” He Yi’s eyes were menacing, the gaze he directed at Yin River Celestial Qi filled with killing intent.

The Yin River Celestial King clenched his fists tightly, but still withheld himself from exploding in fury. To say nothing of the fact that there were still two Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings here, as long as He Yi joined forces with Wang Dongsen, they would be able to kill him in a short while.

He could choose to flee, but if so, what was the point of putting up a brave front at this moment?

“Let’s go!” Wang Dongsen waved a hand, and they walked towards the ancient tomb first.

Only when they had all disappeared did everyone finally sigh in relief. They could feel a cold sweat covering their entire bodies. Just now, they had really been a line away from death. If it had really resulted in a battle, then most likely everyone else aside from the Yin River Celestial King and A’Yuan would have had to die.

“Are we… still going in?” someone asked.

“We are!” the Yin River Celestial King squeezed out through clenched teeth. “Though our strength is inferior to the other party’s, when contending for fated opportunities inside an ancient site, it is not just pure strength that means that you will be the one who has the last laugh!”

He could not swallow this grudge. Since he could not match the other party, they would just have to defeat them in terms of contending for the treasures.

Everyone felt uneasy, but since the Yin River Celestial King had spoken, they could only obey him. Otherwise, given they were all just Second Heaven or Third Heaven Celestial Kings, they would only be bullied here without the protection of the Yin River Celestial King.

“Humph, what is there to fear?” the Yin River Celestial King remarked in displeasure, and led the way forwards.

Ling Han was filled with enthusiasm, and walked on after him.
