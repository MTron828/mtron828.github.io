Chapter 825: Fainted in Fury

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng , Rabbit flew unusually fast and severely smashed into the face of Eighth Elder. And it wasn’t over yet. Rabbit had its own attacking attributes: its four paws paused for a moment before clawing wildly at Eighth Elder’s face, instantly causing his face to be full of scratch marks and bleed continuously.

Everyone who had been watching became completely speechless. At least, the members of the Northern Spear Association were aware that Hu Niu was indeed incomparably powerful, but would never have imagined that even a Rabbit was this powerful as well, actually being able to reduce Eighth Elder of the Southern Spear Association to such a pathetic state.

The Rabbit looked at himself from head to toe, sighed in relief, and patted his chest with lingering fear as he spoke, “Ah, scared Lord Rabbit to death. Thankfully, I was not injured!”

This scene caused everyone irritation. Of course you aren’t hurt. The one injured is Eighth Elder! Pity that Eighth Elder, who was actually an elite of the Heaven Tier. How could he be humiliated to such a miserable state in public?

Also, how could a Rabbit open its mouth to speak?

Eighth Elder was so angry that his entire body trembled. WIth a trembling finger, he pointed at Hu Ni. “I... I...” He became short of breath, and almost passed out completely.

It was really humiliating. He was a Heaven Tier elite, yet ended up in such a pitiful state—it was really horrible and despicable!

“You... you what? This Lord Rabbit hasn’t even complained. Old fart, your face was really tough and almost broke this Lord Rabbit’s claws. Can you afford to compensate me?” the Rabbit said as he glared fiercely.

Eighth Elder immediately shifted his hatred onto the Rabbit. This Rabbit was simply bringing his own taunting effect, provoking others the moment it opened its mouth.

“Die!” He flew out with a slap aimed towards the Rabbit.

“Little Ancestor, help!” The Rabbit screamed. It was only in the Deity Transformation Tier, but possessed a powerful bloodline. That was why previously it was able to injure the Eighth Elder by clawing him. But now, how could it be a match for him in a direct confrontation?

The Rabbit ran quickly. With a xiu , it was already hiding behind Hu Niu. He then poked his head out and pointed his claw at the Eighth Elder. “Little Ancestor, hit him!”

Hu Niu rolled up her sleeves. Fighting and such was what she liked the most!

When the Eighth Elder missed his aim and slammed through the air, he turned around at once and directed a punch towards Hu Niu. The punch expelled out an endless brilliance as unmatched formidable martial intent overflowed from it.

In a fit of rage caused by shame, he had no regard of this being within Cold City, and directly bombarded the target with his full strength. At this moment, he strongly desired to annihilate everyone to prevent disclosure of today’s incident so that no one would ever know how he had been humiliated.

Hong , the strike came, and it was incredibly terrifying.

Hu Niu grabbed the Rabbit from behind her back, lifted it, and flung it forward to smash towards the Eighth Elder again.

“F*ck, why is it Lord Rabbit again?!” Rabbit screamed. Peng , the rabbit once again smashed onto the Eighth Elder’s face. It possessed a powerful bloodline and a body different from a normal rabbit’s. Thus, this one smash caused the Eighth Elder to become disoriented and dizzy. However, that was trivial. With ashua, shua, shua , the Rabbit again clawed madly at the Eighth Elder’s face before fleeing away.

“You! You!” Eighth Elder pointed at Hu Niu and the Rabbit, gasping as he unexpectedly ran short of breath. Suddenly, he stumbled and his body fell to the ground.

Members of the Southern Spear Association quickly went up to gather around him. Then, one by one, they cried out in alarm and bore a weird expression.

“The Eighth Elder has passed out!”

In their eyes, a Heaven Tier elite was the world’s most invincible and unmatched existence. And yet, this elite had actually fainted from anger because of a few tricks coming from a little girl and a talking rabbit. Who could accept this?

Everything happened as if this was a dream.

“Kekekeke!” Hu Niu held her sides as she roared with laughter and clapped her hands earnestly. “This is fun, really fun! Hmm, whom will we play with next?” Her gaze swept back and forth between the faces of the Third Elder and Fourth Elder, causing these two old guys to feel tremendous pressure.

They saw Hu Niu’s attack earlier with their own eyes. There was nothing fancy about her attack; it was just very quick. However, it was this speed that made them fearful, and their hearts were thumping rapidly.

Although Old Eighth’s strength was slightly weaker than theirs, the gap in strength between them wasn’t large. Even if it had been them earlier instead, it would have had the same outcome!

Ling Han laughingly said, “Now, is there still anyone who wishes to force me to change my name?”

Members of the Southern Spear Association were all angry, but dared not voice their resentment. The Eighth Elder had been made to faint from anger, while the other two Elders had suddenly became mute, so what more could they say?

“Let’s go!” Ling Han snapped his fingers.

“Let’s go!” Hu Niu hopped forward cheerfully, grabbing Rabbit’s long ears and dragging it along with her.

“Ah, you are abusing animals!” the Rabbit screamed.

Mu Fei Yao looked on with wide eyes and an expression full of surprise. When she’d first seen Ling Han, the strength of the other party was extremely weak; she could kill him with just one finger. Now, she had just stepped into the Flower Blossom Tier, but the other party had grown to a height that she could only look up to.

Thinking of herself being previously spanked by Ling Han, her pretty face couldn’t help but become hot gradually, and her behind also seemed to become a little itchy.

Ling Han returned to the capital of the Purple Moon Empire. This return trip took up almost ten days; Ma Duo Bao should have resolved the totem’s issue, and be about to head into the final battle with the five great sects.

He wouldn’t want to miss such a good show.

Sure enough, when he returned to the palace, a sword’s virtual image could be seen above the palace—the totem. Ling Han could sense that presently, this sword had condensed a considerable amount of the power of the people’s will, enough to suppress Flower Blossom Tier cultivators.

Really amazing—it had only been a few days.

However, the establishment of the Purple Moon Empire was much earlier than that of the Great Ling Empire. Now, it was only to let the people of the nation have a target or object for their belief. Naturally, it was easy to condense the power of the people’s hearts. In a few days, the totem had advanced to a considerable height.

The middle state was already big, and the overall level of martial arts was considerably high. Perhaps it would not take long for this totem to rival the Shattering Void Tier.

“Hoho, my tanned brother, just as I thought, after forming a real nation... with just the middle state alone being so huge, it was almost enough to fill me to bursting point.” Ma Duo Bao sighed.

Ling Han frowned, and said, “Brother Ma, you have re-cultivated the body, but still can’t endure such strong power of the nation?”

“How much power of the nation can be endured is determined by two aspects. One is the level of your own cultivation, and the other is having a tyrannically strong body. When it comes to cultivation tier, I’m already in the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and thus, it’s impossible to advance further. My body has reached Level Ten precious metal’s toughness, but it’s also the limit.” Ma Duo Bao shook his head, appearing somewhat pitiful.

But then, he immediately smiled. “However, compared to the last time, the power of the nation which I could accommodate this time had at least doubled. There should be a 30% chance of success to split open the sky” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Only 30%!

Ling Han was surprised. Firstly, it was because of Ma Duo Bao’s strength, given his battle prowess was definitely more than fifteen Stars. Furthermore, his body had reached Level Ten precious metal’s toughness, which made him practically invincible and without equal in this world.

Having this kind of strength and body, coupled with the power of the nation, the success rate of splitting open the sky was still only 30%—this was astonishing indeed.

What if it was him?

Ling Han thought to himself that as long as his cultivation level could reach the Shattering Void Tier, then his body would be able to reach the level of Divine Metal, and the power of the nation that he could accommodate would far exceed Ma Duo Bao’s.

And his own martial prowess wasn’t any inferior. Comparing the two of them, what would be the rate of success for him to split open the sky?
