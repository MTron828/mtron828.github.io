Chapter 1994: Yang Soul Ocean opens

Ling Han’s eyes couldn’t help but narrow. Ji Wuming had indeed become stronger, and it was not just by a bit, either.

If Ling Han was to clash with the other party now... it was probably his chances of falling into a disadvantage that would be slightly higher.

Only falling into a disadvantage. With the toughness of his physique and his freakish recovery abilities, as long as they continued fighting, then the one who would be laughing last would definitely be Ling Han, and not Ji Wuming.

Yi was slightly startled, and then his golden and silver eyes shone brightly, turning into two tiny suns. His fighting spirit soared high as he charged towards Ji Wuming again. This time, countless blades of air sliced out as he moved his hands.

One hand controlled Time, while the other commanded Space.

Ji Wuming’s expression did not change in the slightest. He was just as calm and unhurried as he had been. He flicked out a finger, sticking to the same move in response to the changed assault.

Boom, one finger suppressed all, and all the air blades were shattered.

“What an impressive power of Divine Fetus, I will accept it.” Ji Wuming gave a battle cry, and finally took the initiative to move as he surged towards Yi.

With his full effort, Yi instantly fell into a disadvantage.

‘What?!’

Everyone felt their hair standing on ends just by watching, numbed by shock.

Everyone had seen clearly just how strong Yi was. He had defeated the two great monarch tiers, Luo Shengyuan and Shi Bin, consecutively, but he had fallen into a disadvantage after exchanging just a few blows with Ji Wuming. With this comparison, Ji Wuming’s freakishness was clearly visible.

“Could it be that it was true that the Madman was defeated by Ji Wuming?”

“...It really is possible, he is too strong!”

“How could there be such a frightening monster in this world?”

Everyone were exclaiming in shock. This had once again revised their perception of prodigies. So there really were some people that could be as strong as this, that even top-grade monarch tiers could only despair in hopelessness.

Only Shu Yarong’s expression was filled with pride. That lord had been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King all those years ago, and to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, how strong could he have been when he had been in the Severing Mundane Tier?

One could very objectively say that though Ling Han and Yi were presently incredibly powerful, and would also become Celestial Kings in the future, it was still a question of what Heaven they could attain in the Celestial King Tier.

It could be Fourth Heaven, Fifth Heaven, Seventh Heaven, or Eighth Heaven, but it was incredibly and extraordinarily difficult to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

It could be said that in his last life, when Ji Wuming had been in the Severing Mundane Tier, he already possessed battle prowess similar to that of Ling Han and Yi. But more importantly, Ji Wuming had chosen to reincarnate and cultivate again from the beginning. With the experience of a Celestial King to again complete the cultivation level of the Severing Mundane Tier, just what kind of heights would he be able to reach?

No one knew, and no one would be able to imagine.

Yi naturally was an unyielding character. The stronger his opponent was, the stronger his toughness would be, and he displayed astonishing battle prowess.

He had fallen into a disadvantage, but if Ji Wuming wanted to truly defeat him, it was not something that could be accomplished in a short while, either.

Hong long long, the Yang Soul Ocean, or rather that small lake, suddenly began to bubble and brew, as if it was water that was close to boiling point. Furthermore, this water had initially been dark blue, but now it was showing a bright myriad of colors.

“The Yang Soul Ocean has opened!” someone suddenly shouted.

This was no secret. At least half the people here had come before, though there were some people that did not break through the last time, and there were others that had not made the breakthrough after two or three tries, and some people had not made the breakthrough even after several hundred or more than 1,000 tries.

Boom!

Ji Wuming and Yi directly brought their battle into the ocean. Even if they had already sunk a few hundred miles deep in an instant, there would still be occasional shock waves rising from battle surging from beneath the water. Even against emperor tiers, they possessed great destructive power.

“Let’s go!” Firstly, Ling Han wanted to continue watching the battle between Ji Wuming and Yi, and secondly, he had also heard Ma Tongguang say that the person who managed to enter first would be able to grain even greater rewards.

With Ling Han pulling the women with him, they entered into the Yang Soul Ocean with a leap.

At their side, Yan Xianlu also took a leap, and behind him was Ma Tongguang. He hesitated slightly before also leaping downwards. Lu Xianming immediately followed suit. He had heard Ma Tongguang’s words as well. The person who entered first into this space could possibly be rewarded with greater gifts from the heaven and earth.

Though it was called an ocean, it was actually pitifully small, but after they swam downwards for almost 1,000 miles, this passage widened.

Ling Han realized that there was no need to use his own power, as an underwater flow was bringing him downwards. If he did not make the effort to resist, his speed would become faster and faster. If a sharp object that was at the level of Three-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal or above suddenly appeared below, then even if the majority of people boosted their defenses to the maximum, they would still be immediately crushed to bits.

He spread out his arms, wrapping around all three women. Naturally, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had long since entered into the Black Tower. She hadn’t even broken through to the Severing Mundane Tier yet, and there was not the slightest bit of meaning in her taking risks here.

Another three days later, splashing sounds were heard, then with a tong, they actually dropped into a great ocean.

This really was a huge ocean, expansive without end, and there was a waterfall above their heads that was presently bringing them in an endless downwards surge.

The entrance to this Yang Soul Ocean was actually a waterfall!

It could not be imagined. A waterfall flowed for millions and millions of miles, and what it connected to was actually an incredibly massive underground space. The heavens were indeed the greatest of creators.

Ling Han and the three women channeled their cultivation techniques, and stepped on the surface of the ocean. However, they could no longer increase the height they were standing at, because once their feet left the water’s surface, a frightening pressure would assault them, forcing them to drop down into the water.

“So this is the Yang Soul Ocean.” Ling Han cast his eyes farther, and saw that a considerable number had already “surfaced”. Stepping on the water, they raced quickly, and vanished completely in an instant.

Both Yi and Ji Wuming had disappeared, and who knew just how far they had taken their battle. Or perhaps they had temporarily called a ceasefire, and both went their separate ways.

In the distant skies, a rainbow hung like a colorful bridge.

No light source could be seen here, yet it was incredibly bright. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

To break through to Yang Soul Tier was actually very simple, and that was to hunt down living creatures in this huge ocean. The marine creatures here would produce an item called Yang Soul Stone, and a divided soul could then be housed in a Yang Soul Stone. When it broke out of the stone, it would have become a Yang Soul.

Yang Soul Stones varied in purity and size. Of course, the larger and purer, the better, and to house one’s divided soul, there were requirements on the size and purity of the Yang Soul Stone. It was not just any random Yang Soul Stone that could be used.

But what if it was not big or pure enough?

It was fine. One could refine it on his own, melding several smaller Yang Soul Stones into a large one, removing the impurities, and turning it into a treasure.

Of course, after refining, it would definitely be inferior to what was naturally formed.

Additionally, the Yang Soul Stones could not leave the Yang Soul Ocean, so don’t even think of having others transporting it for you. Furthermore, even if it was taken out, it would be useless. The “hatching” of the Yang Soul would also need the special environment of the Yang Soul Ocean.

“Come on, let’s start hunting.”

The four of them set out, heading to the deepest depths of the great ocean.

There were marine creatures everywhere, so there was no need to go to any specific location. Thus, it was naturally a very casual affair, and they could go anywhere they wished.

After only a short while, the ocean’s color suddenly changed. At first, it had been dark blue, but now it became purple. Upon closer look, it was not that the ocean waters had changed in color, but rather it was because a large school of fish had come.

These fishes were very strange. They had long noses, looking like those of elephants, and their scales were very thick, just like the hide of a crocodile.

“Niu goes!” Hu Niu charged out. Peng, she shot out a punch, and splashes of water instantly filled the air, while a massive hole appeared on the ocean’s surface.

The fishes were surprised, and they all turned in the opposite direction to swim downwards.

It was only a mere instant, and the purple ocean waters immediately reverted to dark blue. This blow from Hu Niu had actually been completely ineffective.
