Chapter 2140: Bet

This young man’s name was Lin Xuan.

He was the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King’s disciple, and was outstandingly talented. At present, his cultivation level was at First Secret of Immortal Palace Tier, and his battle prowess had reached Third Secret of Immortal Palace Tier. He was a noble, great monarch tier.

This also filled him with brimming confidence, and he dared to court a prodigious woman like An Ran.

When he found out that Shang Zhiwei had the intention to betroth An Ran to Ling Han, he was naturally both furious and anxious.

What right did Ling Han have?

Lin Xuan had courted An Ran for so many years, and who in the entire Four Seas Palace did not know that? If Ling Han were to rob him of his woman, how would he be able to face others in the future? Moreover, it was very possible that An Ran would inherit the position of Imperial Empress, which was also one of the reasons that he definitely could not give up.

A brat that had popped out from who knew where actually dared to try and snatch his woman?

He was seeking death!

Of course, he only dared to just imagine killing Ling Han. This was a person that Shang Zhiwei favored greatly. Otherwise, how could she want to marry An Ran, whom she treated as her own daughter, to him? Thus, he did not dare do anything fatal to Ling Han at all, but just went along with An Ran’s thoughts on expelling Ling Han from Four Seas City. This naturally would be the best of both worlds.

He would have won An Ran’s favor, and at the same time would not anger Shang Zhiwei—expelling Ling Han was An Ran’s idea.

An Ran was disdainful of Ling Han, and hearing Lin Xuan speak, she nodded. Ling Han was merely an Earth Soul, and should either herself or Lin Xuan move, they would be able to deal with him in a couple of moves.

“You could have escaped unscathed,” Lin Xuan said. He strode forwards. “But since you are so determined to seek your own humiliation, you can’t blame anyone for it, either.”

Without waiting for Ling Han to answer at all, he stretched out his hand to grab out at Ling Han.

“Young Master Lin, please be lenient.” A black figure flashed past, stepping in front of Ling Han, and allowing Lin Xuan’s palm strike to approach. When it landed on his body, Lin Xuan’s whole palm was embedded into his body.

That was Manager Chen. Though Lin Xuan’s whole hand had sunk into his chest, he seemed to have not realized this fact at all. There was no change to his tone of voice, either.

Ling Han had seen very clearly that Manager Chen’s chest had turned into sand, and when this palm strike from Lin Xuan landed, it had not hit anything solid, so it was naturally impossible that it would cause any kind of damage.

This old geezer was definitely an Ascending Origin Tier!

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King might not be able to lift someone else directly to the Celestial King Tier, but it should be no problem for the Ascending Origin Tier. With how much Shang Zhiwei trusted Manager Chen, even if he was just at first severance, or second severance, she would still be able to forcefully boost his cultivation level to the Ascending Origin Tier.

Lin Xuan frowned, and asked, “Elder Chen, why are you stopping me?”

There was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King backing Lin Xuan up, and he originally should not have to be so respectful towards an Ascending Origin Tier, and could directly address him by name. However, the person backing Manager Chen was Shang Zhiwei, and he was very much trusted by her. With this, Lin Xuan could only be extremely polite.

To say nothing of him, even if the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King was here, he would at the very least not simply issue commands to Manager Chen.

Manager Chen chuckled. “Young Master Ling is an honored guest of our Four Seas Palace, and thus I have the duty of protecting our honored guest, so please forgive me, Young Master Lin.”

Lin Xuan was immediately speechless. The other party had used major principles to suppress him, so how was he supposed to refute?

“Now it is a personal matter between me and him!” An Ran was not willing to give in. “Elder Chen, please do not interfere.”

“Young Miss, please do not make things difficult for me, either.” Manager Chen showed a troubled expression. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Naturally, it was impossible that An Ran would cross over Manager Chen and make a move on Ling Han. Thus, she only looked at Ling Han, and said, “When a man acts, he dares to take responsibility for his actions. To have another step up for you, do you not feel ashamed?”

Ling Han scratched his head, his expression simple and honest. “You are an Immortal Palace Tier, and I am only a Dividing Soul Tier. How am I supposed to fight you?”

“As long as you can parry a blow from me, I will temporarily allow you to stay here,” An Ran declared proudly. This naturally was not letting Ling Han off easy, but rather that she intended to seriously injure Ling Han with this strike, or even kill him.

Afterwards, even if she would be reprimanded by Shang Zhiwei, the latter would have nothing to say. In any case, with how much An Ran was doted on, worse came to worst, she would be pelted with a harsh scolding, but for her to resign herself and marry Ling Han was an absolute impossibility.

“One strike!” Ling Han hurriedly pretended to shake his head. “The gap between the Dividing Soul Tier and Immortal Palace Tier is really too wide. To say nothing that you are a First Secret monarch tier, even if you were an ordinary First Secret, I would still be killed by one strike from you.”

This brat was not stupid, Lin Xuan thought from the sidelines. Unfortunately, he was really too greedy, or he should have known that An Ran was definitely someone way beyond his station.

The difference in strength between the Immortal Palace Tier and Dividing Soul Tier was like the difference between heaven and earth, and that was the same for their status.

Perhaps Ling Han would only be capable of remaining in the Dividing Soul Tier for his whole life? But An Ran would at least be capable of becoming a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, or could possibly even inherit Shang Zhiwei’s legacy, and become the strongest Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the Celestial Realm.

…Lin Xuan did not know that there was still the Heavenly Venerable Tier above Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier. Only a very limited number of people knew this kind of secret.

“Even if you are outmatched, I still won’t kill you!” An Ran said deliberately. Her aim was to coerce Ling Han into agreeing. “Are you even a man?”

Ling Han purposely displayed an expression of anger. “Who says I am not a man?”

“Then, come and parry a strike from me!”

“Fine!” It seemed like Ling Han could no longer tolerate being spurred on, and agreed.

Lin Xuan immediately showed a disdainful expression. What an idiot, to completely lose his wits just with a few words. This kind of person was not worthy of his serious regard at all. He just had to scheme a little, and he would be able to easily get him killed.

Meanwhile, Manager Chen was shocked. With how Ling Han had behaved yesterday, he was clearly a calm, steady person. How could he have been so easily angered?

There was something off.

“However!” Ling Han dragged out the word. “I am no idiot. Why should I allow you to hit me when there is no benefit? Unless you agree that if I can parry a strike from you, you will give me a few Celestial medicines!”

‘A few Celestial medicines? Brat, you are really demanding an exorbitant price. Who do you think you are? Taking a hit, and that is worth a few Celestial medicines?’

“No problem!” An Ran agreed without the slightest hesitation.

She was naturally being so straightforward because her killing intent was already spurred. She intended to kill Ling Han. Thus, no matter what kind of harsh conditions the latter demanded, so what?

Ling Han was not so easily dismissed. He stretched out his hand. “Then, we’ll make this bet. Take out the stakes of the bet. I fear you would renege on the bet!”

“Do you think I would renege on our bet?” An Ran was infuriated. She was the Holy Daughter of the Four Seas Palace and also the most favored disciple of Shang Zhiwei. Her word was as good as gold, so how could she possibly break her word?

“In any case, if you don’t take out the Celestial medicines, I am not going to play.” Ling Han’s attitude was determined.

“Fine!” An Ran finally nodded. Spreading open her right hand, three Celestial medicines lay in her palm.

“7,000,000 years, 30,000,000 years plus, and 200,050,000,000 years.” Ling Han swept a glance over, and couldn’t help but shake his head continuously. “I say, do you think you are fooling a beggar here? Celestial medicines of this age cannot even be considered preliminary quality!”

An Ran was involuntarily surprised. She had not thought that Ling Han’s eyes were so sharp. He had just swept an eye over them, and he had completely clearly distinguished the age of the three Celestial medicines. She gave Ling Han a second look, a feeling of alertness rising up in her heart. ‘It can’t be that this brat is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, right?’

But upon further thought, she shook her head inwardly. No matter what, there was absolutely no way that a Dividing Soul Tier could match an Immortal Palace Tier, even if it was just parrying a strike.

Moreover, she was a First Secret monarch tier, her battle prowess directly soaring to the height of Third Secret. No matter how heaven-defying Ling Han was, it was useless. He would definitely be killed instantly with a strike.

With another wave of her hand, three new Celestial medicines appeared in her hand.
