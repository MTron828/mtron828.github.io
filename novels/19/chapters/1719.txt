Chapter 1720: Huge Destruction

Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The members of the Ding Clan almost suffered a heart attack upon hearing Ling Han’s words.

‘Are you f*cking crazy? Do you know who this old man is?

‘Before a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder, is there any room for you to speak?’

Before Han Lu could explode in rage, Ding Song hurriedly said, “Please forgive him, elder. This is a junior from our clan, and he’s never witnessed the world. Please don’t take his words to heart.”

Today’s ceremony was to accept Ling Han into the Ding Clan, so Ding Song was subconsciously starting to view Ling Han as a member of the Ding Clan already.

Han Lu glanced over with a hint of anger on his face. However, he didn’t erupt in rage. Although the Ding Clan was insignificant in his eyes, it was still a subordinate of the Fu Clan, after all. He could put pressure on them, but if he wantonly killed people, that would be equivalent to attacking the Fu Clan’s face. Thus, he needed to be careful.

Of course, he could also choose to forcefully kill people. Who told Ling Han to offend a fourth severance grand elder in the first place?

Most importantly, Han Lu wanted to kill that large black dog. That dog had actually dared to bite his bum! How could he accept this?!

However, the large black dog was indeed extraordinary. He was only at the Genesis Tier, yet he had actually managed to bite the bum of a fourth severance grand elder! Moreover, he had retreated without a single wound. This was an absolute miracle!

“These two elders, how can we resolve this matter just like this?” Ling Han said with an expression of righteousness. “Moreover, Elder Hu has also been severely wounded, so how can we tolerate this? This is the ancestral shrine of our Ding Clan! Yet, this old geezer actually dared to commit violence here without showing any respect toward our Ding Clan! If we don’t punish him, what face will the Ding Clan have?”

Ding Song, Ding Shan, and Ding Hu all went pale upon hearing this. Ling Han was pushing the Ding Clan into a pit of death!

Sure enough, an expression of fury spread across Han Lu’s face. This measly Genesis Tier cultivator dared to humiliate him? He was seeking death!

“I-it was you!” the youth who was being held in Han Lu’s hands suddenly said. He stared at Ling Han with an expression of rage.

He was none other than Han Qi. After being obliterated, he had surprisingly used some mysterious method to nurture a new body. Moreover, this body was definitely of the same bloodline as his. Otherwise, the affinity between them wouldn’t be so high.

Sure enough, Immortal Palace Tier forces were truly powerful and impressive.

Ling Han glanced at him, and said, “The adults are speaking, so why are you interjecting?! Old geezer, hurry up and kneel to beg for forgiveness!”

However, Han Lu looked toward Han Qi, and asked, “Qi’er, what’s wrong?”

As the pampered son of the ancestor of the Han Clan, the status of Han Qi was far too high. Otherwise, how could Han Lu personally accompany him around?

He was a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder, so his status would be extremely high no matter where he went in the Celestial Realm.

Han Qi’s entire body was trembling. This was out of anger. After so many years, he had finally found the perpetrator who had attacked him! His face was full of killing intent as he used his divine sense to communicate with Han Qi.

Han Lu was also enraged upon hearing his words.

‘Good one, Ding Clan! And you dared to say that the criminal in the Ancient Realm had nothing to do with you? Then who’s this?! How courageous of you! The last few times I asked, you even patted your chests and said that there was no such person! And I almost believed you people!’

Han Lu’s expression suddenly became calm. He suppressed his anger and asked Ding Song and the others, “This is a disciple of the Ding Clan, am I correct?”

Just then, he had heard Ding Song refer to this person as a junior of their clan. However, he still needed to confirm this before he flared up in rage.

“Elder Han, it’s our fault for not teaching him properly. We’re truly sorry for this,” Ding Song hurriedly said. In his eyes, apologizing was definitely the way to go at this moment. He didn’t consider anything else.

‘Heh, so you’re admitting it now!’

“Ding Clan, how audacious of you!!” Han Lu suddenly roared.

Boom!

His voice transformed into a wave that surged into the surroundings.

At this moment, there was nothing he needed to fear.

So what if this was a subordinate force of the Fu Clan? A member of their Han Clan had already had their physical body obliterated, so how could they not exact revenge? In fact, the Fu Clan definitely wouldn’t interfere even if he destroyed the entire Ding Clan. After all, how could a three-star force be provoked by a one-star force?

Peng, peng, peng!

Just how powerful was a fourth severance grand elder? Under the powerful attack of his soundwave, one-third of the ancestral shrine was directly reduced to rubble. Meanwhile, the juniors of the Ding Clan all vomited blood as they collapsed. There were countless deaths and injuries.

“E-Elder Han!” Ding Shan and the others roared. To the Ding Clan, this amount of damage was far too great.

“Humph, I’m going to destroy the Ding Clan today!” Han Lu was merciless, yet he didn’t target Ling Han. He would execute this criminal after dragging him to Nine Underworlds City.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was also glad to watch this brilliant spectacle. After cooking up such a grand plan, and after acting for so long, it was finally time to reap the rewards.

This felt incredible!

Ding Shan and the others resisted with all their might, yet how could third severance grand elders rival the power of a fourth severance grand elder? They would need at least several hundred other third severance grand elders to surmount the gulf between their cultivation levels. This was not to mention that Ding Hu was only a first severance grand elder.

Ding Shan and Ding Song vomited blood each time that Han Lu attacked them. Meanwhile, Ding Hu didn’t dare to face his attacks at all. If he were hit by Han Lu’s attacks, he would definitely die on the spot!

The Ding Clan had genuinely been screwed over.

A Severing Mundane Tier battle had erupted inside their clan territory, so just how much destruction was it going to cause?

Most importantly, this was the ancestral shrine of their Ding Clan! This was where the memorial tablets and remains of their ancestors were placed! After a few attacks, however, all of the memorial tablets naturally collapsed.

Ling Han had absolutely no sympathy for them. In the past, the Ding Clan had committed innumerable crimes to steal the Hu Clan’s celestial technique. In fact, they had even sought help from a Celestial King Tier force and directly erased the Hu Clan. Just how sinful was this crime? Even though they were dead, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t allow them to be peacefully worshipped. They deserved to be condemned for all eternity.

The Ding Clan was filled with an atmosphere of grief and indignance. This Han Lu was far too domineering! He even dared to destroy the memorial tablets of their ancestors! Moreover, he had actually wounded and killed so many people!

Of course, they still hated Ling Han the most. After all, if it weren’t for Ling Han’s words, would Han Lu have erupted in such furious rage?

They naturally believed that this was because Ling Han had provoked Han Lu just then. How could they know that there was actually a deeper reason?

Ding Hu found an opportunity to break free, and he immediately charged at Ling Han.

He was going to capture this brat and ask for punishment from Han Lu!

Everything was Ling Han’s fault! The Ding Clan was innocent! Indeed, Ling Han hadn’t even worshipped the ancestors of the Ding Clan yet, so he couldn’t be regarded as a true member of the Ding Clan! They couldn’t be dragged down because of Ling Han.

“Evil brat, I knew that nothing good could happen with you around!” Ding Hu’s eyes were red with grief and rage, yet he knew that they definitely had to swallow this painful consequence. After all, did they dare to seek compensation from the Han Clan? Thus, they could only kill Ling Han to ease their anger.

If he knew that this was all part of Ling Han’s plans, perhaps he would directly die from uncontrollable anger.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Old bastard, I’ve been enduring you for a long time! Come and attack me!”

Peng!

Ding Hu launched a strike, and Ling Han was instantly sent flying. However, Ling Han surprisingly didn’t shatter into pieces of broken flesh. Instead, he appeared completely unscathed.

His physique was far too powerful at this moment, so much so that even first severance grand elders wouldn’t be able to kill him with raw power alone. They could only use the power of Regulations to slowly refine him.

‘Continue your performance, continue!’

Han Lu smiled coldly upon seeing these scenes. How easy was it for a first severance grand elder to kill a Genesis Tier cultivator? Yet, Ding Hu’s attack hadn’t even forced Ling Han to spit blood. Their acting skills were far too inferior!

“Brother Han, you’ve taken things too far,” a voice suddenly said with a sigh. Ding Yaolong finally appeared.

If he still didn’t appear, then the Ding Clan would genuinely be done for.
