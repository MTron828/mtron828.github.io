Chapter 1066: Nine Demons Sword

“That’s not right!” The Nine Flames Heavenly King immediately shook his head. “Even if it was a Spatial God Tool, it could not possibly disappear completely. A Spatial God Tool would still have form! Yi, what kind of secret technique could this be?

“Who exactly is this man?”

He mumbled, “The Nine Demons Sword is extremely important, and absolutely no slip-ups are allowed. Moreover, things have already progressed to this point, and the day of collecting the treasure is close at hand. We must definitely not allow anyone to ruin things!

“Could it be that there has been an information leak that has attracted the attention of other elites?

“But with how strong our empire is, aside form the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire and the Jade Drop Majestic Empire, who else would be qualified to covet what belongs to us?

“If it was the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, they should have sent their huge armies by now, and they would not have possibly mobilized just a mere Mountain River Tier cultivator!

“Strange! I can’t figure it out!

“However, the blood sacrifices is almost concluded. Tomorrow, Imperial Brother will arrive, and personally collect the Nine Demons Sword. As long as we can last through this one day, with the Nine Demons Sword in hand, whom do we need to fear?”

He no longer pondered whilst mumbling to himself. He swept a glance over the gathered crowd, and commanded, “Continue the blood sacrifices. There is to be no further slip-ups!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Yes, My Lord!”

With the Nine Flames Heavenly King standing guard here, the blood sacrifices continued. By now, who else would be able to escape?

“F*ck!”

Ling Han was also rendered speechless. If there were merely elites of the Sun Moon Tier here, he could still think of a way to escape, but if he actually exited the Black Tower rashly with a supreme elite who was in the Heavenly Body Tier, or even high extreme, standing guard here—who, furthermore, had obviously become suspicious—he would definitely be subdued at the first opportunity.

...One definitely could not doubt the abilities of an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier.

“Let’s give it a try.” Ling Han tossed out one of the bodies of the guards.

Shua, the Nine Flames Heavenly King immediately appeared, his eyes fixed on the dead body as if flowers would be blooming from it any time soon.

True enough, this guy’s divine sense had enveloped the whole altar. The moment there was anything the slightest bit off, he would immediately react.

“Hehe, little guy, until when do you plan to hide?” The Nine Flames Heavenly King laughed. “I don’t know what secret technique you’ve used to hide your existence, but you are merely in the Mountain River Tier, so how could you possibly hide yourself completely in front of me?”

He paused for a moment, and then continued, “I’ll give you a chance. Appear on your own, and I can spare your life. There might even be a chance for me to take you in as my battle servant.”

For elites like him, taking others in as battle servants was definitely not a humiliation, but rather a supreme honor.

Ordinarily, only elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier would be thus qualified. Furthermore, they would have to incredibly talented, and qualified to attempt breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier.

Ling Han was naturally not going to acknowledge him with an answer.

A sliver of rage appeared in the Nine Flames Heavenly King’s expression, and he coldly exclaimed, “Since you will only submit to pressure after refusing a polite request, I shall do as you wish!”

Boom!

The nine flames behind him suddenly became denser, and formed a divine flame, causing the surrounding area to start burning. The stone slabs very quickly were heated burning red, and were beginning to melt.

However, no one appeared.

The Nine Flames Heavenly King couldn’t help but be stunned. It had to be known that from the moment sound was heard until the moment he appeared, there was not even time for one hundredth of a heartbeat. He was sure that it was definitely impossible that the man had fled. He had to have used some kind of secret technique to hide himself nearby.

But under the burning fire of his Nine Flames, no one actually appeared?

This was inconceivable!

Even if the man was in the Heavenly Body Tier, under the burning of his Nine Flames, he would still have to channel his Origin Power to fully resist them. Otherwise, that would definitely be seeking death. But, as long as he defended himself, there would definitely be a vibration of Origin Power, and he would find out immediately.

Had he seen a ghost or something?

The corpse had definitely been thrown out of a Spatial Spirit Tool! Hold on, he searched closely. Yet, no matter what, he did not find anything that looked like a Spatial God Tool. Although he had never seen this kind of ultimate treasure, he thought that it was more or less like a Spatial Spirit Tool, and took the form of a ring, necklace, jade bottle, or something of the like.

But here, there was not even a single pebble.

The Nine Flames Heavenly King felt like he was about to go mad. In his whole life, he had fought both minor skirmishes and huge wars, and had also entered various dangerous ancient sites. All his abilities were completely earned through harsh training and experience, but now, this situation caused him to be completely at a loss.

“Humph, but at least I have proved one point. This man’s abilities are indeed low, and he had not just disguised himself as Mountain River Tier. This is why he dares not exchange blows with me, and does not even dare to show his face. He, too, knows that the moment he appeared, I would easily subdue him.

“Then, no matter what, when Imperial Brother comes tomorrow, and collects the Nine Demons Sword, even if we announce the secret of this place to the whole world, what of it?

“We are destined to be invincible!”

He seemed to intentionally let Ling Han hear his words. These words he spoke to himself were not spoken lowly, and he had not used his Origin Power to purposely suppress his voice. Otherwise, those with low abilities obviously could hear the sound, yet would not be able to distinguish a single word.

The Nine Demons Sword?

Ling Han was stunned. Was this the treasure they were conspiring to gain?

He asked the Asura Demon Emperor, and the Asura Demon Emperor naturally could only shake his head in response. He was not one of this realm in the first place. On the other hand, when he told this to the small dog, he began to bark loudly in reply, appearing to be very excited.

“You know of it?” Ling Han was slightly surprised. He had not imagined that even a dog would know.

“I know! I know!” The small dog looked like it was incredibly astonished.

“Then why don’t you quickly tell us!” The Asura Demon Emperor showed a malevolent expression. He really hated this dog too much. That he was actually of the same family as this dog[1] caused him to feel odd when he was trying to act cute and gain Ling Han’s favor.

The small dog quickly fled behind Ling Han, and used its small paw to point at the Asura Demon Emperor, saying, “Big Brother, he’s acting fierce towards me!”

The Asura Demon Emperor was so infuriated he yelled. ‘I address Ling Han “master”, yet you call him “big brother”. Isn’t this taking advantage of me?’

Ling Han smiled. Why were there so many undependable people by his side?

He sat cross-legged, and said, “Don’t keep us in suspense any longer. Tell us about the Nine Demons Sword.”

“All right!” The small dog dared not go against Ling Han. After sorting out his emotions, he said, “According to an ancient legend, in the ancient era of the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, possibly a considerable number of billions of years ago, there had once appeared a supreme elite. He forged himself a Divine Sword, and that was the Nine Demons Sword.

“It is said that this elite from the Chang Clan wielding the Nine Demons Sword swept through the whole world, and was known to be invincible.

“However, an elite from outside our planet arrived at this place later, and a huge war erupted between the elite from the Chang Clan and the former. As a result, the elite from the Chang Clan should have lost, and there was no sign of the Nine Demons Sword from that moment on.

“It is said that this Nine Demons Sword is a God Tool on the level of the Eternal River Tier!”

Pu!

The Asura Demon Emperor suddenly choked. To him, the Sun Moon Tier was already an existence far above him, while the Heavenly Body Tier was invincible. Now that a God Tool on the level of the Eternal River Tier had appeared, how could it not astound him?

Yet Ling Han was more curious about the origins of this small dog, and said, “You know quite a lot.”

“Hehe, though my clan is not all that powerful, we love to collect information about the huge matters through the generations, what more when it is something as huge as this,” the small dog said. “Unfortunately, I am still too young, so the information I have access to is quite limited.”

Tsk, he was still a knowledgeable dog.

Ling Han guessed, “The Chang Clan should have lost the Nine Demons Sword. However, after countless years of searching, they finally discovered the location of the Nine Demons Sword. But because the Nine Demons Sword is on the level of the Eternal River Tier, and is a Level Thirteen God Tool at least, they were unable to recover it immediately. They have to use the method of blood sacrifice to wear away at the air of violence on it first.”
