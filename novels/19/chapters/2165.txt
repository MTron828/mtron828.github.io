Chapter 2166: Scared away

Jing Kebing’s first reaction was that these people were joking around, but the problem here was that he actually knew some of them. They were all the clan elders of the Cheng Clan. The last time he paid a visit to the Cheng Clan, these people had been the reception party.

And aside from one of them, all the others were Severing Mundane Tiers.

‘Are you guys playing house here? What’s so fun about having a large group of people deliberately having a rock pressing down on them and groaning there?’

The clan leader of the Cheng Clan had also followed him in, and his expression involuntarily changed dramatically.

He had thought of countless possibilities, but the only thing he had not imagined was a scene like this.

Th-th-th-this, just what kind of elite was hidden in this valley, actually being capable of forcing Cheng Wuya and the others to this extent?

Furthermore, these rocks were extremely ordinary at a glance, but why were they able to suppress these Severing Mundane Tier grand elders to the point that they could only moan, and could not get back up?

“Hehe, Brother Cheng, you seem to owe me an explanation!” Jing Kebing was not the slightest bit stupid. Otherwise, how could he have possibly become a Dividing Soul Tier, and he would not have possibly become the leader of his clan, either.

He could tell there was something off about this at first glance. It was not like what the Cheng Clan clan leader had told him, about how they refrained from using force in view of their relations.

…Were these Severing Mundane Tiers all incompetent?

The clan leader of the Cheng Clan stated solemnly, “Brother Jing, there is possibly a great enemy within the valley, so we must not be careless.”

‘F*** you!’

Jing Kebing cursed internally. Originally, this was something that had absolutely nothing to do with him, and the reason he had wanted to ally with the Cheng Clan through marriage was so that he could pull the Cheng Clan onto their side so they could unite against the Liu Clan.

A second Dividing Soul Tier had emerged from the Liu Clan, and the Liu and Jing Clan had been feuding for generations. If the Liu Clan prospered, it would mean death for the Jing Clan. If they did not seek external help, they would only be waiting for their demise.

But they hadn’t even gotten their external help yet, and he had to first deal with a person or force that he was not familiar with, so how could he not feel anger?

However, the threat of the Liu Clan was genuine, and the Jing Clan definitely had to obtain the assistance of the Cheng Clan.

Fine, he could only help them.

“Who is in charge in this valley? Please present yourself for a meeting,” the clan leader of the Cheng Clan called out loudly.

“Cheng Rong, you ungrateful traitor, you actually still have the face to come and see me?” Ling Dongxing’s voice rang out. He strode out, his face bearing an expression of great fury. His daughter had actually been divorced, which naturally caused him, her father, to feel uncontrollable fury, and he wanted nothing more than to kill all the members of the Cheng Clan.

Cheng Rong was the clan leader of the Cheng Clan, and hearing Ling Dongxing address him directly by name, he couldn’t help but show an expression of anger.

In the past, Ling Dongxing was worthy of being friends with him because there was a Roc Palace backing the Ling Clan up, but now the Roc Palace itself had become history, and Ling Dongxing still wanted to act as his equal?

He was only a mere Genesis Tier, and was even worth less than nothing in the Celestial Realm! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hahahaha!” Jing Kebing laughed loudly. “What a great joke. A mere Genesis Tier actually dares to be outrageously brazen! Brother Cheng, you are really allowing others to trample on your dignity.”

“Lord Cheng, why don’t you allow me to act, and suppress this man who does not know what is good for him?” Jing Dong said proudly, and felt that the Cheng Clan was really too stupid and cowardly, actually letting a Genesis Tier strut around in front of Dividing Soul Tiers like this.

Cheng Rong’s expression was livid. He had internal reservations. Ling Dongxing naturally could not possibly subdue seven great Severing Mundane Tier grand elders. There had to be another mysterious elite in this valley. As long as the latter did not appear, he could not rest assured.

The unknown was the most terrifying.

“Humph, haven’t you played around enough?” He moved, and grabbed at the rocks on the eight people sprawled out on the ground.

With him controlling his Origin Power, it turned into eight giant hands. Each massive hand held onto a rock, wanting to lift them, but his expression immediately changed in shock because the weight of these rocks had far surpassed his expectations.

He could only lift them the slightest bit.

Cheng Yuan hurriedly withdrew the other seven gigantic hands. Eight streaks of Origin Power combined into one, and he used all his effort to lift a single rock.

Ka, ka, ka.?The rock moved slightly, but it was very negligible.

At this, Jing Kebing’s expression changed drastically as well. Quickly, he shouted at Jing Dong, “Let’s go!”

Jing Dong did not know what was good for him. Wasn’t it just a mere Genesis Tier? What need was there for him to feel any reservations? He was going to argue, and said, “Lord Clan leader—”

“Shut up, and follow me!” Jing Kebing moved directly, grabbing Jing Dong, then soared into the skies, and fled.

After leaving the valley, he breathed a sigh of relief internally, and hurriedly increased his speed.

No one had come out in pursuit of them; that was good.

“Brother Jing! Brother Jing!” Cheng Rong shouted loudly, but Jing Kebing was only running even faster.

Cheng Wuya and the others were all pale. At first, they had thought that now that Cheng Rong had come, he would immediately be able to save them from this torture, but the fact was that Cheng Rong actually almost collapsed in weariness just from moving a single rock the slightest bit. What kind of gap in power was this?

It should be known that Ling Han had only leisurely moved several rocks over. He had not cast any kind of formation on them, or refined them for several days and nights before doing so.

Their bodies were all trembling. They were completely unable to imagine Ling Han’s true strength.

Cheng Rong’s eyes flickered, and he suddenly turned around and fled.

This valley had a supreme elite, and it was definitely no one he could stand against.

Xiu, his figure flickered, and just when it looked like he was about to run out of the valley, his sight blurred, and he returned to his original spot.

What was going on here? Was there some kind of formation here?

Cheng Wuya and the others were also incredibly astonished. It was one thing for them to be endlessly lost, but why was it the same for Cheng Rong as well?

After a few consecutive attempts, Cheng Rong knew that it was impossible for him to escape, and thus stood still. His eyes turned towards Ling Dongxing, a twisted expression on his face. He was going to capture this person, and perhaps he could use him as a hostage. In that case, he might be able to escape.

He suddenly pounced towards Ling Dongxing, and then stretched out his hand, grabbing at Ling Dongxing’s neck.

Just when it looked like he was about to grasp his neck, he felt his sight blur, and he once again returned to his original spot.

He was internally shocked, and knew that with that elite here, there was absolutely no possibility that he could capture Ling Dongxing.

“Brother Ling!” He turned to look at Ling Dongxing again, and became extremely polite. “No matter the case, we are still in-laws, so we should help each other, and endure difficult times together.”

“Endure your sister!” Ling Dongxing waved a fist, and delivered a punch straight at him.

Peng!

Cheng Rong wanted to dodge, but he immediately discovered that his body was completely restrained. It was difficult for him to even raise a finger. Thus, this fist landed solidly on him, and sent him flying upwards.

Ling Dongxing did not let him off now that he had the advantage, and shot forth again, thrashing him madly.

Cheng Rong howled in pain. The power in his body had been sealed off without his awareness, and he could only use his own physique to take the attacks head-on. However, he was not one who focused on cultivating the physique. As a mere Dividing Soul Tier, he could only cultivate his physique to an extent that was slightly superior to the Genesis Tier, so it would not reach the point that he would be killed by a Genesis Tier, but it would still be extremely painful.

Peng, peng, peng.?Ling Dongxing vented all his fury, endlessly barraging Cheng Rong with blows, and causing Cheng Rong to yell continuously in pain. At the same time, the latter was also extremely furious. As a powerful Dividing Soul Tier, he was actually beaten so harshly by a Genesis Tier. This was a great humiliation to him.

But now, his only thought was how to resolve this crisis.

If that mysterious elite had really wanted to kill him, there would have been no need to go to so much trouble, right?

Thus, since he was suffering such physical pain, he was sure that his life would definitely not be at risk.

After beating Cheng Rong for about an hour, Ling Dongxing finally stopped. He had just about vented enough of his fury.

“Where is Cheng Yifeng?” Ling Dongxing asked. Beating Cheng Rong up was only to vent his anger. What was the most important was still to solve the problem of his daughter’s marriage. He could not allow his daughter to become a widow or something of the like, after all.

“At the Cheng Clan,” Cheng Rong hurriedly answered. All this had begun because of Cheng Yifeng, and it clearly could only be ended by him.
