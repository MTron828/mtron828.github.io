2982 Clash of Seventh Tiers

After arriving at their destination, Ling Han and the others went their separate ways.

They were all people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess. Which of them wasn’t proud and arrogant? How could they be willing to bask in the glory of others?

Ling Han headed downwards.

Peng, peng, peng! He charged all the way to the ninth level in a single breath.

Before this, this had been his limit, but now he had easily reached the 10th level. However, this place had long since been mined dry by those Sixth Tiers all those years ago, leaving behind only a stretch of barren land.

Ling Han continued onwards. The fundamental particles were burning furiously, turning into terrifying flames.

Thankfully, this was not deliberately done by a Seventh Tier ultimate elite. The various particles were independent of each other, and while the flame’s might was great, it was only much stronger than Sixth Tier. It had not reached the level of the Seventh Tier, but was rather in between the two cultivation levels.

Thus, Ling Han only expended a little effort, and squeezed his way into the dimension of the 11th level.

This place… He had never been here before, but just as Zhou Heng had said, he was really disappointed.

It had been mined before, and endless energy storms gushed out of the mineshafts, turning this place into hell.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “And they call themselves Seventh Tier, really, they don’t have the slightest bit of taste.” This place had really been completely dug up. He sensed for a while, and found that it was all abandoned scraps of stone, and there was not a single thing that could be used.

Not only that, but this place had also suffered great damage, leaving behind multiple crevasses. It was not at all like the upper levels, where it was the mining that had created pits to dig out the Heavenly Venerable Stones inside.

True, how could a Seventh Tier have so much time?

This should also be because it was only after the Flaming Frost Realm had fallen that the ultimate elites had found the time to enter here to mine. Otherwise, even if they had sent out a doppelganger, it would have been useless. They would not have been able to arrive here at all.

“Let’s go to the next level.”

Ling Han broke through the ground, and headed towards the dimension of the 12th level.

The fundamental particles here were compressed, and the friction became even stronger. Even Ling Han had to strengthen his defenses a bit to be able to pass through.

However, what disappointed him was the fact that this place was also completely empty from the excavation.

Just think, since the Flaming Frost Realm had fallen, how many hundreds of millions of years had it been? Just how powerful were Seventh Tiers? Was it not easy to hollow out a dimension? Moreover, the further down they went, the smaller the dimension, so their speed was naturally faster with each level down. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Han was not discouraged, and continued downwards.

The pressure was increasing, and the flames formed by the fundamental particles were also becoming more and more frightening, causing even Ling Han to become worried. If he went a few levels further, would he be able to withstand it? After all, he was not a real Seventh Tier, and his physique was not invincible.

‘Fine, let’s go to the 14th level.’

And just like that, right as Ling Han arrived at the 23rd level, he finally discovered that this was a world that had not been fully excavated.

‘Let’s get to work.’

Ling Han released his divine sense to search for treasures.

His strength had improved further, and was practically the top in the world. Needless to say, the strength of his divine sense had also increased. The speed of his search was extremely fast. Half a day later, he stretched out his hand and grabbed, and the power took the form of a giant hand. Peng, peng, peng, it blasted through the ground, and then grabbed a Great Herb.

Green.

Without another word, Ling Han directly swallowed it.

For his present strength, the increase in cultivation level brought by a green Great Herb was no longer obvious, but no matter how small a mosquito’s leg was, it was still meat.

After another half a day, Ling Han stretched out his hand again. Peng, bits of rock flew in all directions. This time, he obtained a Heavenly Venerable Seal.

A sixth-grade seal, one that he did not possess yet.

Ling Han nodded. When his cultivation level reached the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, he would go into seclusion for a long time, and deduce all the sixth-grade seals

…Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates all had several dozen first-grade seals, and they could form combination seals at that, which filled him with a strong sense of danger and vigilance.

However, with the restrictions of the cultivation level, it was too difficult for him to deduce first-grade seals now. It was more reliable to start from the sixth-grade seals. Furthermore, after he deduced all of them, their might would also be very strong.

Time passed quietly. Ling Han had gained quite a lot, but they were basically all green Great Herbs and below in grade. They were of limited help to him, and in the case of Heavenly Venerable Seals, there were only a total of six, and he already possessed two of these six.

Three years passed, and Ling Han was still exploring veins of ore and collecting treasures every day. He had long since left the area where he had entered previously, and who knew where he had gone.

On this day, he discovered another Great Herb. Boom, a large hand stretched out.

But when his large hand grabbed onto that Great Herb, a powerful force also assailed. Boom, this force hit his hand, and the shock wave almost caused his large hand to shatter. After all, it was condensed from power, so its toughness was limited. However, the Great Herb in his hand was shattered into pieces.

The power of the Seventh Tier was too strong.

Ling Han’s expression faltered for a moment before becoming furious.

F***, he had finally found a Great Herb with great difficulty. Who was it that had ruined his plans?

Weng, a powerful aura also surged over. Clearly, the other party was also very angry, and thought that it was Ling Han who had snatched something from him.

Ling Han’s figure flew up, and streaked towards that person. Judging by the aura that the person exuded, this was not a Seventh Tier ultimate elite.

“Xin Qihu!” Ling Han soon spotted his opponent. It was his old rival who had repeatedly wanted to kill him.

No wonder he had sensed that the person’s aura didn’t reach Seventh Tier, yet he could still come here.

Xin Qihu laughed loudly. “Ling Han, we meet again!”

Ling Han wore a baleful expression as he asked, “How do you want to die?”

Ling Han was filled with fury for Xin Qihu. This guy was jealous of him, but Ling Han did not take it to heart. However, Xin Qihu would always use his public office to avenge his personal grudges. This was going too far. ‘If you can, then come out in the open. In a battle of equal cultivation level, let’s see who is more impressive.’

“You still can’t kill me!” Xin Qihu said with a smile. He crooked a finger at Ling Han. “Since you want to fight, fine, I’ll play with you.”

“Play your sister!” Ling Han charged out, and Fists of Fury was already used.

Xin Qihu’s expression was slightly ugly. He really had a sister, and Ling Han wanted to play around with his sister?

‘F*ck!’

He was also enraged, brandishing his fists to greet Ling Han’s oncoming charge.

Both of them were supreme prodigies, and both of them possessed Seventh-Tier battle prowess. With a single strike, the ground around them shattered, appearing extremely fragile in front of their power.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

After over 100 consecutive clashes, they were both bathed in blood.

It could not be helped. Their power had surpassed their cultivation level, and their physique could not bear it.

Xin Qihu was still fine. After all, Xin Qihu had an additional fundamental power to temper his body compared to Ling Han, so only his skin had cracked. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s heart, lungs, and other internal organs had all cracked, and he was very severely wounded.

“Ling Han, the higher the cultivation level, the greater the gap,” Xin Qihu said proudly. “Even if you’re no weaker than me in terms of power, what’s the use? Your physique is far too inferior!”

His hands turned into axes, and slashed madly at Ling Han.

This was the honest truth. The reason why Seventh Tiers were so awesome was naturally because their physique was indestructible. Otherwise, just look, there would definitely be people who would defect to join Hysteria’s side.

“You’re right.” Ling Han nodded. If he wasn’t willing to admit even this little bit of truth, then his concept of the big picture would really be too narrow-minded.

Ling Han drew out the distance between them, and did not clash head-on with Xin Qihu. Instead, he used his power to form various weapons, and charged towards Xin Qihu, attacking, punching, ramming, or stabbing. This was the comprehension that he had gained after his battle with Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.
