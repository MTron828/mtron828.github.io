2996 Return

Ling Han examined himself carefully over and over again, meticulous to the point of every cell, but finally came to a conclusion. He really did not find anything out of the ordinary.

There was not the slightest change in his cultivation level and power, but he had a feeling that there was something new in his body.

It was a change because there was presently a Power of Dimension that was forming inside one of Ling Han’s cells. Though it was presently only a sliver, and was not even comparable to the power of a Gushing Spring Tier, as long as this continued, there would eventually come a day when it would develop into a new dimension.

In other words, Ling Ling had already broken through the previous barrier, and now obtained the ability to create a new dimension.

Then, there was only one other ability that could not be confirmed—he could advance one, or even a few dimensions, to the level of transcendent level.

However, it wasn’t easy to prove it now. After all, he was limited by cultivation level. He had to reach the Seventh Tier before he could confirm whether he had such an ability or not.

In truth, as long as the dimensions in his body could multiply endlessly, his strength would never end, and he could continue to grow.

He tore open a rip in the Void, and returned to the Genesis World.

On this trip, he had spent a total of over 500 billion years. He was sure that everything had changed.

He returned to the Profound Negative Realm, and he very soon found the Empress and the others.

Everyone was living in seclusion because they had not resolved the problem of Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the others yet.

Seeing the sudden appearance of Ling Han, everyone was extremely pleasantly surprised.

Since his departure, it had really been too many, many years, and there had long been rumors that Ling Han had already died in the Genesis World of the last era.

Though the Empress and the others all did not believe it, too much time had passed. It was inevitable that they would still feel worried.

Ling Han briefly related his experiences, but he left out the last part of his encounter with the World’s Will because he did not want everyone to worry unnecessarily about him.

Everyone was pleased. Ling Han’s strength had improved further, and he could truly match any Seventh Tier now. This was great news.

“The Realm Battlefield has been reopened,” Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable said.

Over 400 billion years ago, Hysteria had made a comeback, and launched a fierce offensive against the Profound Negative Realm.

And after swallowing the Flaming Frost Realm, Hysteria’s strength had indeed improved greatly.

Though its main body was still being held back by the Seventh Tiers, even with the addition of Zhou Heng and the other newly advanced Seventh Tiers, the situation was still not as good as it had been in the Flaming Frost Realm. Hysteria was able to spare more energy to create more troops.

…This time, the Realm Battlefield had split into two levels. One was the battlefield of the Seventh Tiers, and the other was where Sixth Tiers, Fifth Tiers, and so on were all gathered.

Ling Han was sure that this was a modification made by Hysteria. The fewer battlefields there were, the greater its advantage would be. It would be fine as long as all the monsters it created were at the Sixth Tier. In terms of numbers, it had too much of an advantage.

Ling Han was curious. Just how many Sixth-Tier monsters had Hysteria created that even four people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess couldn’t turn the tables around?

“I have to go and take a look at the Realm Battlefield,” Ling Han said.

Hysteria’s advancement had to be halted because it was no longer possible for another transcendent dimension to form in the Genesis World. Once the Profound Negative Realm fell, Hysteria would then completely conquer the Genesis World in a single sweep. Even Seventh Tiers would not be able to stop it in the slightest.

No matter how deep the enmity was between Ling Han and Chong Yan and the others, faced with the survival of the Genesis World, this was a small matter.

Of course, it had been more than 500 billion years since he last left, so Ling Han couldn’t possibly leave immediately.

He stayed at home for three years, and only then did he set out.

…The Realm Battlefield had already been active for so many years, so it wouldn’t hurt it to wait another three years for him, right?

In these three years, Ling Han spent the majority of his time accompanying his wives and children, as well as providing some guidance on their cultivation.

With Ling Duanyun running here and there, the descendants of the Ling Clan that had been scattered all over the world also slowly gathered, forming another large clan, but it was very low-key. After all, Ling Han had not returned, and they had offended quite a number of Seventh Tier ultimate elites.

Ling Han used his divine sense to sweep over every descendant, but unfortunately, Ling Duanyun was already the most outstanding.

But ultimately, Ling Duanyun could only reach Ninth Heaven, at most, which was still far from the Heavenly Venerable Tier. It would be difficult for another Heavenly Venerate to appear among his descendants!

Ling Han also knew that he was asking too much. Just look at his children and grandchildren. Just how many Heavenly Venerates had emerged from them?

Finally, Ling Han brought Ling Feifan with him to the Realm Battlefield.

There couldn’t be too many people, because while there was no problem for Ling Han to protect himself now, he wouldn’t be able to protect many people in a battle between Seventh Tiers, either.

This applied to Shatter Mountains and the others as well. If they fought with Ling Han, they definitely wouldn’t have the spare energy to take care of the people around them.

The problem was that these five people came from the Genesis World of the last era. Aside from Feng Wuding who they were concerned about, was there anyone else they had to take care of?

Hence, this was unequal. They could be very willful, and fight as they willed, without any reservations at all.

Ling Feifan was currently in the Second Tier, and was in the process of breaking through to the Third Tier. Taking him to the Realm Battlefield to experience life-and-death battle would be of great help to his breakthrough.

A question arose in Ling Han’s mind when he recalled the words that Chong Yan and the others had said before.

Why had they lied about the mark of life? They had said that they had gathered it in advance, and not that the World’s Will had stuffed it into their hands.

To claim credit?

Impossible, did a Seventh Tier need such empty fame?

Then, there was only one possibility left—they wanted to conceal the existence of the World’s Will.

The question was, why?

Ling Han had come into contact with the World’s Will before, and saw the scene of the five ultimate elites slumbering. He didn’t think that it was any kind of secret worth keeping.

Could it be that these five people knew something that he did not know?

Ling Han thought for a long time, but if this was really a secret, it was obviously impossible for him to see through it. Furthermore, it had to be world-shaking. Otherwise, why would the five of them have kept it hidden?

To make even a Seventh Tier ultimate elite keep his mouth shut about it, it had to be an incredibly important matter.

Led by Ling Han, grandfather and grandson soon arrived at the Realm Battlefield.

Similar to the Flaming Frost Realm, a great wall was built here to counter Hysteria’s advantage in numbers.

Ling Han stood in the skies, his eyes gazing into the distance. He could see Hysteria’s army camped 5,000 km outside the city, densely packed together.

Hiss, this scale was really astonishing.

“Who goes there!” A figure streaked over, exuding a massive, majestic aura.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over, and his eyes involuntarily narrowed slightly, revealing a hint of killing intent. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was Xin Qihu.

“En, it’s you?” It was naturally impossible for Xin Qihu not to recognize Ling Han. He also raised his gaze. “Your life is really tough. You actually didn’t die in the Genesis World of the last era[1].”

[1] “Tough life” in Chinese and in this context means that one is really hard to kill.
