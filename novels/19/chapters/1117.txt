Chapter 1118: Invincible Paragon Saint

“According to that unreliable stone tablet, the next trial is a labyrinth. Moreover, we can’t form teams and can only attempt it ourselves. Do you want to enter the Black Tower?” Ling Han asked.

Shui Yanyu pondered for a moment before shaking her head, and saying, “No, I want to attempt it myself!”

“It might be dangerous,” Ling Han warned.

“I know,” Shui Yanyu said with a nod. Then, she turned to Ling Han, and earnestly said, “I don’t want to become a burden to you. I want to be able to help you!”

Ling Han felt moved upon feeling her love for him. However, what he said next was still quite out of touch. “Then let’s have kids first!”

“Damn pervert!” Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at him.

Ling Han laughed cheerily, and he stopped to pull her into an embrace. “Be careful!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I will!”

Ling Han pecked her on the forehead before striding into the second level.

Shui Yanyu faltered for a moment. Then, she suddenly noticed that two divine seals had appeared in her pocket. They were none other than the Vajra Seal and the Lion Seal. Before she could even speak, Ling Han had already disappeared behind the turn in the stairs.

She hurriedly ran after him, yet she saw that he had already entered the second floor. Walls that were built from stone lay before her and stretched for a long distance. They appeared especially messy and disorderly.

This was already the second floor of the tower, and she had become separated from Ling Han.

This wasn’t the first time that they had come across such a situation. When they entered this tomb, those at the Mountain River Tier, Sun Moon Tier, and Heavenly Body Tier had already been separated from each other. She took the two divine seals out from her pocket. Ling Han had only left these with her because he was worried about her.

Moreover, he was afraid that she would reject them, and thus he immediately ran off after stuffing them into her pocket. He gave her absolutely no chance to speak.

Shui Yanyu stared at the divine seals absentmindedly. Then, she remembered that Ling Han still had the Black Tower, meaning that he would probably be safe. Only then did she regain her senses and start to analyze the stone formation before her.

Ling Han was also analyzing the stone formation in the same place—though it seemed as if he were in a different dimension.

There was no doubt that this was the labyrinth.

“Huh? It can move.” After studying the formation for a while, Ling Han discovered that the stone walls would move by themselves. As a result, the layout of the paths would completely change.

‘We have to pass this labyrinth in under two hours. Do we have to find the pattern that governs the movement of these stone walls?’

A confident smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. He had ventured into numerous ancient sites during the last few years of his previous life. During that time, he had come across countless formations. Although the level of the formation before him was much higher, his cultivation level and divine sense were also much more powerful than before.

The more powerful one’s divine sense, the more powerful one’s deduction and inference abilities would become. These were of utmost importance for alchemy, puppet creation, formation setting, and formation cracking.

Ling Han’s eyes moved about slightly as he stared at the formation. As time went on, the speed at which his eyes moved also increased—this was because he was following and remembering all the changes in the formation. After he remembered them, he would start to analyze the patterns that governed their movement.

If he entered the Black Tower and performed comprehension under the Reincarnation Tree, one day’s worth of comprehension would be equivalent to an entire year’s outside. Thus, he would naturally be able to crack this formation in an extremely short amount of time. However, the time limit meant that this formation could be cracked in under two hours. There were rewards at stake, and he was confident that he would be able to crack this formation without any external help.

His mind was already whirring, and a smile quickly tugged at the corners of his mouth.

‘There are 36 transformations, and there are also seven areas designed to trick people. If one enters those places, they’ll definitely be trapped.

‘I’m ready now.’

Ling Han walked into the stone labyrinth.

He headed left for a while, and then right. He appeared especially relaxed, and he passed through the stone formation in only around an hour. Another large hall appeared before him.

Shao Sisi, Du An, and the others who had set off before him had all arrived here already. Even Xia Wuque had already arrived. Prodigies were prodigies, after all, and they were outstanding even in the field of deduction.

However, part of the reason was because the formation had been relatively simple. As such, it hadn’t been able to separate the skills of the prodigies apart. If the difficulty of the formation had been increased dramatically, perhaps differences in completion time would reach several or even dozens of years.

The hall before Ling Han also had a stone tablet.

Ling Han nodded in greeting to Shao Sisi and the others first, and then he walked up to the stone tablet, and said, “I’ve passed, so where is my reward?”

“Brat, remember to call me senior!” the stone tablet said angrily.

Ling Han took this opportunity to ask, “What should I refer to senior as?”

Shao Sisi and the others all perked their ears up. They were also keen to learn about this large tomb’s origin. Being able to construct a tomb among the stars and planets was far too astonishing.

“Haha! Back in the day, I had galloped across the universe and been invincible for a generation! You people can refer to me as the Invincible Paragon Saint!” the stone tablet said.

‘So shameless!’

Everyone shook their heads in their minds. They acknowledged that this person had been supremely powerful when alive. However, it was a bit over the top for him to call himself invincible.

The world was vast, and powerful beings were as many as the clouds. Who could be truly invincible?

Moreover, even Saints couldn’t escape death. If one were invincible... could they overcome the great dao of heaven and earth?

“Oh, so it’s Senior Invincible,” Ling Han said. However, there wasn’t a shred of respect in his voice, and this made the Invincible Paragon Saint feel extremely vexed.

“Bunch of brats. Back in the day, my might— forget about it. A real man doesn’t boast about his past achievements.” The Invincible Paragon Saint humphed, and said, “Take it, it’s your reward.”

Ling Han looked over, only to find another vial of pills on the ground.

“What is it this time?” he asked.

“Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill,” the Invincible Paragon Saint said.

“Again?” Ling Han said with a grimace. His expression was one of great displeasure.

To most people, alchemical pills were incredibly rare and precious. In fact, high-level alchemical pills would even trigger fights and potentially lead to deaths. Such occurrences weren’t rare. However, Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor. After receiving the corresponding pill recipes, what pills couldn’t he refine?

Thus, he “despised” alchemical pill rewards the most. In addition, this was actually the Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill again!

“Wrong, wrong, wrong.” The Invincible Paragon Saint repeated the word “wrong” three times to emphasize his point. “This isn’t the same Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill as last time. Rather, this Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill can provide one with one star more power than the previous Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill.”

“Although you emphasized your point, and although you spoke in riddles, this still doesn’t change the fact that it’s simply a Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill. It’s merely of a slightly higher quality.” Ling Han shook his head in disappointment.

He was an alchemist, so he was naturally aware that “lame” alchemists would end up with alchemical pills of differing levels—even when refining the same cauldron of pills. Some pills would reach the standard 10 stars, while other pills would only reach eight, seven, or even just five stars.

Of course, such kinds of “lame” alchemists made up 99% of the alchemy world. In fact, this was nothing surprising. It was just that Ling Han’s expertise in alchemy was already too high, so he couldn’t help but look down on such kinds of ordinary alchemists.

“I’ll take them back if you don’t want them.” The Invincible Paragon Saint was even more displeased than Ling Han.

Ling Han hurriedly put the pills away. These were for free anyway, so why wouldn’t he take them?

“What’s the next trial like?” he asked.

The Invincible Paragon Saint humphed, and said, “You want me to give you special treatment with that attitude of yours? In your dreams!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Everyone treats you with respect, and only I’m different from the ordinary. Isn’t this enough reason for you to open the back door for me?”

“...” The Invincible Paragon Saint was speechless for a moment. Then, he sighed. “I suddenly realized that you’re more of a sh*tty brat than I initially thought!”
