Chapter 2308 Accidental Injury

“You’re thinking far too highly of this Ba,” the demon said with disdain. “How can he possibly offend You Yuan? They’re not even on the same level!”

Just then, he had still been filled with righteous rage about the angels coming to attack the demons. Now, however, he was siding with You Yuan instead. Judging from this, it was extremely clear just how lofty a standing You Yuan enjoyed in the minds of these students. His reputation had already transcended the boundaries of race; he was a synonym for strength and power.

Ling Han involuntarily smiled, and said, “Perhaps this Ba is also incredibly powerful. Perhaps he can even pummel You Yuan?”

“Rubbish!” Not only did the demon beside him glare at him in anger, but even the dozen or so demons in the surroundings turned around to glare at him. They all wore expressions of disdain and disgust.

You Yuan was like a god of the Hundred Battles Academy. His name couldn’t be sullied.

“Why is this rubbish? After all, they haven’t fought before,” Ling Han said with a smile. His words naturally attracted even more rage. Many more demons turned around to glare at him, and it was as if they wanted to use their gazes to cut him into 10,000 pieces. “Huh?” Someone suddenly faltered before pointing at Ling Han, and exclaiming, “He’s Ba!”

Ah!

Everyone cried out in astonishment. Holy f*ck! After speaking nonsense for so long, this was the culprit? Moreover, just how shameless was he? He was actually praising himself?

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Those who think that I can pummel You Yuan, please raise your hands.”

As expected, no one raised their hand. They all looked at him as if he were a retard.

“Ba!” one of the angels roared. He immediately charged over.

Peng, peng, peng! No one could block him, and his rippling holy glow made him appear like a spotless deity.

“My obedient son,” Ling Han said with a nod. “Oh, that’s right, what were you called again, son? Papa forgot your name.”

The angel instantly flushed red with rage. This person was doing this on purpose, right? He had called himself Ba[1] to take advantage of others. He humphed, and said, “I’m Lu Yuanxin.”

“Fortunately it’s your heart that’s green, not your head[2],” Ling Han said with a serious expression.

Lu Yuanxin had already been enraged, and this infuriated him even more. He was incandescent with rage as he lunged at Ling Han.

Not a single demon stepped forward to help Ling Han. After all, he had dared to belittle You Yuan just then, so this caused all of them to detest him.

Ling Han glanced up, and he immediately unleashed a terrifying killing intent.

Lu Yuanxin was forcefully stopped in his tracks. Fear flashed across his face.

He had a feeling that if he didn’t stop, he would be ruthlessly killed by Ling Han.

“How is this possible?!’

He was at the First Leaf of the Eighth Lotus! According to his information, Ling Han was only at the Fifth Leaf of the Sixth Lotus. The gulf between them was like the gulf between heaven and earth. Even if he shut his eyes and allowed Ling Han to attack him at will, Ling Han still shouldn’t be able to breach his defenses. Just where in the world was this feeling coming from?

Ling Han smiled again, and said, “My good son, do you know that attacking papa is extremely undutiful? Why don’t you hurry up and kneel down and apologize?”

Lu Yuanxin forcefully suppressed the fear in his mind. He was convinced that Ling Han had cultivated some kind of special technique that targeted one’s divine sense. It was because of this that he had mistakenly felt that Ling Han was powerful. In reality, he wasn’t actually powerful.

In any case, Ling Han had called him “son” time and time again, so he would definitely be laughed at by others if he didn’t give Ling Han a wicked beating.

“You’re seeking death!” he roared as he unleashed an attack.

Boom!

A terrifying wave of energy swept forward. His wings flapped, and he immediately summoned 12 golden swords that stabbed down at Ling Han. Each sword was brimming with a devastating destructive power. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“A son is attacking his father! Absolutely traitorous!” Ling Han shouted. He activated the Void Space, but he didn’t summon tens of thousands of clones. Instead, he simply used his agility to dodge the attack.

Boom!

One of the golden swords had initially been stabbing at Ling Han, yet his disappearance was so sudden that Lu Yuanxin couldn’t stop the attack in time. The golden sword instantly impaled the leg of the person behind Ling Han.

The person immediately wailed in agony. At the same time, he glared at Lu Yuanxin in anger. Whom had he offended? Why had he suffered such misfortune?

Lu Yuanxin grimaced upon seeing this. Charging into the Demon Quarters to cause a commotion was already against the academy rules. Now, he had even wounded someone for no reason. He was definitely going to face punishment. However, since it had already come to this, he naturally couldn’t back down. He needed to severely punish Ling Han. He commanded the remaining 11 golden swords to continue pursuing Ling Han.

Ling Han used the same tactic, activating the Void Space to vanish when the golden swords neared him.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Golden light flashed through the air, terrifying the surrounding demons. If they were stabbed, wouldn’t that be the pinnacle of misfortune? Fortunately, Lu Yuanxin was prepared now, so he carefully controlled his swords to avoid the onlookers.

He waved his hand with a humph, commanding the 11 golden swords to continue their pursuit of Ling Han.

‘He’s not getting tricked?’ Ling Han chuckled in his mind. ‘You think it’s this easy?’

When the swords shot over, he lightly parried one of them with his fingers while activating his Void Space to dodge. The sword instantly changed its trajectory, shooting toward a demon.

Pu!

No one expected this sword to suddenly change trajectory, and the demon that it shot toward wasn’t very powerful, either. He was instantly struck.

Coincidentally, this was the same demon that had been struck before. “Aaah!” he screamed in agony, and tears were about to fall from his eyes. This was not only from pain, but also from grief. They all said that sabers and swords had no eyes. However, to be struck twice? These swords clearly had eyes! They were as bloody accurate as could be!

He stared at Lu Yuanxin in grief and resentment. Did the other party harbor some great hatred against him or something?

Lu Yuanxin also felt unspeakable vexation. He had clearly targeted Ling Han, so it was definitely Ling Han’s slight parry that had caused this. It was because of this that his sword had changed paths, and accidentally wounded someone.

Fortunately, this also signified that Ling Han wasn’t very powerful. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have needed to dodge, and he could have parried more than one sword.

He drew on his remaining power, and commanded the remaining 10 swords to continue pursuing Ling Han.

“You people… You’re far too short-sighted,” Ling Han said with a chuckle as he dodged Lu Yuanxin’s attacks. “You’re convinced that You Yuan can’t be rivaled? How laughable! If he’s truly invincible, how did he only win 72nd place for the academy?”

“Impudence!” Lu Yuanxin roared in wild rage. This person actually dared to slander You Yuan? He was seeking death!

With a roar, his 10 golden swords instantly sped up. He had activated an ultimate technique and unleashed his pinnacle power. However, the price was his Spiritual Power being consumed 10 times quicker.

This time, Ling Han didn’t rely on the Void Space to dodge these attacks. Instead, he suddenly leaped back and dodged the attacks of all 10 swords. His sudden change in tactic was done such that Lu Yuanxin couldn’t stop his attack in time. The 10 golden swords immediately shot toward the demon behind Ling Han.

Ling Han was definitely doing this on purpose. The demon behind him was none other than the demon who had already been stabbed twice.

His body was now filled with swords. Even though these swords had been formed from Regulations, they would remain material for a short time. Moreover, they wouldn’t dissipate until the power of Regulations within them was exhausted. The demon glanced at Lu Yuanxin, and then he glanced at Ling Han. The words “holy… f*ck…” were uttered from his mouth before he cocked his head and collapsed to the ground, unconscious.

His gaze had been filled with grief and resentment. Why did Lu Yuanxin always target him? And why did Ling Han always stand in front of him, causing him to suffer such misfortune?

“Detestable!” Lu Yuanxin was beside himself with rage. He furiously charged Ling Han. He was truly about to become a laughing stock. All 12 of his attacks had landed on an innocent bystander.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He extended his right hand, using a single finger like a sword. With a slight flick, a burst of devastating Sword Qi slashed across the air. Its might was astonishing

(1) In Chinese, the word for father can be read as “Ba”.

[2] In Chinese, “Lu” (more accurately Lü, also spelled Lv since ü, which is common in German, doesn’t exist in English; find out how words with ü are spelled in German, and you’ll know the approximate pronunciation in Chinese, an example being führer (from Hitler)) is the character for green, and “Xin” is for heart. Also, wearing a green hat means getting cucked.
