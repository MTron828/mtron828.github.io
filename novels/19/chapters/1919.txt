Chapter 1920: Three floors of the Tower unlock simultaneously

Ling Han had not expected at all that the “great change” that Small Tower spoke of would actually be so great, either.

Three floors of the Tower would open simultaneously!

Weng, the Tower of Three Realms was floating in his Dantian, all nine floors of the Tower shining at the same time, exuding a supreme air that could suppress the heavens and traverse all ages.

“Hmm?”

The Eternal Prosperity Celestial King frowned slightly. Just moments ago, he actually detected a supreme aura, which had far surpassed his cultivation level.

Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

...Perhaps even stronger than that.

‘Impossible!’

His face was filled with shock, and he felt that this was inconceivable. It seemed like all kinds of bizarre and weird occurrences were happening all at the same time.

Meanwhile, Lu Hairong’s limbs trembled slightly. She had had contact with this kind of aura before!

Was it that lord?

In the mountains, Ling Han had no time to see how the Black Tower had changed. He raised his fists skywards, greeting the heavenly tribulation that had become even more violent. In truth, he could have delivered this severance a while later. Then, even if the heaven and earth raged in fury, only one divine bolt of lightning would descend at most. In fact, it could be directly avoided.

Yet Ling Han wanted to try it out to see exactly just how frightening this heavenly tribulation could be.

He was going to set foot on the pinnacle of cultivation, and had to surpass all other prodigies. Thus, he would have to defeat some opponents that other prodigies thought could not possibly be defeated.

Moreover, he still had the Natural Peach Seal to suppress it somewhat. If he still couldn’t endure this kind of heavenly tribulation, he would really be too weak.

Peng!

He confronted the heavenly tribulation. In only a single clash, he felt that his arm was slightly numbed. This caused him to feel slight shock. it should be known that his physique was very strong, and even Yin soul elites would find it very difficult to injure him. Yet now, his arm was already numb from a single strike.

However, this was invigorating!

A frightening power surged in Ling Han’s body. This was a mysterious change that had taken place in his Dantian after he had successfully opened the sky. No longer did he have to absorb Spiritual Qi from the heaven and earth and convert it into his Origin Power; he himself had become a universe of his own.

In the past, he had formed millions of stars, but those were just mere symbols, and could only be used to store Origin Power. It was a different case now. These stars had turned into genuine, real stars, endless power feeding back into him.

It was no wonder that the fifth severance was so strong, being capable of matching Yang soul elites. This was a completely new cultivation level.

His power could shatter the heavens!

Ling Han released a battle cry, and battled fiercely with the lightning. He sent out a barrage of punches, and the Source Power that was formed from the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water was wrapped around his fists, forming multiple seals of great dao, and they were also strengthening in this process.

Source Powers of heaven and earth were destined to be capable of reaching Celestial King Tier, but it was not determined whether it would be First Heaven, Second Heaven, or Eighth heaven, Ninth Heaven. Thus, Ling Han wanted to endlessly temper them.

On the other side, the Empress’s heavenly tribulation was also nearing its end. She did what she could, and did not deliver the fifth severance too early. Instead, she waited until after the final divine bolt of lightning had landed to finally deliver the fifth severance.

In this manner, though the heaven and earth were still raging in fury, nothing could be done to her.

Since both of them were experiencing the heavenly tribulation at the same time, with the conclusion of the Empress’s heavenly tribulation, Ling Han’s naturally ended as well.

The two expanses of tribulation clouds seemed to disperse at practically the same time too. Ling Han and the Empress exchanged a look, both revealing a smile of satisfaction.

The fifth severance!

From this moment onwards, they had finally advanced into the ranks of top tier prodigies, no longer allowing Yan Xianlu, Shan Jitong, and others to simply shine ahead of them.

“Brat, don’t be too proud. Even in the fifth severance, there is similarly a difference in strength,” Small Tower warned.

Ling Han nodded. Just take Yan Xianlu, Shan Jitong, and Lao Song as examples. It was clearly Yan Xianlu that was the strongest of the three, and perhaps he was not just a little bit stronger than the other two. Shan Jitong and Lao Song would have to join forces to be able to match him.

Becoming a fifth severance was only taking a step over the doorstep. However far they could go would still have to depend on their efforts. It was not something that could be done once and for all.

Cultivation always meant going against the flow. If one did not improve, that would mean that he was falling back.

“What about the Black Tower? With three floors unlocking at the same time, what changes have taken place?” Ling Han asked.

“You can use time acceleration effects,” Small Tower said. “The effect of catalyzing the growth of Celestial medicine has improved to 100 times, and if it is limited to just a small area, it can reach 1,000 times.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ling Han was initially surprised, which was followed by his great joy, and he said, “Which also means that if I concoct alchemical pills inside the Black Tower, the speed can be accelerated 1,000 fold?”

“That’s right!” Small Tower nodded.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break into a smile. If it was comprehension, it was the Reincarnation Tree that was still better. However, that was only mental and spiritual acceleration. If the physical body was factored in, it would definitely be the acceleration effects of the Black Tower that were more amazing.

“Additionally, you can also comprehend the Regulation of Time, Regulation of Slaughter, and Regulations of Space,” Small Tower continued.

This was too awesome.

This time, the might of the Tower of Three Realms was fully unlocked.

“In addition, you can also draw on the power of the Black Tower to a certain extent, and release the power of Time, Space, and Slaughter. Just study this slowly on your own,” Small Tower said. “All right. Now then, don’t bother me. I, too, have to improve myself to adjust to these new abilities.”

This proud Tower, it was clearly the one grumbling here, yet actually turned around to say that it was Ling Han’s fault.

However, it was fine that he was aware of it. He did not have to concern himself with it.

Ling Han smilingly said to the Empress, “Let’s go.”

Though they had spent 10 days’ time, it was not definite that they were unable to contest for first place. That was because they had not reached the summit even after traveling for 10 months, which showed how tall this peak was. Wasting 10 days would indeed have some effect, but it should not be too serious.

For example, not one person had caught up to them even now, and that was clear proof.

Of course, it was also possible that the others had not taken this path. This was not the only path that could reach the peak’s summit.

The two of them walked together, hand in hand.

Wisps of clouds lingered, and immediately new memory manifestations of the Celestial King appeared, but this time, they were Yang soul in level!

As expected, the heaven and earth had resonated, and would make adjustments according to every individual’s differing cultivation level. Thus, a higher cultivation level did not have much advantage, either. Instead, it was one’s strength in a battle of equals that determined the speed of one’s advancement.

“Come!” Ling Han laughed loudly; he had just been thinking of trying out the Black Tower’s new ability.

He could finally use the Black Tower to a limited extent. This made him feel very curious just what kind of level he could reach.

The Tower of Three Realms was a precious Tool that was at least Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier in level. If it could unleash its full might, it was capable of matching a Celestial King even now, so what about using it to a limited extent?

Ling Han clashed with a manifestation. He merely parried and did not counter so he would not destroy the latter in a moment of carelessness. Then, he communicated with the Black Tower on how to use the mysterious powers of Time, Space, and Slaughter.

With his comprehension ability, and added with the fact that the Black Tower was in his body in the first place, he very soon showed an expression of understanding. He pressed down a hand on a manifestation. “Take in!”

That manifestation’s body immediately shone all over, multiple seals of great dao appearing on it, but there was no particular change.

“It cannot be taken in?” Ling Han was shocked. He had wanted to take this manifestation directly into the Black Tower, yet he had failed.

“Then, let’s switch.” He smiled, and then pressed down his palm again. “Cut!”

Shua, shua, shua. Countless blades of wind sliced out, slashing out at that manifestation. Every blade of wind was only a foot long, yet seals of great dao were flickering in them, stimulating the power of the heaven and earth, and boosting it to a terrifying extent.

Wherever the blades of wind swept past, the manifestations would immediately be shredded into pieces.

And they were dealt with just like that.
