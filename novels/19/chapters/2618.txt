Chapter 2619: Jade Essence Pearl

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A Fifth Heaven Celestial King!

The other Celestial Kings faltered upon hearing this. How was this possible? After analyzing the events for half a day—even though all they spoke was nonsense—they confidently confirmed that the culprit was at least an Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

Yet, a measly Fifth Heaven Celestial King? How could they possess such battle prowess? Was this not inconceivable? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Brother Xu, perhaps… you saw incorrectly?” a Celestial King said. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and he was also one of the first Celestial Kings to be locked in the Celestial King Graveyard. However, because he was only a monarch tier, he was naturally weaker than Xu Shan. However, he also had the backing of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so he was in no way inferior in this aspect.

Those who had been tossed into the Celestial King Graveyard the earliest all had the backing of Heavenly Venerates.

If others heard his comment, perhaps they would laugh themselves to death. After all, how could a Nine Heaven Celestial King see incorrectly? However, the others didn’t show any signs of laughing. In their eyes, Xu Fang’s claim was indeed a complete impossibility. The only explanation was that Xu Fang had seen incorrectly.

Xu Fang humphed upon hearing this. While he was also displeased with their doubt, he also understood that this was indeed unfathomable. He forcefully suppressed his displeasure before saying, “I saw very clearly through the Soul Extinguishing Drum. It was indeed a Fifth Heaven Celestial King who killed my son!”

He reiterated his point, and the others had no choice but to believe it. After all, would a Ninth Heaven Celestial King speak nonsense for no reason?

However, what had the culprit relied on to become so powerful?

“A Fifth Heaven Celestial King killing a Sixth Heaven Celestial King… Moreover, Nephew Huan was also a monarch tier. Even if we ignore the Soul Extinguishing Drum, the culprit’s strength still definitely reached the Seventh Heaven. Otherwise, it would have been extremely easy for Nephew Huan to escape,” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King analyzed.

“A cultivation at the Fifth Heaven, yet a battle prowess at the Seventh Heaven. His Evolution Index is at least 11!” another Ninth Heaven Celestial King remarked.

Xu Fang’s gaze was intense as he said in a calm voice, “Not only my son, but Niece Zhao Qing, Nephew Yuheng, and the others were also killed by that person!”

“What?!”

The other Celestial Kings exclaimed in shock. Counting the number of people in their group, it was a perfect nine. Moreover, they were coincidentally the parents of Xu Huan and the others. They were all followers of Xu Fang, so their children were naturally followers of Xu Huan as well. There was nothing wrong with this.

Upon receiving the sudden news that their children had been killed, which of them could suppress their anger? Flames of fury erupted from their eyes, and they could barely stop themselves from charging out to search for the culprit straight away.

Xu Fang hesitated for a moment before saying, “We’ve already reached a critical moment here, so we most certainly can’t give up. Moreover, that culprit has already entered this realm, so we’re better off completing this task before going after him. There’s no need to abandon all of our previous efforts.”

“Agreed!” The Celestial Kings all nodded in agreement.

In fact, several of them wanted to abandon this task to go after Ling Han straight away. However, since Xu Fang had already said this, it would be difficult for them to disagree. In any case, since Ling Han had also entered the Ancient Tomb, it would only be a matter of time before they crossed paths.

“Here’s wishing that when we meet him… he’s still alive. We’ll subject him to the most torturous pain in the world before ending his despicable life!”

***

Ling Han entered the Ancient Tomb. There were no gates to this tomb, and there was only an entrance that had been forcefully created by the Celestial Kings. However, this tomb did indeed house structures inside, and it wasn’t just a single solid core.

He continued to advance along the path that had also been forcefully carved out, and it wasn’t long before this path intersected with the passageways inside the tomb. The walls of this passageway were embedded with pearls that were radiating with a warm glow. However, some had already been dug out and taken.

“These are… Jade Essence Pearl!”

Ling Han was astonished upon seeing this.

Jade Essence Pearls were a type of fruit that grew at the bottom of the ocean. When they ripened, they would automatically fall off the tree and become enveloped by the ice-cold energy at the bottom of the sea. After trillions upon trillions of years, they would then condense into pearls that could elevate the cultivation of Celestial Kings.

Of course, the higher level a Celestial King was, the weaker the effects of the Jade Essence Pearl would be. In any case, however, they would still have some positive effects.

Now, however, these pearls were actually being used as lights in an unbelievably extravagant manner. Moreover, they were being used for a dead person. This was truly an astonishing sight.

Jade Essence Pearls were incredibly rare, so even obtaining a single pearl could be seen as extremely lucky. Now, however, Ling Han could see at least several dozen in this stretch of the passageway.

Ling Han reached over to grab one, unleashing his phenomenal power as he did so. However, the Jade Essence Pearls didn’t budge a single inch.

Ling Han refused to accept this, so he immediately retrieved his Divine Demon Sword, and used its tip to dig into the walls. With the toughness of the Divine Demon Sword, all Ling Han heard was a crack before a Jade Essence Pearl fell into his hands.

No wonder some Jade Essence Pearls had been dug out, while others had been left alone. It wasn’t that people didn’t want them, but rather that they couldn’t obtain them. After all, how many people possessed Celestial Tools?

Moreover, those who possessed Celestial Tools were mostly Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings already, so how many of them would care about these Jade Essence Pearls?

In addition, even Jade Essence Pearls were only used as lights, so just how astonishing would the true treasures of this place be?

With this in mind, who would waste their time digging out these Jade Essence Pearls?

“Heh, it’s their choice not to take them. However, I certainly won’t abandon this opportunity.” Not only did Ling Han start to dig, but he even called the Empress out of the Celestial Guest Residence—she also possessed a Celestial Tool. With the combined power of this couple, they could naturally reach peak efficiency.

Even though the Empress was extremely aloof, thinking that all matters in the world belonged to her, and that these Jade Essence Pearls should be offered to her by others, since Ling Han had spoken, she reluctantly agreed to help.

Cling, cling, cling!

Clang, clang, clang!

They didn’t pay any heed to the others as they focused on digging out the Jade Essence Pearls.

In any case, so many years had already passed, so wasting some more time here wouldn’t make any difference, right?

They continued to dig as they advanced, and it was quite clear that Ling Han was much quicker than the Empress. Firstly, his cultivation level was higher, and secondly, the Divine Demon Sword was also more powerful than her Celestial Tool.

In three days, they had already advanced several hundred meters. However, the passageway stretched on, and it was as if there were no end in sight.

“The person resting here… is most likely a Heavenly Venerate, right?” Ling Han speculated. Otherwise, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King couldn’t be so extravagant and possess so many Jade Essence Pearls.

The Empress nodded in agreement. “By the looks of it, it’s very likely that the remaining six scrolls of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll are hidden here.”

“Not necessarily,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. “It’s impossible to guess the thoughts of Desolate Moon, so who knows what he’s playing at here.”

They continued to advance. After several more days, they finally reached the end of the passageway.

However, it was also at this moment that they heard footsteps behind them. Judging from the auras, this was most likely a group of eight Celestial Kings. After reaching the Celestial King Tier, one could easily move around without making a sound. However, these people insisted on making their footsteps heard, and this was a clear reflection of their confidence. Or perhaps this was a reflection of their arrogance and fearlessness.

It wasn’t long before eight youths appeared behind the couple. Their cultivation levels varied, with some being at the Third Heaven and others being at the Sixth Heaven. However, each of them carried an air of arrogance.

“Leave the Jade Essence Pearls, and then piss off!” a Celestial King said. Once he swept his gaze over the Empress, his face immediately lit up. He then pointed at her, and said, “Leave this woman as well!”

“You’re seeking death!” the Empress said in a baleful voice. She directly drew her sword, and charged at the eight people.

“You dare?!” The eight people hurriedly moved to block her attacks.

Ling Han also lashed out, blocking the Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings, and leaving the others to the Empress.

They actually dared to target his wife? This naturally enraged Ling Han. His attacks were merciless, and the two Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings were completely no match for him, killed before they could even unleash their trump cards.

“Y-you’ve caused huge trouble! You killed Lord Kong Si’s only son! Lord Kong Si is a Ninth Heaven monarch star who possesses a heaven-defying battle prowess! You’re dead meat!” the others stammered in shock.

However, would the Empress pay any heed to this? Heads rolled as her Celestial Tool continued to dance.

Ling Han sheathed his sword, saying in a relaxed manner, “I’ve already offended numerous Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so what does it matter if I offend a few more?”
