2803 What’s with your attitude?

He Liqun turned his gaze, softened his attitude, and said, “For your sake, friend, I can take a step back. As long as this brat kneels down and apologizes to me, I can spare him just this once.”

Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation let out an oh, and enquired, “How has his boy offended you, friend?”

He Liqun couldn’t help it as his expression turned ugly for a brief moment. Would he have the nerve to reiterate the scandal of his devastating defeat to Ling Han in front of Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation? He shook his head, and said, “You don’t need to know the specific details of the process, my friend. As long as this brat will bow his head to me… I’m neither a petty nor narrow-minded person.”

Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation nodded slowly. Ling Han was merely a First Tier Heavenly Venerate. In that case, bowing his head to an elite of the Fourth Tier-level wouldn’t be a big deal.

!!

She looked at Ling Han, and said, “Since Friend He has said so, you should kneel down and kowtow to Friend He.”

Ling Han was talking to Hu Niu. The two hadn’t seen each other for more than an epoch, so they naturally both had a lot to say. The little girl had already become a Heavenly Venerate, and had even advanced to Second Tier, but it wasn’t through gathering of power of many dimensions like the Empress, but rather she had walked the path of an ordinary Heavenly Venerate.

This was also the reason why she could take the lead in cultivation level. As for Ling Han and the Empress, it would take an astonishingly long time to progress a step forward. This was the price one had to pay for being stronger at the same level.

The little girl was a talkative person by nature, and coupled with the fact that they hadn’t seen each other for so long, she was chattering incessantly.

Ling Han gladly listened to her. At this moment, just looking at the little girl and listening to her talk filled him with happiness.

“…Aiya, Niu almost died several times, wu, wu, wu, and you stinky bastard, you haven’t been by Niu’s side.” The little girl pressed herself into Ling Han’s embrace while scolding him in a coquettish manner.

The two of them were loving and affectionate, and they simply didn’t pay any attention to what The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation was saying.

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation couldn’t help showing a look of dissatisfaction. ‘I have kindly stood up for you, what’s with your attitude?’ She coughed heavily, surging with the power of a Heavenly Venerate.

Only then were Ling Han and Hu Niu shaken out of their enamoredness. Hu Niu, being extremely dissatisfied, said, “Old nun, didn’t you see that Niu is talking to Ling Han?”

She had never acknowledged Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation as her master, and her attitude had always been like this, so this wasn’t regarded as disobedience.

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation had long been used to her character. It was thanks to the pure and clear heart of the little girl that she could dedicate herself wholeheartedly into the process of cultivation, otherwise, going by her natural talent, she could only reach the level of First Tier at the most.

She was upset with Ling Han, and said in a deep voice, “Brat, I asked you to kowtow to Friend He to make amends.”

“No way!” Before Ling Han could say anything, Hu Niu jumped up first. She knew Ling Han too well; it was absolutely impossible for him to suffer such great humiliation.

The Empress also said sternly, “Old nun, you have gone too far!”

Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation’s face twitched. Old nun? Although her title was Earnest Meditation, it had absolutely nothing to do with Buddhism. How dared she call her an old nun1? It was already enough with Hu Niu; why was this woman doing the same?

She was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, after all, so how dared a First Tier Heavenly Venerate be so disrespectful to her?

“Impudence!” She glared, exuding an infinite murderous aura.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Senior, I am deeply grateful to you for standing up for me. However, it is absolutely impossible for me to kowtow to such an old beast who bullies the weak.”

While these words caused the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation to feel unhappy, and He Liqun to twist his lips angrily, it was also what the latter wanted.

He Liqun knew Ling Han’s terrible temper very well, and knew that he wouldn’t bow his head to him, so he had taken a step back on purpose. In this way, Ling Han would become someone who didn’t know what was good for him, and would the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation still want to stand up for him then?

“Brat, you are going too far!” the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation said with dissatisfaction. As it was, she was already unhappy with Hu Niu’s affection for Ling Han, and deemed Ling Han to be unworthy of her, and secondly, cultivators should put all their energy into cultivation, so how could they be so engrossed in love affairs like this?

Ling Han smiled faintly. “I’m afraid I’m not able to obey Senior’s order. With regards to this matter, Senior needs not bother about it.”

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation was so angry that her brows twitched. How dared a mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate be so arrogant? Was he so confident that she would stop He Liqun for him for Hu Niu’s sake? Humph, it would be good if Ling Han was dead. In this way, Hu Niu wouldn’t be infatuated with such a damn man.

She waved her hand. “Fine, I will not care about your business.”

He Liqun couldn’t help showing a smug smile. From the time that he had taken a step back, he had already dug a hole for the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation, being confident that Ling Han wouldn’t give in to persuasion.

He Liqun took a step forward. “Ling Han, the opportunity has been given to you, but you didn’t seize it. What a fool you are.”

Ling Han shook his head. “He Liqun, do you think you have a good chance of winning?”

He Liqun sneered. “I don’t believe that you can overturn the current circumstances.”

“Then you just go all out, and see how I will kill you,” Ling Han said lightly.

“I do want to give it a try, to see how you can suppress and kill me.” He Liqun strode purposefully towards Ling Han. With the presence of another Fourth Tier, he had to destroy Ling Han with overwhelming force to avoid trouble in the future.

Today, Ling Han had to die.

Ling Han smiled, and took out the letter that Chu Hao had given him. With the divine sense locked on He Liqun, he threw the letter, and it blasted towards He Liqun.

Immediately, the letter glowed, overflowing with an extremely powerful aura.

The rays of light condensed and turned into a fist, which then smashed at He Liqun and sent him flying.

He Liqun turned pale with fright; this blow was too terrifying. The aura that flowed out was definitely not at the Fourth Tier, but rather Fifth Tier, no, perhaps even the Sixth Tier.

This blow… He couldn’t stop it, and he didn’t even have the capability to block it. The only thing he could do was to run away.

He quickly turned around and ran, fearing that he would be doomed if he even slowed down for a bit.

It was just that this was Chu Hao’s handiwork, which was equivalent to the attack of a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Despite its might being only of the Fifth Tier, how could it be resisted by a Fourth Tier?

Boom, a terrifying force surged through. This fist hit He Liqun’s body, and He Liqun was immediately torn apart.

Faced with the power of a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate was merely trash.

The reason why Lin Youlian and the other heaven-defying freaks remained stuck in the Fourth Tier for so long was admittedly because they had been charging forward too aggressively, and couldn’t avoid the need to slow down and accumulate their energy for a bit. Simultaneously, it was also because the gap between the Fifth Tier and the Fourth Tier was too great.

It didn’t matter even for one as strong as He Liqun—he was annihilated with a single blow.

The Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation’s eyes rounded in shock. She knew it very well herself that had this blow landed on her body, then her fate would definitely have been the same as that of He Liqun—she couldn’t be more dead if attacked.

A dignified Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate… died just like that.

Who could have imagined an outcome like this?

Everyone was dumbfounded, and even more so He Yufeng, who couldn’t come back to his senses. His own father had just died like that?

“He Yufeng, it’s your turn!” Ling Han, being the decisive person that he was, strode forward, with complete elimination in mind. If he let go of He Yufeng this time, there was no telling just how much trouble a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate could cause.

He Yufeng gritted his teeth, and turned around and ran away all of a sudden. Just the Empress alone was enough to fight on par with him, and with the addition of Ling Han and Hu Niu, he didn’t think he had any chance of winning. Furthermore, this was in a situation where the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation wouldn’t make a move.

Ling Han shook his head, and reached out with his right hand, which turned into a monstrous hand that easily suppressed He Yufeng.
