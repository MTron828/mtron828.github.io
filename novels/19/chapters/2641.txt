Chapter 2642: Merciless Toying

Upon seeing this, Niu Cangyu and the others wanted to grab a hammer to bash themselves to death. Why hadn’t they nodded?

Even Gu Heyi found this incredibly strange. What was Ling Han playing at?

However, he immediately came to a realization. None of them could open the scroll anyway, so Ling Han was simply pretending to be generous. In reality, he was actually toying with them.

Diao You faltered for a moment before hurriedly using his other hand to open the scroll. Once he succeeded, he could immediately soar into the heavens and become the most powerful person in the Celestial King Graveyard.

!!

In fact, even after he left this place, he could still act wantonly thanks to this newfound strength.

Heavenly Venerates were transcendent above Regulations!

However, it was too late for Niu Cangyu and the others to feel regret now. Their reaction was too slow, so they could only look on in helplessness.

Diao You’s hands were trembling slightly. The Dimension Scroll was almost weightless, yet he felt as if it were as heavy as a mountain. His heart was about to leap out from his throat.

He was beside himself with excitement, and with a flick of his finger, the Dimension Scroll… actually… opened…

It opened!

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this. Were they about to witness a miracle? Were they going to witness the birth of a Heavenly Venerate, someone who would dominate the world from hereon?

F*ck! Why hadn’t this fortune fallen to them?

Not only Niu Cangyu and his companions, but even the Celestial Kings below had extremely complicated feelings. They felt an urge to roar at Ling Han, asking him why he didn’t give the Dimension Scroll to them.

Even Gu Heyi couldn’t understand this at all. In his mind, Ling Han wasn’t this type of person.

Even if Ling Han couldn’t open the Dimension Scroll, he still wouldn’t give it to others for nothing, right? Moreover, how did Diao You manage to open the Dimension Scroll? This didn’t make sense!

“Hahaha! Mere mortals, bow before me!” After opening the Dimension Scroll, Diao You spread his arms and closed his eyes, an expression of intoxication on his face.

After opening the Dimension Scroll, he could obtain the blessing of heaven and earth, something that could transform even mere mortals into Heavenly Venerates.

Because this was the power of heaven and earth, the power of a realm, it could naturally transform anyone it wanted into a Heavenly Venerate.

Diao You was far too smug at this moment. As he swept his gaze around, his eyes were filled with disdain and scorn as if everyone was beneath him. He was already on a different level from these people. These people were nothing but mere ants.

Diao You’s eyes were cold as he peered at Ling Han from the corners of his eyes, and he said, “Taking into account your contribution, I can spare you from death. Kneel down and submit to me!”

This was clearly a weakling being intoxicated by success!

Ling Han scoffed, saying, “Are you stupid?”

“Impudence!” Diao You said with a cold sneer. He raised his hand and swatted at Ling Han. Before a mighty Heavenly Venerate, this measly person still dared to act with such disrespect?

Such foolishness and insolence!

Ling Han shook his head as he replied with a punch.

Peng!

Diao You was instantly sent flying, crashing into a mountain peak several hundred kilometers away. Under the huge force, the mountain peak was immediately shattered and broken. However, Diao You was also stopped in his tracks.

“How is this possible?!” Diao You shouted as he shakily hovered in the sky. He had already become a Heavenly Venerate, yet he was still unable to block Ling Han’s punch?!

Niu Cangyu and the others couldn’t help but shake their heads. They could see everything clearly. Diao You was still the same Diao You as always. Had his strength gone up by a single iota?

That Dimension Scroll or whatnot was an absolute fake!

However, Gu Heyi didn’t think this. Shock spread across his face as he said, “I understand! I know why your Body Art is so powerful now! It’s because you absorbed the power of the Dimension Scroll!”

‘What?!’

Everyone was stunned. Hadn’t Ling Han told them himself that only those chosen by heaven and earth could open the Dimension Scroll? If it were others, even if they were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, they would still be unable to open the Dimension Scroll. Otherwise, wouldn’t the power of heaven and earth be worthless?

Yet, Ling Han could extract power from the Dimension Scroll? Was this not inconceivable?

However, this speculation was extremely logical. Ling Han’s Body Art had indeed overcome some barrier.

Ling Han nodded, saying, “I have to say, you are quite an intelligent person.”

“You’ve already extracted all of the power from this Dimension Scroll?” Gu Heyi asked. “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have tossed it to someone else.”

“Correct,” Ling Han said, not disputing this speculation. Otherwise, even if he wanted to toy with Gu Heyi and the others, he wouldn’t have risked the Dimension Scroll. After all, what if one of them was truly the chosen one?

Diao You naturally heard this as well, and his face involuntarily became beet red.

As a mighty Eighth Heaven Celestial King, he had actually been fooled like a monkey? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He shook in fury. He had been so excited just then! He had been so smug! It was as if he had obtained a peerless treasure. In the end, however, he had actually been fooled!

He was like a clown, giving the performance of his life before everyone. He had lost all face.

He felt frustration, and he felt rage. He wanted to kill someone!

However, Diao You’s next action took everyone by surprise. Turning around, he immediately fled into the distance.

Weighing fury against life, what was the former worth? Ling Han was far too powerful at this moment, and Diao You couldn’t rival him at all. Thus, would he charge over to seek death?

The higher level a Celestial King, the less they were affected by the black energy. They would indeed have increased bloodlust, yet they wouldn’t seek death for no reason.

“You still want to flee?” Ling Han said with a shake of his head.

Whoosh!

Drawing on his terrifying strength, he immediately shot forward and caught up to Diao You. He then threw a punch.

With Ling Han’s current explosive power, unless his opponent was skilled in the Regulations of Space, they would be unable to escape from his grasp.

Pu!

With a single punch, Ling Han’s fist instantly exited through the front of Diao You’s chest.

Diao You slowly looked down. He wanted to speak, yet his head immediately flopped to the side, signaling his death.

Two Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings! Yet, they were easily killed by Ling Han just like that.

Everyone was stunned. They all became numb. Meanwhile, Niu Cangyu and the others all felt a cold chill run down their spines. An unspeakable feeling of bitterness and anguish washed over them.

They exchanged a glance before fleeing in different directions.

Now was the best time to flee. Otherwise, there would be no other opportunity.

“You guys didn’t p*ss off when I told you to, yet you still want to leave now?” Ling Han said with a humph. He immediately leaped forward.

Peng!

His speed was indescribable, and he caught up to Xue Chengbai in an instant, killing him with a single punch.

However, Rong Wenlin and Niu Cangyu had already escaped into the distance, and he could only catch up to one of them.

Whom should he choose?

Ling Han gave a soft roar.

Swoosh!

He threw his Divine Demon Sword, which transformed into a streak of light that shot toward Niu Cangyu. Meanwhile, he dashed toward Rong Wenlin.

“Aaah!” There was a scream of agony as the Divine Demon Sword pierced through Niu Cangyu’s shoulder, nailing him to the ground. The murderous aura of the Divine Demon Sword rushed into his body, rapidly dismantling his battle prowess. Meanwhile, Rong Wenlin was also quickly hunted down by Ling Han.

He tried to counterattack, but how could he possibly rival Ling Han? In a short few exchanges, he was brutally blasted into pieces.

Ling Han casually swaggered back, arriving beside Niu Cangyu.

Niu Cangyu looked up and begged for his life. “Please forgive—”

Pu!

Ling Han stomped down, instantly crushing Niu Cangyu’s head. This was the fifth Eighth Heaven Celestial King to be killed!

Ling Han retrieved his Divine Demon Sword before looking at Gu Heyi with a strange expression. “You actually didn’t flee?”

“I, Gu Heyi, have experienced countless battles in my life. I’ve never fled without even battling,” Gu Heyi said with a proud expression.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Because of your words, I’ve decided to erect a tombstone for you.”

“Ling Han, you’re far too arrogant!” Gu Heyi said with a humph. “Even if your strength has soared, it’s still nothing but a dream if you want to kill me!”

“Then why don’t we try?” Ling Han strode forward with his sword. Even though he had killed five Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings in a row, the sum of their strength was still inferior to that of Gu Heyi.

Gu Heyi also drew his sword. He then took a deep breath before saying, “I’ll borrow your strength to advance to the Eighth Heaven!”

Since Ling Han could advance during battle, he could definitely do so as well!

Because he was Gu Heyi!
