The peaceful life didn’t last long. Only one month later, the army of Hysteria attacked.

The alarm sounded, and Ling Han immediately mobilized.

Same as with the first spatial level, some people were guarding the city wall, while others were behind the city wall. Most of the people had taken out Heavenly Venerate Tools, and looked like they were ready to go all out.

Ling Han couldn’t help feeling rueful about the fact that there were so many Heavenly Venerates.

At a glance, there were at least tens of thousands; these were all Heavenly Venerates, and definitely not cheap cabbages.

Upon further thought, almost all the Heavenly Venerates of the whole Genesis World were gathered here, so it wasn’t unusual for the number to reach tens of thousands.

Despite his thoughts, seeing so many Heavenly Venerates all of a sudden still gave rise to a dreamlike feeling for Ling Han.

Boom!

The ground trembled. The army of Hysteria was already assaulting.

There were those who ran on the ground and those who flew in the sky. Hysteria was somewhat creative; its creations were bizarre. However, there was a common characteristic: there were many of them.

There were some with many feet, some with many eyes, and some with many heads—they were extremely bizarre. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, when these monsters were close enough, the city defense still hadn’t been activated. There was no light wave going xiu, xiu, xiu and being shot out to first kill a batch of monsters.

“From the second spatial level onwards, the city defense would just be a defense.” Ling Jianxue stood beside him, explaining to his father. “The city defense cannot unleash the battle prowess of a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, so the focus is on withstanding enemy attacks.

“The gate there will be opened to let some monsters enter the city, while we will create a pocket of encirclement to destroy them at the first instance.”

Ling Han nodded. There were only tens of thousands of Heavenly Venerates here, but looking at the number of monsters all over the mountains and plains, there were at least about 500,000-600,000, right?

If an intense battle was fought in an open terrain, it might not result in an absolute defeat, but even if it was a victory, it would only be a narrow one.

As far as Hysteria was concerned, how long would it take to recreate a large army?

Therefore, one couldn’t fight recklessly without thinking.

Just as Ling Jianxue spoke, Hysteria’s army had begun attacking the city.

Peng, an enormous 18-eyed giant waved its arms and hurled a huge stone slab, which it attached Heavenly-Venerable-Tier power to. Peng, the stone hit the city wall, causing a crack in it.

This was fine, but there were still many 18-eyed giants such as this, and they threw stones one after another, trying to smash the city defense to bits.

Of course, there were countermeasures prepared by the Flaming Frost Realm. There were several elites on the city wall who drew their bows and shot out a series of godly arrows. Some smashed the stones to bits, while some barraged the 18-eyed giants.

On the other side, Hysteria’s main troops were also pouring out from the intentionally opened gap in the city wall, yet only a portion of them could enter, which instantly rendered their advantage in numbers nonexistent.

“Kill!”

The people here were all extremely practiced, and they immediately went to kill the enemy commanders.

They had to end the battle as soon as possible; otherwise, when the influx of Hysteria’s army reached a certain level, their advantageous situation would instantly become disadvantageous.

Almost one-third of the Heavenly Venerates here possessed Heavenly Venerate Tools, while none of the monsters in the army was equipped. This, too, ought to be related to Hysteria’s ability of creation. After all, there was only so much Divine Metal and Devouring Metal in one dimension.

Given the advantage in numbers, coupled with the power exhibited by the Heavenly Venerate Tools, a massacre immediately unfolded at the gap in the city wall as batches of Hysteria’s troops fell.

However, each of Hysteria’s fighters was intrepid and fearless in the face of death, rushing forward one after another, and soon caused casualties for the Flaming Frost Realm.

Hysteria could afford for Heavenly Venerates to die, but the Flaming Frost Realm really couldn’t afford the same.

Generally speaking, it would take at least an epoch to nurture a Heavenly Venerate. Therefore, it would be a huge loss if one fell.

With a loud battle cry, Ling Han swung his sword, leaped down, and unleashed a massacre.

Now he was getting more familiar with controlling his power, and slashing out with his sword once was just enough to kill the enemy without wasting any power.

The other Heavenly Venerates were also showing their power. Someone smashed out with a hammer, and a silver light flashed. A seal could just vaguely be glimpsed, but was completely indistinct.

Peng, at the smash of the hammer, silver lightning spread out, and a dozen monsters were instantly sent flying, their entire bodies covered by flashing silver light. They fell into a paralyzed state, and were then struck by the Heavenly Venerates behind them, who instantly killed them in a clean sweep.

Here, greater emphasis was placed on cooperation.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. He asked the Empress and Ling Jianxue to follow behind him, while he acted as the spearhead, charging forward all the way.

He brandished the Divine Demon Sword, sweeping everything in front of him.

The Empress also raised a Heavenly Venerable Seal in her palm, and delivered a blast. Boom, her battle prowess increased by at least 10 times, and simultaneously caused dozens of nearby monsters to be sent flying, turning into a bloody foam while they were still in mid-air.

It had to be known that although she was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, she had the battle prowess of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so her destructive power was of course terrifying.

Ling Jianxue’s battle prowess was much inferior. He was merely an average First Tier Heavenly Venerate. He had neither a Heavenly Venerate Tool nor any Heavenly Venerable Seals. He hadn’t even learned any Heavenly Venerate Technique, so his battle prowess could only be considered ordinary.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel guilty inwardly; he would definitely teach his son a Heavenly Venerate Technique in the future, but the acquisition of Devouring Metal would depend on luck. It wasn’t something one could obtain as one desired. As for Heavenly Venerable Seals, one could only come across them by chance.

Fortunately, the assault this time wasn’t that fierce. After only seven days, the fighting subsided.

No one spoke of celebration or the like. Everyone immediately proceeded to rest, repair the city wall, and then bury their comrades.

Here there was also a leaderboard of battle merits, and the rules were exactly the same. One was the general leaderboard, while the other was the recent leaderboard, and the time to update was also once every 1,000 years.

The last update was seven years ago, so it was still way too early until the next update.

Ling Han called his son over, and taught the Five Elements Lightning Technique and the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll to him. These two were relatively easy to cultivate. Of course, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had also been taught to Ling Jianxue, but it would require a lot of material support, so cultivating it was going to be much slower.

After the end of a battle, everyone hastened to cultivate and strive for an early breakthrough. If they could defeat Hysteria in the eighth layer of space, they would be able to get rid of the scourge once and for all1.

There were still some people who went out to hunt the scattered monsters. These monsters feared no death when they were first created, but they also had no intelligence at all. However, they were Heavenly Venerates, after all, and if they were to remain in this space long enough, they would quickly start to develop intelligence.

Once they did, it would be too difficult to kill this kind of Heavenly Venerate. If one party insisted on escaping, they could not be stopped at all without the other party having an advantage in numbers.

Therefore, they had to be eliminated as soon as possible.

A very long time ago, everyone had ignored these wandering soldiers. As a result, their numbers had increased after a few years, and they had joined forces to attack the city, causing horrific damage. After learning this lesson, everyone would set out to wipe out these wandering soldiers lest they became a threat every time the battle ended.

Ling Han also planned on setting out as he had always believed that fighting was the fastest way to improve one’s cultivation level.

“Ling Han!” Before he could set off, he saw a young Heavenly Venerate approaching with a smile on his face. “Are you heading out of the city to hunt those monsters? Let’s go together and take care of each other.”

Ling Han cast a glance at the other party. At this moment, he didn’t know if the other party really wanted to go together with him, or if there was some ulterior motive.

He thought for a while, and then smiled. “Okay.”
