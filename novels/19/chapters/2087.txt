Chapter 2088: Poison

Ling Han thought for a while, and then clapped his hands. “There’s only one way!”

He had absolutely zero trust in Fan Luoling’s abilities. She had to have obtained this kind of result through cheating, and in the area of Spirit Refinement, he only had to have a clear victory over her, and it would definitely be no issue for him to surpass her results.

The only one in his way was Lin Yongchang, and Ling Han originally should have been ranked ahead of him. He only had to even out the gap between them, and he would be able to get first place.

Since he was so determined to seek death, what could be done?

“Ling Han, you’ve gone mad!” Fu Yue came back to his senses, and hurriedly called out after a moment of being stunned.

Ling Han really had gone crazy. To actually want to kill an heir of the Ancient Alchemy Tower in Hundred Dragons City? Just how tired of life was he?

“Then what you mean is that I should just bear with this kind of injustice?” Ling Han looked at him.

Fu Yue couldn’t help but be rendered speechless. However, he immediately said, “But you definitely cannot do this. There is absolutely no way you would succeed. This is Hundred Dragons City, and there would be Ascending Origin Tier elites standing guard in the alchemy chamber. If you want to commit a crime, the only one who will die is you.”

Ling Han broke into a grin. “That’s right. It would be much too dangerous.”

“En, en, en.” Fu Yue quickly nodded.

Ling Han patted his shoulder. “Then you make the move for me.”

Fu Yue immediately wanted to throw up blood. He had no wish to be dragged in.

“I can’t make a move, and it’s pointless even if you want to as you’re too weak.” Ling Han withdrew his hand while commenting disdainfully about Fu Yue at the same time.

“That’s right.” Hu Niu clapped her hands to express her agreement.

“En, trash.” The Empress was the same as well.

Fu Yue was about to go crazy. Why were the brains of these people so different from others? It was not a question of whether it was possible to kill Lin Yongchang at all, but rather the problem was that the latter could not be touched or killed. That could cause a gigantic storm.

“However, there is someone that can,” Ling Han said smilingly, his gaze turned on Xiao Gu.

“However, there is someone that can.” Xiao Gu saw this, and thought that Ling Han was playing with him, involuntarily imitating his words.

“Xiao Gu, help me kill a person.”

“Xiao Gu, help me…” Xiao Gu copied every single word.

Ling Han breathed a sigh. To have Xiao Gu kill someone for him seemed to be unrealistic. Aside from imitating words, this guy would only passively defend. The only thing that could make him actively attack would be the cultivators of the alternative cultivation system.

What to do now?

Furthermore, it was indeed like what Fu Yue had said. Lin Yongchang was an heir of the Ancient Alchemy Tower, and the defenses around him would definitely be very strong. To kill him in absolute secrecy was not very realistic.

Even if Xiao Gu was willing to move, with the silly temperament of this guy, the whole world would probably find out in the end.

Then, Xiao Gu would also have to be set aside for now.

“Yi, I got it!” Ling Han suddenly smacked his thigh. “Success would have to depend on my luck.”

He moved out alone, heading towards the alchemy palace, but he was not aiming for Lin Yongchang, but rather searching for an alchemy chamber.

The next contest was Spirit Refinement, and a tool needed for Spirit Refinement would be… a ready-made alchemical pill.

To ensure that there was no cheating taking place, such alchemical pills were prepared by the Ancient Alchemy Tower, but they were all One-Star alchemical pills. Thus, there was no need to worry even if Spirit Refinement failed, as loss would be limited.

What Ling Han hoped was that the users of these alchemical pills had been prearranged. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He used the Regulations of Space, his figure moving like a ghost. Even a Dividing Soul Tier elite would find it very difficult to discover any traces of him.

However, this would not be able to fool Immortal Palace Tiers.

“Who is it!” A figure suddenly raced out of his room. It was a man of astonishingly tall build. His face was filled with suspicion. He had clearly sensed an unfamiliar presence, but when he came out, he had not discovered anything at all.

Had he been cultivating too hard recently, and gone mad?

He surveyed for another while, and then only did this man return to his chambers.

Ling Han came out of the Black Tower. This was his true support, and Regulations of Space was only adding on to the perfection.

Xiu, that large man raced out again, the suspicion in his expression even more pronounced. That was because he had once again sensed that unfamiliar presence, but he did not find anything when he ran out, which made him feel like he was about to go crazy.

He circled around in the vicinity, and then returned to his room.

Ling Han once again appeared from the Black Tower, and leaped forwards.

Xiu, that large guy ran out again.

His eyes were even a little bloodshot by now. What was going on here? Had he really gone crazy?

This time, he used his divine sense to carefully search every inch of the ground, but still did not discover anything, making him almost want to tug at his hair in irritation.

Peng, he went into his room, and slammed the doors heavily behind him.

When Ling Han appeared once more, the large man did not appear again. He probably really thought that he had gone mad, and was having a serious case of delusions.

“Actually, there is no need to go to so much trouble,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up. “You only have to activate the Source Powers of heaven and earth, and even a Celestial King would find it very hard to discover your presence.”

“Hmm?”

“Since the Source Powers of heaven and earth contain the words ‘heaven and earth’, they naturally are a portion of the heaven and earth. If you use the Source Powers, you would be one with the heaven and earth. Even a Celestial King would not deliberately do a sweep with their divine sense, and thus it would be impossible to discover your presence.”

‘F***.’ Ling Han gritted his teeth. “Why didn’t you tell me earlier about such an important matter?”

“Looks like I have thought too highly of your intelligence. I thought you would have thought of it,” Small Tower said.

Small Tower was again treating him with disdain.

Ling Han did not bother with it. He used the Source Power of Wood—because the wood and earth in this great palace was present the most. Since he did not have the Source Power of Earth, he could only use the Source Power of Wood.

Weng, divine sense swept out, directly passing over him without the slightest pause.

This was an Ascending Origin Tier elite!

Ling Han nodded. It was just as how Small Tower had said, this elite treated him like a tree in the alchemy palace, and naturally would not pay overly much attention to him.

Going by that logic, should he change his mind, and directly head to kill off Lin Yongchang?

This thought only flashed through his mind before disappearing. The moment he moved, his aura would be immediately exposed without reservations. Even if he managed to enter into the Black Tower in time, and his appearance was not glimpsed by that Ascending Origin Tier elite, he only had to leave behind a trace of his aura, and that would be even worse than having someone actually glimpse his appearance.

It was because appearances could be changed, while auras could not… At least it was very, very hard to do so.

He had best just do as he had planned. Unless the situation differed from what he thought. In that case, he would go and seek out Lin Yongchang. Even if he did not kill him, he would draw him into the Black Tower, imprisoning him till he was satisfied.

He searched for a long while, and finally arrived at the alchemy chamber.

‘Lucky, there are no protective formations!’ Ling Han smiled.

True, with an Ascending Origin Tier elite standing guard, what need was there for defense here?

Ling Han pushed open the doors, and searched around inside.

‘As expected!’

He found a rack, and there were 100 boxes on the rack. There were three alchemical pills that had not undergone Spirit Refinement yet placed in each box. Furthermore, a person’s name was written down on each box, and they were all the people who had advanced to the third round.

‘Lin Yongchang.’ Ling Han immediately found the box that had Lin Yongchang’s name written down on it. It was the first box on the first shelf. After he opened it, he took out the Red Spotten Poison Fruit. There was a pitifully small amount, merely a few drops of liquid.

He cautiously dripped it on one of the alchemical pills. It was not that he did not want to drip the poison on the other two alchemical pills, but rather that the poison had been used up.

“I’ll give you a way of survival. If you only execute Spirit Refinement on one or two, and just coincidentally avoided this one, that would really be your luck,” Ling Han said.

If it were not Lin Yongchang and Yuan Tongguang who had used such underhanded means in the first place, he would not have condescended to do this, either, but who asked them to be underhanded first? In that case, he could only say sorry.
