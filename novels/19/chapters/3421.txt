Ling Han was astonished.

Previously, Inscription Tier elites were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. There were only the Four Great Generals, Grand Tutor Hong, and a few elder Imperial Princes. They could really be counted on one’s fingers.

But now?

Aside from the Four Great Generals and the others, who were still stagnant, the Imperial Princes had all advanced into Enlightenment Tier. In fact, the Eldest Imperial Prince had even become a Mystery Realm Tier.

There was also the Demon Race. There might not be a large number of Inscription Tier elites, but there were still hundreds of them.

But now that he had come out on this trip? Great, there was an ordinary mountain resident who ingested Treasured Fruits and directly became an Inscription Tier elite.

All of a sudden, it was as if a jar of Inscription Tiers had been knocked over and they were spilled all over the place. It was no longer as high and mighty as before.

This so-called Young Master Gao was actually also an Inscription Tier elite.

However, it was clear that this person hadn’t been forcefully upgraded after ingesting the Strengthening Origin Fruit. His aura was powerful and stable, and it was clear that he had cultivated to this level through hard work.

This kind of prodigy would definitely not appear out of thin air.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up, and he asked, “Hidden clan?”

Young Master Gao faltered upon hearing this. However, before he could even speak, the other eight people were already stunned.

“How do you know?”

“Our Lu Clan has already lived in seclusion for more than 2000 years. I never thought that someone would actually know?”

“Brat, who exactly are you?”

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle. Was this what a stupid teammate was?

Lu Gao humphed, and said, “Who would’ve thought that you knew about the hidden clans!”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. He had initially thought that the Jin Clan was the only hidden clan that remained. He hadn’t imagined that there were other clans. Since there were two clans, perhaps there would be a third clan, a fourth clan, and so on.

“Since you know that we come from a hidden clan, you should understand that we are the true rulers of this planet. All the ancient sites belong to us!” Lu Gao said.

Yi, your skin is really quite thick.

First, it was Jin Shaojian, who thought too highly of himself. This Lu Gao was not much better either.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’ve seen quite a number of shameless people. You can be ranked among them.”

“How dare you!” Lu Gao roared. He raised his palm and launched a strike at Ling Han.

Shua, a strong gust of wind swept past, bringing with it dark blue high-level energy, which turned into a saber that rapidly slashed over.

Ling Han clenched a fist to parry, and also sent out a burst of energy.

Peng, the two flashes of Qi crashed into each other, creating a powerful shockwave. Instantly, all the tables and chairs in the palace were blasted into smithereens.

“Hmm?” Astonishment spread across Lu Gao’s face. He had actually failed to gain an upper hand in this exchange. This was far beyond his expectations.

Though he was only a Two Inscriptions elite, his battle prowess had already surpassed the peak stage of Five Inscriptions. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so confident, thinking that even Hong Tianbu was no match for him.

Of course, he definitely didn’t believe that Hong Tianbu had the ability to battle with a disadvantage of a major tier. It was not only Hong Tianbu, but no one else could do it.

Ling Han was actually able to withstand a casual strike from him. This was slightly surprising to him.

“You have some skill. No wonder you dare to be insolent in front of me!” Lu Gao said coldly, but he was still filled with confidence, because he had not used his full strength at all just now.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “If you want to fight, be straightforward. Don’t be so wishy-washy. I’m not here to watch you perform.”

Lu Gao looked at Ling Han, and after a while, he said, “You claim to be the second Hong Tianbu, and you do indeed have some abilities. Then, I’ll subdue you, train you a bit, and have you defeat Hong Tianbu. Only then will that be able to show how strong I am.”

“Young Master Gao, you are really too brilliant,” the person beside him hurriedly flattered.

“Haha, even one of Young Master Gao’s subordinates has defeated Hong Tianbu. Then, the world would be stunned by Young Master Gao’s strength.”

“I’m really looking forward to it. What bullsh*t Hong Tianbu, he actually dares to name himself as the freak that suppresses the heavens. Has he asked our Young Master Gao first?”

Meanwhile, someone looked at Ling Han and shouted, “Brat, our Young Master Gao is willing to take you as a subordinate. Hurry up and kneel down to thank him!”

“You have to know that Young Master Gao is the most generous person. He will often bestow Treasured Fruits, cultivation techniques, and secret techniques on his subordinates. This is your great fortune!”

“Come and thank him!”

These people all spoke at once, as if becoming Lu Gao’s dog was really an incredibly fortunate thing.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head, saying, “Hahahaha, what a joke. A few frogs at the bottom of a well are shouting and jumping around! Hurry up, attack if you want to. If you don’t, I’m going to call it a day. I don’t have time to waste with trash like you.”

“Humph! You’ll definitely regret rejecting my kindness!” Lu Gao said coldly.

He charged over, and xiu, he suddenly burst out at three times the speed of sound. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived in front of Ling Han, and delivered a palm strike.

Ling Han also activated his movement technique, exchanging blows with Lu Gao.

Peng, peng, peng! The two of them exchanged blows, and after a few probes, they burst out with their full strength, but the two of them were equal in strength. However, if they exchanged blows like this, it would depend on whose mystical power and physical power was stronger, and this could last for a longer time.

Xiu, Lu Gao stepped back. He looked at Ling Han, and said, “What level of cultivation are you? You can actually last so long under my hands.”

Ling Han chuckled, but did not reveal his own cultivation level. In any case, even if he told him the truth, he would not believe him.

—What, there was someone that could fight him to a tie even though there was a difference of a major tier in cultivation level? Wasn’t that a joke?

“Why don’t we just battle? Why are you spouting so much nonsense?” He took the initiative to charge out. This Lu Gao could be said to be a very good opponent, possessing the strength to sweep aside Inscription Tier elites. If he compared himself to him, it could be said that they were evenly matched.

“What an arrogant brat!” Lu Gao said through gritted teeth. He naturally wouldn’t cower, and he continued to exchange blows with Ling Han.

This Lu Gao was indeed very strong. Multiple secret techniques appeared one after another, which allowed Ling Han to enjoy the battle very much.

Pa!

There was a flash of fireworks in the distance, and after Lu Gao caught a glimpse of it, he immediately stopped, and said, “Consider yourself lucky. The next time we meet, if you don’t submit, I’ll kill you!”

After saying this, he hurriedly left with the other eight people, as if something incredible had happened.

Ling Han didn’t give chase, not wanting to waste any more time.

Though he had gone all out just now, he had not used any ultimate moves. To speak of nothing else, once Absolute Fairness was used, it was guaranteed that he would be able to deal with the other within ten moves.

“Father, should we also join in on the excitement?” Second Baby pointed into the distance. That was where the fireworks had gone off.

Ling Han nodded. It was possible that a treasure had appeared there, and that was why the other members of the Lu Clan had sent out a signal, summoning Lu Gao over to participate in the competition.

He moved out as well. The palaces here were all built on steep cliffs, and there was no way to walk at all. They could only climb the cliffs, which was very dangerous.

One adult, seven small kids, eight people all climbed the wall. This was naturally no big deal for them, while the perverted pig was thrown into the Essence Nurturing Gourd by Ling Han.

Very quickly, they arrived at this palace.

There was a massive plaza in front of the palace, and at present, there were two groups of people standing off against each other in the plaza. Both groups had a considerable number of people, with 22 on one side and 25 on the other.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. On one side, it was the Jin Clan, and on the other, it was the Lu Clan. The two hidden clans had come into conflict..
