Chapter 1417 Freakish Recovery Ability

‘holy f*ck! are you a freak?!’

everyone was stunned speechless.

this was far too astonishing. ling han’s body had already been beaten beyond recognition, yet he had actually managed to recover in the blink of an eye? if he were so freakish, why didn’t he ascend heaven?!

however, their feelings of shock instantly transformed into greed the very next instant. their breathing quickened, and a bright glimmer appeared in their eyes.

this was definitely the effect of some supreme cultivation technique. after all, they hadn’t seen ling han ingesting any alchemical pill or activating any rare treasure!

even if activating this cultivation technique required a huge sacrifice, the fact that it could instantly heal one’s wounds was still an invaluable life-saving ability.

for example, if one were severely wounded during a battle with a foe, yet they suddenly recovered to their peak condition again, this would give them a huge advantage regardless of whether they decided to counterattack or flee.

how could there exist such an incredible cultivation technique in this world?

‘i want it! i want it! i want it!’

the heavenly body tier elites were all filled with greed as they stared at ling han. even the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor were no different. compared to his cultivation technique, it was as if they could put empress luan xing aside first.

in this world, strength was the most important quality. with strength, one could naturally attain power, status, women, and anything else they desired!

right now, snatching the cultivation technique from ling han could increase their strength.

“very well, very well! however, how many strikes can you withstand?” the eternity sky emperor launched another attack, throwing a punch that seemed ordinary at first glance. however, this strike enveloped the entire surroundings, and it was like an emperor descending from the heavens. would its subjects dare to resist its might?

meanwhile, the jade drop emperor didn’t launch another attack. he was biding his time, waiting for ling han to reveal his weakness after blocking the eternity sky emperor’s attack. when the opportunity showed itself, he would deal ling han the killing blow, just like the eternity sky emperor had done so before.

“motherf*cker!” ling han raised his arm and tossed a large handful of flying fire pills toward the eternity sky emperor. the jade drop emperor had activated his dao manifestation just then, and his colossal body would have dispersed the might of the flying fire pill, reducing its effects.

however, the eternity sky emperor hadn’t activated his dao manifestation, so wasn’t he asking for a serving of flying fire pills?

boom, boom, boom, boom!

there was a string of deafening explosions, and even the surrounding air was twisted and distorted. the nearby heavenly body tier elites were all thrown off their feet and sent flying back. from this, one could tell just how many flying fire pills ling han had tossed.

the eternity sky emperor wore a livid expression as blood dripped from his right hand. he had actually been wounded by the attack just then!

although this was only a tiny wound, it was a wound that had been caused by a measly elite at the medium extreme of the heavenly body tier! he couldn’t help but feel utterly humiliated.

emperors couldn’t be humiliated!

he roared in fury as he finally activated his dao manifestation, transforming into a flaming giant that measured 3000 meters in height. he was like an ancient god of flames.

he then raised his foot and stomped down on ling han.

there was a sense of profound contempt behind his attack. he was going to stomp on ling han, and what could lin han do about this?

he possessed a crushing advantage in both cultivation and power, and his dao manifestation further magnified this advantage manyfold. without even needing to aim, he could easily flatten ling han and the small mountain behind him.

of course, no one knew whether the secret room built into the small mountain would collapse or not. however, they believed that it wouldn’t. otherwise, it would be far too weak.

ling han leaped into the sky. he was on the back foot because he had to guard the small mountain behind him. his wife was cultivating in seclusion inside this mountain.

he could shed blood, but he couldn’t retreat!

ling han activated tide of the ages once again. however, like before, he was brutally beaten into the ground. meanwhile, the jade drop emperor seized this opportunity to attack.

boom!

ling han couldn’t dodge, and his body was twisted out of shape again. he had suffered devastating wounds.

he circulated another drop of indestructible true fluid. however, even the effects of the indestructible true fluid would decrease significantly when used in quick succession. ling han only managed to heal his wounds completely after circulating two drops of indestructible true fluid. even so, the speed of his recovery was still evidently slower than before.

however, this still rendered everyone speechless with shock. this astonishing healing technique could actually be used numerous times in quick succession?!

ling han wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth before saying in disdain, “you two truly cooperate well. have you been together for so long and f*cked each other so much that you’ve developed tacit understanding?”

been together for long? f*cked until they developed tacit understanding?

what kind of f*cking drivel was this?

the expressions of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor changed drastically. the mouth of this brat was far too toxic. he had actually dared to slander them, the rulers of majestic empires!

“you’re truly seeking death!”

ling han laughed loudly as he bent his body like a bow and activated the annihilating dragon star arrow. the pupils of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor contracted slightly. they could sense the formidable might of this arrow.

even they could sense its might, so it went without saying that the others could also sense its might. in fact, those under the consummate level of the heavenly body tier were all drenched in cold sweat. it was as if they would face certain death if they were targeted by ling han’s arrow.

at this instant, neither the eternity sky emperor nor the jade drop emperor made a move.

this was because ling han had not only activated the annihilating dragon star arrow, but even imbued it with a wisp of heaven’s might.

this was incredibly threatening!

however, the two emperors were both king tiers, after all. how confident were king tiers? moreover, their cultivation levels were also far above that of ling han. thus, they quickly regained their composure, killing intent bursting from their bodies. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

they exchanged a glance, and they both discovered the determination in each other’s eyes.

even if they couldn’t capture empress luan xing today, they would still definitely kill ling han!

this young man was far too terrifying. he was not even 500 years old, yet he already possessed such devastating power, so how much would he grow if he were given another 500 years?

he would threaten the very existence of their two majestic empires!

‘we have to kill him. we definitely have to kill him today and snatch his cultivation technique. i’ll then capture empress luan xing and keep her in my chambers forever.’

upon thinking of empress luan xing’s ethereal beauty, they couldn’t help but feel a jolt in their hearts. what did it matter that they were king tiers? they still felt an urge to howl in lust and excitement.

“before our absolute might, what use is resistance?” the eternity sky emperor unsheathed a sword. of course, this wasn’t the nine demons sword. however, the might of this sword was still tremendous, with sword qi soaring into the sky. this was the most powerful god tool among the heavenly body tier.

the jade drop emperor also wore a solemn expression as an emerald spear slowly burst out from his body. this was the ancestral weapon of the jade drop majestic empire. although it wasn’t at the eternal river tier, it was still worthy of being called a paramount god tool of the heavenly body tier.

both emperors were apprehensive of ling han’s potential. if they couldn’t kill him here, who knew what kind of terrifying threat he would pose in the future. in any case, ling han possessed a supreme cultivation technique that they were hell-bent on snatching.

“comparing god tools?” ling han asked with a cold chuckle. with a thought, the divine demon sword immediately materialized in the air above his head, columns of divine light flowing down from its body. it was only a level 10 god tool, yet it was countless times more domineering than the sword and spear of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor.

it was as if the divine demon sword were saying, “i am heaven, and you must bow down to me!”

everyone was stunned. this was merely a sword, so how could it release such a domineering aura?

little did they know that the divine demon sword was forged from a material that would eventually evolve into divine metal. combined with ling han’s martial intent, it more so possessed the formidable aura of heaven’s might. thus, it naturally possessed a domineering and transcendent aura.

in terms of quality alone, the divine demon sword was far, far transcendent above the level of ling han.

meanwhile, ling han held a wooden sword in his hand. this was a powerful weapon from the netherworld. although he was unable to awaken it, this didn’t prevent him from using it as an ordinary weapon. moreover, as long as this wooden sword tasted blood, its destructive ability wouldn’t be weaker than that of the divine demon sword.

the divine demon sword radiated with a brilliant divine light, rendering the eternity sky emperor’s sword and the jade drop emperor’s spear dull and spiritless. it was as if they weren’t god tools at all. in fact, even the violent aura of the wooden sword was suppressed, making it seem far more obedient than normal.

before the might of a celestial tool, everything was as weak as trash!
