Chapter 1025: Aura of the Demon Master

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Y-you can’t kill me! Otherwise, my master will never forgive you!” Guo Xiuwen said shakily.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I thought that someone as freakish and ruthless as you would also be ruthless toward themselves. How are you so cowardly?”

Ling Han threw Luo Wu’s corpse aside.

It was genuinely a corpse now as the True Origin Stones inside had already been extracted and the formations carved into it destroyed. Apart from its bones being relatively sturdy, this corpse had little difference from other ordinary corpses.

“You created this puppet, am I correct?” Ling Han pointed at the corpse, and continued, “You were ruthless enough to dig the organs out from others, yet you’re afraid of suffering a similar fate?”

Guo Xiuwen shuddered in fright, and frantically explained, “I-i-i-it’s different! That’s only a piece of raw material, not a human!”

Ling Han was slightly astonished. Guo Xiuwen’s outlook on life was already completely twisted. He was clearly a coward, yet he was somehow able to commit such disgusting atrocities. Ling Han slapped him across the face, and said, “I don’t want to read your disgusting memory, so answer my questions!”

Shui Yanyu walked over and placed her sword on Guo Xiuwen’s neck. “What’s the point of speaking with such people? They’re better off dead!”

“No! No!” Guo Xiuwen was extremely terrified. “Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! I’ll tell you everything that you want to know! Please don’t kill me!” The sound of pissing could be heard as Guo Xiuwen shrieked in terror. He had wet himself in fright.

Shui Yanyu hurriedly pinched her nose as she retreated into the distance.

Ling Han also wanted to give him a good hard kick. There truly weren’t many people who were as cowardly as him. “Tell me everything you know,” he said coldly.

Guo Xiuwen nodded vigorously, and said, “As you wish, as you wish. I’ll speak, I’ll tell you everything!”

He started to tell a story.

He had already become Pei Ji’s disciple over 30,000 years ago. At that time, he was only six or seven years old. Perhaps he was two years older than that, or perhaps he was two years younger than that. It was too long ago, so his memory of that time had already become hazy.

In these 30,000 years, he had learned martial arts and puppet-making from Pei Ji. During that time, Pei Ji had also taken in four more disciples.

Guo Xiuwen had initially been unaware of how he had become Pei Ji’s disciple, yet he saw a shadow of himself on his four junior brothers’ bodies.

Although this island was isolated, the sea was no stranger to all kinds of unforeseen circumstances. There were tsunamis and there were pirates, and in the decades and centuries that passed, people would occasionally drift over to this island. However, none of them could escape the fate of being refined into a puppet by Pei Ji.

Sometimes, there were children among those who arrived, and Pei Ji would choose a few talented ones to become his disciples. If he later discovered that there was no value in raising them, he would kill them without mercy.

Thus, Guo Xiuwen deduced that he himself was also the descendant of someone who had drifted here. His parents had been killed by Pei Ji, yet due to his relatively good talent, he was spared by Pei Ji and even taken in as a disciple.

He had been too young at that time, so he was unable to remember any of these events. Or perhaps he had been traumatized so much that these memories were suppressed in some hidden corner of his brain.

However, even if he knew the truth, he still didn’t dare develop any shred of hatred toward Pei Ji. After all, Pei Ji had two pseudo-Sun Moon Tier puppets. Even if he and the other four disciples were to team up, they would still be easily insta-killed by these two puppets.

Pei Ji was an outstanding puppeteer, yet it seemed like he had experienced some dramatic event that made him uninterested in developing his talents. Instead, he chose to become a tyrant on this island, someone who brought nightmares to those who drifted to this place.

As for Pei Ji’s background and history, Guo Xiuwen knew absolutely nothing. He merely knew that the colossal pit was extremely mysterious. A peculiar mist-like matter would drift out from it every year, and if it was fused into a puppet’s body, it would cause the puppet to become much stronger than before.

Moreover, creating a puppet usually took several months, yet with the help of the divine mist, this time would be compressed into a mere few days.

‘Divine mist?’

Ling Han’s interest was piqued, and he said, “Where is it? Show me.”

Guo Xiuwen trembled nervously as he crawled up and opened a drawer. He retrieved a jade vial, and said, “The divine mist is enclosed in here.” He lowered his head to hide the viciousness that was flashing across his eyes.

This divine mist was extremely helpful in creating puppets, but it would corrode one’s divine sense if they were to directly inhale it. It would transform one into a puppet-like tool whose only aim was to kill. The only difference was that they wouldn’t listen to commands.

Once he dealt with Ling Han, Guo Xiuwen wouldn’t be afraid of the remaining woman in the least.

Ling Han accepted the vial, but didn’t immediately open it up. Instead, he tossed Guo Xiuwen into the Black Tower, and then entered with Shui Yanyu.

He was about to examine an unknown substance, so it was naturally the safest to do so in the Black Tower.

“Small Tower, can you determine what this is?” Ling Han tossed the jade vial into the air.

Pa!

With a thought, the jade vial instantly exploded into pieces.

A wisp of black mist instantly streaked into the air and shifted into all kinds of forms. It transformed into the shape of a beast, then a bird, and then a human who had a single horn on their head and a tail extending from their rear.

Small Tower appeared, and exclaimed in unison with Ling Han, “Demonic Qi!”

This was definitely Demonic Qi—Ling Han had seen this substance in the Lower Realm before. Although there was only a wisp of it, it was far more powerful than the aura of the Asura Demon Emperor. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

‘That’s right!’

A thought flashed through Ling Han’s mind, and the Asura Demon Emperor was immediately brought before him. This demon had been confined in the Black Tower this entire time.

“My respects to master! Master’s fortune is shared with Heaven, and Master’s lifespan is eternal and boundless!” The Asura Demon Emperor was extremely obsequious, and his behavior was completely typical of a base person. He glanced at Shui Yanyu, and instantly dropped down on his knees. “My respects to Master’s wife! Master has such refined taste! Master’s wife is as beautiful as a celestial maiden, and her aura is brimming with nobility and elegance. She’s definitely a beauty who only appears once every hundreds of millions of years!”

Shui Yanyu was completely dumbstruck. ‘How can there be such an obsequious person? Does he have no face?’

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Enough with the nonsense. Hurry up and check this Demonic Qi out. Tell me about its origin.”

“As you wish, as you wish!” The Asura Demon Emperor hurriedly nodded and bowed before turning his gaze to the wisp of Demonic Qi. His smoke-like body involuntarily quaked, and he stuttered, “This... this... this is a wisp of Demonic Qi from a Demon Master!”

“Demon Master?” Ling Han glared at him, and said, “Explain more clearly.”

The Asura Demon Emperor was completely void of any temper now, and he immediately started to nod and bow again. “In the Immortal Realm, those who have reached the Genesis Tier are referred to as Saints. In the Netherworld, however, those who have reached the Genesis Tier are referred to as Demon Masters.”

Shui Yanyu was astonished by the sight of the Asura Demon Emperor, and she interjected, “This is a demon from the Netherworld?”

“This lowly demon is indeed from the Netherworld. As expected, the eyes of Master’s wife radiate with a brilliance that sees through all of my thoughts.” The Asura Demon Emperor flattered Shui Yanyu relentlessly.

Ling Han was astounded by the revelation. ‘This wisp of aura was left by a Demon Master whose rank is equivalent to the Genesis Tier?

‘Hang on... Wasn’t there a suppressed passageway in the Flame Cave of the Heavenly Sea Mystery Realm? And wasn’t there a being who referred to itself as Demon Master Zhen Yi trying to break through the passageway and enter this realm?’

Gasp!

He had actually quarreled with a great elite at the Genesis Tier!

“The beauty of Master’s wife is like the sun in the sky that blinds one with its dazzling radiance! The aura of Master’s wife is like the brilliant moon whose chastity makes one drop their head in shame!” The Asura Demon Emperor knew no shame as he continued to praise and flatter Shui Yanyu. However, at some point in time, he suddenly lunged toward the wisp of Demonic Qi in the air.

“Hahahaha! Once I fuse with this wisp of Demonic Qi, my power will soar rapidly, and I’ll recover a battle prowess of the Mountain River Tier! Killing you two will be as easy as slaughtering defenseless chickens!” The Asura Demon Emperor laughed excitedly as it neared the wisp of Demonic Qi.
