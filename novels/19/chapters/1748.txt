Chapter 1749: Bei Xuanming issues a challenge

In this place, only two people had passed for now: Xiao Sheng and Changsun Liang.

Changsun Liang only nodded at Ling Han, and did not approach to greet him. There was no need to rush things.

Xiao Sheng’s eyes were spitting fire. Previously, he had been beaten like a punching bag and kicked around like a ball by Ling Han and the Empress. This was the greatest humiliation he had ever experienced in this lifetime. Before breaking through, he was sure that there was no way that he could match Ling Han and the Empress, but it was a different story now that he had advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier.

This was a reshuffling of cards in terms of strength.

He had attained a flawless severance. Thus, even if Ling Han had similarly achieved a flawless severance, his battle prowess could not possibly be all that much higher than his. Then, his bountiful battle experience and various secret techniques would be extraordinarily effective.

He was going to get his vengeance!

“Who do you think you are!” Fu Gaoyun suddenly spoke up. Without any prior sign, he made his move, and threw out a punch at Xiao Sheng.

Though Xiao Sheng was caught off guard, as a first severance elite, as well as a king tier of the present generation, his reaction speed naturally would not be slow. He immediately shot out, and rapidly leaped backwards.

However, a second severance would completely dominate a first severance, and this was a fact that had never been wrong throughout the ages—except when one encountered the level of freaks the likes of Ling Han and the Empress. How could Xiao Sheng possibly manage to escape completely?

The power that Fu Gaoyun shot out formed a fist that landed on Xiao Sheng, and this was still because the latter had managed to dodge in the nick of time, and had thus escaped being hit by the fist head-on. Instead, it only scraped against him.

Even so, Xiao Sheng was still sent flying by the force. He had already begun throwing up blood like mad even while he was still in midair.

Fu Xiaoyun and the others were confused; why had Fu Gaoyun moved so suddenly?

Xiao Sheng landed, and only regained his footing after stumbling a few steps. Gritting his teeth, he asked, “May I know why Young Master Fu attacked me?”

“Didn’t you want to spar with Brother Ling?” Fu Gaoyun asked disdainfully. “Then, sparring with me is the same.”

Xiao Sheng’s eyes were spitting fire from his utter fury, and an incomparable jealousy filled his heart. So Ling Han had become good friends with the young master of the Fu Clan? Just look, he had clearly issued his challenge towards Ling Han, yet it was Fu Gaoyun who had immediately cut in.

Just how good were their relations?

Fu Xiaoyun and the others also thought the same, and similarly felt incredibly curious, especially in Fu Xiaoyun’s case. She knew very well how proud this elder brother of hers was, and it was really, really difficult for anyone to become his good friend.

“Hoho.” Fu Gaoyun shook his head. “Do you all think that I have only moved just because I call him Brother Ling? That’s right, if anyone wants to challenge my brother, I naturally will accept it on his behalf! However, even if I did not, this kind of trash would not be any match for my Brother Ling, either.”

He paused, and scanned every person’s expression before finally saying, “Just now, Brother Ling has managed to fight me on equal terms.”

‘What?!’

Fu Xiaoyun, Bei Xuanming, Xiao Sheng, and even Changsun Liang showed an expression of disbelief. ‘You’re really exaggerating too much here; it should be known that you are a second severance here!’

King tiers like them were already awesome enough, but they could only be invincible among their peers. Even if they had cultivated to the peak stage of the first severance, they could only barely manage a tie against an opponent in the early stage of the second severance. There was nothing else that could be done. Having an additional severance meant a world of difference in terms of battle prowess.

And Fu Gaoyun was not only a second severance, but also one that was in the late stage of the second severance, and was also a king tier in the second severance. In theory, even a king tier at the peak stage of the second severance could only just barely suppress him.

But now, a guy that had just advanced into the first severance actually managed to fight Fu Gaoyun to a tie? Wasn’t that a major joke?

“I don’t believe it!” Xiao Sheng immediately shouted, slightly despondent.

If these words were true, this meant that it was impossible for him to get his vengeance, at least in the level of the Severing Mundane Tier. He could only anticipate another reshuffling of cards in terms of strength after breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier. But putting aside the fact whether they would be able to reach this kind of height or not, even if they could, just how many years later would that be?

Even if he had the talent of a king tier, that would at least need 10 billion years!

Fu Gaoyun merely scoffed, not even bothering to refute him.

Did he need the agreement of this kind of trash?

“I don’t believe it, either!” Bei Xuanming declared darkly. If Ling Han had managed to fight Fu Gaoyun to a tie, then wouldn’t that mean that the former’s strength was superior to his?

He could not accept that!

If he agreed to these words, he would never be able to hold his head up in front of Ling Han again.

“So what if you don’t believe it?” Fu Gaoyun asked disdainfully. Though the strength of the Fu Clan was indeed inferior to the Lunar Sect, they were both three-star forces, and neither had to be afraid of the other.

Moreover, who knew how far the two forces were from each other. There were at least 10 three-star forces between them. Even if the Lunar Sect wanted to start a war, how were they supposed to pass over so many different forces? They could only battle their whole way through, but if they did that, then when their troops had finally arrived, the Lunar Sect would not be left with many elites, either.

Bei Xuanming naturally knew this fact as well. Thus, he did not become angry, and merely smiled faintly, and asked, “Ling Han, do you dare battle me?”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “I have been waiting for these words from you! You know, I have very much wanted to thrash that damn face of yours since long ago!”

“Ya, Brother Ling, you have that kind of feeling as well!” Fu Gaoyun immediately clapped his hands and laughed loudly. “I, too, very much want to thrash his face, but it would not be appropriate for me to do so given my identity. I will just have to delegate this mission to you.”

“It’s no big deal.” Ling Han nodded.

“The two of you!!” Bei Xuanming gritted his teeth, his killing intent blazing.

They actually dared to look down on him so much. He was the Holy Son of the Lunar Sect, an undisputed king tier.

How could the might of a king tier allow disdain to be cast upon him!

“If you’re not convinced, I’ll beat you into submission!” Ling Han took a step forward, and flicked his robes, looking very relaxed.

“Just because of your words...” Bei Xuanming said sinisterly. He had not finished speaking, but the killing intent in his eyes was already blazing like fire.

Ling Han turned and asked Fu Gaoyun, “Brother Fu, it would be all right for me to kill him, right?”

Fu Gaoyun immediately shuddered, and even his expression had turned a little gray. He hurriedly exclaimed, “Definitely not!”

You see, even he was not in the right position to thrash Bei Xuanming. That was because he would be bullying him with his superior strength, and the Lunar Sect would definitely fly into a thunderous rage. And if their Holy Son died here, the matter would become a huge issue. The Lunar Sect would have a just reason to dispatch their troops, and it was not very likely that the other forces along the way would stand in their way.

Facing the Lunar Sect that ranked in the top three amongst three-star forces in terms of strength without these shields, the Fu Clan would really be in great trouble.

“Why not?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “With your courage, Brother Fu, are you afraid of the mere Lunar Sect?”

‘I, f***, you can’t screw me over like this!’

Fu Gaoyun’s expression was filled with resentment. He had discovered that Ling Han was not only an idiot in terms of music, but also possessed the ability to make anyone go crazy.

‘I’ll call you Boss, all right?’

“Have, the, two, of, you, said, enough!!” Bei Xuanming was practically spitting out word after word, flames spurting from his gaze.

Were they treating him like air?

“You didn’t make a move all this while, so we chatted a while to pass the time.” Ling Han broke into a grin. “Come on then, what are you standing around for? Make your move so we can quickly finish the fight and go home.”

“What mad arrogance!” Bei Xuanming moved. Boom, he was filled with fury, so his first move was a powerful one. Cold light shot from his eyes, forming two swords of ice that ruthlessly stabbed out at Ling Han.
