Chapter 548: Are You Qualified?

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“What? Jia Zhang actually wants to take in this young man as a follower?”

“This brat has really gotten a big break!”

“Jia Zhang’s father is Grandmaster Kang’s youngest disciple, and he’s rumored to be shockingly talented in alchemy. His future accomplishments would be immeasurable!”

“Which Grandmaster Kang?”

“Haha, in Million Treasures City, who else would dare refer to himself as Grandmaster Kang?”

“Could he be the Heaven Grade alchemist, Kang Zi Shi, Grandmaster Kang?”

“Naturally!”

The masses released exclamations of shock; a considerable number actually directed envious looks at Ling Han. If he could become Jia Zhang’s follower, then there would be no longer any need for him to worry about obtaining alchemical pills. One had to know that there were an unknown number of people here who wanted desperately to become Jia Zhang’s followers, but the latter would not even look at them.

Even the profligate from before could not help but feel extreme envy. Though his background was not too bad, but it was incomparable to Jia Zhang. If one was alike a dragon, then it was already very kind to compare the other to a dog.

All eyes looked at Ling Han, and no matter how they pondered, there was no chance that Ling Han would reject the offer.

Ling Han cast an eye on Jia Zhang, and said with a smile, “Are you sure you’re qualified enough for me to follow you?”

“Hahahaha!” Jia Zhang laughed loudly. “Young man, you are able to break through to the Flower Blossom Tier at such a young age, and this is indeed a commendable feat. However, from the Flower Blossom Tier onwards, there are pitifully few natural treasures that will have supplementary effects for you; you can only depend on the alchemical pills concocted by high grade alchemists.

“And my father is the disciple of a Heaven Grade alchemist. So, don’t you think that I’m qualified enough for you to follow me?”

This was indeed a fact. Before the Flower Blossom Tier, alchemical pills were more commonly used for recovery and healing, but from the Flower Blossom Tier onwards, alchemical pills would really become supplementary items that no cultivator could go without.

How tremendously difficult a feat it was to comprehend the natural Dao of this world. However, high grade alchemists were capable of extracting the natural essence from medicinal ingredients and transform them into patterns—a kind of consciousness—that would allow a cultivator to have better comprehension and increase the advancement rate of one’s cultivation.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “I see you have already broken through to the Flower Blossom Tier before thirty, so you can barely be considered a genius. In the future, you may follow by my side and be a manservant.”

Pu!

Everyone choked. This brat was really too mad, wasn’t he? He actually wanted one of the Five Dragons, Jia Zhang, to follow him? Where had he gotten such confidence to say something like that?

Jia Zhang had not foreseen this, either. He had already revealed his background, but Ling Han was not the slightest bit moved. He could not help but feel slightly stunned.

“Hahahaha, Jia Zhang, you’ve been beaten, haven’t you?” One of the other Five Dragons laughed.

“That’s right. Usually, just because you have a lot of alchemical pills, you always throw them in everyone’s faces, and now, you’ve finally thrown them at a wall of iron, haven’t you?”

Jia Zhang could not help but look angry, and said, “Wall of iron? At most it’s only a wall of wood.”

“He’s only about twenty, and is already in the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier. And you still think he’s a wall of wood?” One of the others continued to fan the flames, enjoying chaotic situations.

Jia Zhang felt humiliated, and countered, “He’s only in the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier. I would be able to suppress him single-handedly.”

“Jia Zhang, you, too, are only in the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier,” someone pointed out.

“Ha, the cultivation level may be the same, but there could be a massive gulf in battle prowess. And my battle prowess is... seven Stars!” Jia Zhang declared arrogantly.

To be able to have battle prowess surpassing five Stars, this was indeed a very terrifying thing. Usually, one with battle prowess surpassing two Stars could already be considered a genius, and five Stars was definitely a super-genius.

“Forget it!” one of the Twin Phoenixes, a girl in green robes, advised. She was extremely beautiful, not the slightest bit inferior to Liu Yu Tong or Li Si Chan. She looked like a deity with her extremely beautiful looks and touching temperament. “The auction is about to begin. It’s best to enter earlier.”

“For Miss Li’s sake, I’ll spare you this once.” Jia Zhang humphed.

Meanwhile, the other girl in red robes was a quirky one. She waved a hand at Ling Han and said, “I see that you’re waiting here, so you must not have an invitation, right? Why don’t you come with us? Our private room is big, anyway, so having one more person would be fine.”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Thank you for the invitation, but I, as a human, would prefer not to sit with cats or dogs to avoid downgrading my own status.” When he said ‘cats or dogs’, his eyes were focused on Jia Zhang, and the meaning between the lines could be no more obvious.

He was comparing Jia Zhang to an animal.

This time, not only Jia Zhang was driven furious, even the other six people were slightly displeased. They were part of Jia Zhang’s group, so didn’t that mean that they, too, were cats and dogs?

“Brat, watch your mouth!” one of them rebuked.

“Oh?” Ling Han was completely indifferent. “You all came here, and the first thing that pops out of your mouth is to make me your follower. Is that reasonable? Then call your fathers here. I’m in a good mood today, so I will take them in as my followers.”

“How, how dare you!” the Five Dragons shouted simultaneously. Had this young man lost his mind? Which one of their fathers wasn’t an important, influential figure? This young man was practically seeking his own demise. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han humphed, and said, “You feel displeased? Then, before you open your mouths, think carefully if your words would offend someone. There are some people in this world that you cannot afford to offend.”

Mad! He was really mad!

In front of the Five Dragons and Twin Phoenixes, he actually said that he was someone that they could not afford to offend, but who the f*** was he?! It could be claimed that these seven people were practically representatives of the seven strongest parties in this Million Treasures City. Added together, even the city would have to give them face.

Ling Han was only twenty years old, and such a young man himself was definitely no one too important. In terms of background, there was no way he could compare to the Five Dragons and Twin Phoenixes, so where had he gotten such self-confidence from?

One could only say that he was too mad.

“Could it be that the seven of us have not been out for too long a time that people have already forgotten our power?” one of them asked coldly. His name was Lai Qin Yun, one of the Five Dragons. The forefather of his clan was in the Deity Transformation Tier, and his background was also the worst off amongst their group. However, his personal talent in martial arts was extremely high, and he was also the one who took his place as one of the Five Dragons most seriously.

In comparison, the green-clad girl was kinder. She merely frowned slightly, and said, “Forget it, he’s merely a mad man.” Her name was Li Fei Yun. The Li Clan was an old great clan in Million Treasures City. They had a powerful Heaven Tier cultivator in their ranks, but in the last few years, there were rumors that this old monster had already fossilized, though no one knew the truth of the matter.

Meanwhile, the red-clad girl was obviously one who liked to stir up trouble. She immediately pulled Li Fei Yun back and said, “Big Sister Yun, this brat’s pride is sky-high, so let us just see if he can back it up.”

Her name was Ding Ban Xiang, and she, too, was a member of a great clan that possessed a Heaven Tier cultivator.

The Five Dragons glared at Ling Han simultaneously. All of them were giants among men and rulers of martial arts. The combined appearance of all five of them formed a terrifying pressure. Any normal cultivator in the Flower Blossom Tier would probably have shaky legs in the face of such pressure, not even being able to remain standing.

Ling Han looked like he felt nothing. These five people were indeed very strong, but they were far from the level of Yao Hui Yue and Xuanyuan Zi Guang. Even compared to Lang Wu Xin and Fei Hong, they were still far inferior, and they wanted to suppress him? What kind of joke was that?

“Are you playing a game of crossing your eyes?” he asked, smiling.

This brat was really mad; at this point, he actually still dared to tease them.

“Brat, speak your name!” Jia Zhang shouted.

“What, do you guys want to beat me up?” Ling Han asked in surprise.

“People with cheap mouths naturally should be properly disciplined!” Lai Qin Yun said coldly.
