Chapter 1023: The Shocking Truth

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Stop! Quickly, make it stop!” Shui Yanyu shouted at Guo Xiuwen.

She was not worried about Ling Han’s safety. As long as this damn pervert could not be insta-killed, then with his recovery abilities, he was an undying existence. However, who would like being the target of attack for no reason?

Guo Xiuwen bared his teeth in a grin, and replied, “Miss Shui, I have not issued any command to attack. It is completely the will of this puppet.”

“How could that be?” Shui Yanyu asked in fury. “This puppet was built by you, and if it was not by your command, why would it attack?”

“Miss Shui, have you forgotten my earlier words?” Guo Xiuwen was not the slightest bit angered, and said, “A kind of mysterious substance would seep out of the Earth’s Core Cave, and blending it into the puppet would produce an extremely amazing effect.”

“Like what?” Shui Yanyu calmed down.

Ling Han and that puppet were currently engaged in a fierce battle. For the moment, the battle would not be so easily decided. Hence, she was not anxious.

Guo Xiuwen showed a strange smile, and replied, “For example, the materials would retain a part of their memories.”

Shui Yanyu was confused. What did “retain a part of their memories” mean? What relation did that have with its attacking Ling Han?

Yet a thought streaked through Ling Han’s head. This puppet could not pose a threat to him. Hence, he was completely capable of multitasking, fighting the puppet on one side whilst listening in on the conversation between Shui Yanyu and Guo Xiuwen.

... Could it be?

His eyes turned cold, and he drew out the divine sword, striking fiercely.

Shua, shua, shua, shua. A few dozen strikes later, the pieces of cloth flew in all directions, and the bandages covering the puppet’s face were torn apart, revealing its concealed face.

“It’s, it’s, it’s...” Shui Yanyu’s eyes swept over it, and she couldn’t help but show an incredibly stunned expression. No, it should be an expression of horror.

Guo Xiuwen showed a smile similar to that of a demon, and replied, “That’s right, that’s right. Just as you can see, the raw materials of this puppet have retained a considerable amount of their memories. Hence, it began its attack even when it had not received any command from me.”

That puppet... was astonishingly Luo Wu!

Hiss, he had disappeared for quite a number of days, and had actually been made into a puppet? Or was it that this was a puppet that was merely an imitation of Luo Wu’s features?

Realization suddenly dawned on Ling Han, and he said, “No wonder you did not allow us to enter into the houses of the villagers, and did not allow us to communicate with the villagers. It’s because... they are all puppets!”

“Hahahahahaha!” Guo Xiuwen laughed loudly, and clapped his hands continuously. “That’s right, that’s right. You have guessed correctly. You really deserve to be praised. After all, there are not many people like you that can understand it with just a little hint.”

Ling Han dodged and evaded endlessly. Luo Wu was currently attacking him fiercely. When he had been alive, his strongest thought was to kill Ling Han. Hence, after he had been made into a puppet, this had become his unerasable memory.

“You, you all are practically deranged!” Shui Yanyu rebuked. Now, she was naturally aware that their earlier words were all lies, and they had no intention to prepare a ship for them to leave this island. Instead, they merely wanted to persuade them to stay here.

“Wrong, wrong. In truth, we only wanted to turn you into an eternal being!” Guo Xiuwen said, smiling. “Just think, how long would you be able to live? How many people would really be capable of breaking through to the Sun Moon Tier? At most, you would only be able to live a few hundred thousand years, but in the end, wouldn’t you still have to rot and decay, and return back to the earth?

“However, after being made into a puppet, you all would retain your current appearance eternally! Miss Shui, you are so captivating, so why don’t you retain this kind of beauty eternally!?” He stared at Shui Yanyu, his eyes becoming fanatical.

“Hehe, then why don’t you make yourselves into puppets?” Ling Han broke free of Luo Wu, and charged towards Guo Xiuwen.

“Ang!” The puppet tiger actually released a roar in rage, and the sound wave transformed into multiple circles that oscillated towards Ling Han.

Ling Han’s charging figure suddenly slowed down, and became slower and slower. The clothes on him were forcefully torn apart by the shock wave. Peng , he was suddenly sent flying.

He couldn’t help but be shocked. This puppet tiger’s abilities had actually reached the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, and it could even be a being in the late stage or peak stage.

“Hahahaha, since I have allowed you to discover the secret of this place, how could I have been unprepared?” Guo Xiuwen laughed. “However, rest assured. All of you will be made into puppets. Just the thought excites me. Having a puppet as beautiful as you, I would not complain no matter how many times I play with you every day!”

His last words were aimed at Shui Yanyu. Although this had revealed his dark, demented fetish, so what if they found out? The two of them were going to be turned into puppets shortly anyways.

Shui Yanyu was both shamed and enraged, and rebuked, “Disgusting!”

“I promise I will restore you completely. There would not be the slightest distortion.” Guo Xiuwen’s eyes flickered with an evil light. He had completely no interest in normal beauties. Only after they were made into a cold puppet would they incite his psychotic lust.

Not just him, but his master and junior brothers were all such psychos.

Hu! Hu! Hu!

Both Luo Wu and the puppet tiger were attacking Ling Han fiercely, especially the puppet tiger. Its battle prowess was as high as consummate level. Furthermore, it was not a real living creature, so it had no such thing as vital points. Its tendons and bones had all been rebuilt, so it was practically a beast-shaped weapon in itself.

Ling Han activated the divine patterns of gravity, but immediately looked strained. That puppet tiger was even heavier than Luo Wu, and if he wanted the divine patterns of gravity to take effect, it’d be a massive test for Ling Han.

With a soft shout from Shui Yanyu, she joined the battle with her sword in hand.

Guo Xiuwen, meanwhile, did not make a move. Instead, he merely watched the show from the sidelines with crossed legs, apparently very confident in his creations.

Out of these two people, one was in the early stage of the medium extreme, whereas the other was at the peak stage of the low extreme. In theory, just Luo Wu would be enough to suppress them, what more when there was still a puppet tiger that had battle prowess at the late stage of consummate level?

He was standing by here merely because he feared that these two puppets would not be holding any punches and accidentally tear Shui Yanyu apart.

“Yi!?” Very soon, he looked surprised because he discovered that Ling Han’s defenses were indeed quite frightening. He actually managed to still be standing after being on the receiving end of a combined attack of these two powerful puppets, which was inconceivable to him.

“Hahahaha, this really is a fine material gifted by the heavens!” His surprise immediately turned into great elation. “His physique is incredibly tough, and would be worth having Level Five or even Level Six Godly metal to recast his skeleton!

“Though he is only in the medium extreme of Mountain River Tier, I have the confidence to carve formation patterns for the Sun Moon Tier on his bones. At that time, he would be a puppet of Sun Moon Tier!

“Hahahaha, even Master only possesses two pseudo Sun Moon Tier puppets, and if I can create a Sun Moon Tier puppet, I would be able to replace him, and take hold of all the resources of this place!

“After killing this man, I will hide him, then lie and say that his body had been too severely damaged, hence it could not be made into a puppet. As a result, I have already gotten rid of his corpse. In any case, Master and my junior brothers only care about this woman, after all.

“When I have learnt the art of puppetry for the Sun Moon Tier, and suddenly erupt, I will become the new owner of this place!”

Xiu!

Exactly at that moment, Ling Han broke through the siege, and charged towards him.

To defeat the enemy, their chief had to be captured first!
