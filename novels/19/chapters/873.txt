Chapter 874: Bet on Another Ten Moves

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han took hold of Ding Ping, and disappeared from where he had originally stood in a flash.

Ding Ping only felt his vision blur, and discovered that he had surprisingly appeared in a forest. It took him a moment to distinguish that this was Horse Army Mountain, and was at least more than a hundred miles away from where they had initially been.

It had only been a single step, yet they had traversed more than a hundred miles?

He could not help but be dumbfounded; the extent of his master’s abilities had far exceeded his imagination.

In front of them, there was a tall, slim middle-aged man. He was as gentle as jade, and the sight of him would make anyone have a favorable impression of him.

‘Was he the person that Master was waiting for?’ Ding Ping thought.

“Brother Corpse Boss, it’s been a long time since we last met.” Ling Han clasped his fists in greeting. Although this person was a member of the Thousand Corpse Sect, Ling Han still had quite a good impression of him.

Instantly, the tension in Ding Ping’s heart relaxed. Looking at how relaxed Ling Han was acting, this person should be a friend, and not an enemy. Still, being someone whom his master would address as “Brother”, he had to be a man in the top tier of the elites of this world.

He had only thought that Ling Han had said, “Big Brother Shi” 1 ; otherwise, his hair would definitely be standing on ends in terror.

Corpse Boss could not help but grin bitterly, and said, “It’s all my fault for being greedy for wine, which exposed my location. However, Brother Ling is also very awesome. The sharpness of your senses has completely exceeded my imagination; I was sure that I would not be discovered if I came out to buy some wine.”

Ling Han smiled faintly; a person who had not established a nation would naturally not know the amazing uses of the totem. Even Ma Duo Bao, who had established his empire twice, did not know the correct position to establish a nation. He said, “Brother Corpse Boss, I only need to know an answer.”

Corpse Boss sighed, yet as he turned his eyes on Ding Ping, his eyes lit up, and he said, “This brat’s skeletal structure seems to stand out from the rest!”

“Naturally, he is my disciple,” Ling Han answered, smiling.

“You are still as confident as you have always been!” Corpse Boss smiled as well, yet shook his head, and said, “I’m afraid I cannot give you that answer.”

“I haven’t yet said what question I wanted to ask,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Brother Ling, are you looking down on my intelligence?” Corpse Boss asked with slight displeasure.

Ling Han raised his hands with a smile, and said, “All right, all right. Brother Corpse Boss, why don’t we have a bet? If you can block ten moves from me, I will let you go. If not, then you have to tell me the location of the surviving members of the Thousand Corpse Sect!”

Corpse Boss could not help but feel rueful. The first time he’d seen Ling Han, he had suggested a wager for the latter to block ten moves from him, and as long as Ling Han could do so, he would not kill him. But now, just how many years had passed? It was Ling Han’s turn to turn it around and offer him the same wager.

Could such a large gap have appeared between the strength of the two sides?

Corpse Boss could not believe it, and said darkly, “I have already raised my cultivation to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and awakened a Mystical Power. Now, my battle prowess can reach fifteen Stars, and you are confident that you can defeat me within ten moves?”

“How would you know if you don’t try?” Ling Han asked smilingly. For the last year, he had isolated himself and cultivated hard. Aside from himself, no one knew how strong his ability had become by now.

Fifteen Stars? If he wanted to, he could crush him directly.

Corpse Boss’s expression shifted continuously. If it was any other person, he would go along with the bet. Even if he lost, he could go back on his word as well; who would be able to stop a Shattering Void Tier elite if he wanted to flee? But he was different; his personality was very decisive.

He was not one who would betray his companions; at the same time, he was also one who was loyal to his word. Thus, he had to consider the consequences of his possible loss.

This caused him to feel very conflicted. On one hand, he definitely did not believe that he could not block ten moves from Ling Han, and on the other, he had to consider the possibility of his defeat.

It was only now that Ding Ping found out that Ling Han was actually on opposing sides with this person. He could not help but be shocked; as opponents, they could actually be as amiable as this towards each other?

Ling Han snickered, and said, “What is it? Is Brother Corpse Boss afraid? Actually, with the abilities of Brother Corpse Boss, why do you need to stay in the Thousand Corpse Sect? Once we split open these skies, the world would expand, and where can you not go?”

Corpse Boss’s pupils shrank, and he said, “Just slightly over a year ago, Ma Duo Bao had failed to open the skies, and you want to split open the skies as well. Are you not afraid of death?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, “As a man, what would be the harm in a glorious death? Furthermore, why would I not succeed?”

Corpse Boss became quiet. After a while, he finally said, “On the basis that you have such determination to split open the skies, I shall accept your conditions!”

Yet Ding Ping was completely at a loss; what ‘splitting open the skies’? Did that refer to actually splitting open these skies? How could the skies be opened? Additionally, it seemed like this matter was incredibly dangerous, and there was a possibility of death, which made him extremely worried.

Ling Han raised his right hand, and said, “Then, get ready to receive my blow!”

He did not even need to prepare, and directly delivered a palm strike.

Hiss! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yet, Corpse Boss was astonished. The strength of this palm strike had exceeded ten Stars! Too terrifying, too frightening!

Ordinarily, even if one had cultivated to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, his strength would only be on par with the battle prowess of nine Stars of Shattering Void Tier. Then, with use of martial arts techniques and secret techniques, his battle prowess would be able to break through the limit of nine Stars and reach ten Stars, eleven Stars, or even twelve Stars.

But when the strength itself was powerful, then the battle prowess would naturally soar accordingly, just like how he was at the peak of the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and his strength had reached ten Stars of Shattering Void Tier. With use of secret techniques, he could further increase his battle prowess by another four Stars.

This was very, very amazing.

But Ling Han?

It was obvious that he had just broken through to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier; that aura that had yet to be stabilized could not be more apparent.

He had just advanced into the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, yet his strength had already exceeded ten Stars. Then, how much farther could he raise his strength by the time he reached the real peak of Shattering Void Tier and reinforced his cultivation?

Twelve Stars? Or even thirteen Stars?

This was a f******* monster!

However, no matter how stunned Corpse Boss was, he was still an elite of two eras; his reaction speed was not the slightest bit slow. He immediately crossed his arms, forming them into sharp claws, and clawed out at Ling Han. A pattern appeared on his hands, and they actually seemed like the hands of an Immortal.

Although that skeletal hand had been snatched away by Yi Shuang Shuang, Corpse Boss had apparently still comprehended some profound mystery from it.

Thankfully, Yi Shuang Shuang had acted early on enough. If she met with Corpse Boss again now, then it would really be undecided who the victor would be.

Yet Ling Han was completely nonchalant. He lowered his right hand, and weng , a terrifying energy gushed out, trying to suppress Corpse Boss completely.

Without the slightest bit of fanciness, he directly used his power to crush all; he was really as overbearing as that!

Peng!

The two fighters came into close quarters, and their extremely powerful energy set out to form a shock wave that spread out in all directions from their clash. If their attacks clashed solidly, not only would the whole mountain range be destroyed, even the cities far off would be unable to escape this disaster; they were that strong.

Yet after these energy waves spread out as far as thirty metres, they were immediately blocked as if there was an invisible wall.

Power of the nation!

Ling Han had not used power of the nation to empower himself, but had formed it into a cage to completely control the energy that seeped out in this extremely small space.

“What!?” Corpse Boss exclaimed in shock. His eyes were filled with astonishment as if he had seen a ghost.

Strictly speaking, he was a ghost himself!

“Your power... has reached thirteen Stars!” Corpse Boss exclaimed, stunned. “How could that be!?” The gap of a single Star at the Shattering Void Tier meant a world of difference, and reaching a battle prowess of thirteen Stars with pure power was practically being a monster!

What was more terrifying, though, was the fact that Ling Han had not yet used power of the nation to empower himself.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Recently, my cultivation has become more rounded. Additionally, my body arts has also had slight improvement, and without my knowledge, my power has increased further. Sorry about that.”
