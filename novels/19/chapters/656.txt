Chapter 657: Testing Bone Age

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Henyee

“Good, good, good. What a shocking little sapling!” That ultimate elite who had just been taking a cat nap immediately snapped his eyes open, and even began clapping. As for the fact that a prodigy had just died, so what?

This place was lacking anything but prodigies. Furthermore, since he could be killed with a single strike, what else could he be but trash? He was absolutely unqualified to enter the Restore Heaven Academy.

“Little girl, what’s your name?” this great cultivator asked happily. He was the Law Keeper of the Absolute Saber Sect, and his name was Guo Liang Cai. He had the battle prowess of the Deity Transformation Tier, which was enough to suppress the current young generation. Otherwise, he would not have been able to keep watch here.

When he looked at Hu Niu, his expression was filled with tenderness. If it wasn’t for the fact that his cultivation level was too “low”, he really would want to take Hu Niu in as his true disciple.

But a little girl that was only about six or seven years old actually had the cultivation of the Spiritual Infant Tier—how could he possibly be able to teach such a prodigy? Most likely, only the sect master and the elders would be qualified for this task.

“Niu is Ling Han’s Hu Niu!” Hu Niu said in a slightly confusing way. She then ran over to Ling Han and held his hand, looking completely like a naïve, angelic little girl.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the vulgar man’s corpse still lay on the ground, around which lightning was still popping, perhaps everyone would be fooled by how pure and adorable she looked right now.

Guo Liang Cai swept a glance over Ling Han, and had his mind set. If Ling Han’s talent was nothing impressive, he would kill Ling Han so that he would not affect this little girl any further. Such an excellent little sapling would be of great use!

More importantly, she was still young, so she could be easily brainwashed, and have various ideas instilled into her.

Hu Niu once again stepped forward for her bone age to be tested. This time, even the few disciples were extremely respectful. She was one that had obtained the adoration of a Deity Transformation Tier Law Keeper. As long as one wasn’t an idiot, they should be able to tell how shocking her future prospects would be with how Hu Niu was so fierce even at such a young age...

They could only revere her.

“Seven, over seven years old, not yet eight!” Her bone age was very soon tested. However, Hu Niu was a bit angry. It was a bit painful to be poked by a needle, which caused her to glare ferociously at the disciple who had tested her bone age.

This ferocity was really very terrifying. It had even surpassed the level of the Spiritual Infant Tier. That disciple actually lost control of his bladder in fear, and stench spread out from him.

Ling Han was also surprised. He had not thought that Hu Niu had also broken through to the Spiritual Infant Tier. However, the little girl had always been weird, so no matter how fast her cultivation rose, it was completely normal.

“Heng!” Guo Liang Cai was very displeased, and shouted at that disciple who had lost control of himself, “Get lost and clean yourself up before you come back!”

“Yes! Yes!” That disciple nodded rapidly before turning around and breaking out into a run. Yet, in his heart, there was an unbelievable contrast—Hu Niu’s glare was scarier than even Guo Liang Cai! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

How could that be possible, Guo Liang Cai was in the Deity Transformation Tier! Deity Transformation Tier!

Ling Han stepped forwards, and the aura of the Spiritual Infant Tier moved, proving that he had the qualification to take the test for bone age. At this time, he had restored his original appearance. Since he had made the decision to establish his own country and split open the skies, he decided that he would show his true face to the public in future.

A Heaven Grade alchemist could be claimed to be able to do whatever he wanted wherever he wanted.

“Please stretch out your hand.” For Hu Niu’s sake, the disciple in charge of conducting the test for bone age used the word “please”. Otherwise, he would have directly shouted—for those that were not directly enrolled into the Academy, their talent was nothing too impressive, so why would he need to be too polite?

However, Hu Niu’s appearance made them understand one fact, and that was that the world was really too big. Maybe a stunning, peerless prodigy would really appear at any time.

“You dare to act fierce to Niu’s Ling Han?” But Hu Niu was still not very satisfied, and glared at the disciple, her ferocious gaze on full display again.

That disciple was instantly so scared that he fell down onto the ground. He felt as if he had become the target of a primal beast, and goosebumps appeared all over his body. He almost lost control of his bladder.

He finally understood what his companion had experienced just now—this little girl was practically not human!

Ling Han smiled softly, and said, “All right, don’t make trouble!”

It was only then that Hu Niu changed to all smiles, and happily took Ling Han’s hand, looking completely like an obedient little girl.

Even if you died because you were fooled by her deceptive appearance, she would not pay you your life back. Whoever believed her would be really unlucky.

Ling Han stretched his hand out. That disciple had also stood back up after wiping the cold sweat off his forehead. His hand held a golden needle, but it was endlessly trembling. Though he had not been scared to the extent to lost control of his bladder, it was not a small scare either.

I poke[1.ED/N: I think we used single quotation marks for thoughts so far, so I’ll take this occasion to announce that it’s changed, and we will use italics now.]!

He calmed his turbulent emotions, and poked the needle at Ling Han’s wrist. But the golden needle that was as thin as a hair off a bull’s hide was actually unable to penetrate Ling Han’s skin.

“Don’t use your Origin Power to protect—” that disciple said in slight displeasure. However, he had yet to finish his words when an astonished expression appeared on his face.

What a monster, he obviously had not used Origin Power to protect himself, yet why was his skin so tough that even the Penetrating Bone Needle could not pierce it?

The Penetrating Bone Needle was a tool especially used to test one’s bone age. It could easily penetrate the skin of a Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator, reaching all the way to one’s bone, and extract a little bit of bone tissue. Then, the measurements inscribed on the needle would reflect the corresponding age.

The younger one’s age, the more accurate the measurement, which was measured in years. But after one hundred years old, it would be ten years, twenty years, fifty years as values, because by the time one reached about four to five hundred years old, there would be practically no change in one’s cultivation for at least the next fifty years.

Yet the Penetrating Bone Needle was actually incapable of penetrating Ling Han’s skin. Furthermore, he had not used his Origin Power to defend himself, either; how could this be possible?

It couldn’t be that he had encountered a monster, could he?

“Quickly, quickly. How long do you want to keep poking Ling Han?” Hu Niu was displeased. Do you have something against Ling Han? You keep poking him again and again, without event taking a breath in between.

With Hu Niu rushing him, that disciple was naturally even more nervous, and his hand trembled even more violently. Putting aside the fact that he could not pierce through Ling Han’s skin, he did not even manage to pierce Ling Han’s hand.

“Trash!” Guo Liang Cai stepped up, and shoved that disciple aside after snatching the Penetrating Bone Needle. Then he poked the needle at Ling Han’s hand.

Weng!

The golden needle dropped, and quickly became short.

The needle went through?

No!

Guo Liang Cai was astonished in spite of himself. The Penetrating Bone Needle became short not because it had penetrated Ling Han’s skin, but because Guo Liang Cai had used too much strength, while Ling Han’s skin was too tough, so it was directly crushed. That was why it looked like it had pierced through.

F***, this monster!

The people around them had initially been laughing mockingly at that disciple who had shamed himself, but now, not one could even grin.

How shocking was a physique like that? It remained unharmed even when a Deity Transformation Tier cultivator moved personally.

“I’ll do it myself,” Ling Han said, and drew the Demon Birth Sword. He slashed himself once, and instantly, his skin broke.

At first, Guo Liang Cai was dazed. Then, he immediately pierced the needle through the open wound, and touched Ling Han’s wound once before then drawing out the Penetrating Bone Needle to take a look. An expression of great astonishment again appeared on his face, and he exclaimed in spite of himself, “Over nineteen years old, not yet twenty!”

I’m about to faint!

The people around them were once again shocked speechless. There actually appeared yet another monster. Though he was not as monstrous as Hu Niu, if one took into consideration his terrifying physique, he was not really that far off.

Ling Han put away the Demon Birth Sword, and did not even need to circulate the Indestructible Heaven Scroll. Body of Diamond had already engraved all the secrets of the Scroll into every bit of his flesh and blood, so his skin automatically healed. There was not even a tiny scar left behind, just as if he had never been struck by his sword.

This caused the crowd to once again exclaim “monster” in spite of themselves.

How were they supposed to beat Ling Han?

The toughness of his physique was more or less at the limit of a Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator, so how many people of the same cultivation level could penetrate his defense? Furthermore, his recovery ability was strong enough to cause one’s hair to rise on ends. He was practically an invincible existence amongst all the peers of the same cultivation level.
