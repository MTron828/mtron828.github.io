Chapter 1253: Our Realm Has Prodigies

Faced with Ling Han’s aggressiveness, even Ao Ziyun could only make a tactical retreat.

The two of them fought all the way, and Ao Ziyun kept retreating. Who knew how many mountain rocks they had shattered in their battle? Some Mountain River Tier cultivators they met on their way were almost scared witless. Whether they were beings of the Immortal Realm or the Netherworld, they all ran far, far away.

If they were affected by the aftermath of the battle, even if they did not die, they would be severely injured.

Even elites of the Sun Moon Tier would be wary, what more when they were Mountain River Tiers. They only dared watch from afar, and did not dare to come too close. Otherwise, even they would suffer a calamity.

Those who could watch the battle from a close distance would at least have to be in the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

However, when they discovered that the two people fighting were only in the low extreme, even those at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier broke out in a cold sweat. Prodigies like them would not possibly need tens of thousands of years to catch up to them.

“Damn it!” Ao Ziyun shouted fiercely. Just think, he was invincible at his cultivation level in the Netherworld, and had only ever lost to one person. Furthermore, that person was indeed an extraordinary genius. He was resigned to his loss, and did not feel that he had lost unfairly.

But a freak like that had actually appeared from the Immortal Realm as well?

“I am dissatisfied! I am dissatisfied!” A vein popped out on his forehead.

Since the heavens allowed the birth of a prodigy like him, why would a person like Ling Han still come out, causing him trouble and grievance?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You look too highly upon yourself! With how big the world is, how many corners have you been to? What the world lacks the least is prodigies; don’t think too much of yourself.”

Ling Han, for example, had just been to two galaxies, and he had already met a considerable number of prodigies, like He Tao and Wu Wentong. Which of them was not a well-known figure of their generation? If they battled on an equal level, none of them would be inferior to Ao Ziyun.

He had not been to the Netherworld, but he believed that the size of the Netherworld would not be less than the Immortal Realm’s. Even Eternal River Tiers could only travel in a limited range, so who knew how many prodigies there were in this world?

There would always be someone stronger, and there was only the difference of a hair’s breadth between confidence and arrogance.

“Ling Han, I admit that you are very strong, but compared to the prodigies of my Realm, you still have a long way to go!” Ao Ziyun knew that he could not possibly defeat Ling Han. Even if he used his divine seals and alchemical pills to obtain victory, that would not be a victory born from his own abilities.

A conceited prodigy like him would naturally disdain using this kind of methods to win. He would only use them to save his life. In a battle of equals, a loss was a loss. Otherwise, it would only be more of a humiliation to him.

But now that it involved the two Realms, he was naturally not going to allow Ling Han to continue being “proud”.

“Oh, is that right?” Ling Han smiled faintly.

“That’s right. My Realm has a prodigy whose name is Chi Huangji. He has only been cultivating for 200 years, and he has already broken through to the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier. Compared to him, you are like the light of a firefly as compared to the light of the bright moon; there is practically no need to mention you!” Ao Ziyun belittled Ling Han greatly.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh secretly. If he was really so weak, then what would Ao Ziyun be considered?

However, advancing into the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier in 200 years? This was extremely frightening!

It should be known how many Sun Moon Tiers would be able to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier! This ratio... would probably be 1:10,000, but to be able to cultivate to pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier and break through to the Heavenly Body Tier from there, there would only be one in 10,000 of Heavenly Body Tiers that could accomplish that.

How difficult was it? As difficult as climbing the skies!

And this Chi Huangji actually used a mere 200 years to reach the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, which also meant that if he was willing to, he completely could break through to the Heavenly Body Tier in 200 years’ time!

With such a comparison, it was clear how utterly frightening this man was.

Though Ling Han had only been cultivating up to 30 years at present, after he had crossed over into the Immortal level, he had used the Reincarnation Tree’s power many times, comprehending Dao underneath the tree, whereby a day would be equivalent to a year. In truth, the time that he had spent comprehending his cultivation level had far exceeded 200 years.

‘Perhaps... this Chi Huangji has a treasure similar to the Black Tower, which can speed up the passing of time,’ he deduced. That was because Small Tower had once said that when the Black Tower recovered completely, it could unlock the ability to speed up time. Spending a day in the Black Tower, it could be 10 days, a month, or even several years in the outside world!

This was not just speeding up the mind, but the whole person. Even cultivation could be sped up.

Ling Han chuckled. Advancing quickly through the cultivation levels was not his trump card; the “indestructible” body he had obtained through the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was! He was naturally not going to clarify this to the other party, and merely said, “Fine then, then I will wait to meet this person!”

“You will! Three years later, at the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering, Chi Huangji will let you taste the meaning of the word hopelessness!” Ao Ziyun withdrew his spear. He took out a divine seal and stuck it on himself. Instantly, his speed spiked madly. Even if Ling Han used the Star Plucking Step, he could only pull even with him at most.

Ling Han did not pursue. If he continued further, it would be the territory of the Netherworld. Who knew how many elites were standing by there? At present, his power was still not quite enough.

He stopped and withdrew the Divine Demon Sword. A powerful pressure rose up in his heart.

If he wanted to overthrow the Five Sects, he would have to be at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier at the very least. If it was in mere terms of battle prowess, it was still not enough, because the Five Sects had existed for so many years, so who knew how many trump cards they had? Thus, only if he was at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier would it be absolutely safe.

In any case, he had already been waiting for so many years, so Ling Han did not mind waiting for a few more years. However, he definitely could not be rash and screw himself as well.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. One after another, figures appeared. They were all in the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and they all targeted Ling Han.

They were elites of the Netherworld, none of them hiding the killing intent in their eyes. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This young man from the Immortal Realm was too freakish. They had to get rid of him as soon as possible. If they allowed him to mature and grow, that would be a great disaster for the Netherworld.

“Hehe, you people are dreaming!” There naturally were also elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier from the side of the Immortal Realm nearby too. They had long sensed the commotion, and had rushed over to watch the excitement. Now that they saw that those from the Netherworld wanted to do harm to Ling Han, they stepped out as well.

“Charge!” The elites from the Netherworld were very decisive. The two Realms had been at war for so many years, so they had long since become as incompatible as fire and water. What need was there to be reserved? They immediately began a bloody battle.

“Young man, you go first!” an elite from the Immortal Realm called out to Ling Han.

In truth, no one would be willing to fight a battle that they were uncertain of winning. Hence, the elites of the Immortal Realm moved only for the purpose of protecting Ling Han’s life, but did not think of eliminating all these beings from the Netherworld.

If they fought this battle to the end, then no matter who was the last one standing, they would all have to pay a very high price.

While it was true that everyone came to the Two Realm Battlefield to resist the invasion of the other realm, they were also aiming for merit points as well as Realm Spirit Stones. Who would be willing to truly battle to the death?

Thus, once Ling Han ran, this battle naturally could no longer be continued.

Ling Han nodded, and used the Star Plucking Step. It was as if his figure was flying, and he instantly disappeared into the distance.

Previously, the elites of the Immortal Realm could not stop Ao Ziyun, and now, the elites of the Netherworld were also unable to stop Ling Han.

‘No, my present cultivation level is still too low. I have to think of some way to quickly improve my cultivation level. Otherwise, three years later, if I go and join that Two Realm Prodigy Gathering, I will definitely not be a match for Chi Huangji,’ Ling Han thought as he continued running.
