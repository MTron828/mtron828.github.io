Chapter 2644: Foregone Conclusion

Gu Heyi was unable to respond.

No matter how confident he felt, he was unable to change the reality that Ling Han was a cultivation level below him. Even so, Gu Heyi still needed to cripple himself in order to raise his cultivation level. Only by doing so could he rival Ling Han.

There was no need for comparisons. The gulf between them was clear with a single glance.

However, Gu Heyi was a monarch star, after all. He had experienced countless battles during his lifetime, so how could he be shaken so easily?

He immediately hardened his resolve. What did it matter that Ling Han was more freakish than him? Once Gu Heyi reached the Eighth Heaven, he would be able to kill Ling Han. Regardless of how talented a dead person once was… what difference could this make?

“Die!” Gu Heyi activated the Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword, unleashing a profound might.

He also knew about his own weaknesses, so he started to ingest all kinds of pills. At this moment, he no longer cared about whether he could absorb the effects of all these pills or not. This was his only opportunity, so he naturally had to take a risk.

However, Ling Han wasn’t worried at all. If Gu Heyi could truly advance like this, then that would be viewing cultivation in far too simplistic a manner.

Ling Han swung his sword again and again, with each strike being powerful enough to shatter countless heavenly bodies.

Right now, Ling Han was far too powerful. His Body Art was fused together with the power of Regulations, causing his battle prowess to directly soar to the Ninth Heaven!

Reaching each subsequent Heaven was as difficult as ascending the heavens. Thus, a difference of one cultivation level was like the gulf between heaven and earth. The Ninth Heaven was more so an insurmountable barrier. Overcoming this barrier would elevate one’s battle prowess by an immense amount.

Gu Heyi could just barely hold on. However, he would need to pay a huge price each time he blocked Ling Han’s strike. This was an identical situation to what Ling Han had faced before.

Now, Ling Han’s opponent was riddled with wounds, with blood drenching his body, his bones also showing. He appeared as miserable as could be.

Gu Heyi roared in fury. However, he didn’t dare to sacrifice his soul and spirit again. Otherwise, he would die on the spot. However, if this continued, he would also be struggling in vain.

If he continued to battle, he would definitely be killed.

He couldn’t go on like this.

With a long roar, he turned around to flee.

If he lived, there would still be hope. He was only a step away from reaching the Eighth Heaven, so once he overcame this barrier, he could return to suppress Ling Han. He would definitely succeed!

Ling Han snickered, saying, “Who said they would never flee in fear?”

He chased after Gu Heyi. Even though he couldn’t draw much power from the Regulations, the explosive power of his Body Art was immense. With a single step, he instantly caught up. He then threw a punch with his left hand.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Gu Heyi had no option but to block this strike.

Boom, clang, boom!

Their swords clanged and their fists collided as they started to battle head-on again.

This hurt Gu Heyi far too much. However, Ling Han was relentless, so the former had no option but to block his strikes. Otherwise, he would definitely be hit. In his current state, how would he dare to take another hit from Ling Han?

Gu Heyi vomited blood. Even though he could still block Ling Han right now, the divine sense that he had sacrificed was already about to disappear. The might of the Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword was decreasing drastically, so how would he block Ling Han afterward?

Even though he could still struggle to block Ling Han at this moment, it was as if he could already see the god of death waving at him.

If there were no reinforcements, it was inevitable that Gu Heyi would be killed.

However, who would save him at this moment?

Gu Heyi gritted his teeth as he continued to resist. However, he couldn’t turn the tables at all. At some point in time, his battle prowess suddenly dropped off a cliff.

The divine sense that he had sacrificed had already burned up. It was unable to help him anymore.

Gu Heyi’s expression instantly became ashen. In his current state, he would struggle to block another strike from Ling Han.

“Trash from the outside world, die!” Right at this moment, however, there was a deep rumble as a person shot over from the distance. He radiated with a powerful aura, and he was more so surrounded by numerous ribbons of iridescent light that were even brighter than the stars.

‘Reinforcements?’

Delight appeared on Gu Heyi’s face. However, upon seeing eight ribbons of iridescent light around the person, his expression of hope and delight involuntarily turned into disappointment.

How could an Eighth Heaven Celestial King block the Ninth-Heaven battle prowess of Ling Han?

Unless it was a supreme monarch star like Xiao Yingxiong and Miao Hua!

Ling Han naturally saw this as well, and he wasn’t worried at all. He slashed down with his sword.

Pu!

Gu Heyi was instantly cut into two.

Weng!

His Divine Sword fell from his hand, and flew into the distance.

A prodigy was erased from the world just like that.

“Celestial Tool!” the Eighth Heaven Celestial King who had just arrived exclaimed. He was overcome with delight. He had only charged over because he had heard the news that there were two outsiders here. However, he hadn’t expected that he would receive such a valuable present!

This was a Celestial Tool! In this place, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could barely get their hands on such a treasure!

He quickly dashed forward.

Whoosh!

He caught up to Gu Heyi’s Divine Sword, and grabbed it in his hand.

The Celestial Tool instantly unleashed its might, with a gleam of cold light slashing at the Celestial King.

This was a treasure refined by Gu Heyi, so even though it hadn’t reached his level, its might was still extraordinary—its creator had been a supreme monarch star, after all. It was more than powerful enough to rival the Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

The Eighth Heaven Celestial King was overjoyed, and he was completely focused on trying to obtain the Celestial Tool. Only after failing to obtain it after a dozen attempts did he finally feel astonishment.

This Celestial Tool had had an owner before, yet this person had already been killed. That being the case, just how powerful was his opponent?

Right now, was he not trying to snatch prey from a tiger’s mouth? Was he not seeking death?

With this in mind, he involuntarily stopped his movements in fright. Scanning the surroundings with his divine sense, he indeed discovered Ling Han standing 90 meters away, his arms crossed before his chest as if he were enjoying a show.

The Celestial Tool didn’t seize this opportunity to counterattack, either, instead turning around to flee into the clouds.

“Get down!” Ling Han reached out to grab at the Divine Sword.

‘You’re asking for trouble!’ the Eight Heaven Celestial King said in his mind.

Without battle prowess at the Ninth Heaven, how could anyone possibly face a Celestial Tool head-on? That was the most supreme being in the level of Regulations.

However, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets in the next instant. This was because Ling Han directly grabbed the Divine Sword with his bare hand.

Not the sword’s hilt, but the sword’s blade!

‘F*ck! He’s a freak!’

Cold sweat instantly drenched the Eighth Heaven Celestial King. He couldn’t help but shake in fear.

Ling Han tightly gripped the blade of the sword. If this Celestial Tool were being wielded by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he definitely wouldn’t dare to grab it just like that. This was because the combination of their power could definitely slice through his skin and even wound his godly bones. It was possible that they could directly sever his fingers.

However, this was a sword with no owner, so it could at most only unleash a battle prowess at the peak stage of the Eighth Heaven. Thus, did Ling Han need to be afraid?

No matter how sharp a weapon, it still needed an owner to unleash its true might.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he placed restriction after restriction on the Celestial Tool, sealing its power. He then tossed it into his Celestial Guest Residence. He would slowly refine this Celestial Tool in the future.

After doing this, he turned to the Eighth Heaven Celestial King with a smile, and said, “What did you say just then?”

The Eighth Heaven Celestial King wore an awkward expression. He had failed to suppress the Celestial Tool after several dozen exchanges, yet Ling Han dealt with it in a single grab. The gulf between them was as clear as day. The man hurriedly forced a smile, and said, “This junior was saying that Senior is far too mighty! In a single glance, it’s clear that Senior is a dragon among men and as domineering as can be!”

An Eighth Heaven Celestial King was actually referring to a Sixth Heaven Celestial King as “senior”?

Ling Han was astonished. This person was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, after all, so how could he be so shameless?

Whoosh!

At this moment, the Eighth Heaven Celestial King suddenly turned around to flee.

He hadn’t placed his hopes on Ling Han being benevolent. Instead, he had purposefully tricked Ling Han into lowering his guard, buying himself time to flee.

Once he set off, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would find it difficult to catch up to him.

However, just as he started to flee, he suddenly discovered that there was already a person standing before him, with their hands clasped behind their back. It was as if they were taking a casual stroll.

Who was this person if not Ling Han?
