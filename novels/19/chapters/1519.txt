1520 Setting up an ambush

“Little Black, as expected of the Saint of Deceit; it’s no easy feat to trick you,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“That’s right... ptui!” The large black dog was just about to grin proudly, but then he immediately turned around to bite at Ling Han. “You actually dare to tease your Grandpa Dog; just see if I won’t bite a chunk out of your behind!”

Ling Han clenched his hand into a fist to greet the incoming attack. Peng, peng, peng, the man and dog exchanged a few blows, but their battle ended very soon.

One feared the other’s sharp teeth, whereas the other was wary of the Nine Heavens Flame. Moreover, they were merely playing around in the first place, so it was naturally impossible that they would really be fighting.

Their battle had ended, and so had the others. That was because everyone could see that it was not some kind of treasure that was inside the chest, but rather a scene of chaos.

What... the hell was this?

Yet Gu Daoyi’s eyes lit up. As one who had once been the Severing Mundane Ancestor, he could completely confirm that this was a doorway, and the inside of the chest was a small world.

Treasure trove! The secret technique of a Celestial King!

He was the first to leap inside. Even though the chest wasn’t very big, when one leaped in, their body would continuously shrink in size, and then sink inside. It was very easy to slip through.

Everyone exchanged looks, and then they all jumped in one after another. There was a treasure trove inside; who would be willing to be left behind? Furthermore, Gu Daoyi was already leading the way. He wasn’t afraid, so who else would be?

Ling Han stood up as well. There was no time to lose. He was going to snipe Gu Daoyi.

He leaped into the world inside the chest, and returned to a familiar place.

“Gasp!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At the entry point to the world inside the chest, everyone let out exclamations of surprise as they stared at that gigantic paw.

The three Phoenix Kings were conducting the ultimate inheritance, and merely from the surface, they did not even look like phoenixes. Their aura was not obvious, and one could only vaguely sense the massive power they possessed. But this giant paw was different. With a single look, one could tell that it was incredibly powerful, as if it was a Saint King.

It was merely a snapped off paw, and was already so frightening. Then what kind of existence would the true owner of this paw be?

This place... had to possess a supreme rare treasure!

Gu Daoyi was the first to move. He raced out, heading towards the main peak. That massive paw seemed like it was a tip.

The others followed closely as well. Everyone had the mentality to follow blindly. Though king tiers were more likely to hold their own opinions, who was Gu Daoyi? The greatest prodigy of all eternity, and even the Great Saint was fighting to take him as a disciple. This represented the good fortune of the heaven and earth.

Gu Daoyi’s figure suddenly slowed, and he immediately began walking at an incredibly slow pace.

“Ah!”

“En!”

“Yi!”

When the others entered into this zone, they all exclaimed in shock. Then, their speed immediately decreased. Some people were wounded by the mountain winds because they had rushed too quickly ahead, and were now covered with injuries. The person who experienced the worst had even had one of his arms sliced off, and was crying out in pain.

Only then did everyone finally calm down. They did not dare to rush too quickly ahead; that would completely be seeking death.

They were also internally blaming Gu Daoyi. ‘You clearly knew how frightening the mountain winds here are, yet why did you not even give a hint? We are from the same academy, after all!’

Now that they had arrived here, even Gu Daoyi was advancing with difficulty in every step. He had to concentrate a large portion of his power on defense. His Divine Fetus was not strong in terms of strength of physique. He had merely distributed the power he had devoured throughout his whole body, and indirectly increased his defenses.

But the situation now was different. When the mountain winds blew over him, half of his body would be affected. Though he was still much more relaxed than the others, he was far from being able to walk ahead easily.

Meanwhile, it was the Second in the World who was practically like a fish back in the sea. He ran quickly ahead, and was even faster than Gu Daoyi.

That was because his physique was truly strong.

“F***, what are you running so fast for?” Ling Han ascended from the other side of the mountain. It was harder to walk than the normal mountain path. However, he was practically completely unaffected by the mountain winds. Thus, even if the terrain here was a little more difficult to travel, it was fine. He could even fly a small part of the way, but it was still impossible to fly for too long. After all, the paw of a Saint King was pressing down on him.

According to Ling Han’s plan, he would first enter into the palace at the peak, and then set up an ambush. After Gu Daoyi entered, he would attack him and take him down.

With that massive paw hindering him, his physique had too much of an advantage. Furthermore, the aura of a Saint King would conceal divine sense, which could allow a sneak attack to become even more powerful. It was not impossible that he could take down Gu Daoyi with a single move.

As long as he drew him inside the Black Tower, then he, too, would stay in there for a while, or leave ahead of the others. Naturally, no one would think Gu Daoyi’s disappearance would be tied to him.

Yet the Second in the World was actually coming to join in as well?

This poor guy, he could only take him down as well.

Ling Han quickly sped up, and soon arrived at the summit. Because he had walked another mountain path covered by dense forest, no one discovered his whereabouts. He carefully entered through the hole pierced through by the massive paw, and waited inside the treasure trove.

The Second in the World soon surpassed Gu Daoyi. The two of them engaged in battle, but the Second in the World had the advantage in physique, and he was not that much inferior to Gu Daoyi in the first place. Thus, he successfully broke through Gu Daoyi’s blockade, and became the first in the procession. Then, he continued to enlarge his lead.

When he arrived at the summit, Gu Daoyi had only travelled three quarters of the path, and the others were even farther behind. None of them had even walked half of the way.

The Second in the World very quickly discovered the location of the treasure trove. He carefully climbed down. Because he knew that he was the first person, he completely did not think that there would be anyone below him there. Naturally, he completely let down his guard.

Ling Han moved, and delivered a palm strike straight at the back of the head of the Second in the World.

The Second in the World immediately roared in fury, but his divine sense had been blocked by the Saint King’s aura, and he was no different than a blind and deaf man. Furthermore, he still had to use a portion of his power to defend against the mountain winds. Additionally, Ling Han was actively scheming against he who was unprepared, and his abilities were superior as well, so how was he supposed to block the incoming blow?

Pa, he was knocked unconscious with Ling Han’s palm strike on his head.

Even though he had fallen unconscious, there was still an expression of strong humiliation and rage on the Second in the World’s face. This was natural. He was a king among kings, and yet had actually been knocked unconscious with a single palm strike. This was too embarrassing.

“Brother, so sorry!” Ling Han tossed the Second in the World into the Black Tower so that he would not be alerted into regaining consciousness by the commotion created by the great battle between Ling Han and Gu Daoyi. Otherwise, Ling Han could only kill him to prevent him from leaking the secret, or would have to imprison the Second in the World in the Black Tower for a very long period of time.

Ling Han stepped back a bit. The main character was next.

After waiting for a long while, the light sound of footsteps was heard. A drawn out shadow was cast down. Gu Daoyi had finally arrived.

Without hesitation, he climbed down the hole, but his speed was extremely slow. That was because he knew that the Second in the World had already entered into this place, so how could he possibly be careless? If this place did not have the massive paw of a Saint King, he would naturally be unafraid, but now he thought of the Second in the World as a formidable opponent.

Ling Han’s eyes became serious, and he suddenly moved.

“Humph, I’ve long kept up my guard against you!” Gu Daoyi smirked. Without even turning his head, he shot out a fist. Weng, his bodies of nine lives appeared at the same time, and his eyes naturally had long since recovered.

Obviously, he had used the many Mystical Powers from his previous lifetimes previously, and summoned out his bodies of nine lives. Only then did he come down as he intended to suppress the Second in the World in the shortest time possible so that he alone would obtain the treasures.

Peng!

The two fists clashed into one another. Gu Daoyi’s expression suddenly changed. When had this Second in the World become so strong?

Abruptly, he spat out a mouthful of blood, and his figure fell down. Finally, he managed to turn his body around, and his eyes involuntarily widened. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “Ling Han!”
