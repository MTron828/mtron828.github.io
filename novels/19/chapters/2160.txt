Chapter 2161: Reunited

“En?” The white-robed young man stared at Ling Han, an expression of displeasure showing on his face. “I told you to commit suicide, and you are actually not moving yet. Do you plan on a terribly painful death?”

Ling Han shook his head, and turned to glance at Hu Niu and the other women, asking, “Have we entered a den of thieves here?”

“How dare you!” The white-robed young man flew into a rage, and stretched out a hand to grab Ling Han, planning to apprehend this disrespectful man.

Everyone was shouting battle cries, providing encouragement for this young man.

Peng, the white-robed young man’s hand directly grabbed Ling Han’s chest.

“All right!”

“Kill this insolent, arrogant man!”

“To actually dare come to our place and behave so atrociously!”

Everyone around them was calling out in excitement. As they saw it, it was very normal that Ling Han would be completely unable to fight back, because the young man could practically be considered the strongest elite of the valley.

“Ah…” A terrible cry rang out, yet it was not from Ling Han, but rather came from that white-robed young man.

He held his right wrist in his left hand, his expression filled with pain. All five fingers of his right hand had been twisted in an exaggerated manner, and the mere sight would induce empathetic pain and a corresponding chill to rise up in those who saw it.

At this moment, sounds of gasps rang out in the surroundings.

How was this possible?

Cheng Zilong was a great elite of the Genesis Tier, and was practically known as the strongest elite in the entire valley. How could he have possibly lost in a single move? Instead, it was he who had broken his own fingers?

“Let go of Young Master Long!”

“We are the esteemed guests of the Roc Palace. Do you know what kind of force the Roc Palace is? They are no one that you can afford to trifle with!”

Everyone soon exclaimed all at once. However, this time, they were using the Roc Palace as an intimidation tactic.

These people’s news was too outdated, wasn’t it? Didn’t they know that the Roc Palace had already been forced into disbanding?

Ling Han shook his head, and suddenly released a loud cry towards the skies. His voice rolled out like thunder, like the howl of a dragon.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?Immediately, more people leaped out of the valley. Without entering into the Severing Mundane Tier, they would not be capable of flying in the Celestial Realm.

“Ancestor!”

“First Madam!”

“Second Madam!”

Everyone paid their respects to those who had just arrived, their expressions respectful.

“Ancestor, please ask the elites of the Roc Palace to seek justice for Long’er!” The white-robed young man half-knelt in front of a middle-aged couple. “This insolent man not only barged forcibly into our valley, and even wounded me—”

“Husband!” A sharp cry rang out, and a beautiful woman had already rushed out, pouncing towards Ling Han.

Then, another beautiful woman rushed out, and pounced towards Ling Han. Then, it was the third and the fourth.

Everyone was all dumbfounded. These few ladies were all the wives of their lord valley master—though they had never seen Lord Valley Master, they had only been told that he would eventually return one day.

But why were they pouncing towards an unfamiliar man?

‘Hang on!’

Realization suddenly dawned on them. Could it be that this unfamiliar man was…

Ling Han!

“Han’er!” Ling Dong Xing and Yue Hong Chang both raced over, pouncing towards their precious son.

“Father, Mother!” Ling Han called out, and felt his eyes become slightly damp. Even if he was a great monarch tier that was invincible among his peers, there was always a soft, tender spot in the depths of his heart.

Seeing this scene, even the stupidest person would understand who Ling Han was, and also knew just what a great mistake it was that they had made.

The white-robed young man also came out of his shock. His face was completely flushed red. He had been humiliated in public, but not only were his two grand elders not the slightest bit concerned about him, they were instead incredibly cordial towards the culprit, and this made him even more infuriated.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them. Liu Yu Tong, Li Si Chan, Zhu Xuan Er, Helian Xunxue, and the others were all by his side, and they all showed overjoyed expressions, causing him to involuntarily feel touched as he said, “I’ve made you all wait.”

Meanwhile, Hu Niu yawned, and looked bored. At the same time, she was also slightly displeased. Only with much difficulty had she managed to take all these witches from Ling Han’s side, and now they were back again.

“These are all…” Ling Dong Xing and his wife looked at the Empress, Hu Niu, Bewitching Maiden Rou, and the others, looking stunned.

Though it was Hu Niu who had made arrangements for them to settle here, Hu Niu had never even come here before. Thus, Ling Dong Xing and his wife’s impression of Hu Niu was still of her as a child, and they were completely unable to link this woman who looked like a celestial maiden with the child Hu Niu.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Let me introduce. This is Hu Niu—”

Pu!

Ling Dong Xing and his wife, Helian Xunxue, and the other women all spluttered. All of them had seen Hu Niu when she was a child, but they had always thought that this little girl would never grow up, and now that they had seen such a beautiful young woman, they could not believe their eyes.

“What is it? Niu can’t be pretty?” Hu Niu was greatly displeased, and bared her teeth, hands on her hips.

In this way, everyone nodded. This was definitely Hu Niu.

After a round of introductions, the women all got to know each other. The Empress only said a few words, and was naturally able to have the other women center around her, and submit to her authority completely, while Ling Dong Xing and his wife asked Ling Han endless questions.

“Yi, Father, Mother, what has happened here?” A figure descended, and it was a poised woman, and her words were directed at Ling Don Xing and his wife.

Father, mother?

Instantly, a surprised expression came over Ling Han’s face, and then realization dawned on him.

Ling Dong Xing and his wife were slightly flushed, and said to Ling Han, “Come, this is your younger sister, Ling Yueyan.”

“Brother?” The beautiful woman looked at Ling Han, showing a hint of surprise in her expression.

“En, he is your elder brother, Ling Han!” Yue Hong Chang pulled on her daughter’s hand. The two women stood together, and there indeed were some similarities they shared.

Ling Han looked towards his father, and couldn’t help but give him a thumbs-up. His old man was really awesome, creating a younger sister that was younger than even Ling Han’s own son. However, age was really not all that important in the Celestial Realm. Everyone could live several tens of billions of years at the drop of a hat. If one was really serious about calculating the generations, they would just drive themselves dizzy.

“Brother!” Ling Yueyan called out clearly.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “Sister.”

“Come, let’s go in first. We’ll discuss slowly afterwards,” Ling Dong Xing said smilingly. They couldn’t just continue chatting outside, after all.

They entered indoors, and Ling Dong Xing and his wife couldn’t wait to ask about Ling Han’s experiences all these years. However, Ling Han merely sketched over the details, making absolutely no mention of the various dangers he had encountered, not wanting to make his parents worry. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When they were done talking about his matters, the topic of conversation naturally turned back to Ling Dong Xing and his wife.

Their experiences were much calmer. After they were brought by Hu Niu to the Celestial Realm, they settled down in this place. Then, they accidentally gave birth to Ling Yueyan, and then Ling Yueyan married, and gave birth to three sons, and then these three sons married, and had their own children.

Thus, this valley gradually became livelier.

Because there were now many of them, for the convenience of management, they set up a force modelled as a clan. Of course, in the Celestial Realm, this was practically just playing around. They did not even have a Severing Mundane grand elder.

However, because the people in the valley were cut off from the outside world, it was inevitable that they would be ignorant, and develop an exaggerated opinion of themselves. Added with the fact that they thought that they still had the Roc Palace to depend on, a trend of arrogance was slowly developed.

When it had reached this generation, it could no longer be controlled. Thankfully, this place was at the foot of the mountains of the Roc Palace, and unconcerned people could not possibly reach this place. Those that were qualified to come would also not bother about them on the basis of the Roc Palace.

This caused the people of the valley to become even more arrogant and proud.

“Then where is my brother-in-law?” Ling Han asked.
