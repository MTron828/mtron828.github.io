Chapter 2593: Hidden Secret

Zhao Shuang’s expression was ashen as he swallowed the “poisonous pill.” He felt as if he had nothing more to live for.

Ling Han chuckled in his mind. Where would he get a poisonous pill from? He had merely done this to frighten Zhao Shuang. However, in order to convince Zhao Shuang, he purposefully used some techniques to make Zhao Shuang feel intense pain in his abdomen.

This pain was tolerable, yet it definitely couldn’t be ignored.

Zhao Shuang was a cowardly person, and it wasn’t long before he collapsed, saying, “Brother Long, I feel like the poison is about to spread! Hurry, give me the antidote!”

Peng!

Ling Han sent him flying with a kick.

If this pill weren’t produced by him, he might have truly been fooled by Zhao Shuang’s terrified expression, and he might have been fooled into thinking the poisonous pill was genuine.

“Enough with the nonsense. Hurry up!” Ling Han didn’t waste any time as he dragged Zhao Shuang along.

News of Zhao Shuang being kidnapped would definitely spread throughout the city in no time. Even though the herbal garden was in a remote location, it was still only a matter of time before the news spread over. Thus, Ling Han had to enter and exit the herbal garden before this news arrived.

This herbal garden was indeed located in an extremely remote location. It was hidden inside a desolate mountain, yet it was still protected by formations on all sides. There was also an Eighth Heaven Celestial King standing guard.

Ling Han had entered the Spatial Celestial Tool long ago, and only Zhao Shuang remained walking in the outside world, with the Spatial Celestial Tool hidden on his body.

This was a risky plan. If Zhao Shuang suddenly discovered some courage, and asked the Eighth Heaven Celestial King for help, Ling Han would immediately become trapped. Even if he could flee, he would definitely have to pay a huge price.

However, Ling Han was an audacious person, and he was also convinced that a profligate second-generation young master like Zhao Shuang would definitely value his life above all else. He wouldn’t dare to bring them both down together.

Zhao Shuang took a deep breath, and wiped the expression of fear and anxiety from his face. He then reverted to his temperament of a profligate second-generation young master as he strode into the mountain.

“Zhao Shuang, you’ve come to steal medicines again?” someone said in a mocking tone.

Zhao Shuang felt his eyes blur, and before he knew it, there was already a person standing before him. This person had eight ribbons of iridescent light around him, and he was none other than the Celestial King who was guarding the herbal garden. Zhao Shuang’s heart burned, and he almost spat out a call for help.

However, he immediately recalled Ling Han’s calm expression that seemingly hid an infinite amount of confidence. A cold chill involuntarily ran down his spine.

One had to realize that many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had been sent out to hunt for him back then. However, they had still failed to capture Ling Han!

In fact, all of this was a misunderstanding that had been caused by Zhan Feiyu’s sudden appearance. However, in terms of the end results, this was indeed true. Moreover, people who heard this story wouldn’t consider so much. They would simply think that Ling Han was an incredibly freakish person even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings couldn’t capture.

Thus, Zhao Shuang naturally had even less confidence in an Eighth Heaven Celestial King. If Ling Han managed to escape, who would give him the antidote for the poisonous pill?

With this in mind, he immediately poured a bucket of cold water over his burning heart.

“Uncle Xu, you jest. I’m only here to take a look,” he said.

“You say this every time, but when have you ever been honest?” the Eighth Heaven Celestial King said with a smile. However, he still waved his hand, saying, “Go ahead.” This was Zhao Yuanyi’s command. As long as Zhao Shuang didn’t take things too far, he could allow him to “steal” some Brahman Celestial Flowers. This was his son, after all.

Zhao Shuang nodded in acknowledgment before walking into the mountain. After taking a few steps, he couldn’t help but steal a backward glance. He felt a strong urge in his mind, yet he ultimately didn’t open his mouth.

After Zhao Shuang ventured deep into the mountain, Ling Han exited his Spatial Celestial Tool. He had already channeled the Heaven Deceiving Technique, so as long as he didn’t attack anyone, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t be able to detect his existence. Of course, this was unless they saw him with their eyes.

This was a herbal garden in which many Celestial medicines were being cultivated. However, many of them were extremely young, rendering them useless to Celestial Kings. They needed at least a few more epochs before they could be of any use.

Ling Han was even more astonished upon seeing this. Even Celestial King Tier Great Herbs were extremely difficult to cultivate, so why were Ascending Dragon Pills so abundant in number?

Theoretically speaking, didn’t Brahman Celestial Flowers require several epochs to grow and produce fruit? This would in turn severely limit the production of Ascending Dragon Pills.

“Brother Long, this is the place,” Zhao Shuang said as he pointed at a plot of land.

Ling Han looked over. ‘These are Brahman Celestial Flowers?’

This was an extremely eerie and colorful type of plant. Its stem was bright red as blood, and its leaves were purple and filled with azure veins. These colors would instantly grab one’s attention.

Some Brahman Celestial Flowers were already blooming, with their flowers as large as fists and their petals extremely lush and healthy. Their colors were more so extremely attractive. Some were still flower buds, while some had already produced fruit, which were similarly colorful.

Ling Han walked over for a closer look.

These flowers were extremely colorful. In fact, they were so colorful that they seemed eerie and bewitching. Ling Han couldn’t help but feel a sinister aura from them.

This wasn’t an illusion. Ling Han could smell blood.

Ling Han turned around, and asked, “What are these flowers watered with?”

“Brother Long, I feel like I can’t breathe. Did you calculate the time wrong? Is the poison already spreading?” Zhao Shuang was extremely anxious and uneasy, and he didn’t hear Ling Han’s question at all.

Pa!

Ling Han gave him a good slap, finally waking him up. Zhao Shuang cradled his face in grief as he said, “Brother Long, why did you hit me?”

“I asked you a question!”

Zhao Shuang shuddered, but he still asked, “Brother Long, what did you ask?”

Ling Han shook his head before repeating his question again.

“I don’t know”, Zhao Shuang replied with a shake of his head.

Ling Han didn’t ask any more questions. In the eyes of this second-generation young master, there was nothing more to it than Brahman Celestial Flowers and astonishing wealth. As for how these Brahman Celestial Flowers were cultivated, Zhao Shuang didn’t care at all.

As Ling Han continued to observe the Brahman Celestial Flowers, a speculation slowly formed in his mind.

After a while, he suddenly shuddered before turning to Zhao Shuang, and saying, “Someone’s coming over. Don’t give away any clues.”

Whoosh!?

He entered the Spatial Celestial Tool.

Sure enough, it wasn’t long before someone walked over. This was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King. After seeing Zhao Shuang, he hurriedly greeted him in respect, saying, “This underling pays his respects to Young Master.”

Zhao Shuang nodded in acknowledgment.

The Fifth Heaven Celestial King walked up to the field of Brahman Celestial Flowers before sweeping his hand and tossing forth numerous corpses. There were the corpses of humans, beasts, birds, and many more. However, they were all Celestial Kings. Even though they had died, they still radiated with a powerful aura that couldn’t be faked.

Zhao Shuang’s eyes widened in disbelief. This was because Ling Han had only just asked about this a moment ago, so he was able to immediately connect the dots.

Sure enough, the Fifth Heaven Celestial King chopped the corpses of the Celestial Kings into pieces, transforming them into blood water and bone scraps as he buried them in the field.

His movements were practiced, and it was as if he had already done this many times before.

Thus, he was able to finish his task in no time. He then turned to Zhao Shuang, nodding, and said, “This subordinate will take his leave now.”

Zhao Shuang was still transfixed with shock, so he simply gave a stiff nod of acknowledgment.

After the Celestial King left, Ling Han reappeared once again.

His expression was solemn. Sure enough, it was as he had speculated.

Before, he had always been curious about why Ascending Dragon Pills only existed in the Celestial King Graveyard. Moreover, the effects of these pills were so potent and heaven-defying.

Now, the answer had finally appeared before him. This was because Brahman Celestial Flowers were cultivated using the corpses of Celestial Kings.

This was equivalent to using Celestial Kings to raise more Celestial Kings. Moreover, this behavior would definitely lead to a huge waste of resources. Perhaps the corpses of 10 Celestial Kings could only raise a single Celestial King. However, this didn’t matter. This was the Celestial King Graveyard, so a large number of Celestial Kings would be sent here each year, providing them with a large amount of “resources.”

It was no wonder why so many Celestial Kings without a powerful background were also tossed into this place. This was the fundamental reason.

‘Hang on… If Ascending Dragon Pills can’t be taken to the outside world, why do the Celestial Kings in the outside world need to do this? Why do they insist on tossing these Celestial Kings inside?’

Gasp!

Ling Han instantly came to a realization. This was very likely related to a colossal black market.
