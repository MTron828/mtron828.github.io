2917 What is your father’s name?

Seeing that Bai Mifan was about to make another move, Ling Han quickly waved his hand. “Alright, stop, stop. It’s enough, I admit that you are qualified to join my team.”

He didn’t want to expose his strongest trick in full view; it was meant as a surprise for someone.

Bai Mifan couldn’t get enough of it, and said, “You are the first person to take on this technique of mine among peers of the same cultivation level… no, you are even just a Third Tier. You really deserve the evaluation of my ancestor and Master Lin.”

“Dare I ask what’s your name?” Lin Youlian said. She didn’t know that there were still other hidden talents under her command.

Bai Mifan couldn’t help but blush; he really didn’t want to say his own name.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “This is Brother Bai Mifan.”

Pu. Abruptly, a great many burst out laughing.

If it wasn’t Bai Mifan’s deliberate deception, then this guy’s parents would be really reckless.

Lin Youlian’s delicate body trembled, and she said, “Is your grandfather Lord Bai Fan?”

Many young people immediately burst into laughter again. The grandfather was called Bai Fan, while the grandson was called Bai Mifan. They really were a family1.

So, what was the name of Bai Fan’s son and Bai Mifan’s father?

They were truly very curious.

But the older people gasped and revealed shocked expressions.

“It’s Lord Bai’s grandson, no wonder he is so powerful.”

“He’s not at all inferior to Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu in terms of background.”

“Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, Lord Bai Fan!”

Even Ling Han was surprised. He knew that Bai Mifan should have a great background, but he didn’t expect that the latter was also a descendant of Seventh Tier.

Remembering his suspicions of Bai Mifan previously, Ling Han shook his head. How could a Seventh Tier’s grandson be the remnant of Hysteria? If he couldn’t even distinguish this, then would the Seventh Tier still be qualified to fight against Hysteria?

After everyone recovered from this shocking news, they were once again taken by surprise.

…Bai Mifan wanted to join Ling Han’s team and participate in the decapitation operation.

This… Wasn’t this guy afraid of death?

Hysteria’s army didn’t care whose grandson you were. There was only one word for it: kill.

No matter how freakish you were, you only had Fifth-Tier battle prowess, after all, so what could you use against the infinite Hysteria army?

However, the blood of some people was ignited. Ling Han returned from the front line alive and killed two leaders of Hysteria’s army. Now even the grandson of an exalted Seventh Tier wanted to join this team, which made many passionate people eager as well.

A young man stood up with a faint smile, and said, “I also want to apply to join.”

“You are?” Ling Han looked at that person; this was a Fifth Tier, but he had been too low-key before, and had never said a word previously, as if he had been air.

“I am Xuan Feng,” this young man replied calmly.

“Brother Xuan Feng.” Ling Han nodded. Since he was a Fifth Tier, there was no need to test his strength. Who, having cultivated to this level, wasn’t a genius among geniuses?

“Ling Han, congratulations, the team has expanded again. Can you kill a few more leaders of Hysteria this time?” Xin Qihu, who also appeared, said lightly, his expression unchanged.

Naturally, he would not be moved, because he was the commander-in-chief, the person in charge of the overall situation. Ling Han was merely a pawn of his now.

“Just do your best,” Ling Han said, also lightly, while looking at Xin Qihu, his eyes full of challenge.

“It’s not just to do our best, but to ensure that the mission is complete.” Nalan Xiong took a step forward. He was now very close to Xin Qihu, and there were some things that weren’t convenient for Xin Qihu to say, so he would speak up for him.

“A fox makes use of a tiger’s might2.” Bai Mifan seemed to be talking to himself, then walked up to Ling Han, and looked directly at Nalan Xiong, with an expression that said “if you are upset, then I will beat the crap out of you.”

Naturally, Nalan Xiong wasn’t intimidated by Bai Mifan; when a Fifth Tier went against a Fourth Tier, no matter how freakish the latter was, the former was confident that he would be undefeated. But Nalan Xiong was afraid of the one behind Bai Mifan; that was a Seventh Tier, a supreme being.

Only those who had cultivated to the Fifth Tier knew how difficult it was to leap from the Fourth Tier to Fifth Tier, and even more how difficult it was to go up even a little bit from there.

In their eyes, a Seventh Tier was simply a god-like existence who could not be surpassed, and could only be looked up to.

How many years had passed since ancient times, but how many Seventh Tiers were there?

A Seventh Tier was immortal, so even if the limited number of Seventh Tiers were entangled by the Hysteria’s main body, and it was impossible for them to return, everyone still respected the Seventh Tiers’ families. This was the prestige of a Seventh Tier.

Bai Mifan could speak freely, but Nalan Xiong had to be more careful.

“Why, you don’t accept it?” Bai Mifan was gentle on the surface, but in fact he was extremely proud, and could only acknowledge true prodigies. “If you don’t accept it, I will beat you into accepting. Do you dare to fight me?”

Ling Han stretched out his hand to stop him. “They are all our own people, so why are we speaking of fighting?”

Everyone was surprised that Ling Han actually spoke up for outsiders; could it be that the sun had risen from the west?

Even Nalan Xiong was surprised. Could it be that Ling Han was about to yield to Xin Qihu, so he began to give in?

“Since Brother Nalan cares so much, why don’t you join our team, and we’ll let you supervise the battle? How about it?” Ling Han smiled.

This sentence immediately made Nalan Xiong’s face turn green.

He didn’t know how Ling Han had escaped before, but even if Ling Han had the ability to do it again, he definitely wouldn’t take Nalan Xiong with him.

When the time came, Ling Han and the others would return safely, but Nalan Xiong would “go down in history forever.” Who would do that kind of thing?

Nalan Xiong shook his head hastily, and looked at Xin Qihu, fearing that the other party would fall for Ling Han’s mockery and really send him as a representative.

“Hahahaha!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing Nalan Xiong’s appearance, everyone laughed.

It was a shame that a dignified Fifth Tier was played so badly!

Nalan Xiong also had a hot face. He really wanted to fight Ling Han, but he swallowed his anger when he recalled Ling Han’s strength.

“Ling Han, set out tonight, speed is everything in war,” Xin Qihu said, not allowing Ling Han to refuse. He waved his hand, turned, and left.

Ling Han gestured a middle finger to his back, and then looked at the two people beside him. “You two, are you ready to have a big fight?”

...

“Sure.”

“No problem.”

Both Bai Mifan and Xuan Feng were very calm, as if they were not going to kill the enemy in Hysteria’s base camp, but were going on a day trip to some famous place or historic site.

“Haha, such a fun thing, how can I miss it?” Fu Yuan laughed and walked over.

“Okay!” Ling Han laughed, full of pride. “Then let’s have a big fight!”

All four stretched out a hand each, and placed them one on top of the other.

“By the way, Brother Bai, I’m curious about your father’s name,” Xuan Feng said suddenly with a smile on his face.

“I’m also curious.” Fu Yuan nodded.

Hu Niu leaned closer, turned her head exaggeratedly, and pricked her ears.

Bai Mifan couldn’t help being embarrassed. “Aren’t you guys going too far?”

“Not at all,” Ling Han, Hu Niu, Xuan Feng, and others said in unison.

...

Bai Mifan sighed, hesitated again and again, and said, “My father’s name is Bai Chi3.”

Pu, everyone burst out laughing.
