2785 Fourth Tier also arrives

Quite a few groups returned in defeat. Naturally, no one else dared to descend into the lake again.

These people did not just include the top 100 of the recent leaderboard of the second level, but also supreme elites from the third and fourth level. Any single one of them was a powerful figure that could suppress the world, and make even heaven and earth pale. But here, all of them could only act in accordance with the rules.

The power of a transcendent dimension was really too strong.

Over a dozen days later, a wave suddenly rose up in the lake, and the wave this time was more frightening than any previous wave. It was 3,000 kilometers tall. It was like the whole world was pounding straight towards the crowd, causing everyone’s expression to change drastically.

If they were struck by this, even a Heavenly Venerate would be done for.

Boom, boom, boom! In accompaniment with this giant wave, there was also rumbling from the ground, as if an earthquake was happening.

However, anyone who was a Heavenly Venerate could feel the changes in space. This was not Regulations of Space, but rather a change in space that would only happen when the dimension was being compressed.

Everyone was both shocked and overjoyed. That was because the collision between two transcendent dimensions was too terrifying, and who knew how terrifyingly dangerous it would be, but change also meant opportunity. Who knew, perhaps that Heavenly Venerable Seal would truly come into being.

After a long while, the wave finally weakened and faded. However, a massive whirlpool appeared in the waters. Right at the very center, there was a pit. Its depth was unknown, and it was dark and eerie, striking fear into anyone who chanced to gaze at it.

“Yi?”

“En?”

“Ya?”

A considerable number of Heavenly Venerates suddenly showed hints of surprise. Upon closer look, one would realize that they were all Third Tier Heavenly Venerates that came from the fourth spatial level—only one person was the exception, and that was Ling Han.

They all sensed that a number of powerful auras were presently flying out from the bottom of the lake.

It could not be helped. Even if their cultivation level was suppressed, a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate would definitely be stronger in various areas than any Second Tier or First Tier Heavenly Venerate, but the extent of their strength would be limited.

Only a while later, Second Tier Heavenly Venerates also sensed it, which was then followed by First Tier Heavenly Venerates, and finally even Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could sense it.

But right at this moment, over a dozen figures shot out from the center of the whirlpool. They were all extremely colossal, and their similarity was that they had particularly many legs, arms, eyes, and heads. However, every single monster was covered with wounds, which were still gushing out blood.

These were… creatures created by Hysteria.

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. Judging by the aura exuding from these monsters, it was clear that they had already existed for countless years. They were not like the “newbies” that assaulted cities every time, and had extremely weak auras of age.

Could it be that these were Hysteria’s troops that had not died when space had been previously folded?

“There are just over a dozen lingering dregs!” a Heavenly Venerate said disdainfully. He was a great elite from the fourth level, and rushed forwards to fight them immediately.

With him leading the way, the others would naturally not sit idly by, and they all surged towards these monsters.

Usually, it would be Hysteria’s army that would be bullying them with an advantage in numbers, but now the situation was completely reversed. These over a dozen monsters were being ganged up on by several thousand Heavenly Venerates, and they were destroyed very soon. This place suppressed one’s cultivation level, so they were all First Tier Heavenly Venerates. The advantage in numbers was too important.

“They are all at the Third Tier.” After the battle ended, everyone analyzed the condition of these monsters.

“When space folded all those years ago, they had been left here.”

“After a good number of epochs, they have also developed their own intelligence. If it were not for the advantage in numbers, they would not have been so easily dealt with.”

“Thankfully, there is suppression from the Power of Dimension. They are small in number, after all, so they would not cause too much impact.”

“Still, to think that there are actually dregs of Hysteria’s troops still alive here. This is truly unimaginable.”

“…These monsters could come out, so does that mean that we can go down as well?”

Everyone was making their guesses. Because these monsters could come from the bottom of the lake alive, though they were severely wounded, then the crowd, too, should be able to go down.

Immediately, quite a number of people leaped out, and dived down the pit in the center of the lake. There was no pressure from the lake waters here, so they naturally would not have to suffer that terrifying pressure. Otherwise, those soldiers of Hysteria from before would not have been able to appear, either.

“Let’s hurry too,” one of Yuan Yinglong’s lackeys said. This was a Heavenly Venerable Seal; it was too valuable.

Ling Han waved a hand dismissively. “Don’t be impatient.”

He felt that this whirlpool was not stable. What if people dived under, and then the lake waters suddenly poured over them? That would be equivalent to countless Third Tier Heavenly Venerates attacking them all at once, and who would be able to withstand that?

Yuan Yinglong nodded as well. “Don’t be rash.”

Most people had suppressed their greed. While one had to be brave to contend for treasures in an ancient site, to simply rush in without any reservations was not courage, but rather recklessness.

Some spoke up to warn them, but a great many people still stayed stubborn, and did not heed these warnings.

As they saw it, this was a great opportunity that belonged to them, and definitely could not be missed. If they fell even one step behind, the Heavenly Venerable Seal might be obtained by another.

They dived in, and very soon disappeared from the range of everyone’s senses.

In only 15 minutes, the ground started to tremble fiercely again. Boom! A massive wave rose, and great amounts of lake water gushed into the whirlpool.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically.

With so much lake water gushing downwards, this was equivalent to having over 100 Third Tier Heavenly Venerates attacking at the same time. Just how many First Tier Heavenly Venerates were needed to be able to withstand that?

…At the very least, those people inside the lake were not enough.

They were done for. In this little bit of time, they definitely could not have reached the bottom of the lake. Then, without any place where they could hide, their only fate would be death.

Everyone shook their head. Even a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate was helpless. To say nothing of the fact that their power was suppressed in this place, even if they could use their full power, they would only be able to ensure their own safety when faced with this kind of attack. How would they be able to save others?

It could not be helped. This was also what those people asked for.

Everyone waited patiently, and the pit in the middle of the whirlpool gradually grew in size a while later. The water level of the lake also began to diminish. Furthermore, it was at a very high speed at that.

This space was again compressed and collided, and the terrain was changed again. The bottom of the lake should have cracked. In fact, it might even be connected to another dimension, and that was why the lake water had been extracted.

The water level was rapidly falling, and everyone could also feel that the pressure in the lake waters was quickly decreasing.

The contest… was about to begin.

Weng! Weng! Weng!

A few more figures shot over from a distance, and landed on the banks of the lake. They looked to vary in age, but they all exuded a great aura that could suppress the heaven and earth. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Gasp!”

“These are… the great elites of the fifth level!”

...

“Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates!”

Quite a number of people immediately exclaimed in shock. They had not thought that even Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates would be alerted.

Thankfully, there was suppression of cultivation levels here. Even a Fourth Tier would only have the battle prowess of a First Tier, so this was still a fair competition.

“Shen Fei, Wu Feng, He Liqun…” Yuan Yinglong had visited the fifth spatial level before. He recognized at least half of these Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han was slightly startled. He Liqun? Wasn’t that He Yufeng’s old man?

Previously, just because he had broken through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and because he had an old man at the Fourth Tier, He Yufeng had publicly bullied Ling Han in the martial academy. Afterwards, Ling Han’s strength had greatly increased, and he turned around to thrash He Yufeng severely as payback.

But this garnered the resentment from He Liqun, and he even refused to approve his application for indefinite leave. He was extremely petty.

And now, Ling Han finally saw the man himself.

A smile slowly appeared at the corners of Ling Han’s lips. This place suppressed one’s cultivation level, so could this be considered as He Liqun delivering himself straight to Ling Han’s doorstep?
