Chapter 2187: Yield

Three great monarch tiers were working together, and even then, they were actually only capable of fighting Ling Han to a tie?

It should be known that the greater the restrictions on cultivation level, the smaller the advantage they would have as those who have attained the Fifth Severance, and formed the strongest divided soul.

For example, 100 was greater than 90 by 10, but everyone had been weakened 10 times. In that case, 10 was only greater than nine by one, and the advantage would correspondingly shrink tenfold.

Vice versa, if the restrictions on cultivation level was lifted, then wouldn’t Ling Han be even more heaven-defyingly powerful?

Cheng Zixin and the others were all shaking their heads inwardly. Perhaps Ling Han was only a Yin Soul, or even a Yang Soul. In that case, without the restriction of cultivation level, any one of them would be able to easily suppress Ling Han.

However, that was a matter for the future. At present, though, Ling Han was heavily suppressing them in a battle of three against one, and no matter how they used various celestial techniques, it was of no help in the situation.

They were all extremely resentful. That was because after their cultivation levels had been restricted, a great many celestial techniques were no longer usable, causing them to feel like they were tied up, which was incredibly horrible.

However, they did not know that the person under the heaviest restriction was Ling Han. His strongest deadly attack was the Great Clash of Source Powers, but now all nine Source Powers of heaven and earth had entered into slumber, and could not be used at all.

Otherwise, Ling Han would have been able to insta-kill all three of them with the first move.

Yet Ling Han was completely unconcerned. He had already created his own path. The Great Clash of Source Powers was only one of his deadly attacks, and he would eventually give it up—even if the Five Elements could all be improved to the level of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

It was useless!

Ling Han’s goal was the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Even if he managed to advance them to the Ninth Heaven Celestial King-level, so what? He definitely would not think of them as his true trump cards.

He used Fists of Fury, and his aura immediately changed. It was as if he was a primitive emperor that had descended, exuding a domineering air that could suppress one and all.

Cheng Zixin and the others all paled in shock. Standing in front of Ling Han, they felt very tiny, as if the latter could crush them to dust with a casual punch. For better or worse, they were still monarch tiers, so they hurriedly suppressed the fear in their hearts, burning their fighting spirit as much as possible, and going all out in battle.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. The fighting spirit of this trio was worth recognition, and what he wanted was precisely this kind of talent. Otherwise, when they met with the storm of darkness in the future, wouldn’t they instantly weaken and flee from battle when they saw how there were more numbers and more elites on the opposing side?

He had the mind to make these three submit to him, and thus did not use his full power, and merely used Fists of Fury to suppress the trio.

Cheng Zixin and the others were all shouting in fury, but it was completely useless. On the level of the Mountain River Tier, Ling Han was invincible, and even if it was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, it would still be the same.

After fighting for half a day, Ling Han suddenly stopped, and asked smilingly, “How about it? Yield?”

“No way!” Cheng Zixin and the others all exclaimed. They were unconvinced, and thought that it was the cultivation level that restricted their movements. Otherwise, how could it be possible that the three of them working together were still no match for Ling Han?

Ling Han could see their defiance, and thus said, “All right. Then, when we go out, we’ll have another match!”

Cheng Zixin and the others looked at one another, and nodded in unison.

Though they were not convinced, they had completely acknowledged Ling Han’s strength. In a battle of equal levels, they were no match for him, and there was nothing to say about that.

“Brother Fu, Brother Cheng, Brother He, come, sit, sit, sit,” Yan Xianlu said smilingly. He naturally was playing the role of mediator. Otherwise, with how these three people had just been beaten by Ling Han, how could they bring themselves to stay?

Indeed, Fu Zhou and the others were initially planning to leave, but firstly, Yan Xianlu had spoken up and invited them, and secondly, they did need to rest and recover their energy. Thus, they nodded, and sat cross-legged on the ground, taking out alchemical pills to ingest.

However, they had just taken their alchemical pills out when their vision blurred. Ling Han had actually snatched their alchemical pills.

“You…” The trio stood up. ‘You’ve gone too far, haven’t you? Do you plan on humiliating us?’

Ling Han smiled, and tossed out three alchemical pill bottles with a wave of his hand. “Use the alchemical pills I concoct.”

The three of them took the pill bottles, exchanged looks, and then doubtfully removed the cork of the bottle. After they poured out the alchemical pills, they immediately looked stunned.

“Primordial Heart Nurturing Pill!”

Ling Han nodded slightly. They recognized this kind of alchemical pill, as expected of monarch tiers.

“Primordial Heart Nurturing Pill, a Three-Star alchemical pill, and even among Three-Star alchemical pills, it can be ranked in the upper echelons.”

“For those below Ascending Origin Tier, this is the best alchemical pill for recovering Origin Power.”

“Furthermore, it’s a Sixth Refinement at that!”

The three of them spoke one after another, showing that they had considerable knowledge regarding alchemical pills as well.

This was natural. Though they were not alchemists themselves, as cultivators, they had to have a very detailed understanding of alchemical pills as well. Otherwise, how would they know if they had made a profit or loss should they purchase an alchemical pill at the auction house? Or if they should obtain one in an ancient site, how would they know if it could be ingested?

…Why wasn’t it a Four-Star alchemical pill? Wasn’t Ling Han capable of concocting such an alchemical pill?

This was not Ling Han being stingy, but that Four-Star alchemical pills were prepared for Ascending Origin Tiers, and why was Ascending Origin Tier called Ascending Origin Tier? That was because the Origin Power in their bodies was soaring, turning into Source Power. If cultivators of the Immortal Palace Tier or below ingested this kind of alchemical pill, they would definitely explode and die from the force.

“You concocted this?” Fu Zhou asked in disbelief.

Though this was only a Three-Star alchemical pill, what did Sixth Refinement mean?

Ling Han definitely had to be a Four-Star Alchemist.

In terms of pure status, Four-Star Alchemists would definitely be superior to Dividing Soul Tiers, and superior by an unknown amount at that.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and answered, “That’s right.”

Gasp! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Fu Zhou and the others all inhaled sharply, appearing incredibly stunned.

‘F***, are you even human?

‘Not only are you a monarch tier, you are also an alchemist, and a Four-Star Grandmaster at that?

‘Monster, an absolute monster.’

However, it was also precisely because of this that the conflicted feelings that Fu Zhou and his group felt towards Ling Han decreased considerably.

A Four-Star Grandmaster, and one that was so young, had extremely high hopes of advancing to become a Five-Star Alchemist. And once Ling Han became a Five-Star Alchemist, to say nothing of them, even Celestial Kings would be very polite upon meeting him.

“Brother Ling!” They paid their greetings to Ling Han again, and this time their manner was filled with sincerity, and they now considered him important.

Of course, they had not been fully convinced yet. After leaving this place, they would definitely have another fierce battle with Ling Han again.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Recover your vitality quickly. We still have to climb the mountain.”

They continued to recover their vitality, and after half a day, Fu Zhou and his group opened their eyes at the same time. They had completely recuperated.

“As expected of the Primordial Heart Nurturing Pill, and it’s a Sixth Refinement at that. Merely a single pill is enough to help me recover practically all my vitality.”

“En, if it was our own alchemical pills, one would only help to recover about 30% of our power, and the more alchemical pills ingested, the stronger the immunity would be. Not only would its effects drop drastically, it would also leave behind alchemic poison in the body.”

The trio were all profuse with their praise. Previously, they had only known that this alchemical pill was good, but they had completely no knowledge of the extent of its benefits. They only knew after trying it out themselves.

“Let’s go.”

The group continued their climb, and after journeying for a stretch, they discovered that the air was getting thinner and thinner, causing their faces to become incredibly pale, and their bodies to sway, practically about to pass out.

After advancing into the Flower Blossom Tier, cultivators would be able to fly in the skies and tunnel through the ground, no longer requiring ordinary food or even air to breathe. As long as there was Spiritual Qi, they could stay alive.

Yet now, they actually felt difficulties in breathing. How could this not be extremely illogical?

Clearly, this was another test from the heaven and earth.

“Hold on!” Ling Han cheered the women on. If there was anyone that really could not bear it, he could only draw them into the Black Tower. He could not really allow them to die here, after all, right?
