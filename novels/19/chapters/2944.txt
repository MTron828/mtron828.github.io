2945 Exchange of Blows

It went without saying that it would be a terrible idea to offend the masses.

Thank you readers!

Lin Youlian possessed a battle prowess at the Sixth Tier, and she could easily suppress any single person beneath the platform. If they teamed up, however, they would be powerful enough to stop her in her tracks. Moreover, Xin Qihu wasn’t weaker than her, and Feng Wuding was only slightly weaker than her. Thus, she couldn’t do as she pleased.

If she insisted on supporting Ling Han, this would potentially cause the Flaming Frost army to fracture and collapse. Such a consequence would be far too severe.

‘What should I do?’

Even though she was usually calm and composed, she couldn’t help but feel at a loss at this moment.

!!

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Very well! If you want to capture me, then come over here! Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

“Ling Han, you’re far too selfish! If you choose to resist, won’t that be hurting our alliance and helping our enemies?” Xin Qihu said loudly, his face filled with righteousness.

‘Holy! F*ck!’

Ling Han truly wanted to kill Xin Qihu at this moment. Even at this moment, this person was still playing his little games. It looked like he was trying to persuade Ling Han, but in reality, he was actually adding fuel to the fire. He was igniting everyone’s emotions.

If Ling Han truly killed someone here—even if his innocence was proven at a later date—how could he ever be forgiven? In fact, it was extremely likely that no one would even continue to investigate the reality of the situation. At that time, he would suffer injustice forever.

There was Hysteria pressuring them from the outside, and there was Xin Qihu causing trouble from the inside. Were they trying to force him into a dead-end?

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly descended at this moment, radiating with a profound aura that suppressed all matter.

Everyone looked over, and they involuntarily shuddered. They hurriedly bowed, and said, “Our respects to Lord Zhou!”

This person was none other than Zhou Heng.

Lin Youlian breathed a sigh of relief. When Ling Han had arrived yesterday, she had already informed Zhou Heng, Lin Xiaoyang, and the others of the situation. Even though Zhou Heng had arrived slightly later than desired, his status as a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate was more than enough to suppress everyone.

Zhou Heng nodded in acknowledgment, and gestured for everyone to get up.

By comparing Zhou Heng’s aura to Lin Youlian’s, it was clear that the former was far superior even though they both possessed a battle prowess at the Sixth Tier.

This was because he wasn’t an ordinary Sixth Tier. Instead, he was a supremely powerful elite who might advance to the Seventh Tier at any moment.

Even though Zhou Heng’s cultivation level was being suppressed here, he most likely still wouldn’t lose to Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang, the three greatest prodigies of all eternity. After all, as someone who had the right to become a Seventh Tier, was he not one of the most paramount prodigies?

Was the pinnacle cultivation level not the Seventh Tier?

As expected of one of the strongest Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates. He was able to immediately control the situation.

“Ling Han is indeed one of the seeds chosen by Hysteria,” Zhou Heng continued.

Everyone had only just calmed down, yet their intense emotions were immediately reignited. They had only been suspicious just then, but would a Sixth Tier elite lie to them? This was especially the case since it was Zhou Heng, a super elite who had the right to advance to the Seventh Tier.

“Kill him!”

“That’s right! We definitely have to kill this spy! Otherwise, who knows what abominable crime he’ll commit?”

“Kill him! Kill him!”

Zhou Heng held up a hand, and everyone instantly fell silent again.

“However, Chu Hao, Lin Xiaoyang, and I already knew about this quite a while ago. We also investigated Ling Han’s mind, and we can guarantee that he’s already erased the mark that Hysteria left behind. He’s got no relationship with Hysteria.”

This…!

Everyone became hesitant and indecisive upon hearing this.

On one side, there was “solid and indisputable evidence,” while on the other side, there was Zhou Heng, a supremely powerful figure. In fact, there was even Lin Xiaoyang and Chu Hao, two Sixth Tier elites. One had to realize that Chu Hao was also someone who had the right to advance to the Seventh Tier.

The three of them were vouching for Ling Han right now, so who dared to question them? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Who dared to disrespect their stance?

At the very least, no one here dared to oppose them. This was the case for Wu Haoyang, Xin Qihu, and Feng Wuding

“Lord Zhou, don’t be tricked by him!” Feng Wuding said, not willing to give up. Ling Han was already on the verge of being nailed to the pillar of shame, yet Zhou Heng’s arrival had quickly turned the situation on its head. Was Ling Han going to be rescued just like this?

No, Feng Wuding definitely couldn’t accept this.

Everyone nodded in agreement. Even though Zhou Heng was extremely powerful, Hysteria was even more powerful than him. Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising if Zhou Heng and the others failed to detect Hysteria’s tricks.

“Lord Zhou, you shouldn’t sacrifice your brilliant reputation for the sake of Ling Han,” someone said. However, they were hidden in the crowd, and they didn’t reveal their identity.

Ling Han swept his gaze across the room. This person was extremely sinister, and he was purposely trying to drag Zhou Heng’s name through the mud. Perhaps he was Huangfu Dongyue’s companion?

However, it was a shame that this person was hidden too well. Everyone here was a Heavenly Venerate, so their powerful and varied auras made it extremely difficult to pinpoint this person.

Someone suddenly appeared, and said, “Heh, I’m also of the same opinion!”

He was also radiating with a profound and domineering aura. This was another Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Yue Borong.

Ling Han furrowed his brows. Zhou Heng’s arrival was naturally good news. However, Yue Borong’s arrival was the complete opposite.

Yue Borong glanced at Ling Han, not concealing his powerful killing intent as he said, “Since he’s suspected of being in cahoots with Hysteria, we have to capture and execute him. It’s better that we wrongly execute someone than wrongly exonerate someone.”

‘F*ck you, you old dog!’

Hu Niu immediately jumped up, and said, “Old man, what nonsense are you spewing?!”

“You dare to disrespect me?” Yue Borong said coldly. He launched a palm strike at Hu Niu.

“You’re seeking death!!” Ling Han roared. His gaze was cold as he leaped forward and threw a punch.

Peng!

Yue Borong’s attack was immediately blocked. However, Ling Han didn’t stop, and he continued to charge at Yue Borong.

‘Old man, you really think that you can do as you please?’

In terms of true battle prowess, Yue Borong was definitely more powerful than Ling Han. However, this place would suppress one’s cultivation level, so those who were at the Sixth Tier would also be suppressed to the Fifth Tier. In that case, just how powerful would Yue Borong still be?

Even if he were a freak who could overcome the barrier to the Sixth Tier while still at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, the most his battle prowess could reach was still only the early stage of the Sixth Tier.

As for Ling Han?

He could reach the middle stage of the Sixth Tier!

Thus, Ling Han would naturally have an advantage.

Peng, peng, peng!

After a flurry of furious exchanges, Yue Borong had no option but to retreat continuously. This caused him to roar in rage.

He was a mighty Sixth Tier elite! Moreover, he had come here in a haughty and domineering manner for no other reason than to capture Ling Han.

But now?

Ling Han was actually forcing him to retreat! He was being humiliated in front of everyone!

“Just who do you think you are? You actually dared to attack my wife?” Ling Han said coldly. His attacks became even more furious.

“That’s right! What right do you have to attack Niu!” Hu Niu fumed, with her hands on her hips.

Everyone was rendered speechless. Hu Niu hadn’t been hurt at all, and it was instead Yue Borong who was being completely suppressed by Ling Han. If anyone were to feel furious, it should have been Yue Borong.

Yue Borong roared in rage as he used a trump card, boosting himself with a second-grade seal as he unleashed an attack at Ling Han.

However, this was utterly useless.

Ling Han was someone who possessed a first-grade seal. He had already enjoyed an advantage before, so after boosting himself with the Heavenly Venerable Seal, he became even more powerful and domineering. Yue Borong was unable to counterattack, and he could only continue to retreat as he was pummeled by Ling Han.
