Chapter 2224: Gained respect

The 19 of them moved at the same time. Though their cultivation levels varied—the weakest was at Second Secret, and the majority were at Third Secrets—with so many of them attacking at the same time, their might was naturally world-shaking.

However, Ling Huo and the others merely crossed their arms over their chests, appearing to be completely unconcerned.

They had watched Ling Han in battle many times, and suppressing Third Secret king tiers was naturally child’s play for him. Now that Ling Han had further advanced to the First Secret, even a Fifth Secret king tier could just barely match him.

However, Li Hongfei and the others were unaware that Ling Han was that strong. When they saw that Ling Han was indeed going to confront elites like them alone, they couldn’t help but smirk coldly.

He bit off more than he could chew!

Boom, multiple giant hands descended, as if multiple stars were falling down, which was incredibly terrifying,

Ling Han smiled slightly, and casually swept out his hand.?Peng, peng, peng.?He had instantly sent all 19 of them flying backwards, all of them throwing up blood madly.

And this was still because he had held back. Otherwise, he would have been able to insta-kill all 19 of them.

Li Hongfei and his group all paled in shock. He was only a mere First Secret, yet could actually defeat all 19 of them in an instant. What kind of concept was that?

Monarch tier?

Even a monarch tier could only be invincible against an opponent superior by two levels, which was equivalent to a Third Secret king tier, but there were as many as 10 such elites among them, so no matter what, they shouldn’t have been defeated by Ling Han in a single blow.

“Above monarch tier…” Li Hongfei said shakily, even his body was trembling.

Such an existence was called Monarch Star in the Clear Heaven Pass, placed high above as if they were in the Ninth Heaven, and other monarch tiers could only look up at them.

“Monarch Star!” Deng Li also exclaimed, his expression filled with disbelief.

This coward in their eyes was actually a Monarch Star, a supreme overlord that would definitely become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in future!

They exchanged looks, and then all yielded, falling to one knee. “Greetings, my lord.”

The people of Clear Heaven Pass were all incredibly realistic. Monarch Stars would definitely become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. This was the strongest power of the Clear Heaven Pass, and was also the rock main pillar that stood against the Foreign Realm, and would be nurtured with great focus. Thus, Deng Li and the others immediately knelt and conceded.

Ling Han faltered as well. He had seen many different types of people, but he had not seen many that were like them.

He nodded, and said, “Rise.”

Only then did Li Hongfei and the other others stand up. One of them said, “Please come into the pass, my lord.”

They set out together, but did not fly to that stronghold in the skies. Instead, they arrived at the area beneath the stronghold, and Ling Han saw that there were formation patterns carved on the ground. It was clear that they had been there a long time, and some traces were already mottled.

They stood on the formation patterns, and after Deng Li used the horn to say a few words, a light surged over, wrapping around them. When the light flashed again, they had already appeared in the great city in the skies.

Clear Heaven Pass dominated the path that the Foreign Realm had to take in their invasion. It was incredibly majestic, and when they appeared inside it, they could immediately feel a militaristic air of bloodshed and an ancient air of age that assaulted their senses.

Even a person with the weakest character would be influenced by this atmosphere when they came here, and proceed to show a stronger side of themselves.

“Please come with us.” Li Hongfei and the others continued to lead the way, bringing Ling Han and his group onwards.

In other places of the Celestial Realm, every city was as huge as a planet. Thus, there were actually mountains and rivers here, which was then followed by scattered towns. But in this place, there were no mountains or bodies of water. It was all structures that were constructed from stones, filled with a primitive air.

Occasionally, they could see the corpses of elites of the Foreign Realm. They had been suppressed in the formation, and their power was being extracted and supplied for the whole defense system of the great city.

They traveled for slightly less than half a day’s time before finally arriving in front of a stone military camp. Then, Li Hongfei brought Ling Han and his group in to meet with the person in charge here.

That was a man with a single eye. A piece of black cloth covered his left eye, and his black hair hung over his shoulders. His upper body was bared, muscles bulging as if they were built from mountain rock.

An Ascending Origin Tier, Ling Han thought. He had cultivated the Heaven Deceiving Technique, and thus was the most sensitive to auras. However, because the gap in their cultivation levels was too wide, he could not judge the other’s exact cultivation level.

“New disciples from the Saintly Origin Academy?” this one-eyed man said.

“Yes.” Ling Han nodded, then turned around, and pointed at Ling Huo and the others. “They are my followers.”

The one-eyed man was slightly surprised because he could sense how strong Ling Huo and the others were. Instead, it was Ling Han that seemed very ordinary—this naturally was because of the Heaven Deceiving Technique.

He was not overly curious, though, and said, “You have been recruited under my leadership. We are 17th camp of Unit D, and I am your senior officer. My name is Nie Heshan. Settle down first, and I will slowly assign missions to you.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “My lord, we will beg our leave first then.”

They walked out of Nie Heshan’s stone house, and Li Hongfei approached them again. “My lord, let me arrange accommodations for you.”

“Tell me about the recent situation,” Ling Han asked.

“Yes.”

Li Hongfei began to talk about the major events that had happened in these few years. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Just as the Eternity Celestial King had said, the Foreign Realm had issued a written war challenge to the Celestial Realm, wanting to hold matches for the younger generation. However, in these years, it had only been Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier prodigies that were battling, and had not yet been raised to the level of the Immortal Palace Tier.

Judging by the present situation, the Celestial Realm’s side was in extremely terrible circumstances.

That was because the younger generation of the Celestial Realm had fought a total of 17 battles, yet had lost every single one of them. The prodigies of the Celestial Realm were too strong. From Severing Mundane Tier to Dividing Seven Souls, there were supreme monarch tiers in each level.

Especially in the Dividing Soul Tier, where there was no shortage of Dividing Five Souls, Dividing Six Souls or even Dividing Seven Souls elites. Though it was possible that they could never attain Dividing Nine Souls, their strength was much greater than that of Dividing Four Souls monarch tiers.

This was an absolutely one-sided suppression.

And it was also because of these repeated losses that the Celestial Realm did not dare to easily agree to starting an Immortal Palace Tier competition with the Foreign Realm.

Why?

That was because while the Celestial Realm had such Monarch Stars like Ji Wuming and Jia Lan, the cultivation levels of these four great Monarch Stars were too low. As long as the Foreign Realm had such Monarch Stars, they only had to attain Second Secret or Third Secret, and they would be able to suppress Ji Wuming and the others.

Hence, they did not dare agree to another match with the Foreign Realm, fearing that it would result in a complete loss again. If that was the case, the morale of the cultivators of the Celestial Realm would drop to rock bottom.

The Celestial Realm would definitely go to war again with the Foreign Realm, and boost their military morale which was already very low, but it was definitely not now. At least, it would have to wait until Ji Wuming and the others reached the Fifth Secret.

Thus, in the recent times, the monarch tiers had all been sent into the most dangerous locations, cultivating amidst bloody battles to increase their cultivation level as soon as possible. Of course, the cultivation resources they obtained were also exceedingly high in amount. All kinds of natural treasures were poured on them.

This was also one of the reasons for why Li Hongfei and the others hated Ling Han. They felt that those like him had been rewarded without any efforts, and this was unfair for the citizens of Clear Heaven Pass.

On the other side, the connecting point between the two Realms had become more and more stable. Perhaps, after another while, even Heavenly Venerable Tier power would be able to pass. By then, it would not be minor skirmishes like this, but a full-out war.

Hence, the present generation had to mature as quickly as possible.

After Ling Han settled down, he immediately entered into the Black Tower to concoct alchemical pills so that the Empress and the others could break through to the Immortal Palace Tier as soon as possible.

Only a day had passed in the outside world, and Ling Han had concocted enough Thousand Year Dream Pills, which would be sufficient for them to enter the Time Mystery Realm a few more times..
