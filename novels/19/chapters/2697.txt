2698 Your Grandpa is the one

“Heavenly Brilliance Tier!” As soon as the young man in fine clothes made a move, everyone was shocked.

Heavenly Brilliance Tier—the corresponding level of martial arts in the Celestial Realm would be the Ascending Origin Tier. This was indeed extremely strong, completely crushing the weaklings here. With just one move, the person who had spoken was seized by the young man in fine clothes.

He gripped the other party’s neck, and said lightly, “I didn’t hear clearly what you said earlier. Can you repeat?”

The man showed hesitation, but in the end he didn’t dare to attempt being valiant, and said, “It’s my fault for being blind as a bat and offending Young Master, please forgive me.”

This was a world of cultivators, where those with strength would be respected. Had he dared to attempt being valiant, then he would have died in vain if he had been killed.

The young man in fine clothes laughed out loud, raised his hand, and threw the man. He took a step, and pa, pa, pa, several “Ling Han Blood Stones” on the ground shattered to pieces, which also proved that the stones were fake. Otherwise, had they truly been stained with the blood of a Celestial King, they wouldn’t have been so easily destroyed by a person of the Ascending Origin Tier.

“So what of Ling Han? If I had been born 200,000 years earlier, I would have killed him with a single swat of my hand!” he said arrogantly.

Everyone was angry, but didn’t dare not speak out. They thought to themselves that Ling Han was merely a Seventh Heaven Celestial King at that time, but he killed more than 10 Celestial Kings at the peak of Ninth Heaven in one battle, fought against a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate for half a year, and blocked the Yun Clan so much so that no one dared to step out their doors. How domineering and powerful was this?

What was a mere Heavenly Brilliance Tier like this guy worth?

‘If Lord Ling Han had not fallen, would you have dared to slander him like this?’

“Remember, my name is Situ Taisun!” said the young man in fine clothes. “The future of the world will belong to me. One day, I will trample all the prodigies under my feet. People like Ji Wuming, Heavenborn, and Du Shiyi can only look up to me!”

Everyone was speechless. This was too shameless indeed; his conceit practically soared to the skies.

The large black dog couldn’t bear it any longer, and said, “You snob, have you devoured the courage of an Immortal Dragon to actually dare to boast so shamelessly!”

Situ Taisun looked at the large black dog with an angry expression. “What kind of dog dares to act presumptuously in front of me!”

The large black dog was furious. He hated people mentioning the word “dog” in front of him as it was tantamount to cursing him face to face. He gave a howl, waved his paw, and swatted towards Situ Taisun.

“You’re courting death!” Situ Taisun sneered and raised his palm to fight back. He was of the Heavenly Brilliance Tier, and the only person stronger than him in heaven and earth would be a Celestial King. However, even in the Flaming Frost Realm, a Celestial King wasn’t just anybody, and would not be so easily encountered.

Peng!

With one blow, Situ Taisun was immediately sent flying. Given his strength, he was certainly no match for the large black dog. In fact, the large black dog didn’t even need to make a move; he could crush him into a puddle of blood with just a snort.

However, the large black dog didn’t want to reveal his identity for the time being, so Situ Taisun was flipped upside down with a slap, and his head was planted in the ground, so deep that half his body was embedded in it.

Even so, there was a buzz of gasps all around.

That person was someone at the Heavenly Brilliance Tier, after all, and he was knocked over with a slap. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

‘Could it be that you are a Celestial King?’

Everyone looked at the large black dog with admiration.

Though Ling Han could see Celestial Kings all around him after he had arrived at the martial academy, so many that he was almost bored by it, in fact, the number of Celestial Kings was still low even in the Flaming Frost Realm. It was just that place where Ling Han had stayed happened to be full of Celestial Kings, which gave the feeling that the number of Celestial Kings was exceptionally high.

For the vast majority of people, the Severing Mundane Tier was already unattainable, while an Immortal Palace Tier could be regarded as a peerless elite, and an Ascending Origin Tier would be an overlord of a region, capable of starting a sect and establishing a faction.

How powerful was a Celestial King Tier?

These were just minor characters of the Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier. Naturally, to see a Celestial King with their own eyes was extremely exciting, so much that they were about to cry.

“My Lord, you have caused trouble!” A person approached from the street, and said, “A few days ago, I saw with my own eyes a young master of the Yun Clan accompanying this person, so the identity of this person must be extraordinary. My Lord, you had best leave quickly.

Hearing this, the people around inhaled sharply, showing an expression of great reverence.

They didn’t know Situ Taisun, but they knew what the Yun Clan symbolized.

…The clan was right on top of them, right? Who of those that came to the clan’s territory would not know the power of the Yun Clan?

To have a relationship with the Yun Clan was incredible!

Not to mention Situ Taisun’s own background, as long as the Yun Clan was willing to stand up for him, what Celestial King could bear up to such fury?

To speak of nothing else, Ling Han was already very powerful and freakish, right? Hadn’t he still died here?

The large black dog couldn’t help being amused. He was not afraid of the Yun Clan now, of course, and said smilingly, “So what about the Yun Clan, as long as they dare to come, Grandpa, I, will destroy them with one hand.”

The corners of everyone’s mouth twitched. Situ Taisun had been bragging before, but now the large black dog was even more able to talk nonsense. It was a pity that none of them dared to refute.

“Why, you still don’t believe it?” the large black dog barked. “I will sit here for the whole day today, and wait for the Yun Clan to come.”

Sure enough, he sat down on the side, but one paw could not help but habitually stick up, trying to scratch his neck, and it was very hard to hold back the urge.

Everyone didn’t dare to persuade him anymore. This was a Celestial King, so who would dare to talk too much in front of him?

After a while, sure enough, someone from the Yun Clan came.

The Yun Clan was located in the clouds, and they naturally descended from the sky. There were two people in total, both of whom were extremely handsome young men.

When they saw Situ Taisun “planted” in the ground, they showed anger.

“Brother Tailong, my brother had an accident in the territory of our Yun Clan, I will definitely give you an explanation for this,” said a young man who was dressed in green.

The other person, who was dressed in black, nodded. “Of course, I believe Brother Aokong.”

That young man in green clothes was Yun Aokong!

Not only were there many warriors who came to pay their respects to the sacred site of Ling Han’s battle, there were also many disciples from the martial academy who were interested in it. They were all people who had seen how freakish Ling Han could be with their own eyes, and were very interested in the secret of Ling Han’s power. When Ling Han was still “alive,” of course they didn’t dare to do anything, but now that Ling Han was dead, they gained some ideas.

Maybe they could find where Ling Han was buried and obtain everything that had once belonged to him.

Therefore, Yun Aokong returned.

The person dressed in black was named Situ Tailong, and he was also a disciple of the martial academy. He was also a descendant of the Situ Clan. The Situ Clan was a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier noble clan, with an elder of their clan that was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and that background was even stronger than the Yun Clan’s.

“What does the culprit look like?” Yun Aokong asked the surrounding people.

Everyone exchanged looks, a strange feeling rising up in their heart. It was weird to ask what the culprit looked like when the culprit was right there.

Some of them stretched out their fingers, and pointed at the large black dog.

“He looks similar?” Yun Aokong didn’t even think that the large black dog was the culprit, and thought that everyone was using the large black dog for comparison.

“Your grandpa is the one!” the large black dog declared proudly. He was actually someone who would bully the weak but tremble before the strong, so he was naturally completely unconcerned about Yun Aokong.

Yun Aokong was stunned for a moment, and then burst into anger.

‘You’re so arrogant, you beat someone, yet didn’t run away, and you’re still waiting here?

‘Just how far are you looking down on the Yun Clan?

‘Do you think you are Ling Han?’

Yun Aokong was furious. Now that Ling Han had caused such trouble in their clan, any average Celestial King dared to come to their Yun Clan and flaunt their arrogance?
