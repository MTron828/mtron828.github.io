Chapter 1985: Take refuge with me

This was Alchemy City. Ling Han was the future chairperson of Alchemy City, and he actually had to wait at the entrance for someone to announce his arrival?

This was a straightforward provocation.

Ling Han shook his head. Initially, Lu Xianming could be considered a genius, but now he had actually descended to become someone else’s lowly servant. Furthermore, it was at the entrance to his own residence. This really was a complete and utter disgrace.

“Lu Xianming, to think that I thought of you as a rival, this was my mistake,” Ling Han said with a smile. Then, his face darkened, and he said, “What are you all gathered around here for? Do whatever you all have to do.”

Who would dare disregard the command of the future chairperson?

Immediately, the people in the surroundings left, and it was fortunate enough that Ling Han would not pursue the matter. Of course, they had left now, but it was uncertain when they would come back. After all, Ling Han couldn’t possibly stand guard here forever, right?

Lu Xianming fixed his eyes on Ling Han, his gaze menacing.

As he saw it, the fact that he had fallen to this level was all Ling Han’s fault.

If it were not for Ling Han’s appearance, the person that would’ve been in his position now would be him.

As he looked at it, inheriting the position of chairperson of Alchemy City was only proper and expected. In fact, he had not wanted to become completely hostile with the other Holy Sons, and merely stayed on the defense. He had thought that with the passing of time, his rise to the pinnacle could no longer be stopped, and the other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters like Ou Kan would soon become the subordinates under his rule, so he did not wish any single one of them to be lost.

Power could only be reflected by having talented people, and ruling over prodigies would give a stronger feeling of accomplishment.

But all of this had been ruined by Ling Han.

He was filled with hate and fury!

Thankfully, a wonderful chance had suddenly appeared. The Holy Land of Alchemy of the Western Celestial Realm had actually sent an envoy, and Lu Xianming had also successfully made connections. In the future, he would be able to leave the Eastern Celestial Realm with Ma Tongguang. He was sure that with his natural talent, he would definitely be capable of surpassing Ma Tongguang many years later, and flourish in the Western Celestial Realm.

By then, Ling Han would only be a minor character like a frog at the bottom of a well. Not only did the Western Celestial Realm have a higher overall level of cultivation, its level of alchemy was also considerably higher than the Eastern Celestial Realm’s. At least, there were Five-Star Alchemists in the Western Celestial Realm.

When Lu Xianming became a Four-Star Grandmaster, he would return in glory, and let these people of Alchemy City know just how wrong they had been.

...To actually refuse to choose him as the future chairperson!

Now that he had seen Ling Han, he could not withhold the jealousy in his heart, and deliberately provoked him.

“Holy Son Ling is truly overbearing!” Lu Xianming suppressed the fury in his heart. “Don’t forget you are not Lord Chairperson yet!”

Pa!

Ling Han gave him a slap. With his strength as a peak stage fifth severance, how could Lu Xianming possibly be able to block it? Instantly, he was struck dizzy by this slap.

He had just barely managed to steady his footing, and a sliver of blood was seeping from the corner of his lips, his hair dishevelled, looking extremely pathetic.

Ling Han withdrew his hand, and calmly stated, “Don’t you forget either that you are no longer a Holy Son. If you treat me with disrespect, to say nothing of just a slap, even if I had you executed, no one would say anything to the contrary.”

It was as if Lu Xianming’s eyes could shoot fire, but just as Ling Han had said, he was no longer the noble and majestic Holy Son, but was just an ordinary Two-Star Alchemist. At most, his future was brighter than the rest’s, and he basically could become a Three-Star Alchemist, but if he wanted to become a Four-Star Alchemist, this was practically an impossible feat.

How was he to compare with Ling Han?

Even if he had sustained a slap, he would have to swallow it down. There was nowhere he could go to announce the injustice he had suffered.

To dare to provoke the future Lord Chairperson, wasn’t it right and proper to slap you?

“Hehe, Holy Son Ling, you have honored me with your presence, and I have not come out to receive you. Forgive me for the lapse in manners.” Just at this moment, a loud laugh rang out, and a young man in fluttering white robes walked out of the doors. He really was extremely handsome, his hair as black as ink and thick, and his eyes as bright as the moon, exuding a captivating spirit.

“Young Master Ma!” Lu Xianming hurriedly turned around, and bowed towards this white-robed young man. His attitude could be considered extremely respectful.

This person was Ma Tongguang, the prodigy of alchemy from the Western Celestial Realm.

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed, and he smilingly said, “It is I who have lapsed in manners. Brother Ma has already arrived for a number of days, and I have only just come now to pay you a visit.”

The other, a guest, wanted to overwhelm him, the host, and Ling Han naturally could not give him this chance.

Ma Tongguang looked at Ling Han longer, the smile on his face more and more pronounced as he said, “The alchemists of the Eastern and Western Celestial Realm are a family, so where would there be any difference between host and guest?”

There was an underlying meaning in his words.

Ling Han understood clearly. Ma Tongguang said that the alchemy of the Eastern Celestial Realm and Western Celestial Realm was one family, so there would definitely be a clan leader, right? Then, what right did the Eastern Celestial Realm have to compare to the Western Celestial Realm? They did not even have a Five-Star Alchemist!

Then, if Ling Han admitted that the Eastern and Western Celestial Realm were one and the same, his position as Holy Son and future chairperson of Alchemy City would be more de jure than in fact.

That was simple. Without the approval of the clan leader, what right did you have to become chairperson here?

It was only a few words, but there was already a deep trap hidden there.

This was no simple character!

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “All the alchemists in the world share the same path, and the Eastern Celestial Realm and Western Celestial Realm are like two brothers. We alchemists of the Eastern Celestial Realm have less wealth, so we would still have to ask for more help from the brothers in the Western Celestial Realm.”

Even with brothers, clear accounts had to be kept, what more when it concerned interfering in the internal affairs of the other.

Thus, it was best that they each minded their own business.

Ma Tongguang paused slightly, and then broke out into laughter, as if he was very pleased.

Ling Han only smiled faintly. He could not bother himself to keep up superficial appearances with the other party.

“Brother Ling would definitely be representing Grandmaster Zi Cheng to attend the gathering of alchemy in the Western Celestial Realm, right?” Ma Tongguang suddenly changed the topic.

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded. “That is precisely why I have come.”

Lu Xianming immediately revealed an expression of jealousy. If Ling Han had not been there in his way, the person who would have had this chance would have been him.

How grand it would be, representing the whole world of alchemy of the Eastern Celestial Realm.

But now? He could only participate as the friend of Ma Tongguang—and this was putting it in a nice way. If one was blunter, then he would just be a lackey, or an underling. Who would care about a person like him?

Originally, he had been the Holy Son of Alchemy City, and would’ve been surrounded by people everywhere he went, and now he had fallen from the heavens right down to rock bottom, which was something he could not get used to no matter what.

And with this, he had also understood why Ou Kan and the others were so determined to eliminate him previously, without any care for their kinship as fellow alchemists. The temptation of power was really too big.

Now, if he was given a chance to get rid of Ling Han, he would definitely make use of this chance, whatever the cost.

Ma Tongguang said, “Brother Ling, after you reach the Western Celestial Realm, you will realize that the level of the Eastern Celestial Realm is really too low. To say nothing of anything else, merely in terms of Four-Star Alchemists, we have a total number of 3,655 that have been recorded in the Western Celestial Realm!”

This disparity was too large, wasn’t it? There were only 10 Four-Star Alchemists in the entire Eastern Celestial Realm, and this was counting in those few that had long since become hermits. It was unknown whether they were still even alive now. After all, without becoming a Celestial King, there would ultimately come a day when they would be killed by the Immortal’s Tribulation.

More than 3,600 Four-Star Alchemists, this was really too astonishing.

Ling Han gave an “oh”, and said, “Then there is really quite a number.”

“Brother Ling, though you can also be considered young and promising, your chance of becoming a Four-Star Alchemist is one in a million,” Ma Tongguang stated evenly. “However, if you take refuge with me, with my help, to say nothing of Four-Star Alchemist, even becoming a Five-Star Alchemist would not be impossible!”

Five-Star Alchemist was the existence that was truly an equal of a Celestial King!𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
