Chapter 767: Your Power of Nation Is Wrong

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Ling Han, you’d better think clearly, do you really want to kill them?” Helian Xun Xue approached him with a worried look on her face.

Ling Han glanced at her, and said, “The sea race is at the door. It can’t be avoided in the end, so what if I tolerated them this time? We’ll still meet on the battlefield. If that’s so, why tolerate them? Besides, they already walked all over us and acted atrociously!”

Helian Xun Xue shook her head, and said, “But our strength is too weak, after all, and a long time is needed for growth.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Didn’t you hear them talk? If you couldn’t be found in a month, they’d kill all the people in the imperial city. Then tell me, when the time comes, should I hand you over or not? What a joke, coming to my territory to tell me to give up someone, don’t they know that I’m in charge on my territory?”

Helian Xun Xue was speechless, and, after pausing momentarily, said, “Next time, the Xianyu Family will definitely sent a Shattering Void Tier elite over, what do we do then?”

“Serve it cold 1 ,” Ling Han said with a smile.

He truly was unafraid—with Black Tower’s power boost, he could receive a chance to possess Shattering Void Tier battle prowess, and if he could kill a Shattering Void Tier elite, once the show of might was established, the sea race would have to think hard about attacking him.

Moreover, his grasp of the Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation was gradually reaching a higher stage, and when the time came, he’d really possess Shattering Void Tier battle prowess.

It was a world where strength was honored, and if he weren’t powerful enough, people would only think that he was easy to bully.

Dignity and honor were gotten from fighting, not from begging!

He came to the eastern side of the city. The Xianyu uncle and nephew had already been escorted over, with chains all over their body, kneeling on the high platform.

It was an execution stage where Zhu Long Xin and Qian Feng suffered a hundred lashes previously.

“Human, you’re extremely daring. This will bring death upon yourself, and no one can save you!” Xianyu Dongming shouted furiously. “I am a clansman of the north sea’s Xianyu royal family, the lord of the royal family in the future, and if you dare touch a single hair of mine, the royal family’s thirty-plus Shattering Void Tiers will trample over this place and burn you all into ashes.”

Hearing him say so, many people instantly felt fear. Over thirty Shattering Void Tier elites? It was no joke.

“Still impenitent when death is near at hand!” Ling Han walked over and slapped him such that Xianyu Dongming’s mouth was slapped crooked—he ended up groaning and unable to speak.

Xianyu Cheng knew better, and didn’t speak threatening words, and instead tried to coax Ling Han. “Human, we lacked respect before, but we had no ill intentions, and simply wanted to find that woman. How’s this: you let us go, we’ll compensate you, and if you find that woman, we’ll have a great reward for you!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “You’re a fool, or are you taking me for a fool? To actually say that you had no ill intentions now! No ill intentions? I don’t have any ill intentions towards you guys, just going to kill you.”

Xianyu Dongming wanted to jump in nervousness. If killing him wasn’t ill intention, then what was ill intention?

Pa!

Ling Han slapped Xianyu Dongming on the face, making him stupefied. I didn’t f*cking say anything, so why’d you slap me?

Ling Han said indifferently, “Inside my imperial palace, speaking threats and doing as you please, such non-ill intention is really an eye-opener for me.”

“Human, everything is our fault, but please forgive us once for the sake of north sea’s royal family!” Xianyu Cheng was sincere with his words; so long as he survived, then everything could start over, or else all would come to naught.

Ling Han laughed loudly, patted Xianyu Cheng’s shoulder, and said, “Now you’re quite courteous, but where was this attitude earlier? Unfortunately, we’re destined not to get along with each other, because the woman you’re looking for is my wife!”

Oh sh*t!

After being startled for a while, Xianyu Dongming came to his senses. This f*cking cuckold! At this moment, he really cursed Ling Han’s eighteen generations of ancestors. No one could’ve expected that the person they were looking for was in front of them—not only was Helian Xun Xue here, even the cuckold was too!

“Time for the execution!” Ling Han said coldly. Raising the Revere Life Sword high up, he said loudly, “Great Ling Empire’s imperial prestige cannot be challenged, and no matter who it is that comes, those who challenge my imperial prestige will all be killed!”

Pu, pu, one strike for one life, bursting the Xianyu uncle and nephew’s hearts.

Normally, decapitation would be more impactful, but while Xianyu Dongming’s head was easy to cut off, Xianyu Cheng’s wasn’t—after all, his was a physique of ninth-tier rare metal. Even using the Revere Life Sword wasn’t enough, because Ling Han didn’t have enough strength, and it wouldn’t be a public beheading at that time, but rather a public sawing, and that would drastically reduce the deterrence power.

“Long live the emperor!” The entire imperial city’s subjects all knelt down. Ling Han already declared his position that Great Ling Empire didn’t fear any foreign enemies and all violators would be killed!

Our emperor is awe-inspiring, our emperor is imperious!

The public execution instantly made Ling Han’s image as an emperor deeply rooted into people’s hearts, and when the news spread throughout the entire north region, his image as an iron-blooded emperor was obviously firmly established.

Ling Han returned to the imperial palace, and just when he wanted to rest, he suddenly felt a warning premonition, and shouted, “Who is it!”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, such keen perception. This lady was slightly careless only once and already has been discovered by you for revealing a shred of presence.” With a sigh, a red-haired beauty with an alluring figure walked out, swinging her ample buttocks and thin waist extremely seductively.

She was Yi Shuang Shuang—the red hair was too obvious. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“You!” Ling Han instantly showed a vigilant look. She was a Shattering Void Tier elite, who was also extremely likely to be a high-level one, and he would hardly be a match for her even if he used Black Tower’s power boost.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, what’s with your attitude, you don’t like seeing this lady?” Yi Shuang Shuang said unhappily. “This lady saw that you had some trouble and especially ran over to help you.”

“Oh?” Ling Han said with a smile. “Really couldn’t tell that you’re actually a good person!”

“Tsk, if this lady didn’t feel that you’re especially strange, this lady wouldn’t meddle in your business!” Yi Shuang Shuang stroked her chin, pondered for a while, and then said, “And that little girl’s also very strange. This lady must take her as a disciple.”

“Pah, Niu doesn’t want it!” Hu Niu popped out of nowhere and made a face at Yi Shuang Shuang.

Ling Han gestured with his hand at Hu Niu, and said, “Oh, how do you plan on helping me?”

“On two aspects: first, this lady can reluctantly accept to be a retired empress or something, and second... you call this the power of the nation? Really making this lady laugh her head off!” Yi Shuang Shuang sneered.

Ling Han laughed mischievously, and said, “How about bestowing you the title of an imperial maid, want it?”

“To dare tease this lady, are you tired of living?” Yi Shuang Shuang’s beautiful eyes narrowed as she emitted a dangerous aura.

Ling Han raised both hands with a smile, and said, “What, you can’t take a joke? Can’t we still be friends joyfully?”

Yi Shuang Shuang laughed out loud, patted Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “Youngster, you’re quite daring. This lady actually underestimated you.”

“Please advise, what’s wrong with my power of nation?” Ling Han said with a serious look.
