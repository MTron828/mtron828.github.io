Chapter 649: Ximen Jun

“Concentrate on the fight, don’t make me mock you!” Ling Han shouted. Accumulating energy for 10 000 Techniques Return to One would only take one to two breaths’ time; moreover, he could activate it no matter how little time he had used to accumulate energy, though the less energy gathered, the less the power released would be.

Lu Yuan Shen flew out, and as his wooden sword swept past, a wide Sword Ray slashed out, exuding a terrifying light.

With a long whistle, Ling Han raised his sword to parry the attack. The moment 10 000 Techniques Return to One was used, twenty-nine flashes of Sword Qi condensed into pseudo-Ray, and with the stimulation of 10 000 Techniques Return to One, this strike could pierce through even the defenses of the Deity Transformation Tier.

It was, after all, a Level Ten Spirit Tool.

Hong!

Pseudo-Ray and True Ray collided, and endless sparks were roused, filling the whole mountain cave.

When the light vanished, both Ling Han and Lu Yuan Shen were visibly wounded. It was obvious that neither of them had gotten the advantage in the last strike.

However, Ling Han’s physique was really too strong; the wounds that he had were much lighter. Furthermore, he had also cultivated the Indestructible Heaven Scroll, so his injuries were currently healing at a very fast rate.

Lu Yuan Shen returned his sword to its sheath, and said, “I am unable to defeat you.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “It would also be very difficult for me to defeat you.” Currently, his trump card was no longer the Three Styles of Black Origin, but his three Mystical Powers. If he summoned the Setting Sun Bow, and even used an arrow forged from a Level Eight previous metal, with the simultaneous use of all three Mystical Powers, the power was naturally even higher.

Lu Yuan Shen turned around and left, without casting another look at the Thunder Lotus, seeming very free and at ease.

This man was very strange, but met his gains or losses with equanimity. He was only too focused on his sword arts, and could not understand human emotion. His emotional intelligence was really too low, but he could not really be considered as an evil person.

The world was indeed big. There were innumerable able people as well as geniuses. He had never even heard of this Lu Yuan Shen, but the latter had appeared just like that.

Pa, pa, pa. Lu Yuan Shen had just left, when the sound of footsteps were heard again.

Was there no end to it!?

Ling Han hurriedly ran over to the side of the electricity pool, and plucked that Thunder Lotus. This was not a real Divine Herb; it was merely a unique form taken by the power of lightning, a kind of metamorphosis. Thus, it was useless even if he wanted to plant it in the Black Tower as it was impossible that a second one would grow.

The Thunder Spirit had not yet successfully developed, so it naturally could not be considered a real living creature. It did not have any consciousness to speak off, and added with the fact that the pool of electricity had already dried up, Ling Han very easily plucked the Thunder Lotus, and stored it into the Black Tower.

He was not in a rush to refine it as of yet.

The sound of footsteps neared. This time, there were five people—one man and four women. The man was extremely handsome, and the four women were very beautiful, but they were too flirtatious. Every move and gesture, every smile and frown made it seem like they were trying to seduce others. Their flirty temperament was engrained bone-deep in them.

The man’s gaze swept over, and when he saw the empty electricity pool, a cold expression appeared on his face. He shouted, “Are you the one who took away the Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ling Han did not answer. Instead, he turned around to look at that wall that was covered entirely in human faces.

“How dare you, my young master is asking you a question, and you dare not answer?” One of the women humphed.

“Ugly woman, you dare to act fierce to Niu’s Ling Han?” Hu Niu was abruptly angered, and glared at the speaker, her killing intent flaring.

“Bite, bite her to death!” Rabbit yelled out from one side, wishing for the whole world to be in chaos.

Yet Hu Niu twitched her mouth, and said, “She’s too smelly, Niu can’t bite!”

“Then why do you bite Lord Rabbit so happily?” Rabbit was about to die from fury.

“Rabbit meat smells nice, delicious!” Hu Niu’s eyes lit up.

“You all...” The woman that had shouted in rebuke just now was enraged. This human and rabbit actually dared to ignore her? ... Hold on, a rabbit could actually speak?

The man looked impatient. He said, “I am Ximen Jun, a disciple of the Wind Moon Sect. Hand over the Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder, or I will definitely kill you.”

The Wind Moon Sect?

Ling Han could not help but give out a ‘ha’, and asked, “Is the Wind Moon Sect very awesome?”

“Heng, my young master is the fourth disciple of the sect master of the Wind Moon Sect. He has already broken through to the Spiritual Infant Tier when he was only thirty-four years old. With that kind of cultivation level, he is qualified to rank as one of the topmost geniuses in the whole middle state!” A second woman praised.

This was obviously very effective to Ximen Jun. He crossed his arms over his chest proudly, and posed in a way that said, ‘I am very awesome, you all come and worship me.’

Ling Han said, “Looks like the sect master of the Wind Moon Sect not only has a dead son, but will have one less disciple too! Such an evil, despicable sect; one day, I will definitely erase it cleanly.”

“W-what!?” Ximen Jun could not help but be shocked, and cast a few more glances at Ling Han. “Could it be that you are the one who who killed Junior Brother Disciple Hu?”

“Correct!” Ling Han applauded.

Ximen Jun instantly laughed loudly, and said, “This really means the heavens are on my side! Master has already commanded that whoever can apprehend or kill the criminal that has murdered Junior Brother Disciple Hu will be the one he passes down the position of the sect master to!

“Today, not only will I get the Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder, I will also become the young sect master of the Wind Moon Sect!”

He was too pleased. These were two happy events simultaneously happening; how lucky could he be.

“Congratulations, Young Master!”

“No, it should be congratulations to Young Sect Master!”

“Congratulations, Young Sect Master!”

The four women all exclaimed in happiness as they all pounced over to offer a sweet kiss. Ximen Jun did not refuse any of them, and his hands even groped all over the bodies of the women. If it was not for the fact that Ling Han was not dealt with yet, they were sure not to mind have a session of *** right on the spot.

Ling Han covered Hu Niu’s eyes, and murderous intent appeared on his face as he said, “What an illicit group of man and women; it is a disrespect to the universe not to kill you as the clear, bright skies would be hidden by the filth.”

Without a second word, the lightning on his body flashed, and had already surged over.

“How dare you!?” The four women pounced out at the same time, to counter attack Ling Han.

Ling Han waved his sword, and as the Demon Birth Sword danced, who would be able to stand against its might? Pu, pu, pu, pu. Four heads flew up into the skies, and four headless corpses danced as their severed necks spurted out blood like crazy.

“No!” Ximen Jun roared in rage. Though he had no shortage of beautiful women, these four were his favorite. Not only were their looks above average, they were flirtatious and seductive. Their cultivation levels were not low, either, and they could frequently act on his behalf, saving him a great amount of trouble.

“You! Deserve! To! Die!” He glared at Ling Han, his eyes about to spit out flames in his rage.

“Die your sister!” Ling Han charged again, and as the lightning on his body flickered, his speed was shockingly fast.

Ximen Jun could only parry based on his instincts. Two short hammers appeared in his hands. They were black, and there was a round pattern on the hammers which exuded a terrifying aura, making the hammers appear to be very extraordinary.

Peng!

Still, though he had managed to block Ling Han’s sword, he was completely unable to disperse the terrible power behind this strike. His whole body was instantly sent flying by this blow. Peng, he crashed into the cave wall, and the impact caused a mist of blood to spurt out from all over his body.

One had to know that this cave wall had been refined by a Shattering Void Tier ultimate elite, so how could it not be hard?

Ximen Jun looked astonished. He was in the Spiritual Infant Tier, yet was actually unable to match a single strike from Ling Han; how could this be possible!

“There is nothing impossible. You are only the frog at the bottom of a well, so how could you possibly know what extent the truly strong elites in this world can reach!” Ling Han brandished his sword again. The disciples of the Wind Moon Sect were all shameless, vulgar people, and none of them was to be pitied for dying.

Pu, Ximen Jun’s head too flew upwards.
