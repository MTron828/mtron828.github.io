Chapter 1153: Let You Have the First Three Moves

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Junior Brother Han, do you dare battle me?” Zhang Long asked calmly.

He had indeed received a piece of high-grade Godly metal from Gan Shiyun, but this was not the reason that he was willing to move—he was willing to move because he enjoyed trampling over the pride of geniuses, and the more of a genius they were, the happier he was.

Ling Han stood up, and said, “Since you are asking to be defeated, I will naturally oblige!”

How boastful this guy was!

They hadn’t even battled yet, and he already thought that he would win. Wasn’t he afraid that he would be smacked in the face by reality if he went too far and was too confident in his words?

Zhang Long’s expression darkened, and said, “I entered the sect 900 years before you did, so you should respectfully address me as senior brother!”

“Who is the senior brother, and who is the junior brother? Shouldn’t it be decided by abilities?” Ling Han asked calmly. “If I advance into the Sun Moon Tier someday, Junior Brother Zhang would still have to address me as Milord.”

F***, his self-confidence was really full to burst!

Everyone shook their heads. Though Ling Han was indeed very strong, having defeated Gan Shiyun before even entering the sect, Gan Shiyun had only entered the sect for over a year, after all. Hence, her abilities would be limited.

Zhang Long, however, was completely different. He had already been in the sect for nine centuries, and had been taught many secret techniques of the sect. Though he had not formed his fifth Mountain River, he definitely had to have cultivated Mountain River Tier to perfection.

Below the fifth Mountain River, he should be invincible.

“Haha!” Zhang Long laughed coldly. “You are very arrogant, but I like opponents like you, for I can trample all over you. You would become cut and bruised all over, and be thoroughly discredited.”

“Could it be that you don’t worry that you might be the one who would be stomped into the ground, and be so ashamed that you would not be able to show your face?” Ling Han shook his head.

“This joke is not the slightest bit amusing.” Zhang Long humphed.

“I was not joking.” Ling Han strove to be contrary.

Zhang Long’s expression became colder and colder. With a wave of his hand, he declared, “Then come fight!”

“On the basis that you entered the sect earlier than I, I will let you have the first three moves.” Ling Han placed his arms behind his back.

“Arrogance!” Zhang Long was furious, and suddenly charged at Ling Han in attack.

Boom!

Though he had not formed his fifth Mountain River Tier, he had polished his cultivation in Mountain River Tier to the pinnacle. His Origin Power was incredibly dense, and as he attacked, it was as if the sky itself was pressing down, having the forceful and invincible bearing of Mountain River Tier.

Ling Han’s feet moved, and he calmly retreated, dodging his opponent’s attack by a hair’s breadth.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The three moves were delivered, and Ling Han had indeed dispersed all the attacks without even fighting back.

Gasp!

Everyone was stunned. This was slightly strong. Previously, Zhang Long’s abilities had already been analyzed. Aside from the six king tiers, who else could confidently say they could let Zhang Long have the first three moves here?

But Ling Han did not only say these words, he also did as he said.

This man’s abilities were... deep and unmeasurable!

Even Wu Zhe and He Tao looked slightly surprised. They had not thought that Ling Han would be so powerful.

“I have already let you have the first three moves, so I might as well handicap myself by using only one arm as well.” Ling Han continued to place his right arm behind his back, and merely waved his left arm.

‘This...!

‘Aren’t you looking down on your opponent too much? That was Zhang Long!’

Gan Shiyun was shocked, but also pleased internally at the same time. This time, Ling Han had really offended Zhang Long to the fullest. Now, even without her saying so, Zhang Long would definitely be more than pleased to get rid of Ling Han!

‘Good, very good!’

She did not believe that with Zhang Long’s abilities, he would still be unable to defeat Ling Han. If that was so, the seed-level genius he was and the 900 years of cultivation he had after entering the sect would have been a complete waste of time.

Zhang Long seethed in anger. He was truly angered now.

Letting his opponent have the first three moves, handicapping oneself by using just one arm... These should have been his lines! But now, he was treated in this manner by a junior; this caused him to feel greatly humiliated!

“Junior Brother, you’ve asked for this!” His eyes were sinister and cold. All of a sudden, a blood-red flash appeared. His skin instantly became blood-red, and his body suddenly swelled. Pa, pa. The fabric on his arms was immediately torn forcefully, revealing two furry clawed paws.

That was right. They were not arms, but rather tiger-like legs with claws! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

His two arms had currently turned into clawed tiger paws, and there were close to 70 divine patterns flickering on them, exuding a blood-red halo.

“Hiss, what kind of secret technique is this? Why do I feel like Zhang Long’s abilities had surpassed the level of the Mountain River Tier?” someone exclaimed in surprise. He was obviously a seed-level genius, yet had already turned pale from the aura that Zhang Long was exuding now.

“No, it hasn’t surpassed the Mountain River Tier. The reason why you feel this way is because your cultivation level is still a bit too low.”

“This is a strange technique that Senior Brother Zhang has cultivated. It is called Absolute Great Blood Tiger Technique. The moment he uses it, his power and speed would be increased greatly.”

“Senior Brother Zhang has already cultivated the Mountain River Tier to the peak stage in the first place, so his power could surpass six stars. And now, added with the Absolute Great Blood Tiger Technique, it is very possible his power could leap into seven stars.”

“That would be the power of the pinnacle level!”

Some senior brothers who had entered the sect earlier explained Zhang Long’s current condition.

He had not formed his fifth Mountain River Tier, yet he had broken through the pinnacle of the four minor levels of Mountain River Tier with other means.

However, secret techniques would still have a limited duration, unlike truly forming five Mountain Rivers, which would be a permanent increase in power. Furthermore, did forming five Mountain Rivers mean that he wouldn’t be able to cultivate a secret technique?

Zhang Long shouted fiercely, and brandished his clawed hand in an attack at Ling Han.

Xiu!

He was too fast. He seemed to have transformed into a bloody flash, so fast that the majority of the cultivators in the consummate level of Mountain River Tier could not even catch his movement.

Peng!

They saw Ling Han move. His right hand flicked, and delivered a flash of Sword Qi.

This strike was so fast it had reached the peak.

Hong, their attacks clashed, forming a brilliant explosion, and causing the majority of people to become blind even when they had their eyes open. They were completely unable to see how the battle had progressed.

However, the brightness soon vanished. They saw that Ling Han was still standing proudly in the center of the arena, his right arm levelled out. His forefinger and middle finger had joined together to form a ”sword”. There was a weak sword light flickering around it. Zhang Long, though, had collapsed at Ling Han’s feet, his face facing upwards. There was blood gushing out of his chest.

‘What?!’

Someone as strong as Zhang Long had been defeated with a single move?

Everyone watched with wide eyes; even their breathing had stagnated.

How could that be possible!? This was completely impossible!

Some of them even wanted to shout in astonishment as they held their heads. They felt that they must have seen it wrong, and understood things wrong. It must have been Zhang Long who had defeated Ling Han with a single move. However, when they closed and opened their eyes again, there was still not the slightest change in the scene.

Zhang Long was lying on the ground, completely unconscious.

Defeat—utter and complete defeat.

Ling Han sent Zhang Long back to the rock he had originally been on with a kick. The force he had used in this kick was ingenious. It just sent Zhang Long to lie face down on the rock, his behind facing upwards as his arms hung on either side. That image would definitely remain in everyone’s memories forever.

Gan Shiyun only felt coldness rise from deep within. Ling Han’s strength had completely exceeded her expectations. He had defeated even Zhang Long so easily. Could it be that he had formed his fifth Mountain River?

That was really a moat to the heavens. Even a super sect the likes of the Majestic Heaven Sect, which had gathered the most brilliant geniuses from over 100 planets, still merely had six king tiers at present.

This kind of genius would definitely be treated like a great treasure by the sect. How could she possibly have any hope for vengeance, then?

Ling Han looked coldly at her. The fact that Zhang Long chose to challenge him alone was obviously not unrelated to Gan Shiyun.

Gan Shiyun merely felt as if her soul itself trembled. She hurriedly lowered her gaze, not daring to meet Ling Han’s eyes.

“Hoho, I really did not imagine that Junior Brother Han would be so strong!” Wu Zhe praised, smiling as he clapped his hands, a strong glint of wariness in his eyes.

He did not dare to underestimate even Zhang Long, because it was highly possible that the latter would form the fifth Mountain River, and once again catch up to him. Then, wasn’t this man that had defeated Zhang Long even more frightening?

Ling Han broke into a smile, and asked, “Brother Wu, could you give me some guidance?”
