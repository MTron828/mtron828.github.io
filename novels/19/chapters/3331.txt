Chapter 3332: Outwit

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Old Man Cheng, the old b@stard who had drugged Ling Han.

In the previous two times, this old man gave Ling Han a powerful pressure of invincibility, but the third time they met, Ling Han finally discovered that this old man was only as strong as Fang Ziping.

In a head-on confrontation, Ling Han was definitely no match for him. Even if he used the flying sword, Ling Han still felt that his chances of winning were extremely slim.

However, since Old Man Cheng insisted on coming at this time, it was he that was taking the initiative to seek death.

There was no other reason. Ling Han had grasped the secret of the circular disc, and could channel an Inscription Tier-level formation. Even an Extreme Bone Tier wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

Of course, the prerequisite was that Old Man Cheng would step into the trap. Ling Han chuckled. He knew that there was definitely a colossal force behind Old Man Cheng, which could easily launch a beast tide to destroy a city.

However, he now had Chen Fengyan’s imperial sword?.

Even someone as powerful as the Demonic Rat was no match for him, so what was this force worth? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Moreover, this force had committed such a massacre, so Chen Fengyan would definitely fly into a thunderous rage when he found out.

“Thank you for the compliment,” Ling Han said calmly.

“Brat, it’s time for you to perform meritorious service,” Old Man Cheng said with a smile. “My lord is very interested in your alchemy ability, so he ordered me to bring you back. In the future, you’ll be responsible for concocting alchemical pills, and there will be no lack of benefits for you.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, then said, “I want the antidote for the Soul Departing Pill.”

“Gagaga, as long as you do your best for Master, I will naturally give you the antidote.” Old Man Cheng said.

Ling Han shook his head, “I want it now.”

Old Man Cheng couldn’t help but stare at Ling Han, revealing a baleful expression as he said, “Brat, do you think you’re qualified to put on airs in front of me just because you won first place in the hunting competition?” “You people are deranged. For the sake of obtaining the Blood Divine Crystal, you did not hesitate to use humans to feed Demonic Beasts. I have only killed an animal, yet you have set your eyes on me, and even forced me to take poison.” Ling Han said calmly, but his tone was extremely harsh.

“And now, you still want me to work for you?”

Old Man Cheng was first shocked, then bared his mouth in a strange grin, and said, “Brat, you are indeed very stubborn. No wonder you offended even Hong Tianbu! However, it is not up to you today. Since Master has spoken, I will bring you back no matter what.”

He moved aggressively. With his cultivation level of Fifth Extreme, he was sure that Ling Han wouldn’t even be able to withstand a single move from him. No one would be alerted at all.

Ling Han retreated. Peng! He had already broken through the window and exited. Shuttle Steps was activated, and he similarly possessed two times the speed of sound.

“En?” Old Man Cheng was startled. He had not thought that a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator could actually exert such high speed, but without the slightest hesitation, he immediately set off in pursuit of Ling Han. He was very certain, because Ling Han did not run towards the centre of the academy. Instead, he was charging towards the outside of the academy. If he went out further, there would be a dense forest, as well as a boundless mountain forest.

If a battle broke out there, no matter how big the commotion was, it would be very difficult to draw attention, what more when once he had the chance to make his move, he guaranteed that he would be able to take down Ling Han with a single move.

Xiu, his speed was extremely fast.

The two of them, one in front and one behind, soon entered into the dense forest.

“Brat, you won’t be able to escape. You had best follow me obediently!” Old Man Cheng said as he gave chase. “Master is someone who’s going to start a great business in the future, so you won’t feel aggrieved if you follow Master.” “Start your sister’s business. Are deranged people worthy of talking about conquering the world?” Ling Han said coldly.

Old Man Cheng found this strange. Where did Ling Han get his confidence from? He had clearly been poisoned by the Soul Departing Pill, so how did he dare to resist?

If there was no antidote, this brat would only be able to live for more than half a year. Why had he suddenly exploded?

However, this thought only flashed through his mind before disappearing. Since his lord said that he was to bring Ling Han back, he didn’t have to care about anything else. He just had to bring Ling Han back.

“Brat, you won’t be able to escape!” the old geezer said coldly. He was slightly irritated. He hadn’t been able to capture a mere Blood Transformation Tier even after such a long time; this was embarrassing.

“Old b@stard!” Ling Han waved his hand, and xiu, the flying sword shot out. “Petty tricks!” Old Man Cheng casually swatted with his hand, instantly sending the flying sword flying.

Ling Han threw another sword. This time, he used Sword Dao, and under its frenzied activation, the flying sword suddenly soared to more than four times the speed of sound. Like a streak of light, it shot towards Old Man Cheng. Old Man Cheng saw Ling Han take out a second small sword, and was naturally filled with disdain. ‘You already failed the first time, so it is naturally even more impossible for you to succeed the second time.’

Precisely because he had seen what move Ling Han had used, he had naturally underestimated him. However, after Ling Han’s sword strike flew out, he finally knew that he had been overwhelmingly wrong.

Most importantly, he was also chasing Ling Han at twice the speed of sound. What kind of concept was that?

It was equivalent to the flying sword flying at six times the speed of sound while he was in a state of stillness.

He was shocked, and hurriedly covered his face with his hands. Then, he tilted his head, dodging with all his might.

Pu, the flying sword pierced through his fingers and stabbed into his face, instantly causing blood to flow.

Old Man Cheng was both furious and shocked. Though he had dodged and protected his vital points, this sword still pierced into his cheek, like a fish that had its cheek pierced by a straw rope.

A Blood Transformation Tier cultivator was actually able to accelerate a flying sword to such a speed?

He was internally stunned. This was the first time that he felt wariness towards a Blood Transformation Tier, but more than that, he was furious. This was a great humiliation.

However, in the next instant, his expression changed drastically.

A terrifying chill assaulted, and an ice arrow shot over from one side at an indescribable speed. It was practically the attack of an Inscription Tier.

However, where did this Inscription Tier martial artist come from?

He wanted to dodge, but in this state, how was he supposed to dodge or parry? He forcefully threw a punch, which landed on the ice arrow and shattered it with a pa – this also showed how strong he was. Otherwise, he would not have been able to hit it at all. However, the might of the ice arrow was not power in the first place, but rather the bone-piercing coldness.

Visibly, Old Man Cheng’s hand immediately froze over, and it was still spreading towards his arm.

This wasn’t the most fatal thing, because there was a second arrow, a third… even more arrows of ice shot towards the old geezer.

Old Man Cheng was completely unable to dodge. With his right hand frozen, it seriously affected the flow of his blood, and he couldn’t release any power at all.

This was an attack on the level of a martial artist in Inscription Tier.

Pu, pu, pu! He was continuously hit by the arrows, and multiple patches of ice appeared on his body.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief, a hint of satisfaction on his face.

Shooting the first flying sword was naturally a deliberate misdirection, and the second flying sword was similarly a deception. The real killing move was when Old Man Cheng used his arms to protect himself, and Ling Han took the chance to throw out the circular plate, so Old Man Cheng didn’t discover it at all.

Thus, after Old Man Cheng dispelled the attack of the flying sword, he naturally stepped into the formation.

What a perfect plan!

Ling Han opened his mouth, and said, “Tell me who your Master is!”
