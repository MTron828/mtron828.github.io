Chapter 2481: First Battle Against Third Heaven Celestial King

Ling Han and the others set off for the center of the ruins.

Each time they came across a camp, they would ask whether it belonged to the Dark Frost Celestial King. If it did, they would directly conquer it. If it didn’t, they would act according to the people’s attitude. If they were friendly, they would simply borrow some rooms to rest. If they were hostile, they would directly take over the camp.

Half a month passed, and the Dark Frost Celestial King lost another five camps.

Right now, only a measly four camps remained under his control.

This caused his expression to become dark and furious. After tasking his three remaining Second Heaven Celestial Kings with defending the main base, he snuck away to search for Ling Han and the others.

He was extremely quick, and it only took him seven days to reach his third camp. He stayed there, silently waiting for Ling Han and the others to arrive. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go to the fourth camp, but rather that it had already fallen.

At this time, the Dark Frost Celestial King naturally understood what Ling Han meant by returning the favor. This enraged him to no end.

However, with so many of his camps being defeated, it was quite surprising that not a single wisp of his separated divine sense had returned to inform him of what had happened. This confused him greatly.

However, he didn’t pay much heed to this, either. As long as Ling Han and the others dared to attack this camp, he would teach these outsiders a lesson. He would teach them that it was “seniors” like him who controlled the Celestial Path.

Elsewhere, Ling Han and the others were extremely relaxed as they wandered around. Right now, all of the structures that they had taken control of were vertically aligned. Even though they had already exceeded the maximum of nine, such structures could still bring them great benefits.

If they obtained enlightenment, they would stop to comprehend it and also rest for a few days. They were in no hurry to reach the center of the ruins. After all, there were still several hundred years left.

Several days passed, and they set off once again.

The suppression of the purple light brought great discomfort to all of them. Moreover, the more time that passed, the more powerful the suppression of the purple light became. Thus, they started to hasten their speed. In just two days, they saw a building appear before them. This building was five stories tall, and it radiated with a ceramic glaze that prevented the purple light from infiltrating it.

Ling Han walked over with a smile, and asked, “Can I ask you a question? Is this the territory of the Dark Frost Celestial King?”

“Impudence! You actually dare to utter the lord’s name?” the guards immediately chided.

Ling Han nodded before turning around, and saying, “Alright, this is also Dark Frost’s territory.”

“Lord Cheng!”

“Lord Fu!”

The eyes of the guards involuntarily widened when they saw Fu Yuan and Cheng Tao. What in the world was going on? Why were the two Celestial Kings trailing behind like subordinates? Moreover, they were at the very end, signifying that they had no standing at all!

Cheng Tao and Fu Yuan both wore awkward expressions. Even though they had belonged to the Dark Frost Celestial King’s force before, they had both enjoyed a transcendent status. They hadn’t been subordinates of the Dark Frost Celestial King. Now, however, their situation was completely different. They genuinely felt ashamed to face others.

A Celestial King walked over, and asked, “Friend Cheng, Friend Fu, what’s the meaning of this?”

There was a single ribbon of iridescent light around him. His name was Xun Dong, and he was the guarding Celestial King of this building.

Cheng Tao and Fu Yuan both ignored him as if they hadn’t heard his question. Firstly, there was indeed no need for them to explain. Secondly, Ling Han was their master, so they didn’t dare to supersede his command, either.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “This territory is mine now. Are you going to leave by yourself, or do you want me to send you away?”

“How audacious!” someone said in a cold voice. It was as if this voice had traveled over from the depths of the world.

“Dark Frost Celestial King!” Cheng Tao and Fu Yuan exclaimed in unison. Even though they were mentally prepared to meet him sooner or later, they hadn’t expected to come across him so soon.

A Celestial King appeared at the entrance, with three ribbons of iridescent light hovering around his body. Boundless bursts of ice-cold aura also gathered around him, appearing as terrifying as could be.

He was none other than the Dark Frost Celestial King.

Ling Han roared with laughter, and said, “After obliterating so many wisps of your divine sense, I’m finally able to meet you in person! It was truly difficult to find you!”

“Young man, you think I won’t dare to kill you just because you have a powerful background in the outside world?” the Dark Frost Celestial King asked in a cold voice. He was one of the most powerful beings on the Celestial Path, so he never needed to consider the consequences when he did something. Moreover, if he obtained the huge opportunity this time, he would no longer need to worry about Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, Heavenly Venerates, or whatnot.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “If I truly bring a Heavenly Venerate over, and you still dare to speak like this, I’ll truly respect your bravery. In any case, enough with the nonsense. Since you’re finally here, I’ll give you two options to choose from. The first option is to become my subordinate, and the second option is death. Alright, you can choose one now.”

“Hahaha!” The Dark Frost Celestial King tilted his head back and roared with laughter. Where was this brat getting his confidence from?

“I’ll go!” Huo Furong said as she charged over. She immediately swallowed a Subduing Purple Fruit. They had obtained several of these fruits on their way here, so each person had no fewer than five opportunities to unleash explosive power.

She wasn’t underestimating her opponent, and she directly retrieved her Celestial Tool as well. An ancient mirror hovered above her head, pulsating with the power of Regulations.

“Fire!” she roared. The origin flames of heaven and earth burst forth, transforming her entire body into one of flames. These were devastating flames that could even incinerate Regulations themselves.

The Dark Frost Celestial King was astonished upon seeing this. This young girl was clearly just a First Heaven Celestial King, so why was her power making him feel a sense of apprehension? Her battle prowess was indeed inferior to his. However, after taking into account her Celestial Tool, she was definitely strong enough to threaten him.

Was she truly a First Heaven Celestial King?

Huo Furong charged over, and the Dark Frost Celestial King had no option but to meet her attacks. He summoned the Great Dao of Water, creating a streak of black water wherein each drop was as heavy as a planet. These were incredibly deadly droplets.

Peng!

The two Celestial Kings exchanged a blow. Sure enough, Huo Furong’s battle prowess left her at a disadvantage. However, thanks to her Celestial Tool, she was easily able to rival her opponent. Ancient symbols continued to appear in the ancient mirror, emitting a mysterious chant that was seemingly divulging the most primordial secrets of heaven and earth.

The ancient mirror glowed with a destructive radiance that even the Dark Frost Celestial King didn’t dare to face head-on. He had to block its attacks with his full strength, or else he would also suffer severe injuries.

The Dark Frost Celestial King was completely unable to suppress his opponent. His defenses were breached by Huo Furong, and the two of them continued their vicious battle on the building.

Boom, boom, boom!

Just the shock waves of their attacks alone were powerful enough to frighten Second Heaven Celestial Kings.

Ling Han and the others were in no hurry to interfere. They easily shooed the others away before finding the control core of the building. Ling Han marked it with a wisp of his divine sense, and this allowed him to connect all of their conquered camps. If someone else completed this step, this building would be treated as part of another force.

This was a fairly comical scene. The battle had yet to conclude, yet the building had already changed owners.

The Dark Frost Celestial King was both astonished and enraged. With a roar, he turned around to flee.

He was giving up?

Of course he was giving up! Even his camp had been conquered by his enemies, and Huo Furong’s battle prowess was also immensely powerful. He wasn’t confident that he could suppress her. Moreover, there were so many people on Ling Han’s side, so what would he do if there were a few more powerful Celestial Kings?

Thus, he decided to retreat. He would return after he found a few helpers.

Ling Han didn’t pursue him. He could escape from this camp, but could he escape from this realm? In any case, the Dark Frost Celestial King definitely wouldn’t abandon his final camp. At that time, they would head over there to find him.

They rested for a brief while to dispel the effects of the purple light. Afterward, they would continue to advance, intent on settling their differences with the Dark Frost Celestial King in a single breath.

Two days later, they absorbed some peculiar light and peculiar fragrance again, not only improving their cultivation significantly, but even dispelling the negative effects of the purple light.

Thereupon, they set off again.
