Chapter 1493 Toxic Heart of a Woman

The battle between Gu Daoyi and Empress Luan Xing continued for another day. Eventually, after some discussions between a few elites, they decided to terminate this battle.

Otherwise, at the rate that they were going, Gu Daoyi and Empress Luan Xing could have easily fought for another few hundred or few thousand years.

They awarded victory to Gu Daoyi!

He hadn’t genuinely won, but he had indeed enjoyed an advantage for the large majority of the battle. Since the battle had been terminated, it was only natural that victory was awarded to the party who had enjoyed the advantage.

The empress was extremely dissatisfied with this decision, and she wore a haughty expression as she peered down at the elites. They had actually dared to award her with a loss?

“This isn’t fair!”

“We can’t accept this decision!”

“We urge you to award victory to the empress!”

The spectators were up in arms about this decision, and they were overwhelmingly in support of awarding the victory of the battle to Empress Luan Xing.

Her charm was truly incredible.

Gu Daoyi instantly became the enemy of the spectators, and even his most loyal supporters started to hesitate in their support for him. Should they also raise their arms and shout in support for Empress Luan Xing?

“The finals will be held tomorrow morning,” the teachers of the nine campuses announced in unison. “Ling Han versus Gu Daoyi!”

At this moment, the spectators all thought to themselves, ‘As expected.’

When entering the academy, Gu Daoyi had been recruited first, with his Divine Fetus peerless and receiving praise from the nine Saints. He definitely deserved to be recruited first. Meanwhile, Ling Han had been recruited second. However, in reality, it was slightly unfair that he had been recruited second. After all, cultivators generally decided their rankings based on strength.

Right now, both of them had made it to the finals.

If Gu Daoyi won, he would be the undoubted number one. Such a result would also prove the strong vision of the nine Saints and justify their belief that a Divine Fetus was more powerful. However, if Ling Han won, he would wash away the frustration that he had felt due to being recruited after Gu Daoyi.

‘I’m the true number one!’

There was a good show to come, and the spectators were all on the edge of their seats. ‘Why wait until tomorrow? Hold the final today!’

However, the spectators could only yearn for this in their minds. The battle would be held whenever it was supposed to be held. This wouldn’t change even if they urged otherwise.

Ling Han returned to his residence with the empress. She was extremely aloof and haughty, and it was clear that she was still angry about the result from before.

“Let it be. I’m definitely going to suppress Gu Daoyi anyway. I’ll help vent your anger tomorrow!” Ling Han said in consolation.

However, the empress still wasn’t willing to soothe her frown. “I should’ve defeated him today. Then when we battle tomorrow, I could’ve leaped into your embrace and admitted defeat. That should’ve been the only reasonable outcome!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly, and say, “Wife, I’ll be spoiled silly by you.”

The empress smiled upon hearing this, and she leaned into Ling Han’s embrace, her body soft and gentle like water.

Ling Han wrapped his arm around her waists, and said, “We need to hurry up and dispose of Gu Daoyi. Once you absorb the power of his Divine Fetus, your physique will definitely break through to a new level. At that time, you’ll become much closer to reaching the Genesis Tier.”

Ling Han naturally wanted the empress to reach the Genesis Tier as soon as possible so that he could push her over and make love with her.

If it were the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, she would have definitely jumped over to beat him up upon hearing this. However, the empress replied with a gentle smile as she pecked him on the lips, and said, “Definitely!” Her eyes were squinted in an enchanting smile.

‘My empress is so good,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

He chuckled and was just about to say something. However, he was cut off by the sound of someone knocking on the door.

Peng, peng, peng!

He went over to open the door, only to find Wei Zhen, the teacher who had been responsible for leading them to the Ancient Academy.

“Ling Han, follow me,” Wei Zhen said expressionlessly.

Ling Han had initially thought that he was here to discuss the finals to be held tomorrow. After all, he was a representative of the eighth campus. If he could win first place, the entire eighth campus would also be able to bathe in his glory.

He followed Wei Zhen and quickly arrived at his courtyard. Upon entering the main hall, he discovered that there were already two people waiting inside. One was a woman who was sitting on the master’s chair. Beside her, there was a young child who was sitting on the floor and playing with dirt.

They were the wife and son of the Great Saint.

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily darkened. It was evident that Wei Zhen hadn’t called him over to discuss tomorrow’s finals. Rather, he had been ordered to get him at the command of the Great Saint’s wife.

‘What does this woman want?’

“Do you still dare to be stubborn now?” the wife of the Great Saint asked haughtily. Her name was Zhu Xiu’er.

Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “What? Are you going to accuse me of a crime?”

“Insolence!” Wei Zhen roared. His glare was as piercing as a sword, and he continued, “Do you have the right to question the Saint’s wife?”

To say nothing of Ling Han, even the nine Saints would have to treat Zhu Xiu’er with respect if they were present. Was her identity as the wife of a Great Saint not powerful enough?

Her status was the second-highest among everyone in the hundreds of nearby galaxies!

“I haven’t done anything wrong, so why can’t I question her?” Ling Han said calmly. “I also want to ask, why have Teacher Wei and Madam have called me over so late at night? If it’s nothing important, I’ll take my leave now. After all, I still need to compete in the finals tomorrow.”

“Haha!” Zhu Xiu’er sneered coldly before saying, “Take your leave? In your dreams! You’ll be stuck here both today and tomorrow! Whenever you understand, you’ll naturally know what to do in order to leave.”

This was simple. All he had to do was lower his head and respectfully kowtow to this woman. All he needed to sacrifice was his dignity.

However, this was something that Ling Han definitely couldn’t accept.

“I desire to leave. Are you two going to stop me?” Ling Han said calmly.

“Are you able to leave?” Zhu Xiu’er said with a cold chuckle. Wei Zhen was an elite at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. If he failed to even stop an elite at the low extreme from leaving, then he might as well bang his head on a wall until he died.

Wei Zhen remained expressionless.

From his point of view, he actually wanted to witness Ling Han defeat Gu Daoyi and win glory for the eighth campus. However, who could have envisioned Zhu Xiu’er summoning him over? She was determined to make him submit. To say nothing of him, even the Tranquil Heart Saint would have no option but to yield to her request. He would think of some way to compensate Ling Han in the future.

Anyhow, she was their master’s wife, so which of the nine Saints would dare to disrespect her?

If he wanted to blame someone, he could only blame Ling Han for being too proud. During his first day at the academy, he had refused to crawl through the dog flap. Because of this, he had become the common enemy of all of the senior disciples of the eighth campus. Now, he was again unwilling to bow his head to the wife of the Great Saint. As a result, even his right to compete in the finals of the competition was stripped from him.

‘Is it that difficult for you to bow your head? The path of cultivation is long, and as long as you haven’t reached the peak yet, you’ll definitely have no option but to lower your head to those more powerful than you.

‘For what reason are you resisting? For what reason are you bringing trouble onto yourself?’

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Fine. Since you two insist on having me stay over for tea, I’ll respect your request.”

‘F*ck! Who’s inviting you over for tea?!’

Zhu Xiu’er sneered upon hearing this. ‘Act calm and composed all you want. When tomorrow comes and we draw closer and closer to the final battle, let’s see if you can still remain so unfazed and calm.’

She was extremely eager to see Ling Han’s expression at that time.

Was there any deep hostility between her and Ling Han? No, there wasn’t. However, who told Ling Han to challenge her authority? She was the wife of the Great Saint, and she was the motherly model of the world. Thus, it was only natural that everyone had to respect her.

However, Ling Han simply plonked down on a chair and started to meditate. He appeared as calm as could be.

‘Keep pretending!’

Zhu Xiu’er saw his actions, yet she didn’t scold him for sitting without being invited to. She could sometimes be incredibly patient.

It wasn’t long before the little boy became tired. He lay down on the floor and fell asleep just like that.

He was at the Shattering Void Tier, so he naturally didn’t need to worry about becoming sick due to the coldness of the floor.

Time slowly ticked by. Eventually, a sliver of white appeared on the horizon in the distance. Before long, the sun rose into the sky, its radiance warm and dazzling.

It was morning, and the final battle was scheduled to begin in another hour or so. Moreover, the competitors were only allowed to be late by one hour at most. Once this time limit expired, they would be automatically disqualified.

Zhu Xiu’er was slightly excited. To a prodigy, losing a battle wasn’t the most humiliating thing. Instead, it would be far more humiliating if they didn’t even dare to participate in the battle. This would be a humiliation that they could never wash away.

When people mentioned Ling Han in the future, it would be inevitable that they mentioned his cowardly act of today. They would view him as a coward and a weakling.

This would be the most damaging aspect. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

What a toxic heart this woman possessed!
