Chapter 2067: Counterattack of the Four Monarch Tiers

After returning to the Azure Dragon Town, Ling Han asked the villagers some questions again. Only then did he realize that he had been slightly misled.

One could indeed find Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes in that canyon. Moreover, that canyon was also the best place to search for Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes. However, this was entirely time-dependent.

During an entire year, there would only be three or so days when the canyon would become calm, without a single gust of wind. At that time, it would be extremely easy to enter and search for Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes. After this time, however, the canyon would become chaotic with violent wind. In fact, even Immortal Palace Tier elites would cry in pain if they were struck by the flying rocks.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. This place was isolated from the outside world, yet even so, the people were still unable to maintain their innocence. They were also cunning, and they would also play tricks on others.

Anyhow, the three calm days definitely weren’t now. Instead, it had been during the time that they had been fighting. Thus, there was simply no way that they could obtain any Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes.

Meanwhile, news of Ling Han and Ji Wuming’s battle against the four monarch tiers also started to spread. In the beginning, no one believed this news. Wasn’t this a joke? Just what kind of beings were the four monarch tiers? Any single one of them could easily crush all of the other outsiders.

However, when it was revealed that Ling Han and Ji Wuming had walked across the Most Venerable Divine Path, many people instantly believed this news.

That was the Most Venerable Divine Path! This was a path that had never been traversed before. In fact, even that paramount prodigy in the past—the one who had become an Eighth Heaven Celestial King—had only managed to ascend a golden dragon bridge. Thus, what kind of concept was ascending the Most Venerable Divine Path? Were they destined to become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? Or were they destined to become rulers among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings?

However, the powerful image of the four monarch tiers was already deeply ingrained in everyone’s mind. Thus, there were still many people who refused to believe this news. They were adamant that this was a rumor used to slander and shake the leadership of the four powerful monarch tiers.

Ling Han had no intention of becoming a leader and whatnot, so he naturally couldn’t be bothered explaining himself. He left the others to argue among themselves.

Three days passed, and the four monarch tier finally made a decision. They chose to ally with some tribe. After another day, Ling Han suddenly realized that he and the Empress surprisingly hadn’t signed a contract with any of the tribes yet.

If they didn’t sign a contract, they couldn’t represent a tribe in battle.

‘What’s going on?’

He went over to ask, only to learn that he, the Empress, and Ji Wuming had all been kicked out from the alliance.

‘Heh.’

Ling Han immediately chuckled. Perhaps Tian Qingyue and the others wanted to target him and Ji Wuming in the following battle between tribes?

By expelling them from the alliance, even if Ling Han and the others found another tribe to ally with, they would still be at a numerical disadvantage at that time. Moreover, this would be a severe numerical disadvantage.

They would be outnumbered at least 100 to one.

That being the case, even if Ling Han and Ji Wuming teamed up, could they hope to achieve victory?

Ling Han shook his head. Who had come up with this plan? Did they really think it would work? If he and Ji Wuming both chose to join the same tribes as Tian Qingyue and the others, wouldn’t his plan have come undone?

Ling Han pondered this for a moment. Even though he was aware of these people’s plans, he still wouldn’t choose to join the same tribes as them.

This was for his pride, if not for nothing else!

‘Do you think I’m afraid of you?’

Ling Han knew that it was unhelpful to act rashly at this moment. However, he couldn’t suppress his pride no matter what.

Moreover, he recalled the words of the “elder” that Du Shaojun had mentioned before. Joining the powerful side didn’t necessarily guarantee victory.

By the looks of things right now, the side with the four monarch tiers definitely possessed an advantage. No matter how one looked at it, Ling Han and the others were on the slightly weaker side. Even with Ji Wuming, they were still at a disadvantage.

Was there still any doubt about the result?

“Ling Han, we’re going to crush these peoples’ a*s!” Hu Niu said in anger. She shook her dainty fists as she spoke. She was eager to pummel these people, especially since Ling Han always prevented her from crushing other peoples’ a*ses. She was feeling extremely rebellious at this moment.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. He felt overwhelming regret for having destroyed someone’s a*s before Hu Niu before. Now, Hu Niu was always itching to replicate his feat.

“Alright, do what you want. However, you definitely have to use a staff,” Ling Han said in a stern voice.

“Alright!” Hu Niu answered in excitement. She clapped her hands in glee.

The Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou involuntarily shed cold sweat. Could this be regarded as a warning? One of them was unreliable, and the other was even more unreliable!

They went to look for the elder of Azure Dragon Town. Regardless of whether they had a representative or not, they definitely had to sign the contract in person. This couldn’t be done by a representative.

When the four of them arrived at the Divine Temple, they saw Tian Qingyue and the other monarch tiers standing before the gates, wearing expressions of scorn and ridicule.

“Ling Han, we’ve all chosen to join the Primordial Iron Tribe,” Tian Qingyue suddenly said.

‘What’s the meaning of this?’

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. By telling them which tribe they had joined, they were trying to rile up Ling Han and the others.

Even if Ling Han and the others wanted to join the same tribe, would they have the face to?

In any case, there were hundreds of outsiders here, so it was naturally impossible to hide this news. Since that was the case, they decided to proudly reveal this to Ling Han.

After learning of this, would he still have the face to join the same tribe? Could he stand to lose this face?

“Ugly b*tch, what are you being so arrogant for?” Hu Niu glared at her, and said, “Just you wait! In a moment, Niu will pummel all of you!”

Tian Qingyue and the others wore expressions of disdain. They were already aware that Hu Niu and the Empress had also triggered the golden dragon bridges, meaning that their cultivation talent was on the same level. However, they possessed a crushing advantage of three minor levels, so which of them couldn’t suppress Hu Niu and the Empress with ease? As such, did they need to pay any attention to them?

However, the expressions of disdain immediately vanished from their faces. This wasn’t because Hu Niu was baring her teeth at them. Instead, it was because a young man in white had walked over.

Ji Wuming!

This was a paramount prodigy that no one could ignore. In terms of offensive prowess alone, he was peerless in the world.

“Ling Han, are you interested in teaming up with me and slaying these weaklings again?” Ji Wuming said with a smile. His teeth were sparkling white, and they were indescribably attractive.

“Alright!” Ling Han replied with a smile. He also wanted to pummel the four monarch tiers.

Ji Wuming nodded in acknowledgment. He then gazed at the four monarch tiers, and his expression was as if he were looking at lambs ready for slaughter. The disdain on his face couldn’t be hidden.

One had to realize that Ji Wuming wasn’t in his peak state right now. His divided soul hadn’t entered this place, so he could only unleash 50 percent of his battle prowess.

“Then we’ll eliminate you two when the battle begins!” Xia Houtong said in a calm voice. He was brimming with confidence. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Make sure to clean your a*s! Niu is going to obliterate all of your a*ses!” Hu Niu also said in a threatening voice.

Tian Qingyue and the others almost tripped and fell upon hearing this.

A mighty monarch tier was actually uttering such words? This was far too crude and uncouth! Moreover, she was also a breathtakingly beautiful woman. It was simply impossible to imagine such words coming from her mouth.

“You wait and see!” The four monarch tiers didn’t argue with them any longer. Against someone like Hu Niu, who dared to say anything, their battle prowess was truly insufficient.

Ling Han smiled before entering the Divine Dragon Temple with the three women.

Because most people had already chosen a tribe to ally with, the seven large tribes were indifferent toward Ling Han and the others. After all, they couldn’t change much regardless of which tribe they joined.

“Then we’ll choose the Bronze Tribe,” Ling Han said.
