Chapter 1287 Aggressive Approach

“Captain, dare I ask, what command did I disobey?” Ling Han asked with a smile. He seemed extremely relaxed and unworried.

Xie Donglai was lost for words. Before so many people, did he have the face to say that he had commanded Ling Han to collect firewood? If he said this, he would be making a fool of himself! Commanding a Sun Moon Tier elite to collect firewood... What an utter joke!

He could pick on Ling Han in private, but he wouldn’t be able to do so in public. One didn’t need to be a genius, and even those of average intelligence would be able to tell that he was purposefully picking on Ling Han.

There were unspoken rules behind Xie Dongai’s actions. He was the superior, and Ling Han was his subordinate. Thus, Ling Han would need to act exactly as he commanded. Otherwise, he would continue to pick on him until he submitted.

However, once Ling Han yielded, he would only be pushed further and further, until there was no path of retreat.

Thus, when dealing with petty superiors like Xie Donglai, one would only have two options—either submit completely or resist until the end.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t submit. He had chosen to resist head-on.

Xie Donglai’s expression became dark. He was being challenged by a subordinate in public, and this made him feel extremely, extremely unhappy.

“Ling Han, you’re disrespecting your superior!” he shouted sharply.

“Oh? I’m disrespecting my superior by asking a simple question? How domineering of you!” Ling Han laughed, and said, “The army of the Netherworld is only 50 kilometers away. Captain, why don’t you bring your domineering aura over there and scare them all away?”

‘F*ck! To say nothing of me, even Xie Qian won’t be able to force the Netherworld army to retreat!’

Discomfort gripped at Xie Donglai’s mind as he glowered at Ling Han. He enjoyed a higher cultivation level, a stronger battle prowess, and also a more influential background. In fact, he was even Ling Han’s superior at this moment. So, why was he still unable to deal with him?

With a menacing edge to his voice, he said, “Since you’re my subordinate, let me teach you some moves, lest you be killed once you enter the battlefield!”

“Captain, how caring and considerate of you!” Ling Han said mockingly.

“Stop being a smart aleck! As a superior, it’s my responsibility to guide my subordinates in cultivation!” Xie Donglai felt like he had finally managed to grab onto a tangible point. Since he was more powerful, it was only natural that he should use his power to suppress Ling Han.

“If you don’t want to accept my guidance, fine! But you’ll have to chop 10,000 piculs of firewood... within a day!” He was afraid that Ling Han would obey on the surface but resist in private again. Thus, he added a time limit to the task.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “Why does Young Master Xie need so much firewood? Do you want to hold a barbeque? If that’s the case, you should’ve brought a few more servants from your home. This is the army, so why are you still acting like some mighty young master? What an absolute joke.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Why, you little troublemaker, you actually dare to challenge your superior’s might? Come, show me if you’ve got the right to challenge me!” Xie Donglai immediately launched an attack at Ling Han.

Weng!

He extended a hand and flipped it over, and then pushed it down toward Ling Han.

A formidable pressure instantly enveloped Ling Han, crashing down on him and trying to make him kneel.

There was a difference of two minor levels between them, and thus the disparity between their power was genuinely huge.

Ling Han remained proudly standing. Under the crushing pressure of Xie Donglai’s power, streaks of divine patterns started to appear on his now glowing body. If one looked carefully, they would see that these divine patterns were actually nine divine dragons, each with a unique appearance.

Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art!

As the legends said, the nine sons of the dragon were all different. Right now, these nine divine dragons still had yet to become True Dragons. Some were missing horns, while others were missing claws. However, these divine dragons would gradually become more perfect following Ling Han’s improvement in the Body Art.

When these nine divine dragons became True Dragons, it would signify that Ling Han had reached the pinnacle level of the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art and advanced to the level of a Saint.

“What?! It’s actually nine different True Dragons?”

“Cultivation techniques that have to do with True Dragons are all incredibly powerful!”

“No wonder he dares to challenge Xie Donglai. He’s legitimately got some skill.”

“However, the difference between their cultivation levels is too great. He’s destined to be suppressed.”

“Say, this Xie Donglai person is so petty. He’s still trying to avenge his private resentments at this kind of time.”

The onlookers chattered among themselves, some of them expressing their sympathy toward Ling Han and others showing their disdain toward Xie Donglai’s pettiness. However, not a single one of them stepped forward to stop the conflict.

They were all mercenaries, and none of them had any strong friendship with each other. So, why would they risk offending Xie Donglai to help Ling Han? Instead of helping, many were instead excited to see how this conflict would pan out.

The nine dragons unleashed their might, inhaling and exhaling clouds and mists as they did. Ling Han stood as tall and as proud as a mountain.

The Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art wasn’t the only thing that he practiced, with his Godly bones also nearly as tough as Level Eight Godly metal. Right now, someone at the consummate level wanted to suppress him? How laughable!

“Xie Donglai, how much longer do you want to flip your hands? What on earth are you playing at? Perhaps you really do want to hold a barbeque?” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“F*cking brat!” Xie Donglai whispered under his breath. He, an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, was actually unable to contain a measly cultivator at the medium extreme! Moreover, this was in front of so many onlookers. How much face would he lose?

He knew that Ling Han was peculiar, him being able to kill Zhu Liyun and all. However, he had been helped by Faceless at that time, and he had also relied on the might of the Misty Soul Capturing Flower. Thus, Xie Donglai thought very little of Ling Han’s actual battle prowess.

Moreover, he was a four-star genius himself, so it wouldn’t matter little even if Ling Han were also a four-star genius. This would cancel out, and he would still enjoy a crushing advantage of two minor levels.

Thus, he had thought that he would be able to suppress Ling Han with a mere flip of his hands. Not only would that have been a slap to Ling Han’s face and a good way to exact his revenge, but it would have also been a good way to send a warning to the other mercenaries. It would make them think twice about disobeying him, their superior.

To his surprise, Ling Han was actually a difficult opponent to suppress. Right now, it was he who was between a rock and a hard place.

Boos rang out in the surroundings.

“Shut up!” Xie Donglai roared. He charged toward Ling Han, his hands transforming into claws that swiped at him.

Boom!

He had clearly activated a secret technique, with his hands transforming into pitch-black demonic claws that were as large as a house. These claws had a cold sheen to them, and it was as if they were made of metal.

“Gasp! Could this be the Black Gold Demonic Eagle Claw?”

“According to legends, Black Gold Demonic Eagles are terrifying beasts that can tear through Godly metal that corresponds to their level with a single swipe of their claws.”

“If this strike lands, that person is done for!”

With so many people present, there were naturally some who could identify this attack. These people immediately identified the secret technique that Xie Donglai had unleashed.

Boom!

The two claws smashed down, and it was as if even space was about to shatter apart. Patches of uncanny black swirls appeared in the surroundings.

Ling Han didn’t plan to face this attack head-on, so he immediately jumped to the side and dashed into the crowd of onlookers.

Xie Donglai wielded his demonic claws as he chased after Ling Han.

Peng!

There was a resounding boom, and several people were instantly sent flying. They spat blood as they collapsed to the ground, and many of them started to curse in fury. Chaos descended upon the crowd.

“There’s no animosity between you and the others, yet you actually attacked them with such viciousness! Xie Donglai, might you be a spy of the Netherworld?” Ling Han was completely unscathed. There were so many people to ease the pressure off him, so he could easily deal with the shock waves of Xie Donglai’s attacks.

Xie Donglai was about to explode in anger. ‘F*ck, you actually dare to slander me?’

However, he was too angry to speak, so he continued to wield his demonic claws as he chased after Ling Han.

“A Netherworld spy is killing people!” Ling Han shouted at the top of his lungs as he ran toward the crowds of people.

Peng, peng, peng!

The crowds of people were unable to dodge in time, and many were sent flying by Xie Donglai’s wanton attacks.

Right now, everyone could clearly “see” that Xie Donglai was attacking the Immortal Realm encampment like a crazed maniac.
