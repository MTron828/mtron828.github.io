Chapter 1701: Public s*x

The three-headed dragon was naturally defiant, and even planned to resist Ling Han. But Ling Han merely released his aura slightly, and this Divine Beast was instantly terrified out of its wits. It obediently became their mount.

There was not one path that led to the castle, but rather five. When Ling Han steered the carriage and arrived, he saw that there were already a great many carriages parked there. They were in various shapes and sizes, and there were very many of them.

A considerable number of people had not entered into the castle yet, but were rather standing here, as if they were waiting for others.

“Brother Tong Lin is here!” When they saw the chariot approach, three men immediately came over. They were Tong Lin’s best friends, and could also be called his gang. Because their clans’ power was not as strong as the Tong Clan’s, Tong Lin was also their leader.

When they saw that it was Ling Han steering the carriage, they couldn’t help but feel curious.

When did the dragon chariot need a coachman?

The three-headed dragon had long since gained intelligence, so did it still need someone to steer it? Furthermore, this coachman was actually just a Great Saint. His cultivation level was a little too low, wasn’t it? No matter what, it should have been a Saint King at least.

And under their eyes, Ling Han opened the carriage door, inviting his wife to alight.

Since the Empress was already in the limelight, he decided to simply become the background. Today, he was here to set off his wife.

The Empress walked out. Her figure was tall and slender, so her head could almost touch the top of the carriage door. She wore a golden skirt woven from the highest grade of Saintly Material—the ingredients had come from the mountain bandits’ lair, and it was naturally Ling Han who had hurriedly created it in the last few days.

Her bearing was unmatched in the first place, and added with being set off by this Saint-grade treasured robe, she immediately became the center of attention of the whole area. The veil on her face also added some mystery to her persona, filling others with unending desire to catch a glimpse of her true face.

“Gasp!”

“Brother Tong Lin really has good luck with women to actually get hold of such an exquisite beauty!”

“You haven’t seen her face yet, so how do you know that she is exquisite?”

“F***, with this kind of bearing, and this kind of figure, if she is not an exquisite beauty, I will cut off my own head to become a ball for you!”

The three men all showed stunned expressions, and couldn’t help but whisper amongst themselves.

The other people in the surroundings were also the same. The Empress’s bearing was really too strong; she could become the center of attention of any place at any time. With her there, all other women would only be pure background, and completely pale in comparison.

“She is Luan Xing!”

“What, the super genius who lit up 92 holes with a single strike yesterday?”

“Hiss, I have heard of her name, but I never imagined that her bearing would actually be so enchanting!”

“She must be the Holy Daughter of a major sect, or how else could she possibly have such astonishing natural talent, strength, and bearing!”

“Strange, this is clearly the Tong Clan’s chariot... With the strength of the Tong Clan, how could they possibly manage to make a connection with her?”

Everyone was confused. There were not more than over a dozen people who had passed the test of strength of the holed pillar, but Changsun Liang also invited the young generation of the various forces of Black Moon City. Thus, there were many gathered here.

Everyone knew everyone else, and though Tong Lin’s natural talent in cultivation was not too bad, compared with the Empress, he wasn’t even worthy to tie her shoestrings, and the Tong Clan was far from being enough to make a connection with a large sect.

There was something strange about this matter.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and his mischievous nature burned bright. Who asked him to be friends with the large black dog?

He coughed, and said, “Let me give everyone an explanation. We met Tong Lin on our way here, but Tong Lin went into the bushes with his female companion on a spontaneous whim, and allowed us to have his chariot, saying that there was no need to worry, and that he would be arriving soon.”

A spontaneous whim, going into the bushes with his female companion?

Everyone bore a strange expression. Could it be that Tong Lin’s se*ual desires suddenly surged, and he couldn’t help but want to satisfy them immediately?

“That’s not right, even if he wanted to... do that, wouldn’t it be better inside the carriage?” someone asked curiously. None of their carriages were ordinary, and they had protective formations. They could even block a powerful attack, so being shake-proof and soundproof was even easier.

“Who knows, maybe Tong Lin likes doing it outdoors?”

“The possibility of being discovered at any time, having the taste of a clandestine love affair; this is not a bad idea. I will have to give it a try sometime.”

“Ximen Da, you keep staring at the wives of others; aren’t you afraid of karma?!”

This piece of news was more explosive; everyone could not help feeling their desire for gossip burn, and became busybodies.

Just at this moment, another carriage steered over, and a young man alighted from it with a beautiful female companion by his side. However, he wore a very strange expression on his face, and the moment he came down, he hurriedly exclaimed, “You guys would never guess what I saw on my way here!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He paused, seeming to leave everyone in suspense, and then continued, “There was actually an illicit couple engaged in public s*x! Just guess, who was the man?”

F***, it really was him!

“Tong Lin!” everyone replied, seemingly all at the same time.

The young man from before was dazed for a moment. F***, so you guys had all already seen it.

At first, everyone was just skeptical, but now hearing these words from this young man, it was equivalent to having been given solid proof, so even if they could not believe it, they had no other choice.

Tsk, this Tong Lin was really not picky. He was already close to the castle, and still wanted a roll in the bushes. If Changsun Liang found out, this young king tier would definitely be furious.

...You actually came to have “public s*x” in my territory; just how much of an insult was that to me?

Everyone immediately decided to separate themselves from Tong Lin. Otherwise, it would be terrible if they were to be implicated by their connections to him!

How could Changsun Liang, a king tier that had withdrawn from worldly affairs, destined to have a future filled with boundless prospects, be easily offended?

“Come on, we should head in.” Everyone had no further interest to greet and chat with their friends here any longer. Even Tong Lin’s three friends turned around and left, wanting nothing more than to pretend that they had never met Tong Lin before.

The caste was very big. Thus, even though they were clearly at the main entrance, they had still spent some time to make their way into the main hall. There were already rows of tables that had been arranged here.

The tables were not very big, and could only accommodate two people sitting side by side. This was also why the red-haired young man had said that every person could only bring a single companion.

There was a plaque that was placed on each table, and a name was written on it. The meaning was very clear here; everyone was to be seated according to their corresponding plaque.

That was good too as it would prevent any arguments from breaking out.

Ling Han and the Empress found their places. However, only the Empress’s name was there. As for Ling Han? Today, he was merely there to join in for the meal. He did not care at all, and sat down in a cross-legged position, starting a quiet conversation with the Empress.

...The table was very low, so there was no need for chairs. Instead, there were mats on the floor, and one could sit on them.

“En?” After Ling Han sat down, he was involuntarily slightly surprised because a heat from within the mat entered into his body, and it actually had the effect of increasing Origin Power. However, he had now reached the peak stage of Great Saint, so such benefits had no effect on him.

As expected of a Holy Son, even what he used to receive his guests was such high-grade articles.

Immediately, Ling Han felt an urge to have this for takeaway. This could be given to Feng Po Yun and the others. Though the effect was not especially strong, every little bit counted. If they could speed up their accumulation of Origin Power a little, then why not?

“Hey, just guess what I saw when I just came over?” a person called out very excitedly when he had just entered into the main hall.

“Tong Lin having public s*x!” a few people immediately replied in disapproval.

Ah?

The person who had just entered was immediately stunned. And here he thought that he had discovered a huge piece of news.
