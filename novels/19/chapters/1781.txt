Chapter 1782: Restoring the chants

“What do you mean?” Ling Han asked.

“There are a total of nine ancestral flames in the Celestial Realm. In theory, this number would not change. If any of the ancestral flames is extinguished, only then would the heaven and earth give rise to a new ancestral flame,” Small Tower began to explain.

“According to my deduction, an elite managed to capture the Nine Heavens Flame all those years ago, and created a flame control technique. However, this elite later died, and the Nine Heavens Flame was also extinguished.

“Yet, there was a sliver of the Nine Heavens Flame that remained, and after innumerable years, it began to burn again, becoming the new Nine Heavens Flame. Because this is only a remaining sliver, the flame control technique from years ago is still branded on it, but it is possibly no longer complete. However, through reference to this secret technique, it finally formed a complete technique again.”

This was very logical. Otherwise, it could not be explained how Ling Han could have seen the chant that should not have existed.

Unfortunately, this was only a single piece of paper that contained a mere 10 verbal chants.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head. It looked like he definitely had to meet this Bewitching Maiden Rou.

On the other side, Fu Gaoyun and the others were all scrambling their brains, thinking hard.

Putting aside the fact that Fu Gaoyun had kept Bewitching Maiden Rou in his mind all this while, the others were also filled with anticipation, wanting to see for themselves just how exquisite and enchanting Bewitching Maiden Rou was. This was a great beauty that was filled with legend, a beautiful witch, and an exquisite femme fatale.

Ling Han shook his head secretly. Anyone that was capable of capturing the Nine Heavens Flame, aside from someone very lucky like him, had to be a Celestial King Tier to be able to accomplish this feat. And one that could create a secret technique that could control the ancestral flame could only be a Celestial King without a doubt.

You guys were merely a few Severing Mundane Tiers; if they actually managed to restore the incomplete technique of a Celestial King Tier, he really would refuse to believe it!

Even if they were already standing on the shoulder of a giant, and had a ready chant which they could study, the difficulty level of this task was like reaching for the heavens. Putting aside them, even if it was a few Celestial Kings, they would have to spend immeasurable time to be able to completely restore this incomplete chant. Furthermore, it might not be the same as the original, either.

As Ling Han deduced it, Bewitching Maiden Rou had also obtained this technique accidentally, and had completely no idea how valuable it was. Otherwise, she would definitely not have dared to take it out to be studied by everyone. If this was discovered by someone who actually knew what it was, it would be enough reason to spark off a war.

Thankfully, there were only 10 verbal chants, and that was not enough to distinguish the fact that this was actually a Celestial King technique.

Ling Han did not immediately speak up. This was too freakish, wasn’t it? You knew what the incomplete parts of the chant were just from a single glance? Were you planning to scare the others to death?

Three days passed, and not a single person could think through what the incomplete technique was. In fact, they couldn’t even fill in a single letter. Otherwise, if it was placed together with the other chants, they would probably be treated with disdain.

At this time, Ling Han finally took out the incomplete chant that had the blanks filled in, and handed it to Fu Gaoyun so that he could bring it over to the Purity Sect.

“Will this work?” Fu Gaoyun was unsure. Though he admired Ling Han very much, so many prodigies had not had the slightest bit of advancement after so many days, and you actually declared that you had solved it completely? It naturally would cause doubt.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “Even if it’s wrong, it’s fine, right? Anyways, isn’t it just an attempt?”

When Fu Gaoyun thought about it, this was reasonable. Thus, he took the incomplete chant, and ran over to the Purity Sect’s battle ship to hand it in.

However, nothing was heard even after half a day had passed.

Fu Gaoyun naturally thought that it had not passed, so could only sigh despondently and continue the struggle. He earnestly began to study again.

But it was just at this time that the woman in white that had appeared a few days ago came over elegantly to ask for an audience. After she was granted permission, she delicately bowed to Fu Gaoyun, and said, “Young Master Fu, our Holy Daughter invites you over.”

It really passed?

Fu Gaoyun was stunned for a moment, and then immediately overjoyed. He hurriedly nodded, and said, “Yes! Yes! Yes!”

At this moment, he did not have the slightest bit of reservedness.

“Count me in,” Ling Han said with a smile. He had helped Fu Gaoyun because he wanted to see the full flame control technique.

The woman in white immediately showed a hint of displeasure. ‘Who the hell are you?’

Fu Gaoyun was also stuck in a dilemma. Being able to get an invitation from Bewitching Maiden Rou was already an incredible honor, so how could he bring himself to express the desire to bring someone else along with him? But the issue here was that this problem had actually been resolved by Ling Han, so how could he kick him to the curb now that he’s outlived his usefulness?

A thought moved in Ling Han’s head, and he said, “I have been abrupt. Consider that I have not said anything.”

The fact that Bewitching Maiden Rou would invite Fu Gaoyun over had to be because she wanted him to continue restoring the incomplete technique. Did Fu Gaoyun have this ability? In the end, they would still come back to beg him.

Of course, if this cultivation technique really only had three chants that were incomplete, Ling Han could only resign himself to his poor luck. In future, he would have to think of some way to get the full cultivation technique from the hands of Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Fu Gaoyun instantly breathed a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Ling Han would insist, but he did not want to damage the relations between himself and Ling Han. Otherwise, he would really be willing not to visit Bewitching Maiden Rou instead.

He knew the importance of this matter, or he would not have been qualified to become one of the four heirs of the Fu Clan in the first place.

The woman in white glanced coldly at Ling Han, expressing a strong disdain. She did not make sound, and led Fu Gaoyun towards the battleship of the Purity Sect.

Ling Han crossed his legs, unconcerned. He had a card up his sleeve.

After waiting a few hours, that woman in white had indeed returned, and so did Fu Gaoyun. His forehead was covered in sweat, and he looked a little embarrassed.

Ling Han could guess that Bewitching Maiden Rou had to have taken out the incomplete Celestial King technique, and asked Fu Gaoyun to continue restoring the technique, but how could Fu Gaoyun possibly have that kind of ability? He could only reveal the truth. Thus, he was naturally embarrassed as he had taken the credit for someone else’s effort.

“Brother Ling, come, let’s go and meet Fairy Rou together,” Fu Gaoyun called out the moment he came in.

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “Not interested.”

‘Yi, why are you uninterested now? Previously, didn’t you say yourself that you wanted to go?’

Though people were prone to change, you’d changed a little too quickly, hadn’t you?

“Our Holy Daughter has invited you, and you’re putting on airs?” the woman in white asked without being the slightest bit reserved. She had seen who knew how many young king tiers, but any of them would immediately scramble over when they heard that they were summoned by Bewitching Maiden Rou, and would always treat her very politely.

‘Are you the heir of a noble clan? Are you the Holy Son of a great sect? And you are actually putting on airs, you really have no awareness of your own status!’

Ling Han did not even raise his head, and only waved a dismissive hand. He said, “Just going by this attitude of yours, hoho. We’ll speak again when you have understood what kind of attitude should be maintained when you have a request to make.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Realization dawned on Fu Gaoyun. No wonder Ling Han had changed so suddenly. As it turned out, he had been irked by this woman in white. He communicated a message through divine sense, “Brother Ling, don’t fall to the same level as this woman. What if you overreach yourself, and we aren’t able to meet Bewitching Maiden Rou? You don’t know, this woman is really the most exquisite of the highest grade!”

What a dumb teammate; his will was really too weak!

Ling Han ignored him, and only closed his eyes in rest. He was too sure of himself. When Bewitching Maiden Rou saw the incomplete chant that had been restored, she would definitely be anxious to see the whole cultivation technique completely restored. Thus, the initiative was grasped in his hands.

He indeed did not want to drop down to the same level as this woman in white, but there was no reason that he would be bossed around, either.

“Humph!” The woman in white was proud too, and directly turned around and left.

“Sigh!” Fu Gaoyun sighed, but did not set off to pursue her. Faced with a choice of either his brother or a beautiful woman, he still chose the former.

Yet, Ling Han smiled, and said, “Would you believe it? Not too long after, she will come back.”
