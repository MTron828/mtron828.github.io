Chapter 3277 - 3277: Taken Down in One Move

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The final battle would be held at the training ground.

For safety reasons, the academy also sent out a High Level coach called Tu Yun, whose cultivation level was of the Extreme Bone Tier.

Hu Yang arrived early. He was already impatient and urgently needed to clear his name in front of the public.

After waiting for a long time, Ling Han finally arrived with the little female attendant.

“Ling Han!” Xu Youliang was the first to jump out. “How arrogant of you!”

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “The decisive battle will take place in the morning, and there’s no agreement on what time. It’s your business if you want to arrive early. I’m a person who’s naturally fond of sleeping in.”

“You—” Xu Youliang pointed angrily at Ling Han, and almost wanted to pounce on him.

But firstly, it was not his battle today. Secondly, even if he attacked, the possibility of him being defeated was higher. It would be better not to embarrass himself.

“Scram to the side, could it be that you want to represent your master in battle?” Ling Han reprimanded.

Although Xu Youliang was mad with fury, he could only retreat to the side.

Hu Yang, on the other hand, calmed down. He was the leader of the Hu Clan Gang. How could he lose his composure in public? He said indifferently, “Since he’s here, let’s begin.”

“Wait!” Ling Han stretched out his hand. He had the little female attendant come forward, and placed a package on the ground. “My bet is here. Where’s yours?”

Hu Yang snorted and thought to himself, ‘Could it be that you think this will scare me?’

“Youliang,” he said, tilting his head.

Xu Youliang walked out and connected to the academy’s network with his optical computer, injecting as much as five million Dark North Coins into it.

This would be kept by the academy. If Ling Han won, the academy would directly transfer the money to Ling Han.

Since that was the case, Ling Han also handed the package to Tu Yun, and the academy would first appraise the authenticity of the alchemical pill. This took up some time. After all, Ling Han had brought several hundred alchemical pills with him, so it was naturally not something that could be verified with a wave of his hand.

However, after more than ten minutes, everything was ready.

“Ling Han, don’t you feel that you’ve made the wrong move in the first place?” Hu Yang said calmly.

“What did I do wrong?” Ling Han asked.

Hu Yang shook his head. “This time, I won’t give you any chance. I’ll defeat you with a thunderous force. All your schemes and tricks are useless in front of me because you’ll have to face absolute strength.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and said, “If you don’t go and become a storyteller, it’s really a great loss for the world of comedy!”

Hu Yang’s expression immediately turned ugly. Who was he?

The descendants of the Hu Clan were destined to be officials in the Imperial Court in the future. How dare you compare me to an ordinary person?

He was scolding him right to his face!

“Since that’s the case, we’ll have to show our subordinates a battle of true strength!” he said coldly. Then, he looked at Tu Yun and said, “Teacher Tu, can we start now?”

Tu Yun looked seriously at the two of them and said, “In this duel, you’re allowed to use any Spirit Tool or Talisman Weapon. If you’re willing to fight, I’ll do my best to protect you. However, there would still be a loophole despite taking all measures. There’s still the risk of getting seriously injured or killed. Is that clear?” “Clear. ”

“Clear. ”

Ling Han and Hu Yang both nodded.

“Alright, let the duel begin!” Tu Yun nodded.

Hu Yang didn’t waste any words. His blood immediately boiled. He wanted to suppress Ling Han at the first possible moment and prove to others with his strongest stance that Ling Han was definitely not the second Hong Tianbu, and he couldn’t possibly be Ling Han’s stepping stone.

Xiu, he charged out at a ridiculous speed.

Destruction Claw!

He immediately used all of his ultimate moves. Other than not using his Talisman Weapon and Spirit Tool, he had truly pushed his battle prowess to the extreme.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and locked onto Hu Yang with his divine intent. Then, he injected his mystical power into the Weapon Nurturing Leaf. Weng, the leaf instantly glowed.

He waved his hand again and threw the leaf at Hu Yang.

It was clearly just a leaf, but after it was thrown out, it turned into a huge sword that was ten feet long and slashed at Hu Yang.

“Spirit Tool!”

“No, a Talisman Weapon!”

Everyone shouted. They felt that their eyes could not capture the trajectory of the Talisman Weapon at all.

“Two times the speed of sound!”

Just as everyone was exclaiming in surprise, the huge sword had already arrived in front of Hu Yang.

It was too fast. Hu Yang could not dodge at all. He could only use all his strength to block the sword.

Puff!

Blood spurted out as Hu Yang fell to the ground.

How could Hu Yang block it? He was already lying on the ground.

Tu Yun shouted and charged over from the side, immediately fighting fiercely with the huge sword.

He was in the Extreme Bone Tier, and he was even standing on the second limit. His battle prowess was about the same as the Talisman Weapon, just a little bit weaker. This made him very passive, and he was slashed into a quite a miserable state.

This was because humans had vital points. They would be injured and die, while Talisman Weapons did not.

If he fought the Talisman Weapon head-on, he would be the greatest fool.

However, in order to protect Hu Yang, Tu Yun had to become such a great fool and fight the Talisman Weapon with all his might. This was because the target of the Talisman Weapon was Hu Yang. As long as Tu Yun retreated, the Talisman Weapon would kill Hu Yang.

“Ling Han!” Tu Yun roared. “Hurry up and stop it!”

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “I can’t do anything either. This Talisman

Weapon is special, and once it’s used, it can’t be taken back.”

Tu Yun cried out in anger, but he had no choice. He could only use all his might to block the Talisman Weapon and get someone to move Hu Yang away. Otherwise, he would not be able to continue like this.

The entire place fell silent.

Before this, most people thought that Ling Han would definitely lose, and Hu Yang had indeed crushed Ling Han in all aspects.

A scheme could succeed once, but definitely not twice. After all, Hu Yang wasn’t stupid.

But now, it was Hu Yang who had fallen to the ground.

Who would have thought that Ling Han actually had such a powerful Talisman Weapon? Hu Yang didn’t even have time to react, and directly fell to the ground.

This outcome was beyond anyone’s expectations.

Even if there had been people who had guessed that Ling Han would win, it was definitely not under such circumstances.

Dark, very dark!

Everyone thought to themselves. The first time, this guy had caused Hu Yang to exhaust his boiling of blood and Qi. This time, he directly used the Talisman Weapon to domineeringly prevent Hu Yang from having the chance to make a move.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Hu Yang had been defeated twice, but neither time was a matter of ability. Both times, he had been tricked by Ling Han.

Everyone looked at Ling Han, thinking to themselves that if they were to get into a conflict with this guy in the future, they had to be very, very careful, and not fall into a trap that Ling Han had laid for them.

Look, not only did Hu Yang lose and embarrass himself in public, he even lost five million Dark North Coins.

Although this was only a small matter to the Hu Clan, it was still five million coins after all. No one’s money came from nowhere.

“After a fight, I’m so tired!” Ling Han stretched lazily, and said to the little female attendant, “Come, let’s go home and rest.”

“Yes, Young Master!” Huan Xue hurriedly went to retrieve the package they had brought here. There was no need to worry about the money. The academy would not cheat them of such a small sum of money.

What was there to be tired about? He merely tossed a Talisman Weapon!

Everyone complained in their hearts..
