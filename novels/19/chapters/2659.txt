2660 Selling alchemical pills

Ling Han was here.

Instantly, everyone became excited. The other main character had finally arrived, and the battle was about to begin at any moment.

Ling Han naturally had not come alone. He was accompanied by the Rain Emperor, Yan Xianlu, and the others, including the Empress, Bewitching Maiden Rou, and the other women. His formation was not inferior to Heavenborn’s.

“Brother Ji! Celestial maiden Huo!”

As they walked, Ling Han smilingly greeted Ji Wuming, Huo Furong, and the others. This battle had also attracted the attention of all the prodigies of the Celestial Realm because both parties involved in this battle had come from their realm.

The Celestial Realm was a super low-level dimension, yet two supreme prodigies had now appeared consecutively from their ranks. All the cultivators from the Celestial Realm felt similarly proud. When they spoke of Heavenborn and Ling Han, they would also feel proud.

Hui was also nearby. He had also been born in the Celestial Realm, and was extremely strong. However, his physique was not as strong as Heavenborn’s, and he had been restrained strongly by Heavenborn.

Hui naturally was more inclined to Ling Han winning this battle, but he was also aware that the chances of this were too narrow.

Out of anyone who knew Heavenborn’s strength, who would believe that Ling Han could win?

“Ling Han, you are finally here!” Heavenborn stated calmly. Though his voice was not loud, it was filled with authority and dominance. This was a display of his confidence. “As I see it, you can just barely be considered a prodigy. Submit to me, and follow my lead from today onwards.”

Ling Han ignored him, and continued walking forwards. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Heavenborn, are you still dreaming?” Yi asked.

“Nothing but a puny Third Heaven Celestial King, and you dare speak to Lord Heavenborn in this manner?” Heavenborn naturally couldn’t deign to argue with Yi, but his lackeys would definitely jump out to defend their master.

Heavenborn merely looked coldly at Ling Han, and said, “Since you are unwilling to accept my kindness, then just wait for me to beat you till you burst!”

Since Heavenborn came to being, it was only Ling Han who had successfully tricked him, causing his plans to fall apart, and Heavenborn had not been able to obtain the blood essence of all the prodigies. Otherwise, he could be even stronger than he was now. Thus, the person he hated the most was naturally Ling Han as well, or how could Heavenborn have possibly taken the initiative to challenge the other party?

Ling Han still ignored his opponent. He walked to where the spectators were, and then suddenly broke into a smile. He took out several pill bottles, and called out loudly, “Come, come come. If you are passing by, better not miss out on this opportunity. I have Flawless Pill, which can mend the instability in foundations on the path of cultivation, and there is also Splitting Clouds Pill, which can increase the chance to break through to the next cultivation level by a sliver…”

Ling Han suddenly turned into a businessman, and began to peddle his products right there and then.

‘This…!’

No one expected that Ling Han would actually do this.

But after a moment of surprise, a great many people were moved because the alchemical pills that Ling Han was selling were really what they yearned for.

“I want a bottle!”

“I want 10!”

“Give me one too.”

Everyone gathered around Ling Han. No one knew exactly how many such great Celestial-King-Tier alchemical pills Ling Han possessed. Hence, all of them scrambled over one another in their hurry, fearing that Ling Han’s stock would be emptied out, and they would be left with nothing.

Seeing this scene, Liu Yutong and the other women all bore strange expressions.

Li Sichan asked weakly, “Could it be that this is the true reason that Husband agreed to the challenge?”

“Make use of Heavenborn’s influence, attracting everyone here, then take the chance to sell his alchemical pills. Probably the only person who could do this is Husband.”

“It can be imagined that Heavenborn…”

“Would definitely explode in fury!”

Indeed, Heavenborn was already extremely furious. Who was he? Even the many instructors in the martial academy were very polite to him because it was a sure bet that he would become a Heavenly Venerate in the future with his aptitude.

Among the many disciples, Heavenborn was also one of the strongest. On the Eternal Stone, he had beaten A’mu and other supreme freaks, and could be considered the top in the whole epoch!

Yet, now that he had voluntarily spoken, not only had Ling Han ignored him, he had actually begun to peddle alchemical pills.

‘Are you a peddler?’

Not only did this cause Ling Han’s image to collapse, it also dragged down Heavenborn’s authority as well.

‘See, you are actually challenging this kind of person, which shows that your standards aren’t all that high, either.’

“Hehe!” In midair, A’mu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“This junior brother is really quite interesting!” Du Shiyi said, smiling as well.

“Hopefully, he is not just versed in showing off and nothing else,” Can Yue stated coldly. He hated people who were flashy but without any substance inside.

Below them, Heavenborn finally could no longer bear it, and called out loudly, “Ling Han, are you fighting or not?”

“Of course!” Ling Han continued to do business. He naturally would not be taking Star Stones, but would be trading for valuable ingredients. There were various prodigies gathered in the martial academy, but Grandmaster Alchemists were extremely rare. His pill concoction success rate was shockingly high, so he could make an astounding amount of profit.

“Then what are you doing now?” Heavenborn demanded, forcing down his fury.

Ling Han was surprised. “Our agreement was to battle today, but there was no mention of exact time, right? What are you in such a rush for? The day hasn’t ended yet, right?”

Heavenborn was instantly struck speechless. Did this f*cking kind of logic exist?

‘We agreed to battle today, and you are already here, yet are still wasting time here. Aren’t you deliberately joking with me?’

“Ling Han, if you’re afraid, kneel down immediately and beg for mercy!”

“That’s right, just beg for mercy!”

Heavenborn’s subordinates all called out, speaking on behalf of their master because there were some words that would be inappropriate for one of Heavenborn’s status to say.

Yan Xianlu, Yi, and the others also stepped out to counter with their own retorts. They naturally were helping Ling Han.

Neither of the main characters had begun the battle, but their subordinates were already arguing so intensely that their faces and ears were flushed, looking greatly infuriated.

Ling Han was doing very good business. Everyone here was a prodigy from their respective dimension. Even if not all of them came from powerful backgrounds, there were indeed such “wealthy” people. Some were even the descendants of Heavenly Venerates, so the resources they possessed were shockingly great in volume.

In less than an hour, Ling Han sold all of the alchemical pills he possessed. He subtly calculated the resources that he had traded them for; if these, too, were refined into alchemical pills, the amount would be nine times what he had originally had.

He had made almost 10 times the profit!

Ling Han was very satisfied. He stepped out of the masses, but there were still a great many people that wanted to buy alchemical pills for him. They were still gathered around him, unwilling to let him leave.

“Don’t worry, everyone. 10,000 years later, I will be selling alchemical pills again, so please don’t miss out on the next opportunity,” Ling Han said.

Only then were the masses satisfied. For Celestial Kings, 10,000 years was naturally no big deal.

Ling Han walked forwards, and declared, “Heavenborn, make your move!”

Heavenborn was already livid with fury. How long had he been waiting? Just how long had he been waiting!

“Ling Han, I will let you know what the consequences are for mocking me!” he spat out word by word, his eyes extremely fierce.

Ling Han chuckled, and waved a hand. “Don’t spout so much nonsense. Stop wasting time, and make your move!”

“Humph!” Heavenborn finally could no longer hold himself back. Peng! He suddenly shot into the skies, and with a wave of his arms, they instantly transformed into two golden spears. “Come!”

Ling Han pushed down on his feet. Peng! He, too, shot into the skies, and looked across at Heavenborn. He drew the Divine Demon Sword, and raised it so it was level with his chest, pointing it straight at Heavenborn, his eyes exuding coldness.

“Die!” Heavenborn struck. Xiu! His figure shot forwards, blasting towards Ling Han.

Ding!

Spear and sword clashed, instantly causing the surrounding space to collapse, which spread in all directions. But neither of the two took one step backwards. There was less than a foot’s distance between their faces, and both their expressions were blazing with fighting spirit.

Peng, peng, peng! Explosions rang out in the space around them, and even Regulations were shattered into bits, unable to withstand a single blow under the assault of the two great elites.

“Humph, it’s been a long time since we’ve last met, and your strength has indeed increased considerably!” Heavenborn waved his arms, and sent Ling Han sliding backwards.

“Your strength is as I have expected it to be, though—not all that impressive!” Ling Han retorted calmly.

Heavenborn couldn’t help but grit his teeth. Why did this guy have such a venomous tongue?
