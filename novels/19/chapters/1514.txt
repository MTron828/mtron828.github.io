Chapter 1515 Total Annihilation

When a Saint’s decree showed its might, all of Hu Can’s group were covered with wounds. They had completely no way to withstand it.

When they finally managed to last until the power of the decree had passed, all of them were severely wounded. Though none of them had died, their vitality was greatly damaged, and their strength had also dropped to rock bottom.

Sword in hand, Ling Han charged out without any hesitation.

He had been polite, but they did not want to accept his kindness. Not only did they want to kill him, they dared to have designs on his wife, the Empress. He naturally could not spare them.

Cripple them! Kill them! Eliminate them!

F***, did they think that they were the only ones who could show their might from their haughty positions? Did they think he didn’t have a temper?

The sword swept past, and blood sprayed out. Having tasted human blood, the broken wooden sword became even more hideous. Black Demonic Qi surged out from the sword’s blade and rushed around Ling Han, making it seem as if he had transformed into a great demon of the Netherworld.

Pu! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Hu Bing was weakest, and also became the fastest to die. The sword swept past, and blood spurted into the skies. His head also dropped onto the ground, a disbelieving expression still present on his face.

He was a prodigy of the Forbidden Land; with such a powerful force backing him, someone actually still dared to kill him?

With his head severed by the broken wooden sword, it naturally meant instant death.

“How dare you!!” The eyes of Hu Can and the others all became bloodshot. No matter how much they had been at a disadvantage previously, they were still filled with a deep pride. Coming from a Forbidden Land, they looked down on all others in the Immortal Realm. That was because they thought they belonged to the Celestial Realm, so how could trash from this realm compare to them?

But with the death of Hu Bing, their hearts throbbed violently. That pride and inbred arrogance was completely erased.

They had become afraid. This demon really dared to make a move on them; even the Forbidden Land couldn’t scare him off.

“We are people from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, and have a total of three ancestors. They are all Saint Kings, and the Saints in our Forbidden Land number by the hundreds. You dare make a move on us, your fate will be to die a tragic death!” Hu Can and his group threw out the Eight Stones Forbidden Land. Now, this was their last hope that could save them.

Ling Han only acted as if he had not heard them. Since he was already filled with killing intent, there was no possible way for him to stop. No matter whom they threw out, it would not be enough to scare him off.

Kill, kill, kill!

One after another, heads flew. One after another, they collapsed, and very soon, the only ones remaining alive were Hu Can and Hu Shuyu.

“Run!” Hu Can called out to Hu Shuyu.

Hu Shuyu nodded. Previously, they had kept fighting because they had been held back by Hu Bing and the others. How could they leave these people behind and flee for their own lives? But the present situation was different. The others had all died, so there was no significance in continuing to fight to the death.

Furthermore, if all of them died here, that would be a pointless death. How were they going to avenge themselves? One should know that their ancestor had concealed the twists of fate, and it would last for about a year’s time at least. Thus, even if their ancestor did another fortune telling on the spur of the moment, that would be a matter of a year later.

Where would he go to hunt down their murderer?

Their ancestor was only a Saint King, and not an omnipotent Celestial King!

The two of them immediately fled in two separate directions. As long as one of them managed to escape alive, and enter into the starship outside, the starship’s defense was naturally not something that Ling Han could penetrate.

Ling Han pursued. Now, these two people had sustained serious injuries, their battle prowess dropped greatly. If he didn’t take this chance to kill them, then when they had recovered from their injuries, he would have to use the blood essence of the Saint King if he still wanted to kill them. That was too much of a waste.

Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow!

Ling Han used this divine technique. Xiu, his Origin Power became a streak of light that chased quickly on the heels of Hu Shuyu.

This archery technique had fused with the Tide of the Ages and the Blood Crow Formation. It was visible that when the streak of light flew out, it became a divine blood crow. As its wings flapped, its speed was further boosted.

“What?!” Because Hu Can was no longer the target of attack, he had the energy to turn around and look. He couldn’t help but look stunned. “The Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, you, you are a survivor of the Heavenly River King’s force!”

The Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow was the ultimate technique of one of the Twelve Generals. At the time, it had killed a considerable number of Great Saints, and had even posed a considerable threat to the Saint Kings. Because of this, even if Hu Can had not seen it himself, he had still occasionally heard about it from his seniors, so he remembered it clearly.

Thus, he recognized it with a single look. However, as for why the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow would become a blood crow at the end, he could not provide an explanation for it.

But this did not hinder the might of this strike. It had even far surpassed his understanding. Pu, the blood crow caught up to Hu Shuyu with only a flap of its wings and sank into her heart. A spray of blood spurted out, and she collapsed loudly on the ground.

Ordinarily, Immortals were very, very difficult to kill. Even if their physical bodies were completely destroyed, as long as their spirit had not been damaged, they could still find an empty shell and come back to life. However, Ling Han’s attack had even blended in the Nine Heavens Flame. With an immortal flame in her body, could she still manage to stay alive?

Hu Can’s whole body was covered with cold sweat. Hurriedly, he turned around and fled. By now, he had lost all his fighting spirit, and merely wanted to leave this place as soon as possible. Then, he could ask one of the great elites of the Forbidden Land to move out and hunt Ling Han to the corners of this world.

“None of you can escape!” Ling Han shot out another arrow. This time, he had used the Ultimate Arrow. Pu, a streak of light swept out, and Hu Can’s body suddenly flew, drawing out an arc in midair, and collapsing heavily onto the ground.

Blood poured out beneath him, his eyes wide and filled with fury and defiance.

He was a prodigy of this generation, and actually died in such a stupid manner. How could he possibly rest in peace?

Ling Han though shook his head. Hu Can should be inferior to big shots like Ren Feiyun and the others. He had seen a battle between the three great big shots, and they were at least a whole level stronger than Hu Can.

He picked out the Spatial Spirit Tools of the seven people, and moved all the things inside into the Black Tower. He obtained another great amount of high-level Godly metal.

“This trip was really worth it. As long as the Divine Demon Sword can be improved to Level 14, it can rush up to Level 17 in a single go, and become a Saint Tool!” Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly. Previously, he had not placed any importance on this treasure trove at all, and had merely wanted to set up a trap for Gu Daoyi.

“En, I can’t forget my proper business.” Ling Han immediately began planning. How should he allow the news about the Heavenly River King’s treasure trove “appearing” to leak out such that it would seem normal? Gu Daoyi was no idiot. Having been able to become a Severing Mundane Ancestor, he definitely had to be astute and circumspect.

What Ling Han was betting on was the fact that he was presently a reincarnated body, and did not have the calm nature that he had once had. Furthermore, he definitely wanted to return to the Celestial Realm urgently. Otherwise, he could have worked hard on cultivation on his own. What was the point of his entering into the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy in that case?

“Let’s go out and take a look. Who knows how Feng’er is now.”

The two of them exited the chest, and saw that a dead silence had fallen on this corner of the galaxy. The corpses of the three Phoenix Kings were no longer shining, but they were still tightly embracing each other, and did not leak out even a bit of light.

“Going by the situation now, it won’t end anytime soon.” Ling Han recalled how the Rain Emperor had obtained the inheritance of an Eternal River Tier elite, and had spent at least 20 years to fully digest the benefits he had gained.

And that was just an Eternal River Tier; now they were dealing with Saint Kings!

“This is good too. With these three Phoenix Kings here, it would be more convincing. Furthermore, as long as a Saint King has not appeared, no one can possibly hurt Feng’er.” Ling Han thought about it for a moment, and tied this chariot to the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. Pulling the corpses of the three Phoenix Kings behind him, they headed back to the Wood Figure Planet.

Of course, they had to drag it closer. Otherwise, how long would Gu Daoyi have to spend on this trip? He did not have the Cloud Piercing Shuttle.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle reversed its original course, and took merely over a dozen days, which soon passed.

Ling Han pulled the chariot to a barren planet, and then blasted a massive hold, making it so it seemed as if this chariot had just burst out of the ground. As for the details, he was uncaring. Were the corpses of three Phoenix Kings not convincing enough?

He quietly returned to the academy, and began to use Saintly medicine to cook a soup.
