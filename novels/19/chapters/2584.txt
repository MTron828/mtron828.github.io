Chapter 2585: Forcefully Killed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Yin River Celestial King couldn’t help but laugh. A measly Fourth Heaven Celestial King actually dared to act so audaciously before him?

He shook his head, saying, “Li Long, where in the world is your confidence coming from?”

Ling Han didn’t reply. Instead, his gaze was boiling with killing intent as it remained focused on Tang Yuan.

This person actually dared to screw him over? He naturally had to pay a price for this.

Tang Yuan continued to retreat. Ling Han’s gaze was far too terrifying, so much so that it caused a cold chill to rise from the bottom of his heart.

!!

The Yin River Celestial King humphed, and said, “Why are you retreating? With me here, can he hurt a single hair of yours?”

Tang Yuan was placed in an extremely awkward situation. On the one hand, he was extremely afraid of Ling Han. On the other hand, however, the Yin River Celestial King was the disciple of the Azure Ghost Celestial King. Moreover, because the Azure Ghost Celestial King didn’t have any children, the Yin River Celestial King was much like a son to him. He was dearly loved by the Azure Ghost Celestial King.

Thus, did Tang Yuan dare to disobey him?

If he didn’t give him face, he would definitely suffer a miserable fate.

He mustered all of his courage and forced himself to stop. However, he couldn’t stop himself from shaking in fear. His legs felt like jelly.

Ling Han cracked a grin, saying to the Yin River Celestial King, “Do you want to make a bet? I can definitely kill this person.”

“Impudence!” the Yin River Celestial King roared. He was a mighty Seventh Heaven Celestial King, yet Ling Han actually dared to act with such blatant disregard before him? This was unacceptable!

“Just wait and see!” Ling Han said.

If he unleashed his full battle prowess and summoned his Divine Demon Sword, it most likely wouldn’t be a difficult task to rival the Yin River Celestial King, Moreover, Tang Yuan was far from the Seventh Heaven, so killing him wouldn’t be too difficult, either.

“Capture him!” the Yin River Celestial King roared. He lashed out again, extending his right hand.

Hua, hua, hua!

Several black rivers materialized, appearing much like black dragons as they slithered toward Ling Han.

Without a word, Ling Han immediately summoned his Divine Demon Sword.

His battle prowess could only rival ordinary Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings. However, he definitely couldn’t rival monarch tiers at the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven.

Thus, refusing to use the Divine Demon Sword would be akin to torturing himself.

“Celestial Tool!” the Yin River Celestial King exclaimed, involuntarily furrowing his brows. He hadn’t been aware that Ling Han also possessed a Celestial Tool.

Even though Ling Han had used the Divine Demon Sword in the Tournament of Death before, he had only used it for a split second before sheathing it again. He hadn’t exposed its true power. Moreover, it was only after receiving Lu Li’s calls for reinforcements that the Yin River Celestial King had hurriedly rushed over. He hadn’t had the time to do any research on Ling Han.

As such, the appearance of the Divine Demon Sword truly gave him a start.

To Celestial Kings, possessing or not possessing a Celestial Tools were two completely different concepts.

Before a Celestial Tool’s might, even the Yin River Celestial King had to be extremely wary and careful. He had to dodge the Divine Demon Sword’s razor-sharp attacks. Otherwise, he would suffer an additional wound every time he was struck. If his vitals were struck, he would more so be sent into the afterlife.

Ling Han cracked a grin, saying, “You’re not going to flee?”

His words were aimed at Tang Yuan.

Tang Yuan faltered upon hearing this. Judging from the situation, the Yin River Celestial King was completely unable to suppress Ling Han. Thus, if Tang Yuan remained, wouldn’t he be seeking death?

However, the Yin River Celestial King had already told him to stop fleeing. If he disobeyed and didn’t give him face… What a difficult situation!

The Yin River Celestial King’s expression darkened. Just then, he had confidently proclaimed that he could suppress Ling Han with ease. To his surprise, however, his opponent was actually this terrifying.

Even if it were a freak with an Evolution Index of 12, they would only be able to rival the Sixth Heaven while at the Fourth Heaven, right?

Just what kind of freak was this?!

However, this was inevitable. Who would imagine that Ling Han could actually extract Void Particle Energy to temper his physique, causing his Body Art to far surpass his cultivation level? Add to that the Divine Demon Sword, and he could even rival monarch tiers at the Seventh Heaven.

The Yin River Celestial King had to concede that even though Ling Han couldn’t defeat him, he couldn’t suppress Ling Han, either.

“Piss off!” he roared in frustration and embarrassment.

Tang Yuan instantly heeded this delightful command, hurriedly turning around to flee.

He had lost his face long ago, so he naturally didn’t give a toss about fleeing before everyone.

Ling Han waved his hand, instantly throwing forth a figure. “Go, kill him!”

This was none other than Little Terror.

This little guy possessed the highest cultivation level among Ling Han and the others. Right now, it had already reached the Sixth Heaven. Add to that the fact that he was a monster created by a dimension, and his battle prowess was naturally above his cultivation level as well. Otherwise, how could it live up to its name as a Battle Beast?

Boom!

It charged forward, catching up to Tang Yuan in just a few steps. It then widened its maws to chomp down at Tang Yuan.

Its mouth instantly grew hundreds of times larger, and it was as if it were a mountain as it swallowed Tang Yuan with a gulp.

Little Terror’s mouth then immediately shrunk again. It smacked its lips as if it were enjoying the aftertaste.

The Yin River Celestial King was absolutely stupefied. No matter what, he hadn’t imagined that Ling Han had a Celestial King Tier Great Beast hidden on him.

The adjective “Great” wasn’t based on size. Instead, it was based on cultivation level. This beast had already become a Celestial King, so it was naturally a Great Beast.

“Little Terror, come, let’s dispose of this person now,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Little Terror immediately plodded over, its large eyes filled with killing intent as it glared at the Yin River Celestial King.

Ling Han spread his hands, saying, “I already told you… If I want to kill someone, I’ll definitely succeed.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Yin River Celestial King forcefully suppressed his boiling rage. He then took a deep breath before saying, “Then are you going to kill me as well?”

“Definitely, just not right now,” Ling Han replied with a smile.

The Yin River Celestial King raised a brow. This person was truly audacious, even wanting to kill him. “Oh? Then when are you going to act? That will give me some time to prepare as well, no?”

“When I reach the Fifth Heaven or Sixth Heaven. You won’t have to wait for too long,” Ling Han replied.

The Yin River Celestial King roared with laughter. “You still want to reach the Fifth Heaven or Sixth Heaven? What an absolute joke! You’ll die here today!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, saying, “Rest assured, I’ll leave before the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings receive news of this. There’s no need for you to worry. Moreover, I’ll also return from time to time, killing those I dislike.”

The Yin River Celestial King exploded with rage upon hearing this. Ling Han’s words implied that the Yin River couldn’t stop him at all! Moreover, Ling Han would still sneak back into Ghost King City from time to time, killing people such as Lu Li and the others, including even him!

“Can you truly leave?” he said coldly.

If a Fourth Heaven Celestial King managed to calmly leave Ghost King City after wantonly killing someone, would the Yin River Celestial King still have any face in the future?

After escaping, young masters such as Zhao Shuang would definitely report the situation to their own fathers. Thus, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would definitely arrive here very soon. At that time, Ling Han’s fate would be set in stone.

Ling Han and Little Terror teamed up as they attacked the Yin River Celestial King. Both of them possessed battle prowess at the Seventh Heaven, so they naturally gained an upper hand after teaming up. However, their advantage wasn’t significant. After all, the Yin River Celestial King’s battle prowess was already approaching the Eighth Heaven.

After battling for a while, Ling Han resolutely said, “Little Terror, let’s go!”

Little Terror growled in acknowledgment. The person and beast immediately ignored the Yin River Celestial King as they fled from the city.

The Yin River Celestial King humphed as he gave chase. How could he allow Ling Han to flee?

He was indeed slightly quicker than Ling Han and Little Terror. However, he didn’t dare to get too close to them. After all, he had to dodge the attacks from the Divine Demon Sword. Thus, he could only attack from a distance and cause some obstructions for Ling Han.

This indeed created some troubles for Ling Han and Little Terror as they fled. However, it wasn’t anything serious, and they quickly approached the city gates after just 30 minutes.

Yet, it was also at this moment that they heard a cold humph. A colossal hand reached over from the city, rapidly grabbing at Ling Han. The radiance of the Great Dao flashed, exuding a paramount aura.

This was the act of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.
