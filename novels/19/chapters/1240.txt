Chapter 1241: Looters

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Where are Realm Spirit Stones usually found?” Ling Han asked.

“Naturally where the conflict between the two realms is the most intense,” Rabbit replied.

“Then they’re probably 5,000 kilometers ahead,” Ling Han said. That place was located just in front of the Netherworld’s territory. The encampment of the Immortal Realm lay on this side, while the encampment of the Netherworld lay on that side.

The closer the encampments, the more intense the conflict. After all, beings from both realms wanted to obtain Realm Spirit Stones.

Anyhow, was this war an invasion, a defensive one, or purely a war over benefits?

Ling Han shook his head. This wasn’t for him to think about. He had the Reincarnation Tree, and thus he wasn’t in desperate need of Realm Spirit Stones. Moreover, the aim of his trip was to find the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Everything else could be put aside.

He continued to wait for the Purple Moon Army. As for the old ginseng and Rabbit, they actually ended up with their arms around each others’ shoulders after fighting for a while. It was as if they had become brothers. Ling Han could barely believe his eyes.

Rabbit and the ginseng disappeared in no time after saying that they were going to search for Realm Spirit Stones. Ling Han didn’t mind what they did.

He continued to study cultivation and alchemy as he waited. He had obtained a pile of ancient pill recipes not long ago, and he needed to get his head around them. Although he had already become a Level Eight alchemist, he only knew a pitifully small number of pill recipes. How could he live up to his title as the Alchemy Emperor?

Ling Han ordered the Asura Demon Emperor to keep watch outside as he entered the Black Tower to cultivate and study. If the Purple Moon Army started to move, the Asura Demon Emperor would cause a huge commotion nearby to notify him.

Peng!

After comprehending under the Reincarnation Tree for an unknown period of time, he suddenly felt a large tremor ripple through the earth nearby. He hurriedly exited the Black Tower, only to find the Asura Demon Emperor engaged in an intense battle with a group of people.

There were only three Sun Moon Tier elites among this group, with the other people all being at the Mountain River Tier. However, the puppet that the Asura Demon Emperor was in was already very damaged. He was only at the Mountain River Tier, so his divine sense still wasn’t powerful enough. However, a few of his opponents just happened to specialize in divine sense attacks. This forced him onto his back foot.

If the puppet he was in hadn’t been at the Sun Moon Tier, the Asura Demon Emperor probably would have died under the relentless attacks already.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel irritated. He leaped over, and shouted, “Stop!”

“Master!” The Asura Demon Emperor hurriedly dashed toward Ling Han as if he had seen his savior. He was on the verge of being beaten to death, and now that Ling Han had descended like a deity, he was so moved that he was on the verge of tears.

However, the group of people didn’t stop. Instead, they chuckled coldly, with one person saying, “Damn, you actually dare to collude with wicked beings from the Netherworld! How courageous!”

‘These people actually discovered the Asura Demon Emperor’s true identity?’

Ling Han casually swung his fist and forced the group of people back, saying, “This is my servant; what does he have to do with the Netherworld?”

The Asura Demon Emperor hid behind Ling Han, and he transmitted his voice using his divine sense, saying, “Master, in order to surveil the Purple Moon Army, I released my body outside the puppet. However, I was coincidentally seen by these people, and they started to attack me.”

He was a mist-like being, and even though he couldn’t fly in the Immortal Realm, he could still elongate his body and survey the surroundings from a high vantage point. Unexpectedly, this had led to unwanted trouble. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han nodded in understanding. This wasn’t the Asura Demon Emperor’s fault. In fact, he had only done this to better carry out his orders.

“Sir, if you don’t move, we’ll have to treat you as a traitor of the Immortal Realm and kill you along with that wicked being,” the people warned.

“No need to speak nonsense with him. Perhaps he’s a fat sheep. So, it’ll be better if we just kill him!”

“Maybe he’s the descendant of some large clan. If that’s the case, there’ll be heaps of treasures on him!”

Greed appeared on their faces.

Ling Han suddenly came to a realization, and he said, “You people are ‘looters’, right? You specialize in looting lone travelers.”

“Hehehe!” The group of people chuckled coldly, and said, “Since you’ve guessed our identity, go die!”

Although Ling Han was also at the Sun Moon Tier, he was only at the middle stage of the low extreme. Moreover, he was all by himself. Meanwhile, the group of looters had three Sun Moon Tier elites. After spending numerous years here, they had also accumulated quite some wealth, and used their merit points to obtain quite some treasures. If they unleashed these treasures... Hehe, they could even kill elites at the peak stage of the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier!

This was one of the reasons they dared to act so wantonly.

Killing intent flashed across Ling Han’s eyes. Since they planned to kill him, he didn’t need to hold back, either. He would kill them all!

“Together!”

The group of people naturally wouldn’t battle him one-on-one. A dozen or so people instantly charged toward Ling Han and the Asura Demon Emperor.

Sabers flashed and swords slashed. Killing intent permeated through the air.

Ling Han’s expression became dark, and he said, “You people are ambushing your allies instead of fighting against the Netherworld on the front lines. How admirable!” He clicked his finger.

Pa!

The head of a looter instantly exploded, and his divine sense was also obliterated along with it. He was as dead as could be.

“Damn it!” The ruffians were infuriated. However, the person who had been killed was only at the Mountain River Tier, so they didn’t become afraid. They continued to attack Ling Han.

Ling Han threw a punch.

Pa!

The head of another person instantly exploded. His divine sense was also obliterated.

If one wanted to kill an immortal for good, they had to obliterate their divine sense. Otherwise, an immortal could use their divine sense to possess another person. If they possessed a good host, perhaps they would become even stronger than before.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The heads of the looters continued to explode, causing clouds of blood to soar into the air. There were only a dozen or so looters, so how could they stand up to Ling Han’s vicious massacre? In the flash of an eye, only the three Sun Moon Tier elites remained.

However, these three elites were all trembling in terror. The youth opposite them was like a god of death, killing one of them with each punch. Moreover, he had killed them with absolute ease. His overwhelming power absolutely petrified them.

He was far too powerful!

“Damn it!” one of the looters roared. “Second Brother, Third Brother, this is no time to hold back. Hurry up and unleash your divine seals. Otherwise, we’re all going to die here today!”

A crimson glow instantly erupted from his body. Boundless raging flames surged out, and his aura instantly increased manifold.

Twisted smiles appeared on the faces of the other two, and they both retrieved divine seals before slapping them on their bodies.

They had all practiced the same cultivation technique, and thus they were all using the same divine seal at this moment—Soaring Crimson Flames. Their power instantly soared to the peak stage of the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. In fact, it was already bordering on the early stage of the high extreme.

“Die!” the three people roared as they lunged toward Ling Han.

Ling Han was astonished. Such power-raising divine seals were extremely valuable, yet these three looters each possessed one such divine seal? They had probably used their merit points to redeem them.

No wonder so many people stayed here even after completing their service. Ignoring the startling death rate, the Two Realm Battlefield was truly a land of treasures. As long as one earned enough merit points, they could obtain any treasure they wanted.

However, the divine seals were truly wasted on these three people.

Ling Han unleashed a wisp of heaven’s might.

Pa, pa, pa!

The three people instantly fell to their knees, their bodies becoming so feeble that they couldn’t even unleash an inkling of their power.

The divine seals had merely elevated their power. However, their divine sense hadn’t been strengthened at all. That being the case, how could they withstand Ling Han’s kingly might, a might that used heavenly tribulation as its foundation?
