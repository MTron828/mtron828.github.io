Chapter 2007: Not weak!

Ji Wuming was still dressed completely in white, elegant and untouched by mortal affairs.

“This time... none of you will be able to escape!” A vicious light shone from Ji Wuming’s eyes. He desperately longed for all their bloodlines, and yearned even more to obtain Ling Han’s treasure.

For a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to have thought about something for so long without completing it was an inconceivable matter.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Then let’s have a battle!”

Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared sky-high. Ji Wuming was the first opponent of the same cultivation level that Ling Han had faced multiple times without being able to win. This caused a sense of obstinacy in him, wanting to surpass, surpass, and surpass.

Xiu, Ling Han took the initiative to charge out. Endless Regulations rippled out, and he sent out a palm strike, shaking the Nine Heavens.

“Ignorant!” Ji Wuming scoffed, and flicked out a finger. The sharpness and violence of Regulation of Slaughter exploded, and there was a streak of Regulation of Metal embedded within as well, as if nothing could not be sliced, nothing could not be shattered, and nothing could not be destroyed.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged strikes once. Suddenly, shockingly massive waves were brought forth on the great ocean, and Regulations of the Great Dao were rolling in them. If smacked by the waves, it was probable that ordinary fourth severances would be directly knocked unconscious.

The splashes descended, and Ling Han and Ji Wuming faced each other 300 meters apart, making no further moves.

A wave of peril surged up in Ji Wuming’s heart. Though it was still he who had the upper hand in that clash previously, the advantage was no longer so obvious.

‘How is this possible?!’

It should be known that he had broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier with a purple grade Yang Soul Stone. Though it was a fused one, and not a natural one, aside from reincarnated Celestial Kings like himself, who else could gain enough indigo grade Yang Soul Stones to fuse into a purple grade one?

But the gap between him and Ling Han had only shrunk down a little, and there was only one possibility for that.

The latter had used a natural purple grade Yang Soul Stone to break through to the Dividing Soul Tier.

Gasp!

For the first time, Ji Wuming looked serious. He looked at Ling Han for a while, and then suddenly broke into a smile, and said, “I understand. It is because of that treasure. Not bad, not bad, to actually allow trash to surpass me in a certain aspect. As expected of a precious treasure!”

He was very rueful. He was a noble Ninth Heaven Celestial King who had experienced who knew how many epochs, and above him were only Heavenly Venerates that could be counted on one hand. He had reincarnated and begun cultivation from the very beginning again. Then, he should attain perfection the whole way through, and no one would be able to surpass him.

Yet Ling Han had managed to do so.

A Heavenly Venerable Tier precious treasure, it was indeed a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious treasure.

“I’ll take it!” Ji Wuming shouted lightly, and launched a fierce offensive.

“Just because you said you’ll take it, you will? Who do you think you are?” Ling Han asked coldly. His hands balled into fists, and proceeded to counter without the slightest show of weakness.

In battle prowess, there was indeed still some gap between himself and Ji Wuming, but in terms of physique, Ling Han was much too superior, and he was completely capable of matching the latter.

Weng, Ji Wuming decisively released his divided soul, and Ling Han also summoned the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul. The two great monarch tiers’ four figures clashed, and like lightning travelling back and forth, they used all that they could.

“Huh?!”

Ji Wuming was once again surprised. “A piece of trash like you is actually aware that you should split out a Source Power as your divided soul?”

“Apologies, I shocked you!” Ling Han swiped out a finger, and the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords was used, each strike fiercer than the last.

“Wicked mouth!” Ji Wuming stated calmly. Even if Ling Han’s strength had caught up with his rapidly, Ji Wuming was still the one who had the initiative.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them clashed fiercely. Though Ling Han still had a slight disadvantage, it was no longer very obvious. Added with his physique that was not just a bit stronger, it was enough for him to make up for the shortcoming in his battle prowess, and truly possess the ability to pose a threat to Ji Wuming.

Ji Wuming’s expression was slightly solemn. In his last life, he had experienced who knew how many battles. In fact, he had even slaughtered Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings before, and there was nothing else in this world that could move him.

He only felt that this was slightly intractable. If he could not kill Ling Han, how was he supposed to snatch the treasure the latter possessed.

Ling Han, too, began to gradually understand.

He finally knew just why Ji Wuming was so strong. Firstly, the latter was more detailed in his use of Regulations. Ling Han had been able to distinguish this fact since long ago, but if he himself were to reach this kind of height, he could only depend on a slow buildup of experience over time.

Secondly, Ji Wuming had grasped more Regulations, and could agilely use them in unison. Thus, the battle prowess that he could show was stronger.

Since he had been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, then naturally he had grasped a great dao to its pinnacle to have been able to attain this kind of height. But Celestial Kings truly had an unlimited lifespan, and when they had reached the Ninth Heaven, where there was no further space to advance, what were they to do?

Naturally to go and cultivate other Regulations!

Over an endless stretch of time, even an idiot would be able to grasp some, what more when such naturally gifted extraordinary prodigies the likes of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Perhaps Ji Wuming had grasped all the Regulations there were. Even if not all of them had reached the level of Ninth Heaven, it should not be difficult for them to reach the level of Celestial King Tier.

What did that mean? The other party’s body possessed all the Source Powers of heaven and earth. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Hence, Ji Wuming was incredibly powerful in this lifetime.

Celestials clashed in terms of Regulations. If both sides had the same cultivation level, and the other party had grasp of more Regulations, the latter naturally was stronger.

This was a matter of course.

Ling Han suddenly had an enlightenment. To truly surpass Ji Wuming, he had to exert more effort in terms of Regulations, and grasp even more Regulations of the Great Dao. Only then would he be able to match and surpass the other man.

It was at this instant that Ling Han had complete confidence that Ji Wuming was not someone that could not be surpassed.

There absolutely was a possibility.

He laughed, his fighting spirit blazed. Six arms spread out, sword, fist, palm strike used all at the same time, their might astonishing.

“Mere party tricks!” Ji Wuming smirked coldly, and similarly used various celestial techniques, battling with Ling Han.

The two super monarch tiers clashed, both completely releasing their full strength, captivating the spectators’ hearts uncontrollably.

How could they be so powerful?

This was a question that popped up in everyone’s hearts. Even those that had successfully broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier felt an impulse to kneel down in worship. There really were prodigies that could drive others to hopeless despair in this world.

Battle, battle, battle. Ling Han was slowly turning his disadvantage around.

Firstly, his physique was too strong. It was fine even if he got hit a few times, but if Ji Wuming was hit, that was true damage. Once the number of times he took hits increased, and the time stretched out, it would definitely affect his battle prowess.

Secondly, Ling Han’s use of Regulations was becoming more and more proficient.

For a battle prodigy like himself, the stronger the opponent he encountered, the more it could force out his potential, and the rate of his growth would be astonishingly quick.

Boom!

In an intense clash, Ji Wuming withdrew himself and retreated. He stared at Ling Han for a while, and said, “I have to admit that the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll is indeed the strongest technique to temper the physique in this world.”

Ling Han felt his mind jolt wildly. Though he had long since guessed that Ji Wuming was perhaps aware of the origins of the Black Tower, that was only a guess, after all. Now, hearing the latter actually speak it out, his heart had still clenched.

Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, this was the first time he had heard an outsider say these words.

Ji Wuming broke into a smile, and said, “I can do nothing to your defense at present. However, I will bring a Celestial Tool that would be able to easily penetrate your physique. Brat, protect yourself well. Everything that you possess belongs to me.”

“Hahahaha!” Ji Wuming laughed madly, and strode off.

The final words were very ambiguous, but Ling Han did not have the slightest intention to dispute them.

The next time they met, he would become even stronger, and even in terms of battle prowess, he would be able to suppress Ji Wuming.

“Definitely!”
