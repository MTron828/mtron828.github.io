Chapter 2562: Poisonous Spider

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Oh, you don’t think much of him?” Tang Yuan asked in retort.

This youth was sitting in the same row as Tang Yuan. Meanwhile, Luo Yang and the others were sitting in the row behind them. It was clear that this youth enjoyed a similar status to Tang Yuan’s.

He was called Zhao Shuang, and he was also the son of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Otherwise, he naturally wouldn’t have the right to sit next to Tang Yuan.

He flicked his gaze between Ling Han and Ebony before saying, “Even though Ebony is also at the Third Heaven, he’s a monarch tier on top of that. It’s just that he failed to pass the Nine Deaths Formation of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. However, his strength can’t be underestimated.

“Moreover, he also has a weapon from the Technology Realm, the insanely powerful Demonic Saw. It’s because of this that he was able to kill a disciple of the martial academy. However, it was because they didn’t want to enrage the Heavenly Venerate of that realm that they banished him here.

“However, your pet is completely unremarkable. As such, how can he rival Ebony?”

Tang Yuan roared with laughter, and said, “Why don’t we make a bet?”

“Using what?” Zhao Shuang asked. He didn’t back down.

“We’ll wager… three Brahman Celestial Flowers!” Tang Yuan said after pondering for a brief moment.

Zhao Shuang’s eyes instantly lit up. “Tang Yuan, you’re that confident?”

Brahman Celestial Flowers were incredibly valuable. Even though Tang Yuan could produce some, he would definitely feel pained for some time. In fact, he had already lost a huge sum when his Blood Martial King had lost a while ago.

He was already a poor sod, yet he still dared to make such a large wager?

He was that confident?

However, after glancing at Ling Han again, Zhao Shuang smiled, and said, “Deal!” He couldn’t see any redeeming features in Ling Han at all. He simply thought that Tang Yuan was desperately trying to save face.

Tang Yuan laughed loudly, and said in a calm voice, “This Li Long… is a disciple of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy!”

“What?!” Zhao Shuang exclaimed in astonishment. Being able to enter the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, Ling Han was at least a monarch tier. Moreover, he was definitely an elite among monarch tiers. After all, not all monarch tiers could pass the Nine Deaths Formation. Ebony was the best example of this.

However, after some further thought, Zhao Shuang immediately calmed down. What did it matter that Ling Han was a disciple of the martial academy? Ebony had already killed one!

However, Tang Yuan wore a wide smile as he continued, “Do you know? This person was banished here because he killed a disciple of the martial academy.”

Zhao Shuang was astonished again. Ling Han had also killed a disciple of the martial academy?

He couldn’t help but ask, “How do you know?”

Tang Yuan was extremely smug as he replied, “He only entered the Celestial King Graveyard a few days ago, and when entered the city, he was coincidentally encountered by Xiang Jun’s father. After receiving this news, I hurriedly invited him over.”

Zhao Shuang gritted his teeth, and said, “Xiang Ming is your father’s subordinate! I actually didn’t receive any news of this at all! As it turns out, this news was suppressed by Xiang Ming!”

Tang Yuan roared with laughter. There were over 20 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in Ghost King City, and even though the Azure Ghost Celestial King was the leader, each person had their own personal interests. Thus, it was inevitable that there would be schemes and trickery, conflict and robbery.

“What’s so funny?” a seductive voice suddenly said. They looked over, only to see a woman in black walking over. She was wearing a dress, yet not only were her jade-like arms revealed, but even a large portion of her breasts were exposed. Their voluptuous shape was extremely clear.

Her dress was only knee-length as well, revealing her pale lower legs. She wasn’t wearing shoes, and her dainty pale and jade-like feet were exposed for all to see. Her toenails were painted pink, and it was as if they were blooming flowers. They were incredibly alluring.

Her hair was silken and raven black, yet her lips were as red as scorching flames. Her nose was straight and tall, and her eyes carried a faint hint of green. She radiated with a wild allure.

A lustful expression involuntarily appeared on Tang Yuan’s and Zhao Shuang’s face when they saw this woman. However, there was more so a sense of apprehension. They didn’t dare to stare at her voluptuous breasts and shapely bottom at all, and they were both as well-behaved as could be.

This was because this seductive and alluring woman was called Yang Xiaoling. Her father was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and she was also a Fourth Heaven Celestial King herself.

If this was all, these two young masters naturally wouldn’t have been so apprehensive of her. However, this woman was a poisonous spider who liked to toy with men. This wasn’t normal toying, but toying with them until they were broken, crippled, and dead.

Even though Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang enjoyed beautiful women, they only dared to salivate over this woman. They didn’t dare to touch her at all.

“Sister Ling,” they said in unison. In Ghost King City, there were three second-generation young masters who clearly enjoyed a superior status. Yang Xiaoling was one of them.

Yang Xiaoling swayed her hips as she walked over. There were 10 bare-chested men following behind her, each of them tall and muscular. There were ribbons of iridescent light around them, ranging from one to two.

These were all her gigolos. She had never shied away from letting others know that she had such a hobby and needs.

“That brat is your new pet?” Yang Xiaoling asked as she sat down. She pointed at Ling Han with her slender finger.

“That’s right,” Tang Yuan replied obediently. Even though Yang Xiaoling couldn’t kill him, she could indeed give him a good beating. His father wouldn’t cause a huge commotion with the Yang Clan because of this.

Generally speaking, as long as they didn’t take things too far, their parents wouldn’t interfere with their skirmishes.

Yang Xiaoling licked her slightly full lips, causing them to become even more lush and reflective. There was a sense of intoxication and unrestrainedness about them. “If this brat obtains the title of Blood Martial King, let me play with him for a few days.”

“It’s his honor that Sister Ling has taken a fancy to him,” Tang Yuan hurriedly said. Yang Xiaoling had already spoken, so even if she broke or killed Ling Han, he still wouldn’t dare to make a single peep.

“Then let’s enjoy the show. Here’s hoping that he’s more than just his handsome appearance,” Yang Xiaoling said.

Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang exchanged a glance, with both mumbling in their minds. What was the use of being handsome? Men had to be powerful; they had to be influential. These were the fundamentals.

In the arena, Ling Han stood 30 meters away from Ebony. This was because the commentator was still babbling away to increase the excitement of the spectators.

“Shut up! Or else I’ll kill you first!” Ebony suddenly roared at the commentator.

Boom!

The spectators weren’t frightened by this threat, and they instead became even more fervent with excitement.

It was this kind of lawless and audacious person that they needed. They wanted to witness a bloody and brutal battle.

The commentator was terrified by Ebony’s bloodshot glare. This was a glare flickering with killing intent. He didn’t dare to test Ebony’s patience. This was because human life was worth nothing in this place. Even Celestial Kings were treated as nothing.

“Then let the battle begin!” he shouted.

“Haha, pretty boy, I’ll stomp your face into mincemeat and then thrust my Demonic Saw into your a*s!” Ebony said as he retrieved a saw. After activating it, the blades of the saw instantly started to spin at a high speed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han was astonished. This was because the saw didn’t glow with any symbols. However, it still radiated with might.

This wasn’t a Celestial Tool. He immediately realized this.

Instead, it was a product of the Technology Realm. It wasn’t a Celestial Tool, yet it could rival the might of a Celestial Tool.

This thought flashed through Ling Han’s mind. However, what did this matter? With his absolute strength, he could end this battle with a single punch.

“Die, pretty boy!” Ebony roared as he swung his Demonic Saw. He charged at Ling Han, and with a single step, he already appeared before him. His saw blade spun wildly, emitting an ear-piercing shriek.
