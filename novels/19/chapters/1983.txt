Chapter 1984: Envoy from Western Celestial Realm

“Master, wasn’t the Three Lives Pill lost?” Ling Han asked.

This was the largest problem. Since the pill recipe had already been lost, how was it to be practiced then, what more successfully concocting the alchemical pill.

“Indeed.” Alchemist Zi Cheng nodded. “This pill recipe has been lost for a very long time, but I recently found it again. Hahahaha.”

The old geezer was laughing very happily. For a great alchemist, gaining a lost pill recipe was like he had earned a profit of several hundred million Star Stones.

“Congratulations, Master,” Ling Han said smilingly, feeling happy for his master.

Alchemist Zi Cheng continued, “However, this was not due to me, but rather a fellow alchemist that has come from the Western Celestial Realm, and bestowed this as a gift to Alchemy City.”

“Oh, the Western Celestial Realm?” Ling Han appeared to be slightly surprised. Aside from Hu Niu, this was his first time hearing of someone from the Western Celestial Realm.

“As expected of the Western Celestial Realm. Not only does their overall level of cultivation surpass that of the Eastern Celestial Realm, they rank above us even in alchemy.” Alchemist Zi Cheng felt quite rueful. “A simple gift from them already included three lost pill recipes, and I really couldn’t bring myself to refuse.”

“Refuse what?” Ling Han asked.

“They did not give them for nothing, but rather wished to trade them for a pill recipe,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said smilingly. “Three in exchange for one. It is impossible to refuse this kind of business deal.”

As expected, the old geezer was in essence still a businessman.

“Master has thoroughly grasped the pill recipe?” Ling Han felt that this was a little strange. To say nothing of a Four-Star pill recipe, even grasping a One-Star pill recipe would need a very long amount of time, and Alchemist Zi Cheng should have just obtained this pill recipe not too long ago.

“Close to it. As for the other issues, I’ll make improvements as I go.” Alchemist Zi Cheng waved a hand dismissively, appearing completely unconcerned.

Goodness, every failure would mean wasting a large amount of valuable ingredients, and this was enough to cause a Three-Star Alchemist tremendous heartache, but the old geezer was completely uncaring.

As expected of a rich guy.

Ling Han nodded. Earning money was natural for the purpose of spending. Otherwise, if he was a miser that was unwilling to part with the slightest amount, what was the point of living?

“You come and assist me,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said.

The master and disciple began their pill concoction. Ling Han was helping primarily for the sake of studying Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s techniques. After all, he was presently a Three-Star Alchemist as well, and had reached the Fourth Refinement. This was also why Grandmaster Zi Cheng was determined to begin despite not having complete certainty of success.

It was not that he was so rich that he had money to burn, but primarily for the sake of setting an example, and providing guidance for Ling Han.

Ling Han did not need to learn Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s techniques. What he needed was inspiration to create his own sparks.

After a year, the master and disciple finally stopped, and under time acceleration effects of 100 times, 100 years had already passed.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng was still not sure of successfully concocting the Three Lives Pill, but Ling Han had gained much benefit. This did not allow him to advance into the Fifth Refinement, but his accomplishment at the Fourth Refinement had improved considerably, and advanced into the level of perfection. This meant that he was considerably closer to the threshold of the Fifth Refinement.

“Right, there’s another matter,” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said. “After another 50 years, there will be a gathering hosted by the Western Celestial Realm—a gathering of alchemists. I have decided to send you, firstly because you are my disciple, and secondly because you are also the future chairperson of Alchemy City, so you should go to the Western Celestial Realm and take a look.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Just fine. I’ll use this time to break through to the Dividing Soul Tier first.”

“En, the opening of the Yang Soul Ocean is close at hand, and that envoy from the Western Celestial Realm just happened to want to break through to Dividing Soul Tier as well, and that was why he was deliberately sent on this trip. Otherwise, if he were to wait for the Yang Soul Ocean closest to the Western Celestial Realm to open up, it would need 700,000 years,” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said.

Ling Han gave an “oh”, and said, “Master, who is this envoy?”

“A young man called Ma Tongguang, but he has cultivated for 900,000 years, and is already a Three-Star Alchemist, which is very extraordinary,” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said, showing a sliver of admiration. “As expected of a prodigy nurtured by the Western Celestial Realm.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but nod as well. If the time spent in the Time Cultivation Chamber was taken into account, his age was not too small, either.

A 900,000-year-old Three-Star Alchemist, and one that was about to break through to the Dividing Soul Tier at that, was indeed very amazing.

“Go and meet him.” Grandmaster Zi Cheng looked at his beloved disciple cheerfully. This disciple really had not disappointed him. Whether it was cultivation or alchemy, he was not inferior to a prodigy of the Western Celestial Realm, which made him feel sincerely gratified.

Ling Han nodded, and after bidding Grandmaster Zi Cheng farewell, he went to the manor for honoured guests situated on the fourth level. This place was specifically used for the purpose of entertaining mighty figures of the Ascending Origin Tier and above. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ma Tongguang’s cultivation level was indeed not enough, but he was presently the alchemy representative of the Western Celestial Realm, so he was qualified to reside in the manor for honored guests on the fourth level.

The moment Ling Han entered, he discovered that this was a very lively place.

Goodness, it was filled with an ocean of faces, and was close to bursting at the seams.

“Holy Son, Lord Holy Son!” When they saw Ling Han, those at the sidelines were first surprised, and then paid their respectful greetings in a hurry.

Though Ling Han was already certain to be the future chairperson of Alchemy City, as long as Grandmaster Zi Cheng had not abdicated, Ling Han was still only the Holy Son. However, there were 10 Holy Sons previously, and now Ling Han was the sole heir.

Who could be disrespectful when they saw the future chairperson.

In truth, there were a considerable number of people in Alchemy City that wanted to curry favor with Ling Han, but the latter would either be concocting alchemical pills, or would be out on training trips, so they did not even have a chance.

Ling Han nodded, and smilingly said, “Is everyone lining up here to wait for the summons of that Ma Tongguang?”

“This...” That person immediately flushed, appearing to be stuttering.

Just like Ling Han had said, everyone had really come here because they wanted to be summoned by Ma Tongguang, and their purpose was naturally to form affable relations with Ma Tongguang.

That person was the envoy of the Western Celestial Realm, and a prodigy of alchemy at that. If they could gain his favor, and he was willing to make introductions for them, they would be able to go to the Western Celestial Realm and develop further in future.

...The overall level of cultivation of the Western Celestial Realm was clearly much higher than the Eastern Celestial Realm’s.

It could be said that if you could cultivate to the Severing Mundane Tier in the Eastern Celestial Realm, then you would have 30% higher chances of breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier in the Western Celestial Realm.

Thus, for a brighter future, everyone had come here to form connections with Ma Tongguang.

“Holy Son!”

“Holy Son!”

The others had spotted Ling Han as well, and hurriedly paid their greetings to him, feeling slightly embarrassed.

This was natural. The future chairperson was in front of them, yet they were fawning on an outsider, so their faces were flushed with shame.

“Grass is greener on the side of the Western Celestial Realm,” Ling Han stated smilingly, and these words caused a considerable number to lower their heads, but there were some that were still unconcerned. As the saying went, it was in man’s nature to strive for better, so wasn’t this very normal?

After Ling Han said these words, he strode forwards, and the crowd separated. At present, in Alchemy City, there were only the three Four-Star grandmasters that had higher status than Ling Han.

“Holy Son Ling!” When he arrived in front of Ma Tongguang’s courtyard, he was stopped from going further at the entrance.

Lu Xianming!

He looked at Ling Han with a smile, but there was a sliver of mockery in his eyes. “Are you here to see Young Master Ma? Please wait here then, and allow me to announce your presence.”

He looked completely like a vile character that had gotten into a position of power, becoming conceited and arrogant.
