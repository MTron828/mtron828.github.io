Ling Han studied the veins in the lava for a while, and after he discovered he was close to his limits in maintaining the channeling of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he flew out, and then witnessed how Zhang Tianyan was presently hunting down the Empress.

This naturally filled him with extreme fury. He immediately flashed out, and attacked Zhang Tianyan.

“En?” Zhang Tianyan was slightly startled. He had not thought that the brat would actually be hiding inside the lava.

This lava pool was very frightening. The Regulations of Lightning and Fire were flowing within, and even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would not deliberately run in. There were no benefits to be gained, so it would simply be a waste of their own power.

‘What did you, a mere Fifth Heaven, run in there for?’

“I will beat you till you burst!” Without saying anything else, Ling Han directly charged over, his hands clenched into fists, with Regulations wrapped around them. He burst out with his full power, having Regulations wrapped around his fists, and activating his Body Art as well. He also had two Heavenly Venerate Techniques which boundlessly boosted his battle prowess.

This naturally made his attack incredibly violent. As he threw a punch, it was as if he was a True Dragon in human form, exuding an incomparably formidable and terrifying aura.

At first, Zhang Tianyan had considered Ling Han below his notice. The latter was only a mere Fifth Heaven Celestial King, and did not have a Celestial Tool, either; what need was there for Zhang Tianyan to take Ling Han seriously? But when Ling Han attacked, Zhang Tianyan was immediately stunned. This battle prowess was strong enough to compare to the early, no, middle stage of the Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier!

This was really crazy. Without any external factors, a Fifth Heaven Celestial King was actually capable of unleashing battle prowess of a middle stage of the Eighth Heaven Celestial King. Was he going to defy the heavens?

Going by that accounting, once this brat reached Sixth Heaven, wouldn’t he then be able to stand at the pinnacle of the Celestial King Tier, and stand equal to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

This couple was really too extraordinary!

No wonder they dared to train here. They probably had a Heavenly Venerate backing them, right?

However, this was the Celestial King Graveyard. A Heavenly Venerate would definitely not set foot here. This was a common agreement that all the Heavenly Venerates had agreed upon. Even if Zhang Tianyan killed Ling Han, he would have nothing to fear. There would definitely be no Heavenly Venerate that would enter this place to hunt him down.

“Do you think I am afraid of you?” Zhang Tianyan smirked coldly. He was a late-stage Eighth Heaven Celestial King. Though it was only slightly stronger than Ling Han, that was already enough.

He also charged towards Ling Han, his hands slashing downwards. He was like a True Dragon, like a terrifying beast from the Primitive Age.

Ling Han laughed loudly, meeting the attack with both fists ready.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two great elites clashed. After the exchange of every single punch, shock waves would reverberate, and it was as if even the heavens would be collapsing at any moment.

After exchanging over a dozen blows in a single stroke, Zhang Tianyan couldn’t help but feel shocked.

As expected, he indeed had the upper hand in terms of power, but Ling Han’s physique was too frightening. Though the latter would be sent sliding backwards with every exchange, the vitality in his body was still burning brightly, without any sign of chaos at all.

If this was another person, even if it was really a middle-stage Eighth Heaven Celestial King, their vitality would definitely be stirred up in this kind of exchange, their battle prowess deteriorating. In fact, it was not impossible that they would even be directly sent flopping onto the ground from the impact.

For Ling Han, who was clearly at a disadvantage, but still had no loss to his battle prowess, this was too inconceivable.

How could there be someone like this?

Ling Han seethed with fury, raining down punches. “Damn old geezer, you actually dare hurt my wife! I am going to beat you into mush!”

Zhang Tianyan felt depressed. He had not wanted to hurt the Empress. He only wanted to capture her. Furthermore, a Fifth Heaven Celestial King actually declared that he was going to beat him till he burst. How could he endure such humiliation?

“Brat, you are too arrogant!” He was the first to change his tactic. With a shake of his right hand, a small golden tower appeared in his hand. The moment it appeared, it began spinning, and floated into the air above his head.

The golden tower cascaded down precious Qi. It could be seen that every streak of Qi was extremely heavy, suppressing even Regulations.

This was not a Celestial Tool, but the materials used to forge it were also extraordinary. Furthermore, Zhang Tianyan had used his cultivation level of the Eighth Heaven to temper it constantly, so its might was truly no trivial thing. It could be claimed that not only was it not weaker than himself, it was even that slight bit stronger at that.

“Die!” Against Ling Han, Zhang Tianyan did not have the slightest bit of reservations. Ling Han had been a target that he wanted to kill in the first place. He threw a punch, and as his power combined with the precious Qi of the golden tower, the might was greatly magnified.

Ling Han roared loudly, and still responded with a fist.

Peng!

This time, Ling Han was far from being a match for his opponent. He was sent flying with a single punch, and cracks rang out from all the bones of his body. If it were not for the fact that his physique was extremely strong, a great many of his bones would probably have broken from this one blow.

“You can’t even withstand a single blow!” Zhang Tianyan sneered. He was completely unconcerned that he had already drawn his precious tool, while Ling Han was still fighting with bare fists.

A loss was a loss, and a victory was a victory. Anything else was just mere excuses.

With a loud battle cry, he took the chance to follow up on his attack.

Ling Han wiped the corner of his mouth. He knew that the gap in cultivation level was ultimately too wide. When he was using his bare fists, he would also only be able to match an Eighth Heaven Celestial King that was unarmed. Once the latter drew his precious tool, and he was still in the same circumstances, his disadvantage would be too great.

“Old geezer, you are asking for your own suffering?” Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword. Cold light flashed, and it was as if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had appeared, exuding a harsh air of dominance over all.

After devouring an adequate amount of Divine Metal, even if the Divine Demon Sword had not reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier, it still far surpassed the level of Divine Metal. At least it could already compare to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in terms of intimidation.

“En?” Zhang Tianyan was stunned. This was yet another Celestial Tool!

F***, how lavish.

He was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, but he had only ever seen Celestial Tools himself even now, but this couple were only in the Fifth Heaven, yet both of them had a Celestial Tool in hand. In comparison, he, an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, was really too poor.

People who had come from outside were indeed different. They had a Heavenly Venerate backing them, and even Celestial Tools were things that they could easily gain.

“I will kill you!” Ling Han wielded the sword and moved, slashing madly at Zhang Tianyan.

“You think you are capable?” Zhang Tianyan almost died of fury. It should be known that he had come to kill these two outsiders who had come here to train. He drew on the precious Qi of the golden tower, and threw a punch. The force of the attack turned into a golden battle wolf that pounced towards Ling Han.

He was wary about the might of the Celestial Tool, and did not dare to battle in close quarters.

Pu!

Ling Han’s sword swept out, and that golden battle wolf was instantly slashed in half. Faced with the terrifying destructive power of the Divine Demon Sword, it was impossible that the golden battle wolf would have any chance to attack again. It was directly destroyed.

Zhang Tianyan was astounded. It was not that he had never exchanged blows with a Celestial Tool before, but while the Celestial Tool in the Empress’s hands was still powerful, it had not had might like this.

Ling Han attacked aggressively. With a wave of his left hand, the Lightning of Water and Wood was unleashed, turning into a spear of lightning that was smashed towards Zhang Tianyan.

Ling Han had long since channeled the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. Though it had not reached the greatest boosting effect, with three parts fused into one, this might was already considerably great. The lightning spear shot out fiercely, and the Divine Sword danced. He had completely taken the initiative in this battle.

Zhang Tianyan was helpless. His world-shaking strength was useless here as he did not dare to fight a power battle against Ling Han. Even if he was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, definitely nothing good would happen if he tried a power battle with a Celestial Tool.

Just think, a great Eighth Heaven Celestial King was actually being suppressed by a Fifth Heaven Celestial King. This was very inconceivable, yet it was truly and genuinely playing out now.

“Damn it! Damn it!” Zhang Tianyan cursed. He had completely not foreseen this before he made his move. This couple’s strength was really too great, especially in the case of Ling Han. He was so strong that it went beyond logic.

“You actually dare to use a tower-shaped precious tool. That is even more of a reason that I cannot spare you!” Ling Han’s eyes swept over the golden tower above Zhang Tianyan’s head, his killing intent blazing even hotter.

Though the Black Tower had already been snatched by Heavenborn, Ling Han was still heavily influenced by it. What he hated the most were tower-shaped precious tools.

Zhang Tianyan felt like he didn’t know what to say here. ‘F***, have I caused you any trouble just by forging my precious tool in the shape of a tower?’
