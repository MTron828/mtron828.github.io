Chapter 2535: Xiao Yingxiong’s invitation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Clever,” Xiao Yingxiong complimented. “There is indeed something I wish to discuss with you.”

Ling Han was surprised. What could there be to discuss between him and Xiao Yingxiong?

He pondered for a moment, and then said, “Please go on.”

“Myself and a few others have discovered a historical site from the Primitive Age, and hope that you can join us to explore it,” Xiao Yingxiong said solemnly.

Ling Han gave an oh. “With something as good as that, you would actually think of me?”

Not only were he and Xiao Yingxiong not friends, they were instead rivals in love. Of course, this was only Xiao Yingxiong’s one-sided opinion. If there was anything good like exploring a historical site, how could he possibly take Ling Han into consideration?

Xiao Yingxiong humphed. “If it was not necessary, there is absolutely no way you could get such a great opportunity for nothing like this! That is because the key to opening the historical site requires the lifeblood of a great many supreme monarch stars whose Evolution Index has reached 11. At present, we do not have enough numbers yet.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but think if these words were truth or lie, if this was a fatal trap that was laid out for him.

It should be known that once they left the martial academy, there would not be any Heavenly Venerates guarding them any further.

“I need more information about this historical site,” Ling Han said.

“Take it.” Xiao Yingxiong tossed over a jade seal. “I knew you would have this kind of request. Take it and study it. Three days later, I will come find you again.”

Ling Han took the jade seal. Xiao Yingxiong turned around and left, without the slightest bit of hesitation.

Smiling, Ling Han also exited the great formation, just happening to catch sight of Xiao Yingxiong flying off. The spectators were all confused. Who had won or lost this battle? Why had it finished so quickly?

Ling Han returned to the abode, and shared the information inside the jade seal with the Empress.

The information was very detailed.

This historical site had once belonged to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. It was rumored that he had died because he had failed to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Thus, it was possible that this historical site contained the personal insight of this Celestial King.

They wanted to obtain and study it, and that could help them to avoid a few wrong turns.

Though Xiao Yingxiong was a supreme monarch star whose Evolution Index was as high as 11, he still did not have absolute confidence that he would definitely become a Heavenly Venerate.

Though Heavenly Venerates would never die throughout the ages, a single dimension would only have 10 or over a dozen of them. Their numbers were shockingly low.

Could it be that there were few prodigies that had emerged throughout history, and there was a lack of supreme monarch stars?

No, there were many of them. But becoming a Heavenly Venerate was really much too difficult. It was extremely possible for even a supreme monarch star to fail, and all his cultivation would thus turn into nothing.

An example of failure could possibly be more valuable than a case of success.

Hence, even a supreme monarch star like Xiao Yingxiong was tempted and anxious to obtain this insight.

Ling Han’s heart jolted as well. It was one thing for him to be confident in himself, but the facts were another story altogether.

“We should explore it,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded. “There would not only be the insight of this Celestial King in breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. A person who had been qualified to take this step would definitely be one of the strongest among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. His treasures should be extremely amazing.”

“Call the large black dog too. This guy is a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.”

“Wally too.”

There was no need to get the others. If even the large black dog could not deal with it, then even the combined forces of Ling Huo and the others would be useless.

Ling Han went to inform the large black dog. This damn dog immediately agreed happily. He very much wanted to get a look at the insight of a Celestial King breaking through into the Heavenly Venerable Tier as well, especially of one that had failed. That was because every Heavenly Venerate that had succeeded had created their own path, so there wasn’t much reference value, but a case of failure could be studied, which would allow them to avoid making the same mistakes.

Wally had never been proactive about this kind of thing, but did not refuse, either. In any case, no matter what state he was in, he could still refine the Dimension Scroll.

Now that he had gotten these two great helpers in place, Ling Han naturally felt steady.

Three days later, Xiao Yingxiong arrived quietly. After a conversation with Ling Han, he left in satisfaction because he received the response that he had hoped for. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Another month later, Xiao Yingxiong sent someone to tell Ling Han that everyone had gathered, and they would be setting out at dawn the next day.

Ling Han, the Empress, the large black dog, and Wally all arrived at the designated location. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou stayed behind in the martial academy. Her strength was not enough, so it was best that she stayed behind to continue cultivating in the martial academy. Little Terror had also stayed behind as protection for her.

Of course, Ling Han had also left behind his Spatial Celestial Tool. All the women would improve much faster if they cultivated inside the martial academy.

There were many who came. Ji Wuming, Huo Furong… as well as a great many that Ling Han did not recognize. They should all be disciples of this term, though they came from different realms.

The Rain Emperor, Shi Chanzi, Jia Lan, and the others were not qualified. They were all monarch stars, but they were not supreme monarch stars, so their Evolution Index was only 10, which did not qualify them to be part of this expedition.

Xiao Yingxiong, Gu Heyi, and Miao Hua were all beings above the level of a monarch star.

When he saw the large black dog, Miao Hua immediately humphed coldly. “No pets allowed!”

“Pet your sister, your whole family are pets!” the large black dog immediately pounced out, pushing Miao Hua into the ground. “That brat is the pet here, understood?”

The large black dog had always been mean. He was clearly a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, yet had never revealed anything of himself. This show of might immediately let everyone know just how incredibly powerful his battle prowess was.

“So it was a senior. Please forgive us juniors for the rudeness!” Gu Heyi immediately played mediator.

The large black dog spat at Miao Hua, and only then did he release his paw.

Miao Hua almost died with fury. He was a supreme monarch star, but someone, no, a dog actually spat at his face!

But the large black dog’s strength was superior to his by who knew how far, so he could only glare helplessly. He swore secretly that when his cultivation level had caught up with the large black dog’s, he would definitely get his revenge for this misdeed.

Xiao Yingxiong and Gu Heyi exchanged a look, both of them frowning slightly.

Though they had invited Ling Han, they had not borne him any good intentions. They had planned to kill him in the historical site.

However, now that there was this large black dog whose strength was unfathomable, they felt that this was a troublesome matter. It would not be easy for them to make a move.

“Has everyone arrived?” a supreme monarch star asked. He was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, and was not a local of the Flaming Frost Realm. His name was Liu Hao, and he had arrived at the martial academy long ago, over more than three billion years ago.

“We’re missing one other,” Gu Heyi said.

“Who is it?” another person asked. His name was Luo Yangqiu, and he, too, was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King.

“Haha, am I late?” With a loud shout, a frightening aura surged out. A Celestial King flew over from afar, his whole body exuding a terrifying aura, with nine streaks of peculiar light wrapped around him.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed; it was the Imperial Void!

Ling Han had an absolutely antagonistic relationship with the line of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerate, and had prior enmity with the Imperial Void, who had repeatedly targeted him and coveted his secrets.

Why was this old geezer here?

Very simple; the Imperial Void Celestial King was also presently preparing to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Then, the failed example of another Celestial King would have great value as reference for him. In fact, he had greater need of it than Ling Han and his group because he was about to make the breach into the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and he had to be extremely cautious.

“Senior!” A Ninth Heaven Celestial King had appeared, and even if all of them were supreme monarch stars, they had no choice but to bow in greeting.

The Imperial Void Celestial King smiled. “No need for such formalities.”

Though he had an advantage in cultivation level at present, if he did not break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, the people that were here now would soon be able to catch up to him in cultivation level, and it was possible that they would even surpass him because the step into the threshold of the Heavenly Venerable Tier was really too hard to take. Just look—how long had he been stuck in the Ninth Heaven of the Celestial King Tier?
