Chapter 2324 Fierce battle with You Yuan

The present You Yuan did not have the calm and dashing appearance he had previously had, but rather looked more like a refugee. His clothes were torn and ripped, and if it was not for the fact that he had an astonishing aura, Ling Han would really think that someone had impersonated him.

Ling Han chuckled. “What is it, my obedient son? Fallen to the streets, and compelled to sell yourself?”

“You are still speaking cheekily now, but it is not the slightest bit beneficial to you,” You Yuan said menacingly. He had been evading the pursuit of those five Ninth Lotus elites all these years, but the reason why a Monarch Star was a Monarch Star was naturally because he had steadfast determination and willpower. Thus, not only did this kind of pursuit not drive him to despair, it instead caused his fighting spirits to soar even higher.

He was sure that he would be able to perfect his cultivation of the Eighth Lotus not too long afterwards, and then advance into Ninth Lotus.

Those five people were only grinding stones that made him stronger. Of course, he was actually also very depressed, having become the scapegoat for someone else for no reason. He released his own aura, and the might of the Eleventh Leaf surged out, as if he was a divine overlord.

Ling Han was surprised, and said, “I had not thought that you would have actually advanced into the Eleventh Leaf. No wonder you became so confident all of a sudden. Oh, you were the one who had used that bottle of Ancestral King blood?”

You Yuan’s expression changed slightly as Ling Han had hit the nail on the head.

“Something that is everyone’s property has instead been used by you alone. You are a truly selfish person,” Ling Han stated calmly.

“What do you know!” You Yuan scoffed. “I am a Monarch Star, and only if it is used on me would the Ancestral King blood be the most effective. Otherwise, given to others, it would just be a waste.”

“Whether it would be a waste or not is the business of others. You took someone else’s property, and still act so shameless; hehe, I look down on you!” Ling Han wagged a finger at him.

You Yuan was extremely furious. His intiial intentions had been to play around with Ling Han, and only kill the latter when he was satisfied, but this guy seemed to have no brains at all, actually daring to talk back to him even at this moment.

“You are courting death!” You Yuan moved aggressively. Boom, a frigthening aura surged out. This was a Ninth-Lotus-level super elite.

Whether in the Celestial Realm or the Foreign Realm, Ascending Origin Tiers could be considered elites, and could gain a place even in the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces.

At present, You Yuan possessed Ninth-Lotus-level battle prowess. When he moved, winds and clouds changed, and even the heavens paled in color.

Ling Han released a battle cry, clenching a fist to greet the oncoming attack.

“Utter recklessness!” You Yuan smirked coldly. The other party actually still dared to face him head-on; his brain had to be damaged.

Peng! In this exchange, Ling Han was instantly sent flying back, but his figure immediately bent, and he already landed. He stood steadily, and aside from the fact that his face was slightly flushed, there was absolutely nothing off in his appearance.

Who asked him to have gotten countless celestial medicines? Added with the refinement of Ancestral King blood, he had pushed the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to a level that corresponded to his cultivation level, which was enough to bear Ascending-Origin-Tier attacks.

You Yuan’s eyes involuntarily bulged madly as he was completely incapable of believing what he had just seen.

“You have actually reached the Tenth Leaf!” he practically shouted out.

‘Are you f****** even human?’

You Yuan had used a whole million years, and even then he had just raised his cultivation level from the Fourth Leaf to Tenth Leaf, and this was with the academy sparing no expense, and supplying him with innumerable cultivation resources.

But in Ling Han’s case?

It was just a mere 50 years, and he had actually become a Tenth Leaf. This was something that You Yuan could not believe. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Even if Ling Han had used the highest grade of Time Cultivation Chamber, it would already have been inconceivable enough if this little bit of time had been enough for him to increase his cultivation level by one or two Leaves. …Unless there was an Ancestral King that damaged his own cultivation level, sparing no expense to help him. But what Ancestral King would be so stupid to damage his own cultivation level just to help an Eighth Lotus increase his cultivation level by that one or two Leaves?

“Never expected it, right?” Ling Han chuckled. “Impossible! This is absolutely impossible!” You Yuan roared loudly. This was unacceptable, and could not be accepted. Ling Han sighed. “Even trash like you has advanced to the Eleventh Leaf, yet I am only a Tenth Leaf. The heavens are really unfair.”

Hearing his grumbling complaints, You Yuan was even more outraged.

He had already been a Tenth Leaf in the first place, all right? He had just improved by a minor level, and in comparison, Ling Han’s increase in cultivation level was practically an explosion.

“Just how have you managed to improve?” He calmed down, wanting to know Ling Han’s secret.

“What business is it of yours?” Ling Han scoffed. Unless he had absolute confidence that he could kill the other party, how could he possibly reveal his own secrets to You Yuan?

You Yuan took a deep breath. “It’s fine even if you don’t speak now. When I capture you and search your soul, there is no way that your secrets will be hidden from me any longer.”

Though he was only a minor level superior to Ling Han, the gap between the Tenth Leaf and Eleventh Leaf was a leap in quality. Why had he been stuck on this stage for so many years? That was because after he took this step, his battle prowess directly soared to Ninth Lotus. Otherwise, an Eighth Lotus would ultimately just be Eighth Lotus.

Hence, he had absolute confidence.

Ling Han drew the women into the Black Tower. You Yuan was a strong foe, and Ling Han could not guarantee that he would still be able to protect the women completely in an intense battle with the other man. What reason was there for him to stay on guard constantly? “Come, I’ll play with you.” Ling Han crooked a finger at You Yuan.

“Recklessness!” You Yuan moved. Boom, Ninth-Lotus-level battle prowess surged, and he was like a great demon god.

Ling Han didn’t dodge, and met the attack, choosing to confront You Yuan directly.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

You Yuan naturally was stronger. The leap from the Tenth Leaf to Eleventh Leaf was really too great, and even though Ling Han had assimilated the Regulations of two realms, and his battle prowess in a battle of equals had already surpassed the level of a Monarch Star, it was still useless. It could not copensate for this massive gap. Thankfully, his physique was tough enough, his defenses having reached a frightening level. He had just spat a little blood even after being continuously blasted backwards by You Yuan.

You Yuan was also speechless, but he was even more curious about Ling Han’s secret now. If he could grasp all of Ling Han’s strong points, then he would definitely be able to become the strongest Monarch Star.

He laughed loudly, his offensive becoming more rapid.

Ling Han also attacked with his full efforts. His cultivation level had improved too quickly, so it was inevitable that he would have the weakness of unstable foundations, but battling this kind of elite in a life-or-death battle would undoubtedly increase his real battle prowess to a great extent.

It was only in real battle that his grasp of Regulations could be rapidly increased.

“I say, why is your wing still not recovered?” Ling Han pointed at You Yuan’s wing. Previously, he had sliced it off, and though it had now grown back out again, it was only the pitifully small size of a chicken’s wing.

“It’s not enough for me to eat.” He pretended to feel sorry.

You Yuan exploded in fury. Ling Han’s strength was freakish, and his defenses were freakish, but all this could not compare to his mouth. It was practically capable of causing someone to die from pure fury! “I will kill you!! Kill you!!” You Yuan roared furiously, striking even quicker. If he could not kill Ling Han with his own hands, he would definitely be unable to vent his fury.

In his utter rage, his battle prowess did indeed soar greatly, and even if Ling Han had a tough physique, he was still completely bruised and battered.

Ling Han fought intensely. His fighting spirit was also blazing madly, and he was using You Yuan’s hand to temper himself.

“That’s about it!” After the two battled for 10 days, Ling Han revealed a mad grin, and took out a bottle.

“It’s useless even if you consume celestial medicines!” You Yuan declared menacingly. The toughness of Ling Han’s physique was definitely not inexhaustible. Under You Yuan’s mad barrage of attacks, it had already reached its limits. He only had to put in some more effort, and he would defintiely be able to punch through it.

Ling Han uncorked the bottle, and poured crimson red blood on himself.

“A-Ancestral King’s blood!” You Yuan’s eyes immediately widened.
