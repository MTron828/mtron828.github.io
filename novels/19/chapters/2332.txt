Chapter 2333 Rise in Ranking

Ling Han and the three women joined the teams that were snatching beacons from others.

They were few in number, with only four of them, yet one of them was at the Eleventh Secret, and two of them were at the Tenth Secret. Any one of them three was already powerful enough to act as the leader of a team. Now, they were working together, and Ling Han was more so an absolute freak whose Evolution Index was close to 11. He wasn’t just a mere monarch star.

The four of them casually strolled around, not attempting to conceal themselves like the other teams. It was as if they were shouting, “Come and rob me!”

Many teams genuinely tried to rob them, and it wasn’t long before another team charged over, encircling them.

“Oh, only four people?” someone said with a whistle. “Did you accidentally separate from the rest of your team? Come, call me big brother. Big Brother will protect you.”

“Three women and one man. This is a case of one king and three queens, huh?” someone said in a flippant tone.

“Such strong tastes. Three angels sharing a demon,” a male angel said in jealousy. The Empress and the others were all divinely beautiful and attractive, yet the only man in the team was from the Demon Race. This was truly despicable and infuriating.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’ll give you people a choice. Hand over the beacons and let me beat you up, or I’ll beat you up before taking your beacons.” The 10 people exchanged glances before bursting into laughter.

Was this not hilarious? There were only four people in this group, yet they still wanted to beat them up?

An insect stepped forward, and said, “Actually, we have a third option. That is, we’ll give you a beating.” He had a massive bottom that took up half of his body. It was bright red and covered with patterns, and it was surprisingly harmonious and coherent to look at. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Whoosh!

He quickly dashed over.

Even though he was fat, his movements were extremely quick and agile. With a flash, he immediately arrived before Ling Han, extending his two claws to grab at him.

His claws were both filled with sharp hooks that gleamed with an ice-cold luster.

Sixth Leaf of the Eighth Lotus. This insect was a monarch tier.

Ling Han immediately lashed out.

Pa!

The two claws landed in his palms, and with a twist, emerald-green blood instantly sprayed out from the insect’s broken limbs.

“Squeak...!” The insect faltered for a moment before shrieking in agony. He hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would be so powerful, so powerful that he couldn’t even withstand a single strike. His shriek transformed into a terrifying wave that surged into the surroundings.

Peng, peng, peng!

Mountains crumbled and trees fell.

He was an experienced fighter, and he wasn’t flustered because of this exchange. Instead, he raised his bottom, and instantly ejected a stream of foul-smelling gray gas.

This was an innate divine skill of his tribe. His foul-smelling fart contained a potent poison, one that could faze those at the same cultivation level. Those at a lower cultivation level would be directly corroded into liquid. Even those who were stronger would suffer a huge hit to their battle prowess.

Thus, this was not only a life-saving technique, but also a technique that could turn the tables and lead to victory.

Ling Han filled his cheeks before blowing a mouthful of air.

Whoosh!

Like the devastating gales of heaven, a powerful gust of wind swept forth. As it surged forward, all of the gray gas was swept away, clearing the surroundings once again.

The smug smile of the insect instantly collapsed.

He trembled in apprehension, realizing that he had come across a formidable opponent. This person was not just a little more powerful than him. Instead, he had a crushing advantage over him.

Even though they were prohibited from killing each other in the first round, there was no rule against pummeling other people. However, who would want to get pummeled? Especially when they were mostly all monarch tiers who were destined to become Ancestral Kings in the future. Getting pummeled would be a stain on their name, and it would definitely result in them becoming the butt of jokes in the future.

“Flee!” The nine other people hurriedly sprinted off. In any case, their teammate definitely wouldn’t be killed. At most, he would only suffer some physical pain. As such, protecting the beacons was their priority.

The Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou split up to pursue these people. Apart from Bewitching Maiden Rou being slightly weaker, the Empress and Hu Niu were both Tenth Secret monarch stars. Just how great was their battle prowess?

As long as they didn’t encounter Eleventh Secret monarch stars, who could defeat them?

Not a single one of the 10 people managed to escape. Instead, they were all captured by Ling Han and the others.

This was slightly ironic. In the beginning, it was these 10 people who had encircled Ling Han and the others and threatened to rob them. In the blink of an eye, however, their positions had swapped.

“Which option do you choose?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “If you hand over the beacons first, I can pummel you less severely.”

The 10 people were rendered speechless. However, they all retrieved their beacons and handed them over to Ling Han.

Ling Han counted the beacons. These people had obtained quite the number, with 70 beacons in total. He smiled, and said, “Time for the beating.”

The four of them lashed out, giving the 10 people a harsh lesson. Only then did they let them leave. They then started to casually stroll around again, looking for their next target. At the same time, they were also waiting for prey to bring itself over.

Luck was on their side, and it wasn’t long before they came across another team. These people didn’t speak as they immediately turned around to head toward them. They were proactive and cooperative.

“Seeing that you’re so obedient, I’ll only rob half of your beacons,” Ling Han said with a chuckle. After all, he had only just started hunting, and these people were also so proactive and cooperative. He would give them a 50 percent discount.

“How impudent,” the 10 people said with cold chuckles. They immediately launched an attack.

After only two minutes, the battle drew to a close.

The 10 people were all bruised and battered, and they were filled with dejection and despair as they left. They were overcome with regret.

They had actually charged into the jaws of these four murderous people. How incredibly foolish!

Fortunately, the four people had been principled enough, and they had only robbed half of their beacons just as they promised. This left them with a glimmer of hope.

However, only a short while later, they came across a lone woman from the Angel Race. She was astonishingly beautiful, and her bare feet were as smooth and white as jade. Her silky hair billowed in the air, making her appear graceful and ethereal. She was much like a celestial maiden.

“Hand over your beacons,” the woman said calmly. However, her voice had a hint of force and dominance.

The 10 people were incredibly ticked off. They had only just been robbed by four people, and now they were being challenged by a single person? Did they look like pushovers?

“Capture her!” The 10 people charged forward in unison, yearning to capture the woman. Even obtaining a single beacon would be

good.

The woman humphed before snapping her fingers.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Bursts of Sword Qi slashed forward.

Pu, pu, pu, pu!

The 10 people were all nailed to the ground. These swords of light formed from the Regulations were incredibly devastating.

After robbing them poor, the woman left gracefully.

The 10 people exchanged gloomy glances.

Being robbed by Ling Han had still been somewhat of a fortune. After all, he had only taken half of their beacons. However, they had immediately come across a powerful woman who had taken all of their remaining beacons. They were instantly plunged into poverty. “The woman left in the same direction as those four people. Perhaps they’ll encounter each other?” a person suddenly said.

“Hehe, that’ll be entertaining!”

Some of them even clasped their hands in prayer, saying, “Praise the heavens, please let them encounter each other.”

In the outside world.

Because of Ling Han and the others’ success in robbing other teams, the points and ranking of the Hundred Battles Academy also started to soar.

In only half a day, they had already risen from a lowly 700 and something to 400 and something

This was a significant rise that attracted much attention.
