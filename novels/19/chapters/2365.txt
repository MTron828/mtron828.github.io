Chapter 2366: True face

Feng Hailuan fatlered slightly; he had not expected that Ling Han would admit it.

He humphed, and said, “This matter involves the honor of our master, yet you are still all smiles about it. You do not take the pride of the line of Desolate Eternity seriously at all. I will definitely report this to our two senior brothers!”

He did not believe that Ling Han was that great kidnapper at all, because doing that did not offer the slightest benefit for Ling Han.

Ling Han rubbed his chin, and smilingly asked, “Why is it that no one ever believes me when I speak the truth? All right then, how about this?”

He revealed his true face.

“You, y-y-you…” Feng Hailuan’s emotions fluctuated greatly. “You are that human!”

A great many Heavenly Venerates had issued an arrest warrant for Ling Han together. This had shaken the entire Foreign Realm, but no matter how hard they searched high and low, they could not find Ling Han at all. But who would have imagined that this guy would be incredibly high-profile, and actually scramble his way into the territory of a Heavenly Venerate.

“You are too outrageously bold!” Feng Hailuan called out loudly. Now, he truly believed that Ling Han was that great thief behind the kidnappings.

“Am I?” Ling Han laughed, but he was already charging towards Feng Hailuan in a single move.

Boom, he shot out a fist, and it was like the mountain itself was crumbling.

How could Feng Hailuan possibly dare to take this head-on? In the past, he had been no match for Ling Han, and now that Ling Han had advanced a step further, he naturally was even less of a match for him.

He hurriedly released a battle cry, launching a signal for help.

Ling Han moved widely and boldly, already using Fists of Fury. As his frightening physical power surged out, something that surpassed Regulations was showing its might. Though it was just a tiny bit, it was enough to push his destructive power to a higher level.

It was only a few strikes, and Feng Hailuan was already in dire straits. He had no choice but to ignite his blood essence, or he could possibly die at any time.

He was stunned, furious, and afraid all at the same time. This was Divine Desolate Mountain, the place of enlightenment of a Heavenly Venerate, yet a puny human was committing a crime here. Even if Ling Han was torn to pieces, so what? This would be an eternal shame for the line of Desolate Eternity.

Xiu, xiu, xiu,?someone was already shooting over. It was Sihuang Yun.

He saw how Feng Hailuan was presently battling with Ling Han, and couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

How could there be a human here?

Could it be this was one of those slaves previously?

This was not impossible. Though his memory was extraordinarily good, what need did he have to remember the faces of these lowly slaves?

“Help me now!” Feng Hailuan called out loudly. His wings were already wilted. In a short few mintues’ time, he had already aged several decades. Multiple wrinkles had already appeared on his initially clear and fair forehead.

Though competition existed among the line of Desolate Eternity, this was now an enemy invading from outside. Sihuang Yun did not dare to just stand by. Otherwise, if the matter was investigated afterwards, his crime would really be too heavy.

“Who is he?” Sihuang Yun asked in shock as he joined the battle. How could an indescribably powerful human appear here?

“Ba!” Feng Hailuan said through gritted teeth.

“What!?” Sihuang Yun was greatly shocked. This guy was really outrageously bold; as a mere human, he actually dared to come and become a disciple at the place of enlightenment of a Heavenly Venerate.

And what was more important? He actually managed to deceive a Heavenly Venerate—though the latter was only a sliver of divine sense.

“What? This trash is Ba?” An elite arrived. This time, it was Xue Ge. He looked at Ling Han, the killing intent in his eyes blazing. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He finally understood why Ling Han had slapped him in the face repeatedly for no reason. As it turned out, he was human, so he naturally could not bear to see him devour his fellow men.

“Hahahaha!” He suddenly laughed loudly, filled with cruelty. It was great now. He could get his revenge to his heart’s content. “I will devour your brain tissue!”

“This man’s name is Ling Han, the person that various Heavenly Venerates are hunting down!” Zi Shuang appeared, with her eyes sweeping over Ling Han, filled with surprise.

Initially, she had wanted to form an alliance with Ling Han, and now that she had seen Ling Han reveal his real face, she was naturally exploding with shock.

When these worlds fell, both Sihuang Yun and Xue Ge frowned. They had not anticipated that Ling Han would be so strong that a considerable number of Heavenly Venerates had kept him in mind.

“Capture him to wipe off the shame of our line of Desolate Eternity!” Xue Ge shouted loudly, joining the battle as well.

Ling Han grinned, but his eyes were menacing as he asked, “All of you have come to your deaths?”

“You are only a human!” Xue Ge smirked coldly. He burst out with the power unique to his race. A boundless bloody light spread out, and Regulations of Darkness extended, filled with the reek of slaughter and bloodshed.

“Invincible Exploding Clouds!” Sihuang Yun also shouted loudly, using a great burst of power.

Feng Hailuan did not use any bursts of power, though. He was already burning even his blood essence, and had long since reached his limits.

Ling Han smirked coldly, and waved his right hand. The Divine Demon Sword was summoned, its cold light dazzling the heavens.

He was too strong now, and added with a Celestial Tool like the Divine Demon Sword, he was naturally invincible.

Pu, Xue Ge was the first to suffer, being cleaved in two by the Divine Demon Sword.

This was because Ling Han was targeting him specifically, seeing him as the first target that had to be killed.

Xue Ge screamed in pain. He attempted to reconnect the two halves of his body, but with how overbearing the Divine Demon Sword was, it was useless even if the ripped halves of his body were pulled together. He could not fuse them back together again.

Not only was that the case, he was still continuously losing blood.

This bleeding would not kill a Ninth Lotus elite, but losing too much would still cause great damage to his strength, and his cultivation level could even regress.

Ling Han attacked aggressively, wanting to follow up with a few more strikes, and completely kill this damn insect.

“How dare you!!” Zi Shuang released a battle cry, and joined the battle as well. At this time, more people were rushing here. Huai Jian, Xu Xing, Jing Zhongyue, and the others were naturally all astounded when they found out that this human was Ba, and when they knew that he was the man that the Heavenly Venerates were hunting down, they were naturally even more astonished.

Ling Han’s right hand wielded the sword, while his left hand was curled into a fist. As the Divine Sword swept out, there was no one that could match it at all, and Fists of Fury was also filled with dominance. Even Zi Shuang did not dare face it directly, and they could only block it with the combined efforts of two or three people.

“Die!” Jing Zhongyue and Huai Jian both joined the battle. There was no way that they could allow Ling Han to kill anyone.

Finally, Ancestral King Nahua appeared as well. His eyes swept over them, and a rip was immediately torn in the air, as if the heaven itself was about to collapse.

Ancestral Kings were too strong, being equal with Regulations themselves. As long as you used Regulations, there was no possible way that you could match an Ancestral King. This was an overwhelming level of strength.

“Surrender!” Ancestral King Nahua moved, grabbing out at Ling Han.

“Small Tower!” Ling Han called out mentally. Immediately, an indescribbale power surged out within Ling Han’s body. Then, the heaven and earth immediately paled, with thunderclouds spreading out densely, as if a supreme great tribulation was about to descend.

This was because the Black Tower had shown its might. This was a power that belonged to the Celestial Realm, and was not recognized by this realm.

Peng!

Ling Han directly sent out a palm strike, and Ancestral King Nahua was instantly smacked flat. When he raised his hand again, this powerful being had already become a mess of flesh and blood.

This was an Ancestral King!

Yet Ling Han did not even cast a second look at him. The Black Tower’s power was limited; he had to finish what he came to do as soon as possible.

Peng, peng, peng.?He did not deliberately target anyone, but Xue Ge directly exploded under his crushing aura, both form and spirit obliterated.

With the surge of might from the Black Tower, Ling Han could possess Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier strength. Even the majority of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could not survive 10 moves from him, what more a mere Ninth Lotus, especially when the latter was already severely injured at that.

Everyone was stunned. An Ancestral King and a monarch star had actually already died in Ling Han’s hands in the blink of an eye, and they couldn’t even manage to react in time.

No wonder the Heavenly Venerates had issued an arrest warrant for Ling Han together.
