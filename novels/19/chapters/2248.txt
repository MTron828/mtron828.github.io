Chapter 2249: Erase

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han revealed his true appearance. There were no other people here, so he naturally didn’t need to conceal his identity anymore.

He smiled, and mused, “Why is it impossible?”

Gaddalon stared at Ling Han, and he felt that this person was as unfamiliar as could be. Even without a mask, he still couldn’t recognize this person. He pointed at Ling Han, and said, “You’re only two minor levels above me, so how were you able to catch up to me so quickly? Moreover, I wasn’t able to detect your presence at all.”

It would have been more understandable if Ling Han had been an Ascending Origin Tier elite.

However, Ascending Origin Tiers were unable to enter this realm. In other words, the only explanation was that Ling Han was at the 11th layer of the Eighth Lotus!

Was this possible?

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “How is this impossible? You’re merely a frog at the bottom of a well.”

Gaddalon also chuckled, saying, “Even though you caught up to me, you’ve already spoken with me for so long. Moreover, I can still hold you back for some time. This will be enough time for Yamu to escape! Don’t be so smug. Once Chi Xue rises, killing you will be as easy as slaying a chicken!”

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “No, I’m the chicken slayer. Stealing my title isn’t a good habit.”

“Hahaha! Come battle!” Gaddalon roared. He abandoned all other thoughts, and the only thing remaining on his mind was battle.

After abandoning all other thoughts, his mind surprisingly underwent a transformation.

Boom!

A terrifying aura exuded from his body, and his strength rose by a significant amount.

In the past, he had never entered such a state before. Thus, now that his mind was tempered and tested, he surprisingly transcended his self.

A Monarch Star was a Monarch Star, after all. Even in such a difficult situation, he was still able to transform danger into opportunity.

“What a shame. If I had been afforded some more time, I could have ascended to the ninth layer of the Eighth Lotus. At that time… it would have been difficult to determine the victor,” Gaddalon said with an expression of pity.

If he ascended to the ninth layer of the Eighth Lotus, and if he combusted his blood essence, his strength would then rival the 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus. He would be no weaker than Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Fine, I’ll grant you a cultivation of the Ninth Secret.” With his tap, a ray of light instantly encircled Gaddalon, causing his aura to rise at a rapid rate. It was as if this rise had no limit.

Three times, five times, 10 times!

Gaddalon’s cultivation reached the ninth layer of the Eighth Lotus.

His cultivation level had clearly grown by a significant amount, but Gaddalon couldn’t help but feel cold with fear. Cold sweat drenched his body.

With a single tap, his cultivation level had been raised by a minor level? Just what kind of ability was this?

‘Is he a god?’

He suddenly faltered as this thought flashed through his mind. An expression of shock spread across his face. His finger trembled as he pointed at Ling Han, and he stammered, “Y-y-you… You obtained the Origin Magic Cube!”

If this weren’t the case, even a Celestial King couldn’t elevate his cultivation by a minor level with a single tap.

After all, heaven and earth also abided by their own regulations!

Only by becoming the ruler of this heaven and earth could one do as they pleased. With a single thought, they could become god or devil.

Of course, his rise in cultivation level would only be effective in this realm. Once he left, his cultivation would return to normal.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “You’ve finally realized.”

Gaddalon’s skin had originally been crimson-red, yet it was now as white as a sheet. He was dumbfounded as he stared at Ling Han, and fear started to slowly eat away at his mind.

His opponent had purposefully disguised himself as a cultivator at the 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus… He was clearly trying to trick the Foreign Realm!

“Wh-what level have you reached?” he asked with a sliver of hope. Perhaps this heaven and earth was too weak, in which case Ling Han might only have a cultivation at the 15th Lotus or 16th Lotus. If that were the case, his strength would naturally be much more limited.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Killing a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, or an 18th Lotus elite for the Foreign Realm, shouldn’t be a big problem.”

“You sure are scheming enough,” Gaddalon said, feeling an urge to vomit blood. He could envision how the Celestial Kings of Foreign Realm, who made no preparations, would be slaughtered by Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “These are your final words?”

“Don’t be so arrogant. Regardless of how powerful you are, you still can’t rival Heavenly Venerates!” Gaddalon roared. “We have far more Heavenly Venerates than you, and any one of them will be able to crush you like an ant.”

“Well, this has nothing to do with you. Off you go, and hopefully, you reincarnate into a better person in your next life.” Ling Han immediately lashed out.

Peng!

With a single punch, Gaddalon was instantly erased from existence.

“There’s still one more,” Ling Han murmured. Like flowing air, his body became transparent before vanishing without a trace.

***

Yamu didn’t stop fleeing. She had barely consumed any power of Regulations, and after using self-harming means, her battle prowess had increased by tenfold. She was at her peak state right now, and she would dare to battle against even ninth secret Monarch Stars.

She traveled in a huge arc, and her goal was simply to escape from this realm.

Whoosh!

She was extremely skilled in the Regulations of Space, and her speed was astonishingly quick as a result.

‘Hmm?’

A strange feeling suddenly gripped her mind. This was because the surrounding stars seemed slightly familiar to her.

For a Monarch Star, such feelings naturally wouldn’t arise for no reason. Since they seemed familiar, she had definitely seen them before.

She took note of this.

Whoosh!

She rapidly flew past, yet after a moment, she suddenly ground to a halt. Cold sweat dripped down her insect face.

That star… She had passed it before!

She wasn’t traveling in circles, so how could this be the case?

However, she was a Monarch Star, after all, so her willpower was naturally impressive. She immediately composed herself before setting off again.

This time, she remained laser-focused, and explicitly observed her surroundings.

‘It’s appeared again!’ Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Astonishment spread across her insect face again. This was the third time she had seen this star.

‘What’s going on? Just what in the world is going on?!’

Was this eerie occurrence due to the fact that this heaven and earth had only just been born?

Why was she unlucky enough to encounter it? Moreover, at such a sensitive moment?

“Heh, is it fun?” a voice suddenly asked next to her ear.

“Who is it?!” Yamu exclaimed. She hurriedly looked left and right, yet she couldn’t see anyone at all.

She became even more frightened. With her power, someone was still able to conceal themselves before her? This was simply unfathomable.

“Are you that forgetful?” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“I-it’s you!” Yamu stammered, instantly recalling who it was. Her body involuntarily trembled. This person had actually caught up to her so quickly? A cold chill ran down her spine.

What frightened her more was the continually reappearing planets. Was that also related to Ling Han? If it were, that would be far too terrifying.

Ling Han materialized before her, and it was as if he had stepped out from the empty space.

“Haha!” Yamu immediately composed herself. She was a Monarch Star, after all, so her mental fortitude was naturally superior to that of ordinary people. “Since you’ve chosen to pursue me, Gaddalon can definitely escape.

“After some years, when Gaddalon becomes an 18th Lotus elite, he’ll definitely slaughter the ants of the Celestial Realm, and exact revenge for me!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “You know, Gaddalon said the exact same thing to me.”

“Bullsh*t!” Yamu shouted in a trembling voice.

“Huh? You didn’t find the phenomenon just then strange?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“It was your doing?” Yamu asked. She couldn’t help but shiver.

“That’s right,” Ling Han said with a nod.

Yamu finally came to her senses at this moment, exclaiming, “You obtained the Origin Magic Cube! You can control this heaven and earth!”

“Correct again. However, it’s a pity that there’s no prize,” Ling Han said with a grin.

Yamu’s face was ashen. The Origin Magic Cube had actually fallen into Ling Han’s hands! That being the case, Ling Han could naturally manipulate the realm as he pleased. Just like Gaddalon, she thought of many things at this moment. Ling Han was clearly far more powerful than he let on, yet he was concealing his power on purpose. For what reason did he do this?

He wanted to screw them over big time!
