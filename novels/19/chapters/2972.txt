2973 News of his children

“You have finally come.” Zhou Heng appeared with a light sigh.

Ling Han nodded, clasped his hands, and said, “Greetings, Senior.”

Zhou Heng Heng’s eyes sharpened, and he asked, “Were you the one who killed the seven Sixth Tier elites who entered the Genesis World of the last era?”

Ling Han nodded, and then shook his head. “I only killed Yue Borong. The other six weren’t killed by me.”

Zhou Heng’s expression immediately softened. He was aware of the enmity between Yue Borong and Ling Han, and it was destined that they couldn’t get along peacefully. He then frowned, and asked, “Then whom were the other six people killed by?”

“A mysterious Seventh Tier.” Ling Han recounted the events regarding Jue Huo.

When Zhou Heng heard this, he couldn’t help but feel surprised.

Another Seventh Tier elite had actually appeared, and it was highly possible that she was Hysteria’s subordinate?

Seventh Tier was too terrifying, undying and indestructible. If Hysteria really had such a helper, who knew what kind of consequences would follow.

It should be known that when a Seventh Tier elite battled, even a transcendent dimension would slowly be shattered into pieces.

“Strange!” Zhou Heng murmured. “In all these years, there hasn’t been any news about this woman at all. If it weren’t for the fact that you were the one who told me about this, I would really find it hard to believe.”

Ling Han was also surprised. After Jue Huo went on a killing spree and killed six Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, she suddenly disappeared? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

That was a Seventh Tier we were talking about. If she was really Hysteria’s subordinate, then what great matter was she scheming for with such forbearance?

“That’s right. What happened to those friends and family of mine?” Ling Han recalled the main reason he had come to seek Zhou Heng.

Zhou Heng sighed softly. “After you hear this, you must control your emotions.”

Ling Han instantly felt a sense of unease. Boom, the space around him collapsed, and endless karmic flames blazed, showing the storm of emotions in his heart at this moment.

Zhou Heng hurriedly said, “Don’t worry. Jianxue, Ling Xi, and the others are all fine.”

With these words, Ling Han finally calmed down, and waited quietly for Zhou Heng to finish his words.

“After you left the Realm Battlefield that day, someone did indeed propose to capture your family and use them to force you out. However, Master stopped them,” Zhou Heng said. “However, it was later rumored that you killed seven Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates. After that, the various lords such as Shatter Mountains, Chong Yan, and the others didn’t give Master any more face, and apprehended your children and descendants.

“Fortunately, Master threatened them with Feng Wuding’s life, forcing those lords to only imprison Jianxue and the others, not daring to cause any further damage.”

What happened next could be imagined by Ling Han. A portion of descendants of the Ling Clan escaped this tribulation, but because there were no elites in the clan, and adding the persecution of other forces, they were forced to separate, and the situation became worse and worse.

“Shatter Mountains, Chong Yan!” Ling Han said word by word, his face filled with killing intent.

He swore that he would definitely kill these Seventh Tiers.

Humph, hadn’t the Yellow Sand Heavenly Venerate died as well?

The impact of the Genesis World’s destruction was enough to kill a Seventh Tier. Even if the physical body was not damaged, the spirit would still dissipate, and it would be equivalent to death.

Even if Ling Han possessed the battle prowess of the Seventh Tier, he would not be able to kill a Seventh Tier. On the contrary, he would only be killed by a Seventh Tier, because his physique had not reached the level of being indestructible. However, when he advanced to the Sixth Tier and Seventh Tier, it would be a different story. The Powers of Dimension in his body would become stronger and stronger, and a single strike would be equivalent to the riot of the entire Genesis World.

Killing a Seventh Tier was definitely not wishful thinking.

Ling Han asked, “Where are Jianxue and the others imprisoned?”

“Western Clouds Heaven, Hundred Frost Valley,” Zhou Heng said. “However, don’t try to rescue them. The reason why Chong Yan and the others didn’t kill them was firstly because of Master’s threat, and secondly to draw you out. If you go, you’ll be walking into a trap.”

Ling Han nodded. “I would not be so rash.”

Damn it, his own children were imprisoned, and he could only watch helplessly?

Strength, everything was because he was not strong enough. If he now had the strength of a Seventh Tier, he could completely barge into the Hundred Frost Valley to save them, so what would there be to fear?

Zhou Heng glanced at him, and said, “If you want to save them, you have to possess Seventh-Tier battle prowess, and even a freak like you would have to advance to the Fifth Tier first. Currently, the fastest way for you to advance to the Fifth Tier is to obtain the Flaming Frost Realm’s core.”

Ling Han was surprised. “Senior, could it be that you don’t need it?”

According to the deduction of the Seventh Tiers, this could possibly give a Sixth Tier a chance to reach the peak stage. Thus, this dimensional core should also be extremely important to Zhou Heng.

A confident expression appeared on Zhou Heng’s face, and he said, “Junior Brother Chu and I should be able to advance to the Seventh Tier within 100,000,000 years!”

Ling Han faltered for a moment before immediately breaking into a smile. “Congratulations, Senior Zhou! Congratulations to Senior Chu!”

Whether it was Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, Lin Xiaoyang, or Lin Luo, they had all treated Ling Han very well. Now that Zhou Heng and Chu Hao were finally about to advance to the Seventh Tier, Ling Han was naturally overjoyed.

Zhou Heng nodded, and said, “After Junior Brother Chu and I advance to the Seventh Tier, we should be able to relieve some of the pressure. However, Hysteria has swallowed the Flaming Frost Realm, so even if it doesn’t obtain the core, its strength will have increased exponentially. The situation is still extremely disadvantageous to us. Thus, the real hope is still on you.”

When Ling Han was in the Fourth Tier, he could already kill Sixth Tier elites, and when he reached the Fifth Tier, he should be able to match Seventh Tier elites. Then, what about when he reached the Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier?

Ling Han nodded. “I will definitely not disappoint Senior’s expectations.”

He paused, and then asked, “When can we seize the dimensional core?”

“Within a billion years,” Zhou Heng replied.

“Alright.”

Ling Han left the Zhou Clan, and no longer thought about his son and daughter.

It was not that he did not miss or care about them, but rather that he was at his wits’ end at present. Every time he thought of them, it would only cause him anxiety and heartache.

He returned to the Peaceful Leaf City and focused on teaching his descendant. Meanwhile, he also deduced more Heavenly Venerable Seals. If he could obtain more combination seals, his battle prowess would become even more powerful.

He managed to find Wally. In the field of deduction, Wally was a grandmaster.

Wally still hadn’t advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier yet. However, Ling Han had a feeling that Wally seemed to have taken a different path of evolution, and his future prospects might be unimaginable.

After charging Ling Han with a large pile of Divine Metals, Wally began to deduce the Heavenly Venerable Seals with him.

He did not know cultivation, but it was precisely because of this that he could not be bound by any kind of restriction. He possessed a wild imagination, and was also incredibly rigorous.

The two of them worked together. Wally gave Ling Han a lot of inspiration, and also corrected a lot of steps made in a wrong direction for him.

Ling Han deduced more and more Heavenly Venerable Seals. They were all seventh-grade seals because he wanted to gather the complete set of 111 seals.

500,000,000 years had passed, and he had succeeded.

This was an inconceivable duration. With merely 500,000,000 years, others might not even be able to deduce a single seal even if they spent an epoch’s time, but Ling Han had deduced a few dozen.

Firstly, this was because of Wally, and secondly, it was because Ling Han had too many dimensions inside his body, which allowed him to stand higher than the average person.

Right at this moment, there was news that the core of the Flaming Frost Realm was about to appear.
