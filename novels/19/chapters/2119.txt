Chapter 2120: Opening the passage

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han entered a long period of seclusion once more.

Though he had mastered the Great Clash of Source Powers of four Source Powers, to have five Source Powers clash was not something as simple as just adding another into the equation. Instead, he had to form a relation of mutual interaction with the other four Source Powers.

There were too many aspects that he had to attend to at the same time.

In the process of his attempts, Ling Han killed himself another three times. Thankfully, he had learned his lesson. After each time he used Rising From The Ashes, he would wait until this ability recovered to continue testing out dangerous actions.

He would not waste the other time, either. He was studying the four new Source Powers, and his battle prowess improved further.

In fact, he had a feeling that he would be able to match Ji Wuming even without using the Great Clash of Source Powers.

This was not impossible, because Ji Wuming also had a powerful move to burst his battle prowess.

Ling Han was close to obtaining all nine Source Powers of heaven and earth, and if this still did not allow his usual battle prowess to catch up to Ji Wuming’s, it would really be too unjust. After all, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would also have to break the limits of his own cultivation level. It was only that he would be able to use more power of Regulations.

1,000 years, 3,000 years, 5,000 years!

Ling Han had finally completed cultivating the new Great Clash of Source Powers. He exited the Black Tower, and began to barrage the vacuum.

Peng!

He spread out the shield of Source Power, and then burst out with a frightening strike.

Boom, when this landed on the vacuum, it was like a small pebble being tossed into a great river. The splash created was practically negligible.

“No, the power is too weak. Again.”

Ling Han continued his seclusion, and 70 years later, he made another attempt.

“There’s some improvement, but still too weak. Again.

“The power’s stronger again, but still considerably lacking. Again.

“Again!

“Again!

“Again!”

Another 3,000 years passed, and Ling Han had already forgotten the matter of leaving the vacuum. Instead, he had placed all his focus and energy on the matter of the Great Clash of Source Powers. The power of this secret technique had been developed to a brand-new height at his hand.

The clash of four Source Powers in the past was practically negligible compared to this.

Five Elements perfected, not only could it match Time, Space, and other Regulations, it could even far surpass them.

After all, this was five types of Regulations of heaven and earth.

Boom, Ling Han came out to barrage the vacuum as per usual, testing out the might of the Great Clash of Source Powers. He had not thought that a massive change would happen this time round. The vacuum split apart, and a passage was revealed.

‘Huh?’

Ling Han was startled. This passage only appeared for an instant.

His power was too weak. The space passage he created was too unstable, and could only be maintained for an instant.

Success!

Ling Han had already returned to the Black Tower. He had realized that he had successfully ripped open the void at this moment, and could return to the Celestial Realm. He laughed loudly, and then exited the Black Tower with a leap once more, and blasted out his strongest attack.

The void split apart again, and a passage was revealed. WIthout the slightest hesitation, he rushed inside.

Boom, his whole body shook madly, and he had not gotten his wits back yet when a bright sky appeared suddenly ahead of him.?Bang, he dropped down from the skies, crashing heavily into the ground. He felt like even his internal organs were trembling wildly, and felt incredibly horrible.

When he had entered into the vacuum, he had been protected by Lu Hairong, but now he himself had traversed the vacuum. This kind of feeling was really too terrible.

“Deity?”

“Demon?”

The voices of a few kids rang out in Ling Han’s ear. He forced himself to open his eyes, and saw four small faces appear above him. They were all surveying him with great curiosity.

When they saw Ling Han’s eyes open, these four kids all got a shock, and hurriedly ducked their heads back in.

Ling Han struggled to get to his feet. It was enough to experience this kind of feeling once. He had no wish to experience it a second time.

He straightened up, and surveyed his surroundings. He was at the head of a small village. There was a massive path of limestone here, and in the middle, there was a well, which was also built from limestone, and it actually had a soft luster to it, just like limestone.

“Where is this place?” Ling Han asked the four children.

The four kids shook their heads simultaneously, staying very much on guard against him.

Ling Han smiled, and took out some sweets from the Black Tower. With Hu Niu by his side, he definitely did not lack snacks.

“I will give this to whoever tells me.”

“This is Great Wong Village!” the four kids answered at the same time.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and split the sweets among the four children. Then, he asked, “Do you know which Heavenly Realm this is?”

The difficulty level of this question was slightly too high for the four children, and the four kids all shook their heads dumbly.

“What is the nearest city called?”

They still shook their heads.

Forget it. He had best find it on his own. Hopefully, he had not been swept back into the Eastern Celestial Realm.

This was not impossible. The vacuum and the Celestial Realm did not correspond to one another. It was possible that he entered from the Eastern Celestial Realm, and after traveling for a while and coming back out, he would have already arrived in the Western Celestial Realm. However, this kind of “journey” did not have any accuracy at all, and even a Celestial King could not possibly traverse the void for a journey.

Ling Han soothed his wildly trembling internal organs, and then leaped up, moving his limbs slightly. He felt like he was filled with explosive power.

More than 10,000 years had passed in real time, and with the time acceleration effects of the Black Tower, more than 10,000,000 years had passed. He had long since cultivated Yin Soul Tier to the pinnacle. Thus, he decided to first break through to Earth Soul, and then head to the Roc Palace. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He entered the village, and found some elders of the village to ask around.

…The adult men had all entered the mountains for hunting, while the women were gathering wild fruits in the woods. There were only elderly and children in this village until evening time.

“The nearest city here is called Great Clouds City,” an old man said. “I have been there in my youth. Young man, that really is a prosperous place. I really had an impulse not to return here years ago, but for the sake of my wife and kids, I still gritted my teeth and came back.”

Ling Han smiled slightly. Even if they did not cultivate, the people of the Celestial Realm had an extremely long lifespan. Usually, it would be around 500 years, and this old man had been alive for more than 450 years, and had really reached the end of his years.

But compared to Ling Han, the old man would only be the junior of a junior.

Going by real time, Ling Han had been alive for more than 10,000 years, and added with the time acceleration’s effects, he was already an old monster that had been alive for over 10,000,000 years.

Being called a young man by someone who had only been alive for over 450 years, Ling Han felt slightly amused.

Without his knowing, he had already passed a very long, long time.

“If you’re heading to Great Clouds City, you should head east after you exit the village. You have to walk a total of three years to be able to reach there,” the old man continued, and then patted Ling Han’s shoulder. “Young man, you had best just settle down here. You look quite talented, so it would not be difficult to find a wife.”

Ling Han smiled, and drew out an alchemical pill, which he laid down. To him, it was not valuable, but for mortals, it was incredibly precious. It could reforge the old man’s body, and from now on, he would be strong and healthy. It would be no difficult task to continue living for another 200 years.

Actually, this was not an alchemical pill to increase one’s lifespan, so its effects were not very good. However, for a mortal, this was already enough.

“Old man, take care.” Ling Han stood up, and walked out of the old man’s thatched cottage.

He had just taken a step when he heard a powerful tremor sound from the earth.

It was not an earthquake, but rather something created by some creature stomping on the ground.

He paused slightly. Only a while later, he saw over a dozen handsome horses gallop over from the distance, directly barging into the village. These horses were not any mortal breed, but had a sliver of the bloodline of the Dragon Tribe. Their hooves were covered with dragon scales, and they appeared very majestic and mighty.

When these horses barged in, their speed actually did not slow down. There were two children presently playing around in the middle of the path, and they were instantly scared silly.. In just a moment, they would be run over.
