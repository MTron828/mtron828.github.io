Chapter 2567: Extending row of successive victories

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was really too astonishing.

Though Battle Armor was made from a very, very small amount of Divine Metal, it was still born from a concentrated effort of a technological realm. From a certain aspect, technology was actually also a cultivation technique as it was also about how to use power.

High-tier Battle Armor was extremely sturdy. Otherwise, if it were to be damaged at the first moment in a battle, what use would it be then?

But now?

Everyone was gaping widely, watching numbly as Ling Han tore apart the Battle Armor with his bare hands. That was truly barbaric, violent, and too f****** shocking!

Even Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang were rendered speechless. Ling Han truly was an extreme, powerful man.

However, only after a while, Tang Yuan laughed loudly, and said, “Zhao Shuang, thank you for your three Brahman Celestial Flowers. Added together, I have earned six of them from you!”

Zhao Shuang was speechless. The gaze he directed at Ling Han was filled with anger. Why was this guy so strong? Why couldn’t he just die obediently?

“This is only the sixth battle.” He regained his composure. “Subsequently… the tournament authorities will deploy even more elites. To attain the title of Blood Martial King is as difficult as trying to ascend the heavens.”

However, Tang Yuan was filled with confidence in Ling Han this time. “Zhao Shuang, then we’ll just make another wager later.”

Zhao Shuang did not reply. He was absolutely uncertain about Ling Han’s strength at present, nor did he know what kind of elite the tournament authorities would deploy next, so how could he dare to take up this wager so rashly?

Furthermore, Brahman Celestial Flower was too valuable. By now, he had already lost six in succession, and who knew how harshly his old man would be scolding him. How could Zhao Shuang possibly dare to be rash again?

However, he was sure that the tournament authorities would definitely mobilize a true elite in the 10th battle to stop Ling Han from becoming a Blood Martial King.

Zhao Shuang would bet on the 10th battle, and win everything he had lost back in one stroke. In fact, he was determined to win a much greater amount than that.

In the arena.

As Ling Han ripped and tore the armor apart, Sai Ang appeared in front of him, his expression filled with terror. He was like a completely helpless beauty that had encountered a pervert; he could only shriek shrilly and panic.

His whole body was shaking, and even the blond hair on his skin seemed to be dancing.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “What were you saying just now? I didn’t hear very clearly, so please repeat.”

How could Sai Ang dare to repeat his words? He was far more shocked than any other. Firstly, he was directly involved, and it was he that was facing the immediate danger of death. Secondly, only he knew that his Battle Armor had truly been upgraded, and far surpassed the level of Third Heaven.

Ling Han was a monster; why was it he, Sai Ang, that came to fight him?

“Hehe, I was joking around. Brother, don’t take it seriously.” Sai Ang forced out a smile.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and patted Sai Ang’s shoulder. “Then I am just playing around with you as well.”

Pa, with a strike of his palm, Sai Ang was directly split apart with a?peng.

His legs, arms, and head were all removed, as if he had been torn apart by five?horses1. However, how could a Celestial King die so easily? In fact, as long as Ling Han did not continue his attack, Sai Ang could just piece his body back again, and not even a serious injury would be left behind.

“Brother, as long as you are happy.” Sai Ang still had to force a grin.

He did not beg for mercy. That was because forfeiting was useless in the tournament grounds. If he wanted to live, he could only run to the safety passage by himself.

Ling Han cracked a grin. “Sure then!”

He delivered another palm strike.?Peng, Sai Ang’s body had been completely turned into a mist of blood.

“Aiyo, I’ve used too much force,” Ling Han mumbled. Naturally, he would not take it to heart. His opponent had aimed to kill him from the very beginning, and there was no need to have mercy on this kind of character.

“Li Long wins!” the commentator announced loudly.

“Li Long! Li Long! Li Long!” Everyone was shouting Ling Han’s alias, excited and exhilarated.

Though Ling Han knew that these people were actually very sick, and very psychotic as well, to have over 10,000 Celestial Kings cheering in such mania and frenzy for him still caused some ripple in his emotions as he was influenced by their mood.

No wonder the people here were so crazy. If one battled here for too long, probably even the most normal person would be driven mad, right? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ling Han immediately strengthened his resolve. The purpose he had come to battle here was for the sake of greater strength, and not for bloodshed, nor to satisfy some inner vanity of his or the expectations of others.

He left the tournament ground. Tang Yuan personally came to greet him, unlike previously, when he would just leave by himself, and only host a celebration for him when they were back at the courtyard.

The victory of the sixth battle had extraordinary significance.

Ling Han still submitted. He naturally would not take this seriously. Tang Yuan was the type to mercilessly become hostile. Now, it was only because Ling Han still had value for him to exploit that he was willing to coax him, but as long as there was a conflict with his interests, he would definitely abandon Ling Han without any hesitation.

Tang Yuan was slightly restless. He had taken too many losses from Lu Li, and was determined to get his own back. Ling Han was his ray of hope.

With this kind of prerequisite, he did not mind giving Ling Han the highest level of treatment.

This caused those lackeys of his to be extremely jealous, and the gazes they directed at Ling Han were extremely unfriendly. However, Ling Han’s “royal favor” was presently strong. They did not dare do anything against Ling Han. In fact, some people even called Ling Han “Brother Long.”

Tang Yuan was hurrying things along, wanting to arrange the seventh battle as quickly as possible. However, the tournament was the territory of the Azure Ghost Celestial King. He could exert some pressure, but if he actually wanted to call the shots, he had to be dreaming.

Half a month later, the opponent for the seventh battle was finally confirmed.

This time, Tang Yuan was informed in advance. The opponent’s name was Li He.

“Li He!” After hearing this name, Tang Yuan became serious again. He had a considerable amount of intel in his possession, and he could find out about all kinds of information about Li He just by flipping through it.

This man had once obtained nine successive wins in the tournament, and he himself was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, being much stronger than Sai Ang had been.

“No worries. Li Long has battle prowess on the level of the Blood Martial King. Even if he has a disadvantage of a cultivation level, he would still definitely win!” Tang Yuan boosted his own confidence.

The next day, the second battle began.

When the commentator had introduced the fighters on both sides, all the spectators began to support Li He all over again.

After all, Ling Han had only shown his outstanding ability, but Li He was a “veteran” here. He had gone through hundreds of battles and still survived. In itself, this was a kind of display of strength.

Li He was a middle-aged man with a thin build, four streaks of peculiar light wrapped around him. Both of his arms were extremely dried up and thin, and dark as well, as if they were wooden logs that had been charred black. But as they moved, cold light reflected off of them like they were metallic.

Ling Han saw very clearly that the man’s palms and wrists were covered with seals. They were actually very vague, but they could not deceive his eyes.

“If you don’t want to die, then crawl through here, and get lost!” Li He demanded. He spread open his legs, and pointed between his legs with a finger. His meaning could not be clearer.

…Faked battles were definitely forbidden in the tournament grounds. It was absolutely forbidden to forfeit without even a battle. Even if one escaped from this battle arena, they would still be apprehended by the tournament authorities and executed.

Li He was only humiliating Ling Han.

Hearing these words, the people on the spectators’ seats were greatly excited, screaming shrilly.

Ling Han looked around. Were these people really Celestial Kings? Why was it that there was no difference between them and ordinary people at the marketplace?

Was the influence of surroundings really so strong?

“Brat, I am talking to you, and you actually dare to act as if you haven’t heard me?” Li He uttered coldly. “Do you know how the last person who angered me died?”

Ling Han smiled slightly. “How?”
