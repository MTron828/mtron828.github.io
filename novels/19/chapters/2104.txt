Chapter 2105: Ah, I’ve Made a Mistake

However, Yang Xiao had rashly charged forward, and he had even abandoned all of his defenses. That being the case, how could he dodge now?

‘But I’ve sacrificed my defense to unleash this attack, so how are you going to block me?

‘You were clearly meant to make me the hero, yet you’re making this into a loss for both sides! Just what in the world are you doing?!’

Yang Xiao couldn’t help but roar at the lack of professionalism of these people in his mind. What the f*ck was Xiong Si doing? Hadn’t they already discussed this several days ago? Yet, he had still sent such amateurs over to perform today.

Peng!

Yang Xiao’s palm was quicker than the green smoke as it struck Brother Jun’s chest. Initially, he had only wanted to wound his opponent. After all, this was only a performance. However, in his fit of rage, he didn’t retract much of his power, so his attack would definitely deal severe wounds to his opponents.

Yet, when his palm struck, Brother Jun’s chest instantly became extremely soft and flexible.

Yang Xiao was deeply astonished as he stared at Brother Jun transforming into a puddle of green liquid. A fragrant sweet scent wafted into his nose. This was a scent that could immediately render people unconscious.

‘Poisonous physique!’ he immediately exclaimed in his mind.

This was a type of Divine Fetus, a very rare type at that.

‘So that’s how it is!’

He finally came to a realization. His opponent had purposefully drawn him to launch a rash attack so that he could unleash his poison to attack him. Meanwhile, he would also rely on his Divine Fetus to deal with his attack. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This Divine Fetus was extremely weak, yet it was still more than enough to deal with his attack.

As for Yang Xiao… His situation was as miserable as could be!

‘F*cking hell! You people are taking this performance far too seriously! No one told you to fight with your life on the line, okay?! You people are far too unprofessional! You were clearly meant to be defeated by me, so why are you turning around to defeat me instead?!’

Peng!?Green smoke licked over, completely engulfing Yang Xiao. When the green smoke passed, Yang Xiao had already collapsed to the ground. His entire body was convulsing, and he appeared to be suffering immense pain.

“My poison is called Silent Death and Extermination, and this is a corpse poison that I extracted from the corpse of a celestial. Those who are affected by this poison will be engulfed in an aura of death that renders them immobile. Even if they wish for death, they’ll have no way to die. Only after suffering immense pain for three days and three nights will they transform into a dry corpse,” Brother Jun said in a calm voice. His body had already returned to normal. It was just that he had gone slightly pale.

The power of his Divine Fetus was truly very weak. Thus, unleashing an attack with it had also drained all of his power and put significant stress on his body. He felt extremely unwell at this moment.

‘Motherf*cker!’

Yang Xiao couldn’t speak, so he could only glare at this person in fury.

‘What’s the meaning of this? What the f*ck is the meaning of this? You were meant to perform, yet what the f*ck are you people doing now? You even unleashed the Silent Death and Extermination on me? Exterminate your entire f*cking family!’

These people were far too unprofessional! When he returned, he would definitely protest to his fourth brother.

“Senior Brother Yang!” Chen Shuangshuang exclaimed. Her mind was kind of slow, and she only came to her senses at this moment. Because Yang Xiao had enjoyed an advantage the entire time, she hadn’t expected that he would collapse so suddenly.

“Hahahaha!” Young Master Bing roared with laughter. “How is it? Does anyone else refuse to yield?”

He stepped on Yang Xiao’s head, and he even pressed down with his foot, causing Yang Xiao’s head to slightly deform.

“Senior Brother Yang! Senior Brother Yang!” Chen Shuangshuang exclaimed in concern. This wasn’t because she liked him, but because they were from the same sect. She hurriedly turned to Ling Han, and said, “Please save my senior brother!”

Ling Han smiled in reply, saying, “It’s no big deal. His skin is thick, so he won’t die from this.”

Yang Xiao almost fainted in anger. Was this a problem of dying or not? This was far too humiliating!

Perhaps these fools had made a mistake and mistaken Ling Han for him? So they were waiting for Ling Han to step forward to save the beauties?

‘F*ck! Where are these fools from? They’re f*cking blind, the lot of them!’

Tap, tap, tap…

There was the sound of hurried footsteps as nine people crawled out from the blue mulberry forest. Like Young Master Bing and the others, these people were all radiating with the auras of thugs. All they needed to do was write the word “thug” on their foreheads to complete their getup.

“Oh, what beautiful women. Let this brother— Huh?” The nine people immediately started to harass the Empress and the others when they arrived, yet they couldn’t help but feel astonished when they saw Yang Xiao lying on the ground.

Why was the protagonist lying on the ground? How could they still continue this performance?

‘Huh?’

Even though Yang Xiao couldn’t move, because he was facing this direction, he could still see everything clearly.

Of these nine people, he could recognize at least four of them. Moreover, their leader was none other than Xiao Cheng!

‘Hang on a second… Hang on a second… F*ck! I’ve made a mistake!

‘The seven people just then weren’t from the Vicious Bear Gang at all! They were genuine thugs!

‘F*ck! No wonder they were so violent and ferocious! They weren’t acting at all! Gasp!’

He couldn’t help but draw another cold breath. Since that was the case… wasn’t he facing the danger of death in Young Master Bing’s hands?

He was acutely aware of just how domineering these young masters were. They wouldn’t bat an eyelid at killing people.

If he revealed his Heavenly Saint Palace identity, these people definitely wouldn’t dare to touch him. In fact, they would even fall to their knees in terror and beg for forgiveness. However, the problem was that he couldn’t speak at all right now! He couldn’t unleash his divine sense, either, and he was much like a living corpse.

The people from the Vicious Bear Gang faltered. What in the world was going on? The performance had already finished before they arrived? Moreover, the protagonist had been defeated?

“Hurry! Hurry up and save Young Master Yang!” they hurriedly shouted.

They then charged forward to face off with Young Master Bing and the others.

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face. He turned to Chen Shuangshuang, and said, “Look, he has heaps of friends. He doesn’t need our help at all.”

Young Master Bing humphed, and said, “Who are you people? You dare to act with such audacity before me?”

“Who gives a sh*t about you?! Hurry up and release Young Master Yang!” Xiao Cheng shouted.

“You actually dare to refer to someone else as young master before me?” Young Master Bing said with a humph. “I’m very angry, and the consequences are very severe!” He paused for a moment before continuing in a baleful voice, “Kill them, kill all of them!”

“As you wish, Young Master!” The thugs behind him immediately lunged forward. However, Brother Jun stepped back. After using the power of his Divine Fetus, he was now in an extremely weak and frail state. His battle prowess was far inferior compared to before, so he naturally couldn’t participate in this battle.

“Die! Save Young Master Yang!” Xiao Cheng and the others roared. They drew their sabers and swords as they charged forward.

Cling! Clang!

A chaotic battle instantly ensued.

These people were initially meant to be defeated by the heroic protagonist, yet with a shake, they had become the heroes trying to rescue the “beauty”. This was an incredible transformation.

‘Interesting, how very interesting.’

Ling Han retrieved a few wooden stools from the Black Tower. He handed them to the Empress, Hu Niu, and the others. At the same time, he even retrieved some sunflower seeds to snack on.

Chen Shuangshuang was dazed upon seeing this. ‘You people are far too calm, no? Everyone’s fighting right now, and so be it if you don’t help. Yet, you’re snacking on sunflower seeds as you watch on? Do you still care about other people’s feelings?’

“Don’t worry, take a seat,” Ling Han said as he retrieved another stool. As he did this, he also passed her some sunflower seeds.

“Huh? Spiritual sunflower seeds!” Chen Shuangshuang immediately exclaimed. She had quite a keen eye.

Spiritual Sunflowers were Celestial medicines, and their seeds were more so the essence. Thus, they were as valuable as could be.

“Its medicinal age is only one billion years or so. It’s not mature enough for alchemical pills, so just treat it as a snack,” Ling Han said with a smile.

‘Treat Celestial medicines as a snack?’

Chen Shuangshuang was astounded. Although Celestial medicines of one billion years old were indeed insufficient to be called Great Herbs, it was still far too wasteful to treat them as mere snacks!

However, she liked this.

In any case, her mind was extremely simple. She was only at the third severance, and she was far weaker than Yang Xiao. Thus, since even Yang Xiao was no match for these people, what help would she be? That being the case, this fight could be dealt with by other people. She would just sit back and enjoy the show lest she made matters worse.

And thus, she also sat down and started to snack on sunflower seeds as she spectated the battle.

‘F*ck! I’m still lying here with my life and death hanging in the balance!’

A miserable wail sounded in Yang Xiao’s mind.
