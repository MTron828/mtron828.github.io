Chapter 2334 Rapid Rise

“What’s going on?”

“The Hundred Battles Academy is suddenly unleashing its might?”

“They’re missing You Yuan, so how can they be so powerful?”

“That’s right! And there are even four of them holidaying next to a lake. With only five people, they actually defeated so many teams in half a day?”

“Incredible!”

This attracted the attention of many elites. However, even though the scores and rankings would update in real-time, the live streams on the smooth stone couldn’t be controlled. They could only observe the places that were shown. They couldn’t choose to follow a specific team.

Qi Shuang and Yuan exchanged a glance. Perhaps Xun Feng and the others had unleashed their might?

These little brats were truly able to endure. They had caused them to needlessly worry for more than a dozen days.

‘Very well, continue to charge! Break into the top 200 in a single breath!’

Qi Shuang and Yuan were astonished to discover that their prayers were actually answered. The Hundred Battles Academy continued to rise up the ranks, charging from the 400’s into the 300’s, and then from the 300’s toward the 200’s. However, the higher the rankings, the greater the difference between the number of beacons. This caused the Hundred Battles Academy’s charge to slow down. Instead of soaring up the rankings by dozens of places at a time, they could only climb up by four or five places at a time, and then two or three places, and then finally one or two places.

“214th.”

“213th.”

“212th.”

The two elites continued to observe the rankings. They never knew that they had such a hobby. When the Hundred Battles Academy finally broke into the top 200, they were so excited that they even embraced in joy. However, they immediately separated upon realizing this.

F*ck! An insect and a Holy Beast had actually embraced? This was an absolute joke! This was akin to a demon getting together with an angel. They would be jeered at by most people!

In any case, this wasn’t their final ranking. The Hundred Battles Academy continued to climb the leaderboard, going from 190th to 180th, and then to 170th. Even though their rise was slow, there was still a great deal of time remaining. Judging from this trend, it was almost certain that they would break into the top 100.

Qi Shuang and Yuan were absolutely delighted “Huh?!”

However, they quickly realized that the Hundred Battles Academy’s score had stopped rising. In fact, it had even fallen a little. Even though it wasn’t significant, it had resulted in their rank falling by a few positions as well.

What was going on?

Inside the mystery realm.

Ling Han and the others were being blocked by an attractive woman from the Angel Race. Her demeanor was graceful, and her beauty was breathtaking. Her snow-white wings were radiating with purity and holiness, yet it was her aura that more so astonished Ling Han and the others. Her aura was like the sea, vast and profound.

“Hand over your beacons,” Jing Zhongyue said calmly. Only a single person was worthy of being her opponent—that was Huai Jian, the person who sat atop the throne. The others weren’t even worthy of a single glance.

Fighting spirit burned in Ling Han’s eyes. The Foreign Realm was truly brimming with prodigies. He had initially thought that only Huai Jian was worthy of being his opponent, yet he had first come across Xu Xing, and he had now come across this woman from the Angel Race. They all caused him to burn with fighting spirit. They were definitely worthy opponents.

No wonder the Celestial Realm could only suffer suppression. The environment of heaven and earth was different, so the gulf between the prodigies of the two realms was also astounding.

He took a step forward.

Boom!

His aura rose explosively.

Jing Zhongyue faltered upon seeing this. Her opponent’s aura could actually rival hers.

Such a person existed in the world?

“Huai Jian!” she exclaimed in a solemn voice. However, she immediately shook her head. Even though Huai Jian was also a man, he was from the Angel Race. Meanwhile, the man before her was a legitimate demon. The difference between them was far too great.

“Who are you?” she asked.

“Ba!” Ling Han replied calmly. “From the Hundred Battles Academy.”

Jing Zhongyue was astonished. Hundred Battles Academy? She was indeed aware of this academy. However, she couldn’t recall any powerful prodigy from this academy. ‘Oh, that’s right, they have a monarch star called You something. However, his name definitely wasn’t Ba.’

“Jing Zhongyue, from the Purple Flutter Academy,” she said in introduction. She didn’t dare to underestimate Ling Han. Instead, she already treated him as an opponent. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have announced her identity-weaklings weren’t worthy of learning her name.

“Show me your strength!” she said.

Ling Han clenched his fists, and replied, “Sure thing!”

Xiu!

Like a beautiful and graceful crane, Jing Zhongyue rapidly swooped over. With a flap of her arms, hundreds of bursts of Sword Qi instantly materialized in the air, blotting out heaven and earth as they shot toward Ling Han.

Ling Han was naturally unfazed. He unleashed his Fists of Fury, unleashing large attacks that were as mystical as could be.

The two prodigies exchanged blows, facing each other head-on. In the blink of an eye, they had already completed more than 100 exchanges.

As they watched on, Hu Niu and the Empress also started to brim with fighting spirit. They weren’t resigned to standing on the sidelines. However, there was seemingly a gulf between the Tenth Secret and the Eleventh Secret, one that was astoundingly large. If one couldn’t surmount this gulf, they would have no right to participate in the ultimate competition of the Thousand Academy Tournament.

No, they definitely had to advance to the Eleventh Secret as soon as possible. Otherwise, they wouldn’t even have the right to battle against prodigies such as Jing Zhongyue and Xu Xing.

Xiu, xiu!

Jing Zhongyue and Ling Han separated, with neither of them attacking again.

“Doing battle here has far too many restrictions,” Jing Zhongyue said. “You deserve a place on the Elite Leaderboard. I look forward to battling with you then.”

Ling Han nodded in acknowledgment. This woman was indeed powerful. However, he didn’t feel like he couldn’t win. This was because his physique was unfathomably powerful. At the same time, it was also because he had comprehended the Regulations of the two realms. No monarch star from the Foreign Realm had achieved the same feat.

“We’ll battle then.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jing Zhongyue left with grace. Meanwhile, Hu Niu and the Empress didn’t have any more interest in doing battle. They both entered the Black Tower to cultivate. They yearned to advance as quickly as possible.

Ling Han continued to hunt other teams with Bewitching Maiden Rou. Even though they were few in number, their battle prowess had barely been reduced at all. This was naturally because of Ling Han’s presence. A prodigy at the Eleventh Leaf was equivalent to 10 or even up to 20 prodigies at the Tenth Leaf. As long as he didn’t come across a fellow Eleventh Leaf prodigy, Ling Han could easily defeat everyone else.

In fact, it could be said that as long as he didn’t come across supreme freaks such as Xu Xing and Jing Zhongyue, he could defeat all other Eleventh Leaf monarch stars such as You Yuan within 100 strikes.

Day after day passed, and when they reached the 25th day, the Hundred Battles Academy had already broken into the top 100 on the leaderboard.

Qi Shuang and Yuan were overjoyed upon seeing this. Even though the ranking battles would beat them back into their original shape, leaving them ranked 99th or 100th, this would only be a small drop in ranking compared to last time. Moreover, when the next tournament came around, Ling Han, the Empress, and the others would have already matured, while Huai Jian and the other heaven-defying freaks would have already moved on. At that time, it would be the Hundred Battles Academy’s turn to reign supreme.

Inside the mystery realm, Ling Han naturally didn’t know the ranking of their team. However, because he needed to guarantee a top-100 ranking, he didn’t stop robbing other teams of their beacons. In fact, several teams with Eleventh Secret monarch stars fell victim to him as well, falling back into poverty. It was very likely that they would be eliminated if they didn’t obtain enough beacons again.

Being eliminated even though their teams included Eleventh Secret monarch stars?

What could they do about this? Who told them to suffer such great misfortune?

Outside the mystery realm, the elites from these academies all wore grim expressions. The first round was already drawing to a close, yet their academies had suddenly suffered such a huge blow. They had instantly descended to hell.

Meanwhile, the grins of Qi Shuang and Yuan were almost reaching their ears. They were definitely going to heap praise on Xun Feng and the others when the latter came out.
