Chapter 291: Ousting Strange Fire

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

What was called having the crowd on its feet? This was.

When everyone looked towards Ling Han again, their gazes had fanaticism, and even the three alchemy bigshots weren’t exceptions; they placed the Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill into the jade bottle and reverently returned it to Ling Han, as if looking at a deity.

This was definitely a future king of alchemy who was worth the worship of all alchemists.

Ling Han smiled lightly and said, “I’m now an Earth Grade alchemist, right?

“Yes, most definitely!” Long Yong Zhang and the other alchemy bigshots nodded repeatedly; he wasn’t only an Earth Grade alchemist, but even one who could immediately become a medium level or high level Earth Grade alchemist—utterly kickass.

Ling Han looked towards Cheng Fei Jun whose expression was already ashen, and said with a smile, “Little Cheng, why don’t you pay respect to this master?”

Cheng Fei Jun bit his lip to the point of bleeding. Now three Earth Grade alchemists acknowledged Ling Han’s status, and under everyone’s glare, how could he refuse to acknowledge he lost the bet?

If he knelt down, then his life would be over.

“Hmph, you still haven’t gotten the certificate, so if you say you’re an Earth Grade alchemist, then you are one?” He acted shameless as expected.

Yong Long Zhang immediately revealed a displeased expression and said, “Cheng Fei Jun, Master Ling just refined a Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill, did you not witness it with your own eyes? Besides, we three can prove it, and you still doubt master Ling’s status. What are you implying?”

Cheng Fei Jun clenched his teeth and said, “No matter what, unless he takes out a certificate of an Earth Grade alchemist, I won’t believe it in a million years!”

The Starlight Hall had no right to grant Earth Grade certificates. It had to be reported to north region’s Alchemist Society’s Headquarters, and after a series of steps, then the alchemist certificate could be issued.

Walking through these procedures had to take a month’s time.

Cheng Fei Jun used this fact to stubbornly refuse to admit defeat.

Ling Han laughed slightly and said, “You won’t be convinced until you’re faced with the grim reality?” Daring to refuse defeat, was Cheng Fei Jun seeking death?

He took large strides toward Cheng Fei Jun.

“What, you want to get rough with me?” Cheng Fei Jun sneered. His abilities in alchemy were inferior to Ling Han’s, but in battle prowess, he wouldn’t cower; he was at the seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier!

Ling Han reached out, grabbing towards Cheng Fei Jun.

“Impuence!” Cheng Fei Jun snorted, and raised his hand to counter.

Pa!

A mere seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier couldn’t possibly be Ling Han’s opponent, right? As he raised his hand, Ling Han soon suppressed it; he couldn’t help but stare wide-eyed with an expression of extreme disbelief.

“Acting shamelessly in front of me, where do you get the confidence?” Peng, peng, peng, peng, Ling Han greeted with a series of normal punches, beating Cheng Fei Jun who screamed repeatedly.

Everyone looked at each other, no one daring to stop the fight.

Ling Han was an Earth Grade alchemist, and was highly likely to surpass Yong Long Zhang and the other two Earth Grade alchemists, becoming a medium level, or even a high level Earth Grade alchemist—who would want to offend him? Moreover, Cheng Fei Jun certainly had terrible gambling manners. He downright lost, but still fought with his back against the wall, completely inviting a beating for himself.

After beating Cheng Fei Jun as if he were a dead dog, Ling Han carried him, smiled at everyone, and said, “I still have some debt to take care of with him, be right back.”

Everyone thought that Ling Han wanted to contently punch Cheng Fei Jun, hurriedly nodding their heads that Cheng Fei Jun deserved what he got for going against a great alchemist. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Han carried the unconscious Cheng Fei Jun into a pill refining room. The walls here weren’t transparent, and his figure immediately flashed, bringing Cheng Fei Jun into the Black Tower. In this space, he was like a god; stripping away Cheng Fei Jun’s Strange Fire was as easy as could be.

As expected, a ball of cyan flame immediately surfaced from within Cheng Fei Jun’s body, and Ling Han’s Strange Fire immediately revealed its excitement and sent a thought to Ling Han, “Yi ya ya!” It wanted to devour this ball of cyan flame.

Ling Han swung his hand, and a crimson-colored Strange Fire instantly surfaced, diving towards the cyan flame without hesitation.

The two balls of flames instantly started fighting.

This was a battle between the Strange Fires. Whichever won would devour the other, enabling its own growth while the opponent would forever disappear. In a battle like this, Ling Han couldn’t interfere even if he were the dictator here.

However, Ling Han’s Strange Fire was birthed from a Shattering Void Tier warrior’s body, its level was extremely high. Besides, the Black Tower also strengthened it, and its power increased drastically, soon letting it gain the upper hand.

The two balls of Strange Fire started to fuse and the cyan flame began disappearing at a visible rate, while the crimson flame became brighter and brighter.

Ling Han was done. He took Cheng Fei Jun out of the Black Tower, offhandedly throwing him to the side. If it weren’t for the Strange Fire, why would he even bother to argue with a nobody? This time, he just happened to need to take the test for the Earth Grade, and receiving a Strange Fire in passing was quite the great bonus.

As he came to the large hall, Yong Long Zhang and the others were already waiting here, and all of them expressed a sign of respect towards Ling Han.

Ling Han thanked them one by one, then brought Hu Niu back to the inn, agreeing to return in a few days.

He had to get the Earth Grade certificate before he left, so he was certainly staying here for a while, but Yong Long Zhan and the other two Earth Grade alchemists promised they would acquire Ling Han’s certificate as soon as possible and wouldn’t make him wait long.

Zhu He Xin spoke about Ling Han advancing into the Earth Grade to others, instantly making Guang Yuan and the rest stare dumbfounded. It had only been a few days, and Ling Han had advanced into Earth Grade from high level Black Grade—who could believe this?

However, they immediately became excited—following an Earth Grade alchemist, would they still worry about not having medicinal pills to take?

Sigh, they were bound to be medicine decocting pots for other people to envy!

They immediately called for a celebration for Ling Han. However, their true aim was food—Ling Han’s fruits, vegetables, and meat were truly too delicious, making them keep thinking about them.

Actually, they didn’t even know Ling Han had a vegetable garden that could provide for the entire Rain Country; otherwise, they wouldn’t occasionally bring up the request. They assumed that these worldly delicacies were definitely extremely rare.

At night, in the town’s north area in a quite courtyard.

Cheng Fei Jun wore complete black and appeared like a thief, knocking on the door three lengthy times and two short times. Creak, the door opened, and a fourteen- to fifteen-year-old boy appeared expressionlessly, making way without saying a word.

Cheng Fei Jun figure shifted and entered into the courtyard, walking in quick steps. With only a few steps, he arrived at the main lobby, where an unprepossessing old man sat and drank tea. At a closer look, one could see that his complexion was strangely pale.

“My respects to Lord Luo!” Cheng Fei Jun hurriedly knelt down to pay respects; his arrogant and rampant attitude already disappeared without a trace

“Ten days one report, why have you come early?” the old man surnamed Luo spoke, his voice hoarse, thoroughly seeping with a thread of eeriness.

At this time, the boy also walked into the main lobby and stood behind the old man. Under the light, the boy’s appearance could clearly be seen—a blushed and white face of an indescribable eccentricity... or rather, he put on powder and rouge.

Why would a boy smear powder and rouge over his face?
