Chapter 2106: Truth

“Delicious!”

“Wonderful performance!”

“So fun!”

Ling Han and the others could all be considered as unreliable people. They continued to snack on sunflower seeds as they spectated the battle. This was truly a good way to pass time.

Meanwhile, even though there were only five people from Young Master Bing’s side in the battle, each of them was at the peak stage of the first severance. Their battle prowess was superior, so it wasn’t long before they suppressed Xiao Cheng and the others.

“Bunch of trash!”

“Kill them all!”

“Die!”

They were brimming with killing intent, and they were ruthless as they attacked. They were going to kill Xiao Cheng and the others.

Pu! Pu! Pu!

Blood sprayed through the air, and severed limbs danced in the sky. The battle prowess of those from the Vicious Bear Gang was extremely uneven, so how could they rival the might of these five people? They instantly crumbled in defeat.

After a dozen or so exchanges three of them collapsed, dead.

Chen Shuangshuang couldn’t maintain her composure any longer. Regardless of how simple her mind was, she couldn’t remain unwavering after seeing those people killed.

Meanwhile, Ling Han crossed his legs with a smile, and said, “Don’t worry, it’s merely two dogs going at each other.” He paused for a moment before continuing, “Your senior brother is acquainted with the group who came later, and he had initially planned to have them harass you. At that time, he would then step forward and play the hero who saved the beauties. Unexpectedly, however, some people came over to ruin his good show, which has led to the situation now.”

“I don’t believe you!” Chen Shuangshuang immediately shouted. She wouldn’t allow her senior brother to be slandered like this.

“Whether I’m speaking nonsense or not, I urge you to carefully think about it yourself,” Ling Han said.

Chen Shuangshuang carefully mulled over this, and she immediately discovered several suspicious points.

For example, Young Master Yang had clearly been going easy on Young Master Bing’s underlings at the start. This wasn’t like him. Moreover, Xiao Cheng and the others had also acted like thugs when they arrived, and they had even spoken to harass them. After seeing Young Master Yang on the ground, however, they had immediately changed their attitude.

After eliminating all of the impossibilities, no matter how inconceivable the result was, it would still be the truth!

‘Senior Brother Yang… is actually such kind of person!

‘Despicable! Shameless! Dirty!’

Chen Shuangshuang was indeed simple-minded. However, this was different from being stupid. Otherwise, how could she have become a disciple of the Heavenly Saint Palace?

She immediately returned to her seat. As she glanced at Yang Xiao, the anger in her mind blazed increasingly fierce.

He actually wanted to steal her heart like this?

How preposterous! If she were so easy to move, she would have married someone millions of years ago!

“It’s not this simple,” Ling Han continued in a leisurely voice. “Together with the Vicious Bear Gang—oh, that’s right, the group of thugs who arrived later are from the Vicious Bear Gang. Anyhow, he had already planned this out with them. After capturing you, they were going to feed you some aphrodisiac or whatnot.”

“H-how shameless!” Chen Shuangshuang chided in fury. She could barely contain herself from charging over to stomp on Yang Shuang’s face.

A look of slight astonishment spread across Yang Xiao’s face. It wasn’t that he wasn’t deeply astonished, but rather that his muscles were far too rigid and stiff at this moment, rendering him unable to move them. There was utter shock in his mind. How did Ling Han know about this?

“You’re even more shameless than me!” Young Master Bing said as he stomped on Yang Xiao’s face. “I only tried to forcefully capture them, but you! Even evil people don’t try to trick others like this! Accept my disdain!”

Yang Xiao felt so frustrated that he wanted to die. He was actually being looked down on by Young Master Bing!

“Ah…!” Xiao Cheng suddenly roared in fury.

Boom!

A black aura suddenly burst forth from his body. This was neither mist nor smoke, yet it was incredibly thick and dense. This aura flooded an area of nine meters around his body, and it almost completely covered his figure.

However, his aura instantly became several times more powerful, and it was as if he were a completely different person.

“Hmm?” Ling Han instantly stood up.

It wasn’t Xiao Cheng’s strength that surprised him. In reality, he wouldn’t be surprised even if Xiao Cheng were 10,000 times more powerful. Rather, he was already very familiar with this aura.

This was another cultivation system.

Ling Han recalled the island that he had gone to, and he recalled how the people there would accept those who had suffered disasters at sea. They would lure these people into darkness, manipulating them into believing their so-called deity. They would introduce them to another cultivation system, and this was in order to overthrow the current heaven and earth.

Some survivors had left the island long ago, and they were spreading the belief of this so-called deity in the Celestial Realm. They were also advocating the different cultivation system, thereby severing the foundations of the current heaven and earth.

Of course, this advocation naturally couldn’t occur among large and powerful sects. Instead, it would only occur among low-level cultivators.

Ling Han had initially thought that this cultivation system would only spread among those under the Celestial level. By the looks of it, however, he had been far too optimistic.

The situation was already extremely dire.

Anyhow, Xiao Cheng’s transformation instantly turned the tides of the battle.

Brother Jun had also defeated Yang Xiao using the element of surprise. Otherwise, with how king tiers could dominate ordinary cultivators, how could Yang Xiao have been defeated and captured? Now, Xiao Cheng was doing the same thing.

Boom!

Xiao Cheng was like the demon lord of a dark world. Even though he clearly hadn’t summoned any power of Regulations, each of his attacks was brimming with destructive power. No one dared to face his attacks head-on, and they could only flee in disarray.

Xiao Cheng charged at Young Master Bing, and Brother Jun immediately stepped forward in an attempt to block him. However, how could his battle prowess rival that of Xiao Cheng? He gritted his teeth, and 10 rings immediately appeared on his fingers again. With a crack, these rings exploded in unison, sending a plume of green smoke into the surroundings.

However, Xiao Cheng didn’t dodge or evade, and his hands stabbed at Brother Jun’s chest like a razor-sharp saber.

Brother Jun activated the same technique again, transforming his body into a poisonous green liquid.

As long as their cultivation level was equivalent, no one could hope to wound him when he was in this form. Of course, this “invincibility” could only last for a brief moment. Moreover, being forced to activate the power of his Divine Fetus twice in a day, he was definitely going to suffer severe wounds.

Pu!

Xiao Cheng’s hands stabbed down, causing a fountain of blood to spray into the air. Brother Jun’s poisonous physique was utterly useless against him.

Brother Jun wore a dazed expression as he stared at his opponent. He could feel that his heart had already been ruptured. Moreover, an indescribable power of destruction was spreading from his heart into his mind and divine sense. This was an unstoppable power.

In an instant, his divine sense was completely obliterated into nothingness.

He was filled with grief and vexation. Even his Divine Fetus had failed to block this strike? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

‘Impossible!’

If he had known this earlier, he definitely wouldn’t have come here! He had only wanted to ride on the Long Clan’s coattail, and he certainly hadn’t wanted to sacrifice his life for them!

Ling Han faltered for a moment before coming to a realization.

Even though Divine Fetuses were powerful, and even though Brother Jun’s poisonous physique could allow him to resist all abilities for a brief moment, these “abilities” only referred to the Regulations of this heaven and earth. However, Xiao Cheng belonged to another cultivation system, so he naturally wouldn’t be affected by this Divine Fetus.

These were two contrasting heavens and earth. This was the standoff between two different heavens and earth.

Young Master Bing hurriedly fled in fright. Fortunately, Xiao Cheng’s target was only Yang Xiao, so he didn’t give chase, allowing Young Master Bing to escape.

Xiao Cheng immediately snatched Young Master Yang over, shouting, “Young Master Yang! Young Master Yang!”

If Yang Xiao were able to, he would definitely leap up and furiously slap this person.

‘Are you f*cking blind?! Can’t you see that I’ve been poisoned, and can’t speak or move at all? What the f*ck are you shouting about?! Hurry up and find someone to treat me!’

However, it was a shame that Xiao Cheng’s intelligence was truly limited. He continued to aimlessly shout, not knowing what else to do.

“Let’s go! Let’s go!” Young Master Bing shouted. He called on all of his debauched friends to leave. They were indeed no match for Xiao Cheng and the others.

However, Xiao Cheng didn’t give chase, as his mind was completely focused on how to deal with Yang Xiao. If something untoward happened to Yang Xiao, he would definitely be smacked to death by Xiong Si.

Yang Xiao naturally wasn’t worth much. However, he was a chess piece and a seedling. He was someone who would overthrow the Heavenly Saint Palace in the future.

He finally came to his senses at this moment, and he hurriedly lifted Yang Xiao up. He would bring him to the Vicious Bear Gang.

“Hold on,” Ling Han said as he raised an arm to block him.
