2817 Being taught

It was unknown how long had passed. Ling Han only felt the sudden surge in power in his fist technique. With a punch, hundreds of enemies flew into the air simultaneously, and then all of them exploded to bits.

Although he had been able to send hundreds of them flying with a single punch before, at most only dozens of them would have been killed by him on the spot, while the others would only have suffered a little injury.

But this time, his punch was so powerful that he could kill hundreds of people in one go.

Realization came to Ling Han abruptly; he found that the Fists of Fury already possessed Heavenly-Venerable-Tier power.

!!

…He had finally advanced this fist technique to the level of Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Of course, it just recently advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and it would take a long time to fully match his battle prowess of the Third Tier.

When Ling Han came back to his senses, he realized that his body was riddled with injuries, with every wound so deep that even his bones were visible.

Normally, he ought to have lost his battle prowess with such serious injuries, or at least see his battle prowess plummet, not to mention being so severely wounded to the point of just waiting for death, right? But he didn’t feel that way at all. Apart from being exhausted, his battle prowess was at its peak.

He wasn’t surprised, because he knew that all of this had to be an illusion, but it was so real that even a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate could hardly tell the difference; that resulted in no one having passed the test and successfully entering into the palace.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Come on, come on, to say nothing of 1,000,000 or 10,000,000, no matter how many, I will take them all on!”

He continued on with the killing spree. This was an extremely rare chance to train; perhaps only a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate could create such a setup, so it would be too silly not to seize this opportunity.

However, the length of training this time far exceeded Ling Han’s expectations. 10,000 years, 100,000 years, 1,000,000 years… Time continued to pass, but the battle showed no signs of stopping.

This inevitably would make people wonder—would there never be an end to it?

Ling Han firmly believed that since the test was not over yet, he should study the fist technique, so he didn’t waste time. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

2,000,000 years, 5,000,000 years, 10,000,000 years!

Finally, when the count reached 10,000,000 years, there was no new army. Xiu, Ling Han felt his body tremble. He instantly appeared in a new place, and he saw that he was inside a palace.

He looked at his body again. There wasn’t even a little bit of injury, but he exuded a sense of being worn out, as if he had gone through eternity.

“How long have I been out in the world of consciousness?” Ling Han murmured. He checked his body. Having reached his heights, he could calculate how much time had passed just by looking at the subtle changes in his body.

“It was actually 10,000 years!

“Wait, I have fought in the world of consciousness for 10,000,000 years, but the reality is that 10,000 years have passed, which matches exactly the time acceleration effects of my physique.

“At the Heavenly Venerable Tier, it is impossible for the physical body to be either accelerated or decelerated. It is tempered by fundamental power and surpasses the Regulations. Naturally, it is not affected by Regulations. Time could still be accelerated for the spirit, but this acceleration is limited to under 1000 times.

“So, my physical body has been standing here for 10,000 years, but I have been fighting in the spiritual world for 10,000,000 years.”

Ling Han stretched his muscles, and suddenly there was a majestic force roaring within his body. Before, when his consciousness was in another world, his physical body was in hibernation. Now that his consciousness has returned, his body suddenly became as strong as a dragon.

“Yi, my cultivation level has actually improved slightly.”

Ling Han was surprised. With the passing of 10,000 years, his progress was actually faster than when he was practicing cultivation normally, and it was even much faster at that.

“Battle is indeed the fastest way to improve, even in the world of consciousness.

“However, I have too many Powers of Dimension within my body, and unlike other Heavenly Venerates, this kind of power has no limit. I don’t know how long it will take to reach the peak of the First Tier, but it is still not enough for me to break through to the Second Tier.

“Instead, the Fists of Fury…”

Ling Han showed a satisfied smile. After 10,000,000 years, he had advanced the Fists of Fury to the Second Tier, which truly made him happy.

Weng, a skull suddenly floated up in front of Ling Han.

What was going on?

Although it was a skull, it didn’t look hideous at all. The bones were light golden in color, and there was an extremely complicated seal on the skull. It was even more difficult to comprehend than the sum of the stars in the sky.

In fact, Ling Han expressed joy as this was a Heavenly Venerable Seal!

He reached out and touched the skull, and a star chart suddenly appeared in his consciousness, forming a mysterious seal.

Ling Han quickly sat down cross-legged. A Heavenly Venerable Seal could only be transmitted once, so if he was to miss out any detail, it would be impossible to get it again—unless his luck was heaven-defying enough to restore it under some special circumstances.

Time passed quietly, and this star chart was also slowly fading. It would completely dim within three days at most.

However, a thought flashed across Ling Han’s mind. A glow appeared in his mind, and the star map reappeared immediately.

He had preliminarily mastered this Heavenly Venerable Seal, but of course it would be a long, long time before he could use it.

Ling Han looked at the skull in front of him again. The seal on it has disappeared. As the Heavenly Venerable Seal had been passed on to Ling Han, it was naturally impossible for it to continue existing.

Pa, the skull was also shattered, transforming into countless starlight particles, flying in the air, and fusing with the great dao of heaven and earth.

A powerful psychic message also sounded in Ling Han’s consciousness. “I am Four Directions, who has failed in attempting to break through to the Sixth Tier, and has neither disciples nor descendants. In order to avoid losing the lifetime of comprehension I have learned, I have purposely arranged for this huge tomb to store four bones with my mark for the four seals that I have deduced during my lifetime to pass on to those who are predestined.

“If the four seals can be united, it can also be used to deduce a divine skill that I have once used, but if the four seals can’t be combined, then there is no need to mention it.”

Boom, this message disappeared immediately without a trace.

Ling Han stood upright, and bowed deeply towards the palace. “Senior is righteous. This junior is full of admiration.”

In order to pass on what he had learned, the Heavenly Venerate Four Directions even left remains such as his skull. It couldn’t be helped; how could the Heavenly Venerable Seals be borne by any random things?

Generally speaking, whoever it was would die eventually, but wasn’t still being willing to leave his remains abusing himself?

That was why Ling Han was full of respect for the man.

He was not in a hurry to leave, and continued to comprehend the Tenth Seal that he had just obtained. If he didn’t master it as soon as possible, it would also disappear from his mind.

After more than 10 years, Ling Han suddenly discovered that there was an extra person in the palace.

This was a woman, so beautiful that her beauty wasn’t inferior to that of the Empress or Hu Niu at all. However, at this time her eyes were tightly closed, and there weren’t any signs of life on her body.

Ling Han knew that it wasn’t that the other party had died, but that her consciousness had entered another world like his.

…She was fighting bitterly against a million enemies all by herself.

Ling Han couldn’t help taking another glance at this woman. She was so beautiful that it would surely cause people to be intoxicated with her beauty. However, Ling Han immediately extracted himself, sat cross-legged, and attempted to comprehend the Heavenly Venerable Seal in his consciousness.

Time passed quietly. 1,000 years, 5,000 years… Nearly 10,000 years had passed, and Ling Han suddenly opened his eyes.

...

He had completely mastered the Tenth Seal.

When he channeled it, he found that his efficiency in cultivating had increased 17 times.

This not only far surpassed the more widely known seven seals, but also surpassed the Ninth Seal, which came from the fusion of the essence of countless Third Tier Heavenly Venerates.

At this moment, there was a sudden movement of an incomparably powerful aura.
