2667 Alliance through marriage

Wang Qianyang had just been praising Ling Han for his intelligence, yet why was his intelligence inadequate all of a sudden?

Wang Qianyang naturally knew that it was not because Ling Han had suddenly become dumb, but rather that he was tactfully refusing the offer.

Still, Wang Qianyang was very confused. That granddaughter of his was extremely beautiful, and it was not that Ling Han had never seen her before, so why did he refuse without even the slightest bit of consideration?

Meanwhile, Wang Jiayue appeared very embarrassed. Though neither man had spoken bluntly, who could not read the meaning that underlay their words?

Ling Han had actually rejected her.

This opinionated guy, what right did he have to be so arrogant?

Ptui, did he think that he could ignore her just because his cultivation rate was slightly faster, and he could concoct some alchemical pills?

This damned bastard!

Wang Qianyang naturally would not be concerned that his granddaughter was about to explode with fury. He was also an old fox himself. Since Ling Han was already saying this, he would not embarrass himself further, either. Thus, he said, “Then, I will find more Divine Metal for you, young friend.”

“Thank you,” Ling Han answered, smiling.

Wang Qianyang brought his granddaughter with him when he left. Though Ling Han could see that Wang Jiayue was close to exploding with fury, he only acted as if he had not seen anything. When one had reached heights that he had, was there still need to be concerned about a mere First Heaven Celestial King? Even if this Celestial Qi had a very powerful background.

Ling Han continued to concoct alchemical pills. At present, there were two things that he wanted to complete the most. Firstly, to increase the level of the Indestructible Celestial King Physique to the ninth level, and secondly, to advance the Divine Demon Sword to the level of Heavenly Venerate Tool.

To accomplish these two tasks, he required massive wealth, so he could only work hard on concocting alchemical pills.

But the fact that the Wang Clan had intentions of betrothing their princess to Ling Han still spread out. This filled everyone with envy. Wang Jiayue’s conditions were too outstanding. Who did not want to pluck this delicate flower for themselves?

And when Ma Yuhai heard this piece of news, he was so infuriated that he trashed his whole abode.

He was too outraged. In these millions of years, he had been nurturing affection with Wang Jiayue, and just when it seemed like he was about to claim his prize, someone actually interfered. Not only had Ma Yuhai sustained great humiliation, his future bride had also been snatched.

He could not swallow this injustice.

But Ma Yuhai himself was no match for Ling Han. Though he had indeed been careless at the time, when he now replayed the events in his mind, there was no way he could parry this kind of attack even if he used his full effort.

What could he do? Could it be that he could only watch helplessly, and allow Ling Han to mature and grow even more?

‘I’ll find someone to help me.’ Ma Yuhai thought for a long time, and finally came to a decision. Though it was very demeaning that someone with his strength had to find another person to help him to deal with a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, it was still better than his millions of years of effort ending up in nothing. Furthermore, he was indeed very fond of Wang Jiayue as well, so it was not completely because she was useful to him.

Ma Yuhai left his abode, climbing mountains and crossing the distance, and arrived at the foot of a dangerously steep peak. He was just about to ascend the peak when an elder suddenly appeared. His whole figure was stooped, and he coughed repeatedly as he said, “So it is Young Master Hai. May I know why you have come?”

Though this elder’s vitality was declining, and he looked like he would die at any moment, Ma Yuhai did not dare to look down on him in the slightest. This elder had been a powerful man in his youth, and who knew how many strong beings he had killed. Yet, because the ensuing chaos was really too great, he could only hide himself in the World’s Paramount Martial Academy afterwards and wait for things to blow over.

Furthermore, the person standing behind this elder was even more frightening.

“Greetings, Lord Qin Shuang.” Ma Yuhai paid his greetings respectfully. “I have something to see Young Master He about!”

“Young Master is presently in seclusion,” the elder, Qin Shuang, answered.

Ma Yuhai thought for a moment, and then said, “Then please help me, Lord Qin Shuang!” He took out a bottle of alchemical pills, and said, “This is the Heavenly Venerate Pill that my father has concocted through extracting his own blood essence. I am sure it would be of some help to Lord Qin Shuang.”

Qin Shuang’s expression involuntarily changed, and he showed a hint of excitement.

He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Of course, he had long since reached the peak stage, yet had always been troubled by the fact that he could not break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Though Ma Yuhai’s old man was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and the Heavenly Venerate Pill he concocted did not live up to its name, it would still be very helpful to Qin Shuang. It was possible that it could help him glimpse a sliver of the profound secrets of the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Concocting a Heavenly Venerate Pill required extracting one’s own blood essence, and whether for Heavenly Venerates or Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, this was a tremendous expense. They could only concoct a single pill in who knew how many years.

If it were not for the fact that Ma Yuhai’s own father was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, it was probable that even his own grandfather could not bear to use his blood essence to concoct an alchemical pill.

Qin Shuang could not refuse. When one had reached a height that he had, the only thing that was worthy of his attention, and the only matter that he would take to heart, was the matter of breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“What do you want my help with?” Qin Shuang asked.

“To kill a man!” Ma Yuhai said, his expression completely twisted.

“Whom?” Qin Shuang was completely unconcerned. There were countless he had killed years ago, and there was no small number of prodigies among them, either. Naturally, he would not be shaken.

“Ling Han!”

“Tell me his detailed information.”

“Alright.”

***

Ling Han focused on concocting alchemical pills. He could concoct a number of cauldrons in a single day, and he was sure that even with the wealth of the Wang Clan, they would soon be completely drained by his alchemical pills. Of course, the Wang Clan would definitely only be pleased by this. Only when resources could be converted into alchemical pills that could be used would their true value be displayed.

However, his calm days did not last for very long.

Yi suddenly paid him a visit.

“What is it?” Ling Han still took some time out to meet him.

“Ma Yuhai made a public announcement, demanding that you refuse the request for alliance through marriage from the Wang Clan, or he would make you suffer,” Yi said.

Ling Han was surprised. This Ma Yuhai really hadn’t learned enough from his lesson? He had been beaten so terribly, yet now was actually jumping around so energetically again?

Where had his confidence come from?

“No need to give him any regard.” Ling Han shook his head. Still, he had already refused the suggestion from the Wang Clan for an alliance through marriage in the first place. If the Wang Clan spread out the news, wouldn’t others think that he was afraid now?

But if he was to agree to the marriage from the Wang Clan to disprove this point, wouldn’t it be even more of a joke?

When there was no response from Ling Han, Ma Yuhai sent out another invitation to Ling Han a few days later, inviting him to visit his own abode so they could settle this matter once and for all. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ling Han couldn’t help but scoff. Who did this guy think he was? He demanded Ling Han’s presence, so Ling Han had to oblige?

He ignored this person again. He had to concoct alchemical pills every day; he was very busy.

However, the events that took place in the next few days angered Ling Han completely.

Yi, Yan Xianlu, and the others, as long as they had come from the Celestial Realm, were all challenged, but they were defeated and beaten beyond recognition.

…In the martial academy, as long as the gap of cultivation levels did not surpass two cultivation levels, one could attack even without obtaining the consent of the other party beforehand.

Needless to say, this had to be linked with Ma Yuhai. Otherwise, it was really too much of a coincidence.

And just right at this time, Ma Yuhai sent another invitation to Ling Han, asking him to meet him on Great Fiery Mountain three days later. If Ling Han refused, then the challenges for the cultivators from the Celestial Realm would continue.

“Husband, Ma Yuhai is clearly no match for you, yet repeatedly provokes you. He must be planning something!” Zhu Xuan’er said.

Ling Han nodded. “He should have predicted that I would ignore him from the very start, so the invitation to his abode was only a bluff. Everything after that was just paving the way for Great Fiery Mountain.”

“On the way there… it is possible that there would be ultimate elites sniping you?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.

Ling Han stretched out a fist and rapped the table, saying, “There are only two Heavenly Venerates in the martial academy at present, and neither of them have any relation with Ma Yuhai. In that case, who at the Celestial King Tier would be able to kill me?”
