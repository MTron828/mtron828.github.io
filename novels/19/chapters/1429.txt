Chapter 1430 At the Foot of the Purple Wind Mountain

“Fortunately my Little Qing is uninjured,” Jiang Qiaoling said unhappily. “Otherwise, I would have severed your dog head!” She had very good relationships with the the Old Ginseng, the Rabbit, Little Qing, and Rock Spirit—all the non-humans. Right now, she was sitting on Little Qing’s body and stroking its scales and feathers. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Everyone chuckled upon hearing this. Jiang Qiaoling was mischievous and lively, not gentle and obedient like Ding Zhizhi. However, she was a joy to have around. Which of her seniors didn’t like and spoil her? This was also the reason why she dared to make trouble.

“Let’s go.”

Everyone continued forward. Although this marshland wasn’t small, how quick was everyone’s speed? It took them just a few hours to leave the marshlands behind them. A large city appeared on the horizon before them.

After entering the city, they had two main things to do. The first was to rest up, and the second was to gather information. After all, they had to figure out the location of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy first, no?

This was an ancient city that had existed for heaven knew how many years. Without even entering the city, they could already sense its aura of age and history. Upon entering it, this sensation became even clearer. Each tile and each stone exuded a sense of history.

The best place to gather information was naturally the tavern. As such, they all found a tavern to enter, not asking for a private room and simply sitting in the main room. As they ate, they listened to the conversations around them.

Sure enough, they were able to rapidly develop an understanding of this unfamiliar world.

“Oi, oi, oi, have you guys heard? Seventh Young Master of the Bailao Clan just married the darling daughter of the leader of the Stone Hill Faction half a month ago!”

“Pu! No way! Isn’t Seventh Young Master of the Bailao Clan referred to as a handsome man who only appears once every 10,000 years? Meanwhile, it’s rumored that the darling daughter of the leader of the Stone Hill Faction is not only tremendously ugly, but also extremely violent and uncouth in nature. This is like planting a pretty flower into... Er, anyhow, it’s spoiling a good man!”

“Heh, what could the Bailao Clan do about this? They’re under pressure from their mortal enemies, the Liu Clan, so they had no option but to unite by marriage with the Stone Hill Faction.”

“The Liu Clan, huh? They produced a prodigy!”

“Mm-hm, he’s truly a prodigy. It’s rumored that he received a word of praise from the Dīpankara Saint 7,000 years ago.”

“What? The Star Sand Saint’s seventh disciple, the Dīpankara Saint, has personally praised him before?”

“Or else?”

“Liu Juntian only advanced to the Mountain River Tier 7,000 years ago. Now, however, he’s already reached the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. According to hearsay, he’s not far from advancing to the high extreme, either. This kind of cultivation speed is truly terrifying.”

“He’s definitely going to be accepted into the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy this time!”

“To say nothing else, at least the Dīpankara Saint is impressed with him. This time, all nine of the Saints are recruiting disciples together. Thus, him entering the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy is a foregone conclusion.”

“To say nothing of becoming a Saint, he can at least become an Eternal River Tier elite.”

“That’s the Eternal River Tier! Tsk, tsk, tsk.”

Everyone spoke with spirit and wonderment. Even on a planet like this, where there were 10 Saints, those at the Eternal River Tier could still be referred to as elites. After all, only a rare few cultivators could reach this tier.

Anyhow, both the Liu Clan and Bailao Clan were Heavenly Body Tier forces. However, because the Liu Clan had produced a prodigy in Liu Juntian, this had heaped a tonne of pressure onto the Bailao Clan. After all, these clans were mortal enemies, and the Liu Clan was showing signs of surpassing them in the near future. As such, the Bailao Clan had hurriedly gone out to search for allies.

The Stone Hill Faction was an Eternal River Tier force. Although they only had one such elite—this elite having retired from public view, no less—an elite at the Eternal River Tier was still an elite at the Eternal River Tier, after all. This was enough to suppress the Liu Clan.

Ling Han and the others exchanged a glance, all slightly astonished. This was far too coincidental! They had just come across Liu Juntian’s brother, and they were now hearing about him from the conversation of others. Moreover, they learned that he was indeed a young king tier, and had even received praise from a Saint in the past. It went without saying that he was supremely talented.

However, which of them wasn’t a king tier? As such, what did it matter that Liu Juntian was a king tier? Would they be afraid of him?

“Say, it seems like Liu Juntian went to the Purple Wind Mountain.”

“Why did he go there?”

“Don’t you know? Many young king tiers have arrived recently, and they’ve all agreed to taste tea and discuss dao at the Purple Wind Mountain. This gathering is taking place these few days, and everyone is treating it as an honor to catch a glimpse of this gathering.”

“What’s so impressive about that? Isn’t traveling there to catch a glimpse simple?”

“Haha, old brother, it’s not as simple as you think.”

“Indeed. Not to mention the powerful followers of these king tiers guarding the foot of the mountain, preventing those under the level of king tier from ascending, even the Purple Wind Mountain itself is a peculiar creation of heaven and earth. Only a handful of Heavenly Body Tier elites can succeed in reaching the peak of the Purple Wind Mountain!”

“Really? There are such peculiarities?”

“Brother, you’ve definitely come from somewhere else. Otherwise, if you’re from here, there’s no way you wouldn’t have heard about the famous Purple Wind Mountain before.”

“Sigh... Does that mean that I don’t even have the right to witness their battles?”

“I’ve only just reached the Mountain River Tier, so I’m afraid that I can’t even reach the foot of the Purple Wind Mountain.”

They all sighed in disappointment. However, their conversation quickly took a turn, and they started to discuss their experiences in brothels, comparing which girls were more skilled. They were men, after all, so their topics of discussion would naturally revolve around power, conflict, and women.

Looks of displeasure spread across the female’s faces, so Ling Han took this opportunity to say, “Why don’t we check out this Purple Wind Mountain?”

“Yeah!” Jiang Qiaoling couldn’t be happier, and she immediately shouted in agreement.

“It’s a good opportunity to meet the king tiers from this place!” the Rain Emperor said, a strong fighting spirit exuding from his body. Not only was he eager for battle, but Ding Ping, Jiuyao, Xu Ran, and the others were all eager for battle.

“Let’s go!”

They paid their bill before asking a random man for the location of the Purple Wind Mountain. This mountain was extremely famous, so at least nine out of 10 people would know of its location.

The Purple Wind Mountain wasn’t far from this place, so they decided to head over there as quickly as possible. As such, those who were weaker all entered the Black Tower. In just a few hours, a lone peak appeared before them. There was nothing strange about this peak, yet the winds that howled through this area were incredibly strange. All of them were purple in color.

Purple Wind Mountain—it was certainly true to its name.

Right now, there was already a sea of people at the foot of the Purple Wind Mountain, all of them raising their heads as they gazed at the peak of the mountain. Meanwhile, there were also several hundred people hovering in the sky. Some of them were at the Heavenly Body Tier, while some of them weren’t. Regarding the latter, these were half-humans who had wings on their backs.

It was clear that this gathering of prodigies was an extremely attractive event. Even Heavenly Body Tier elites hurried over to catch a glimpse.

“How lively,” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“Fourth Brother, let’s go. Let’s go to the mountain peak and battle to our heart’s content!” the Rain Emperor said boldly.

Ling Han couldn’t help but say, “Second Brother, the king tiers are there to taste tea and discuss dao.”

“Exactly, so they’re there to taste tea and battle, no?” the Rain Emperor replied.

‘Fine, Second Brother is becoming more and more battle-thirsty.’

Ling Han turned to Ding Ping and the others, and said, “You guys wait here.” Only Heavenly Body Tier elites could ascend this mountain, and these elites had to be king tiers among the Heavenly Body Tier, no less. Although Ding Ping and the others had reached the pinnacle level, they still had yet to reach the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, they were far from qualified enough to ascend this mountain.

Xu Ran also told his wife to wait here for him. In the end, only six people were going to ascend the mountain—Ling Han, the Rain Emperor, Empress Luan Xing, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, Xu Ran, and the Notionless Saint.

However, these six individuals were all incredibly powerful. In fact, Empress Luan Xing had even reached the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier. If she engaged in battle, she would simply be bullying the other king tiers.

They made their way through the crowds and prepared to ascend the mountain.

“Hah, there’s another group of naive fools.”

“Heaps of people want to ascend this mountain. However, how many of them have the right to do so?”

“To say nothing of how difficult ascending the Purple Wind Mountain is, they won’t even have the opportunity to attempt it!”

The people in the surroundings all jeered and mocked them, showing absolutely no confidence in Ling Han and the others.

After all, the king tiers atop the mountain had all left their followers below. Moreover, among those who could become the follower of a king tier, which of them wasn’t a supreme prodigy when compared to ordinary cultivators?
