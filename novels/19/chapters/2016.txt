Chapter 2017: Lan Tianyu

A proud smile appeared on Lan Ruozhi’s face. She was confident that her charm was unmatchable. How could Ling Han possibly be capable of resisting?

This really was her being arrogant and narrow-minded.

Just how many people were there in total on this tiny island? She was indeed pretty and alluring, and naturally had become an unrivalled bloom. However, if she was in the Eastern and Western Celestial Realms, though she could still be considered a beauty, she still was some way away from the extent of an exquisite beauty.

It could not be helped that she had never seen truly beautiful women, and naturally thought herself to be overwhelmingly beautiful.

“Come, Young Master Ling, I will show you around,” she invited.

She should feel lucky that Hu Niu had not appeared now. Otherwise, the latter would definitely have sent a slap straight at her.

Ling Han nodded. This was just good as he indeed wanted to get to know this island better.

The two of them first walked around inside the ancient castle. Previously, their range of movement had been restricted, but now with the daughter of the Island Master leading the way, he naturally could go anywhere freely.

“Yi, where does this place lead to?” Ling Han asked, pointing at a pair of stone doors.

Previously Lan Ruozhi would directly push the doors open whenever they met with doors blocking the way, but now she completely ignored these stone doors.

Ling Han examined these great doors closely. There were actually formation patterns inscribed on them. Clearly, there was a formation laid out here. If one could not unravel the formation at the first instant, the formation would either attack the invader harshly, or proceed to raise an alarm.

Lan Ruozhi smiled delicately, and said, “This, you would only have the right to find out after you truly become one of us.”

“So mysterious?” Ling Han pretended to be very curious.

“Hehe.” Yet Lan Ruozhi’s lips were sealed very tightly, and she did not leak out the slightest bit of information. Instead, she dragged Ling Han away with her.

Afterwards, when Ling Han repeatedly drew the conversation back to this topic, Lan Ruozhi kept using the same excuse to evade the topic: only one who had become a member of the ancient castle would have the right to know further secrets.

The two of them walked on, and soon had completed their rounds of the entire ancient castle.

“En?” Ling Han suddenly frowned. He had sensed an unusual aura.

“What is it?” Yet Lan Ruozhi did not sense anything at all.

“Hahahaha, as expected of a prodigy among prodigies, to have discovered my presence so quickly.” A long bout of laughter was heard, and a man with lanky build walked out from behind a massive stone pillar.

“Fourth Uncle!” When Lan Ruozhi saw him, she hurriedly greeted him politely.

Ling Han also surveyed this man. He looked very young, his black locks hanging haphazardly over his shoulders, and his features were also very handsome. Most importantly, this man was very strong, giving Ling Han a feeling of unfathomable depths.

“I heard that someone defeated Xiao Jun, so I came to take a look for myself,” this young man said. In any case, age could not be distinguished from the appearance in the Celestial Realm. It was possible that a gray-haired old geezer would have to address a young brat as great-grandfather.

“This is Ling Han,” Lan Ruozhi introduced. “This is my fourth uncle, Lan Tianyu.”

Ling Han raised his clasped hands slightly, and said, “Lord Lan.”

Lan Tianyu flicked out a finger. Weng, he summoned a circular ring, which encircled all three of them.

In Ling Han’s eyes, the world had enlarged indefinitely. He had immediately appeared in an expansive and boundless grassy plain, and from the outside, it was clearly Ling Han and the others that were rapidly shrinking down, becoming who knew how many times smaller than even a tiny rice grain.

This was a Spatial God Tool, but it was not the type to directly draw others in. Instead, it affected the surrounding environment.

Ling Han could directly fly off and leave. He only had to exit this area, and he naturally would be able to return to his original state.

He was slightly displeased. Though he did not fear challenge, the action of directly pulling him into a battle zone without his agreement caused a strong feeling of dislike to rise up in him.

This kind of person was asking to be beaten.

“Come, show me.” Lan Tianyu pounced, charging out towards Ling Han.

He naturally cultivated the other kind of cultivation system. As he sent out a palm strike, there was no ripple of great dao, nor was there any light of Regulations of the Great Dao. There was only a shadow enshrouding his palm, exuding an unmatchable evil, yet also astonishingly powerful.

Ling Han’s hands balled into fists, and he greeted the incoming attack.

Peng, peng, peng. The two of them were embroiled in an intense battle. In a short instant, they had exchanged over a dozen blows.

Lan Ruozhi watched with starry eyes. Although she, too, had monarch tier-level strength, she still felt like she was unable to watch the battle clearly.

These two people were too powerful.

She was naturally clear and familiar with how strong Lan Tianyu could be, but what stunned her was Ling Han as he was actually capable of exchanging blows with Lan Tianyu.

It should be known that Lan Tianyu was even stronger than Xiao Jun!

She knew that Ling Han had defeated Xiao Jun, but definitely did not think that Ling Han would have strength to match Lan Tianyu, but now? Facts spoke louder than words, causing her to watch with wide eyes, and making her passion burn ever brighter.

She liked powerful men as they would bring her a feeling of accomplishment that was incredibly amazing. Unfortunately, though there was no lack of handsome men among the young and middle-aged men that had drifted onto their island, none of them was as strong as her in a battle of equal cultivation levels.

And now Ling Han had popped out, causing her to ignite all of a sudden.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Han and Lan Tianyu were still exchanging blows. They would be fighting rapidly at times, exchanging several dozen blows in a mere instant, but sometimes they would also be fighting extremely slowly, only launching an attack after being in a stalemate for three to four breaths.

But in reality, the slower the attacks came, the higher the danger level was. Both sides were releasing powerful moves, and their destructive ability would be higher.

Of course, this danger was actually referring to Lan Tianyu. With Ling Han’s physique being as strong as it was, there was basically no one in the Dividing Soul Tier capable of killing him. If it was not for the fact that he was unwilling to reveal this trump card, he would be completely capable of using his own injuries to trade for injuries with his opponent.

And then Lan Tianyu would tragically discover that he would be covered with injuries, close to death, but Ling Han would be completely fine.

Lan Tianyu was indeed stronger than Xiao Jun, and it was not just by a little bit, either, putting an extremely great pressure on Ling Han. Going by Ling Han’s estimation, this man’s true battle prowess should be equivalent to peak-stage Earth Soul’s level, and then after extracting the so-called deity’s power, his battle prowess would soar into early stage Heaven Soul’s level, or even the extent of middle stage.

This was enough to match Ling Han. In fact, this was slightly superior to Ling Han.

Thus, this was the real reason why there were so many monarch tiers and emperor tiers on the island. That was not their true battle prowess.

“Fourth Uncle, is it fine now?” Lan Ruozhi called out from the side.

“All right!” Lan Tianyu stopped, a prideful expression appearing on his face. Though victory was still undecided, he had enough confidence that he would have had the upper hand in just a few more moves.

And he was sure that Ling Han, too, knew this fact.

Since he already got the upper hand, he naturally would be satisfied with ceasing the battle. After all, the reason for his exchanging blows with Ling Han was not for killing this young man, but so that the latter would know that there was still someone capable of suppressing him here.

Ling Han also smiled faintly. In terms of battle prowess, it was indeed Lan Tianyu that was just that slight bit stronger. That was because Ling Han’s own cultivation level was too low, and in terms of genuine battle prowess, he would be able to kill the other man single-handedly.

Depending on external power, even if the other party won, what would be the point?

‘You can indeed borrow power now, but would you be able to keep borrowing it? Is it guaranteed that you could do it in every corner of the Celestial Realm? Can you guarantee that you can still do the same in Celestial King Tier?’

That Ling Han was not going to believe.

This borrowed power did not come from the heaven and earth, but from some powerful existence, such as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

But a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was not omnipotent. For example, if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King wanted to borrow power... how was he going to borrow it?

Compared to this kind of thing, Ling Han was more trusting of his own strength.
