Chapter 2533: Looting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The large black dog took Ling Han to find Wally.

Though Wally was a War Soldier, he could also be considered as a being that existed independently because he had gained self-awareness. Thus, Zhou Heng had brought him here as a member of the martial academy.

How had Wally managed to get past the Nine Deaths Formation then?

He had just run all the way through, suffering blows as he did so. It could not be helped. His body was constructed from a material called superstring, and possessed astonishing self-recovery ability. He was also practically indestructible.

Throughout these many years, Wally had simply been absorbing the information of the Flaming Frost Realm. Though he had gone to a high-level dimension before, he clearly had not been qualified to venture into a transcendent dimension yet.

When the large black dog and Ling Han arrived, light was flickering in Wally’s eyes as he was still absorbing knowledge while he received the two of them at the same time, causing no disruption to either action.

“Help me analyze this alchemical pill.” Ling Han took out the Crimson Bright Fire Pill, and handed it over to Wally.

Wally did not refuse, and accepted the alchemical pill. However, he said seriously, “You owe me three pieces of Divine Metal.”

It was really expensive to ask this guy for help.

Ling Han complained internally, but thinking about how Wally was the product of hard work of an entire dimension over several hundred epochs, it was understandable that his help would be slightly expensive.

Wally stopped his absorption of information for the time being, and began analyzing this alchemical pill. He only managed to list out all the ingredients after a day, and also handed over three pill recipes, which differed slightly. These were based on reverse-engineering the completed alchemical pill.

“The Crimson Bright Fire Pill was already lost in the passage of time. These are the pill recipes that I have completed through the remains of the pill recipe and the completed alchemical pill. The rate of accuracy is 91%, 87%, and 83%, respectively.”

Wally’s expression was solemn. That was his eternal expression. It was as difficult as climbing the skies to see a smile from him.

“Wally-boy, give Grandpa Dog a smile,” the large black dog teased from the sidelines.

Wally bared his mouth in a grin. Instantly, his upper lip rose and his lower lip descended, revealing two complete rows of teeth.

“Are you smiling here, or trying to scare me?” The large black dog quickly waved a paw. “How many times has Grandpa Dog taught you? A smile has to be natural, and cannot be pretentious or deliberate.”

Wally looked at him blankly. In the area of analysis, he was an expert of the highest grade, but in the area of human behavior, he was just a big idiot.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and patted the large black dog’s shoulder. “Don’t force him. I can see that this pill recipe requires a lot of Great Herbs. I am sadly short of cash now, and can’t afford to buy any ingredients at all. Why don’t we go off and do a big job?”

“Tsk, Grandpa Dog has no benefit at all. No way!” The large black dog immediately refused.

Ling Han said calmly, “We’re going to loot Heavenborn’s place. Up for it?”

“Let’s go!” The large black dog was immediately interested.

Ling Han nodded. “Take Wally as well. Breaking through the formation will need him.”

The man and dog looked at Wally at the same time, while Wally’s expression was completely confused. Though he was not versed in human emotion, he still felt that the expressions of this man and dog were slightly frightening, filled with mischief and trickery.

Heavenborn was nurtured by the heaven and earth, and possessed astonishing natural talent. It was said that there were Heavenly Venerates contending to take him as a disciple after he had come to the martial academy. It was probable that they bestowed a considerable number of precious gifts on him. If they could raid his abode, the loot would definitely be shocking. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, the whole martial academy was under the control of the Heavenly Venerates. If they boldly committed theft, they would definitely be immediately arrested.

Hence, this would need Wally’s help, which would allow them to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes.

The three of them were definitely the absolutely perfect trio for being thieves. With Wally in charge of covering their tracks and analyzing and unraveling the formation, they easily penetrated Heavenborn’s abode, and with the large black dog, even Heavenborn would not be able to discover that they had snuck in.

Ling Han and the large black dog found the treasure chamber, and immediately began to rake in their spoils.

Why did Heavenborn not stow these treasures away inside the Black Tower?

That was simple. The Black Tower had long since been unusable, and could only be repaired with the powerful might of a Heavenly Venerate. Previously, Heavenborn could only make the Black Tower become larger, and use it as a weapon to smash his enemies. All the other abilities could not be used at all.

“There’s also Divine Metal!” Ling Han was surprised. He had actually found a piece of Divine Metal here.

“Mine!” Wally immediately declared. His upgrade required things like Divine Metal or Dimension Scrolls.

“You haven’t even finished digesting the Dimension Scroll, so what are you so rushed for? I’ll keep it in reserve for you,” Ling Han said immediately.

“I’ll take it. Grandpa Dog still lacks a suitable weapon!” The large black dog was also drooling.

Ling Han was puzzled. “Why do you not even have a Celestial Tool?”

It was very ordinary that a normal Celestial King did not have a Celestial Tool, but the large black dog was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. How could it be that he still would not be able to get any Divine Metal?

“Don’t remind me. After I sustained severe injury, I was forced to undergo a great rebirth, and could not bring a single piece of possession with me. My Celestial Tools have probably been seized by others and reforged into something else by now,” the large black dog mumbled gloomily.

Ling Han laughed. “I never expected that there would come a day that you would suffer a loss as well.”

“It’s all the fault of that bastard, Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate. When Grandpa Dog has broken through, I will definitely chop off his dog’s head— pei, pei, pei, chop off his head and kick it around like a ball,” the large black dog said angrily.

Ling Han nodded. With how slippery the large black dog was, the only one that could cause him to suffer a loss could only be a Heavenly Venerate.

“It would be better to have this Divine Metal devoured by the Divine Demon Sword,” Ling Han said. “After all, this is illegal goods, and cannot come into light.”

Though the large black dog was reluctant, he could only agree. Thankfully, there were really quite a lot of treasures in Heavenborn’s place. He got a share of a few Great Herbs at the Celestial King Tier. Even if it was not of much use for him to eat them, he still had to end up with something, at least.

This damn dog had never done a deal that would result in a loss for him.

They retreated, and when they returned, they immediately divided the spoils among themselves. At the first possible chance, they got rid of them.

Less than two days later, Heavenborn discovered that his treasure chamber had been robbed, causing him to fume and jump with rage. Because his losses were too great, even the authorities of martial academy had participated in the investigation, but nothing was discovered even after two consecutive days of keeping guard. Thus, this matter could only be left unresolved.

The large black dog urged Ling Han to see if they could do it again after a few days.

But Ling Han shook his head. This kind of job could only be done once. To do a bad deed right underneath the noses of Heavenly Venerates once was them taking the chance that they were not on guard, but did he really think that a Heavenly Venerate was just there for decoration?

Wally’s deception technique could succeed once because the Heavenly Venerate had not taken notice at all, but to commit the deed again when their tracks were so fresh? It would only be sending themselves into the net.

Furthermore, Heavenborn had just been looted, so what could they get even if they went there again now?

Goats had to be fattened before slaughter.

The large black dog had only said that in a moment of anger. He was the true ancestor of thieves, so how could he not understand? After muttering a few words, he left.

He was going to roam the world, and forge a Celestial Tool for himself. Then, he would get himself enough Divine Metal to be devoured by the Divine Demon Sword. Saving the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable was his greatest wish at present, and had even surpassed his personal desire of becoming a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han began to concoct the Crimson Bright Fire Pill.

He still did not have much ingredients, so Ling Han could only concoct a single Crimson Bright Fire Pill. He thought for a moment, and did not ingest it himself. Instead, he planned to sell it so he could buy more ingredients, and concoct more alchemical pills.

He released the news that there was a Crimson Bright Fire Pill available for sale, and soon garnered the interest of a great many people.

Interestingly, Zhuo Kai had previously taken out this kind of alchemical pill so he could summon some really strong people in an attempt to kill off Ling Han, yet now Ling Han had taken out a Crimson Bright Fire Pill as well. Had he robbed Zhuo Kai?

But after assessment, this alchemical pill was proven to have been concocted just recently, and had absolutely no relation to the alchemical pill that had belonged to Zhuo Kai.

Ling Han took the chance to release the news that he was a Five-Star Alchemist, and could help others to concoct great Celestial King Tier alchemical pills. Of course, his fees would also be exorbitant.

This was Ling Han’s true motive.
