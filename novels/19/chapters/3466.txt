Chapter 3467: Who’s Cheating Whom?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

What treasure could compare to this supplementary cultivation technique?

Moreover, Xin Ruyue had previously revealed that if the secret of the cultivation technique was leaked, an elite would make a move. Whether it was him, the teacher, or Dong Qi, the one who had learnt the technique, they would both be killed.

Ling Han didn’t care whether Dong Qi died or not, but if his life was to be sacrificed, he naturally wouldn’t do it. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Not interested.” Ling Han shook his head.

Dong Qi’s eyes sharpened, and he said, “Native, don’t be too arrogant, and forget who you are!”

“Oh, who am I?” Ling Han asked.

“You are only a country bumpkin that has just come into contact with the boundaries of cultivation in this primitive, backward land, and have absolutely no idea how big the world is!” Tong Qi said coldly, “And how would you know that underneath the world that you know, there is also a massive prison. There are so many elites inside, and the height of cultivation level is not something that you can imagine at all.”

Prison?

Ling Han was surprised. Going by that theory, whether it was the earliest Demonic Rat, or the later Cui Zhenhai, as well as Celestial Path elites that popped out like bamboo shoots after the rain, they all originated from the prison.

In this world, there was a cage that was being suppressed, but the dramatic change of heaven and earth had allowed them to escape?

Hold on, could it be that because they were about to escape, the heaven and earth had changed drastically?

Ling Han’s mind whirred, but his expression did not change. He merely asked calmly, “As a prisoner, where do you get such big words from?

“Are you insulting those seniors and Lords?” Dong Qi said with a sneer. “Do you think that just because the Dark North Nation has a Holy Emperor or whatnot, he can protect you? Wrong, Chen Fengyan has only just entered the Celestial Path, so as long as the crack in the cage opens a bit more, an even more powerful figure will appear and easily kill Chen Fengyan.

“Thus, as a native, you should have some self-awareness!

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You keep saying native and country bumpkin, which makes me very angry!”

Dong Qi laughed loudly, “So what? Do you still intend to make a move on me?” He, on the other hand, wanted nothing more than for Ling Han to do the same.

The weak would actively provoke the strong, and the formation would not weaken the cultivation level of the elite. Then, killing Ling Han would only be a matter of raising his hand.

Of course, he would first squeeze out Ling Han’s secret.

Ling Han’s eyes were baleful, and he said, “Try calling me a native again.” “Native, native, native.” Dong Qi laughed loudly, and provoked, “I already said, how many times do I have to repeat it! Na-tive!”

Ling Han shook his head, “Why do people always seek death!”

He summoned the Heavenly Pattern Jade, wanting to end the battle in the shortest time possible.

Dong Qi’s eyes narrowed slightly. Though he did not recognize this as Heavenly Pattern Jade, he had personally witnessed the might of this thing.

He mustn’t be careless, or else he may meet with unexpected failure in what seems to be something very easy for him.

“Native, do you only know how to act violently with your mouth?” He laughed loudly, and continued to provoke Ling Han.

“One, two, three…” Ling Han began counting.

“Have you gone stupid?” Tong Qi was confused.

“Five!” The killing intent in Ling Han’s eyes was on full display, and he suddenly charged out.

“Haha, you’re truly seeking death!” Dong Qi laughed loudly. He didn’t dodge or evade, and he would only make a move when Ling Han truly arrived. In this way, Ling Han would be the one to take the initiative to attack, and he had absolute confidence that even if Ling Han shot out the Heavenly Pattern Jade, with his cultivation level of Enlightenment Tier, he would still be able to dodge, or even send it flying.

42 meters, 33 meters, 27 meters, 24 meters… Absolute Fairness activated.

Ling Han raised his right hand, and shua, the Heavenly Pattern Jade was thrown out. Driven by Spiritual Power, it instantly reached nine times the speed of sound, shooting rapidly towards Dong Qi.

What!

Dong Qi’s expression changed drastically, because he discovered that his cultivation level had directly fallen to Extreme Bone Tier.

The formation clearly shouldn’t have been activated, so why had his cultivation level been severed?

Could it be?

He suddenly came to a realization. Ling Han had a similar formation on him?

Sh*t!

He wanted to dodge, but under nine times the speed of sound, how could he make it in time?

There was nothing else he could do. He could only forcefully raise his arms in front of him. Pa! He had just raised his arms, when the Heavenly Pattern Jade interrupted him. Blood sprayed through the air, and his arms had already been forcefully broken.

The Heavenly Pattern Jade didn’t diminish in power, continuing to smash toward his chest.

Dong Qi just barely managed to dodge. Pa, the Heavenly Pattern Jade hit his left rib, instantly tearing off a large piece of his flesh, as well as a few nbs, forming a bowl-sized hole on the left side.

He screamed in pain, yet without the slightest hesitation, he turned around and fled, his figure flying.

Originally, he wouldn’t have been so weak, but who asked him to have completely not thought that Ling Han would have a formation like Absolute Fairness, and he had the idea of screwing Ling Han over, counterattacking only when the latter attacked him, which led to a shortage of reaction time?

Only after running far away did he turn around and glare harshly at Ling Han. Only then did he rise up again and disappear into the distance.

“Haha, you still want to trick my father? In your dreams!”

“You’re asking for trouble!”

“Don’t you know that our father is the ancestor of trickery?

The toddlers were all laughing and joking.

Ling Han’s expression darkened. How could there be such a compliment? Having been exposed so greatly by you guys, how am I supposed to screw others over in future?

Xin Ruyue also broke out in a cold sweat, looking at Ling Han strangely.

Just now, she had also thought that Ling Han had been rash, and had fallen for Dong Qi’s provocation, but who would have known that Dong Qi was the one who had been screwed over and ended up falling into his trap instead? Both his arms had been destroyed. Unless he could find a Spiritual Herb that could revive his bones, he would be a cripple forever.

Thankfully, she had suppressed her killing intent. Otherwise, if she had faced that attack from Ling Han, she would probably have been hit as well.

“Brother Ling is truly skilled!” Xin Ruyue said with emotion. She was truly impressed by Ling Han’s flawless performance of a weaker person defeating a stronger opponent.

Ling Han smiled, “Thank you for your praise, Miss Xin.”

He reflected on himself. If he had used his murderous aura to attack before smashing the Heavenly Pattern Jade out, then Dong Qi probably wouldn’t have been able to escape.

“I’ll take my leave first.” Ling Han cupped his hands at Xin Ruyue.

“Please,” Xin Ruyue said with a nod. Her eyes were filled with fighting spirit. Since Ling Han could comprehend the secret of the stone painting, there was no reason that she couldn’t.

Ling Han left with his seven babies. They had not walked too far, when they saw a massive garden appear ahead of them. There was grass everywhere, and there were multiple flowers that were as tall as a man waiting to bloom.

These flowers grew very closely together, and there seemed to be no pattern to them. However, upon closer look, there seemed to be a kind of pattern to them. It was just that the pattern could not be found at this moment.

With a sweep of his eyes, he could still see that this garden was filled with people, and they had all fallen in various positions. Some were facing upwards, while others were sprawled out on the ground. Judging by the faces of those facing upwards, their complexions were rosy, and it was as if they were not dead.

Very soon, Ling Han saw a person get back to his feet. In a daze, he took a few steps forwards, and saw a flower blooming beside him. Pa, this person collapsed again, and after a while, the blooming flower closed back up again. This scene was still repeating, as they watched one after another get back to their feet, and fall head first after taking a few steps. This was very comical..
