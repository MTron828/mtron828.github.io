Chapter 1110: Getting Lucky

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If only one of them could survive, Shui Yanyu naturally wished that it would be Ling Han.

She didn’t care what would happen to the Joint Peace Planet after Empress Luan Xing died, nor did she care that she and Ling Han would be hunted by heavens knew how many people—she didn’t care about all that!

At this moment, she only wished that Ling Han could live on!

Pa!

However, her sword was caught and tightly held by a hand. She couldn’t stab it forward any further.

It was Empress Luan Xing!

She had already raised her head and turned around. Although Shui Yanyu couldn’t see her expression, she believed that it was definitely one of rage and fury.

Her own subject actually dared to assassinate her?

This was high treason!

A boundless killing intent swept outward, bringing with it the domineering might of the empress. The color instantly drained from Shui Yanyu’s face.

However, she was unafraid. She simply looked at Ling Han lovingly. They couldn’t live together, but they could at least die together!

Yet, the fatal blow that she was expecting never arrived. She couldn’t help but feel puzzled. She looked toward the empress, only to see that she was enveloped in an aura of Primal Chaos. It was impossible to discern her expression.

Ling Han’s body shuddered as he slowly regained consciousness.

The large loss of blood had caused him to faint, yet his divine sense was extremely powerful and tough, so he was naturally able to regain consciousness quickly. He reached out and grabbed onto Empress Luan Xing’s wrist, a firm expression on his face.

“If you want to punish anyone, punish me!” He was extremely weak, yet his tone was surprisingly firm.

Empress Luan Xing flared up in rage. She was as clean as ice and as pure as jade, yet she had actually drunk a smelly man’s blood. This made her feel as if she had been soiled. She raised her hand resolutely, and four heavenly bodies materialized behind her back. Each of the heavenly bodies radiated with a devastating aura, causing Ling Han’s skin to instantly crack apart.

However, his blood had already been sucked dry, and thus not a single drop of blood flowed out from his wounds. It was an extremely uncanny sight.

“You’re returning kindness with hatred!” Ling Han obviously wouldn’t lie down and wait for death, and he immediately said, “Don’t think that I don’t know. You were wounded just then, and you sucked my blood in order to stabilize your situation. Or perhaps you used some kind of secret technique.”

“So what?” Empress Luan Xing said coldly. Her target had originally been Shui Yanyu, and she wouldn’t have killed her anyway. Had there been a need for Ling Han to interfere? Pei! She had been forced to suck the blood of this man, and they had even come into close and intimate contact!

Just thinking about this gave her the goosebumps. It was nauseating to the extreme!

“As a ruler, you have to distinguish between kindness and hatred. If you kill us, you’ll become an incompetent and morally bankrupt ruler!” Ling Han spat out whatever he could think of. They had fallen into the hands of a Heavenly Body Tier elite now, and they didn’t have the ability to enter the Black Tower, either. Thus, he naturally had to come up with other methods to save their lives.

“So what if I betray everyone in the world?” Empress Luan Xing didn’t fall into his trap, and continued, “Do you have any last words?”

‘F*ck! You’re not playing by the rules!’

Ling Han wracked his brains for ideas. However, the difference in their power was too great, so it seemed as if all of his ideas would be useless.

“Humph!” Empress Luan Xing struck her palm toward Ling Han’s head.

Ling Han was out of options. He had to use the power Small Tower even if it meant exposing the secret of the Black Tower. If worse came to worst, he would just flee to the ends of the world. He had entered the Immortal Realm now, and both heaven and earth were boundlessly large. It wasn’t like the incredibly tiny small world, where elites would be able to find him easily.

However, Empress Luan Xing suddenly stopped her attack halfway.

‘Damn it!’ the empress cursed in her mind. The Ninth King’s thoughts suddenly appeared in her mind at this moment, preventing her from continuing her strike.

She wanted to sever these thoughts, yet this would lead to extremely serious consequences. It would dissolve her one million years of hard work into nothingness!

As expected, she had prevented their relationship too late. The Ninth King had already developed good feelings toward this detestable man, and these very feelings were affecting her now.

She steeled her heart and went to strike her palm down again, yet a feeling of intense anguish instantly welled up in her heart. This caused her to stop again.

‘Damn it! Damn it!’

Empress Luan Xing humphed as she tossed Ling Han aside, and said in a frosty voice, “The events of today never happened!”

After saying this, she leaped into the air and instantly vanished from their sights.

“How... unreasonable!” Ling Han said with a grimace. He had already circulated a drop of Indestructible True Fluid. However, Indestructible True Fluid was used to treat wounds, and he wasn’t genuinely wounded. He had only lost a great deal of vitality, and thus even the Indestructible True Fluid wasn’t able to help him recover completely. His face was still as white as a sheet.

Shui Yanyu felt as if she had just woken up from a dream. They had actually escaped death?

“Master, Master, Little Asura has missed you dearly!” The Asura Demon Emperor appeared, a look of fright and terror on his face.

“F*ck the hell off!” Ling Han kicked him aside. As expected, he couldn’t be relied upon. When Empress Luan Xing had been present, he hadn’t even dared to appear. Now that she was gone, he had hurriedly scuttled back over.

This wasn’t surprising, though. Even if the Asura Demon Emperor had returned, he would have merely been running to his own death. Thus, Ling Han only kicked him aside to vent his own anger. He didn’t actually have any ill intentions.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief, and said, “Phew, we weren’t killed. How extremely fortunate!” He would just pretend that he had been bitten by a dog. There were heaps of medicine in the Black Tower anyway, so he wouldn’t need long to recover his vitality.

Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at him, and said, “Do you know that you indecently assaulted Her Majesty just then?”

“Huh?” There was a puzzled expression on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “Are you kidding? I was almost sucked dry just then. How could I have indecently assaulted that woman?”

“Humph! I saw it clearly with my own two eyes. Both of your hands had grabbed onto Her Majesty’s breasts!” There was a strong feeling of jealousy in Shui Yanyu’s voice. Her mind had been filled with worry for Ling Han at that time, and now that they were safe, she naturally started to feel jealous.

“What?!” Ling Han was stunned, and he raised his hands in disbelief. These two hands had actually grabbed Empress Luan Xing’s voluptuous breasts! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

F*ck! Why couldn’t he recall this at all? He hadn’t felt anything!

Shui Yanyu humphed, and said, “Do you still want more? Are you lost in the beautiful memories?”

Sure enough, men couldn’t be trusted.

“Why are you feeling jealous?” Ling Han pulled her into his arms, and said, “I almost died just then, so how could I have thought about such matters?”

A look of lingering fear appeared on Shui Yanyu’s face. One of them had grabbed the empress’ breasts, while the other had attempted to assassinate her. However, none of them had died. This was an incredible miracle.

“My wife’s still feel better.” Ling Han chuckled softly as he cupped his hands over Shui Yanyu’s chawan-sized 1 breasts. They truly felt amazing.

“P-pervert!” Shui Yanyu scolded.

She was just about to pinch Ling Han, yet she realized that he had already collapsed into her lap and fallen into a deep slumber. Her tender feelings were instantly stirred, and she bent down to embrace him.

This man had stood up in order to protect her. If he hadn’t, none of these troubles would have ever arisen.

She couldn’t help but smile sweetly. She had met a man who was willing to sacrifice himself for her. What more could she ask for? She embraced Ling Han and let his head rest in her soft bosom so that he could get as good a rest as possible.

However, she still couldn’t understand why the empress had suddenly let them go, especially since she had already developed such an intense killing intent toward them. What worldly matter could still strike fear in the empress’ mind?

There was definitely none!

However, she quickly pushed these thoughts to the back of her mind. She simply gazed at Ling Han with a loving expression, a sweet feeling permeating her heart.
