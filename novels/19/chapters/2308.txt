Chapter 2309 Tables turned

Ling Han used the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords, switching to the Regulation of Slaughter of the Foreign Realm to activate it.

Sword Qi danced wildly, power of Regulation spreading out. This area instantly became extremely dangerous. Everyone in the surroundings stepped back to avoid being dragged into this disaster. It should be known that that person from before was a perfect example to learn from.

‘F*ck!

Everyone looked towards that unlucky fool. Because he had passed out, it was naturally impossible for him to leave, and now that he was dragged into the battle, the robes he was wearing were also torn into scraps, even exposing a flushed bottom. His tail was visibly drooping, and just happened to be lying between his legs, concealing the last bit of that inappropriate scene.

Everyone exchanged looks, and thought that this guy was really ruined. Having mistakenly been struck by 12 sword strikes was already a huge joke, and now was forced to suffer the public exposure of his bottom. What face would he have left to continue staying here?

Yet Lu Yuanxin’s eyes were already bloodshot. He cared about nothing else now, and merely used ultimate moves to launch a flurry of relentless attacks on Ling Han.

He summoned a sword of light. Its might was extremely terrifying, and the strike of light it delivered incited great dislike from the Demon Race. The power of light was contained within, which caused them to feel an instinctive dislike.

Yet Ling Han was still unafraid. Recently, he had been re-cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll while making use of the power of the Origin Magic Cube. He had gained a deeper understanding of Regulations, and even the power of heaven and earth that was superior to Regulations, improving his physique further.

But now that he had reached this stage, improving physique could no longer completely depend on comprehension. It was too slow. Instead, he would have to consume various kinds of natural treasures, and even fuse Divine Metal into his body, turning himself into a human weapon.

Ling Han was still a great distance away from fusing Divine Metal into himself, but the resources he needed were still astonishing in amount. The academy had supplied some, but it was far from reaching the amount that he needed.

However, his present physique was more than adequate to deal with Lu Yuanxin.

The two of them battled incredibly fiercely.

The spectators of the Demon Race were more and more surprised. Though Ling Han had not gained an absolute upper hand, wasn’t it said that he was only a Sixth Lotus Fifth Leaf cultivator? How could he be as powerful as this?

Ling Han unleashed his battle prowess fully, and a Seventh Lotus Ninth Lotus appeared on his forehead. HIs cultivation level was clear to see.

This was a Monarch Star!

Everyone felt their scalps go numb. It should be known that even in a dimension like the Foreign Realm, the number of Monarch Stars was still extremely rare. For example, the Hundred Battles Academy only possessed one, and that was You Yuan.

Why did You Yuan have such a high status? A part of the reason was because of the glory he had won for the academy, and another was his identity as a Monarch Star inspiring reverence from others.

He was an existence that was destined to become an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King as long as he did not die before that. Who would not look up to him?

No wonder this man had been so filled with confidence, considering even You Yuan below his notice. As a Monarch Star, he did indeed should have this kind of dominance.

When this fact was uncovered, the attitude of a great many members of the Demon Race did an about-turn, switching from their previous disdain to heated fanaticism.

They, too, had a Monarch Star now!

Though they revered You Yuan, that was speaking in terms of the bigger picture. After all, they all belonged to the same academy, but if possible, how could it be that they did not hope that You Yuan was a member of the Demon Race?

Of course, there was no way that You Yuan would become a member of the Demon Race, but now Ba had appeared, so they were naturally cheering and encouraging him.

Who said that the Demon Race did not have any super geniuses?

“Humph!” Wu Ya and Xun Feng both walked over. One of them was an Eighth Lotus Seventh Leaf, while the other was an Eighth Lotus Eighth Leaf. Their strength could be ranked in the top 10 of the academy. There were no three people in the Demon Quarters that could stop them. At most, there were only two.

The problem was that neither of the strongest two of the Demon Quarters were here. One had ventured out on a training trip, while the other was breaking through his cultivation level somewhere. For this moment, where were they supposed to go and find them?

“Ba, you are too arrogant!” Wu Ya stated evenly, yet his tone bore a frightening pressure, as if he was an emperor that was presently rebuking his subject.

If a ruler demanded the death of his subject, the subject would have no choice but to die. That was how mighty and powerful he was.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “There is no father like that, nor can I manage to have a son as arrogant as you.”

Instantly, many members of the Demon Race spluttered in laughter. This guy had definitely named himself “Ba” on purpose. Whoever called his name would be at a disadvantage, and Ling Han would constantly be taking advantage of them.

Wu Ya’s expression was very dark. He humphed, and said, “Spare the cheekiness. So what if you are a Monarch Star? In front of me, you will not even last a single blow.” He paused, and then continued, “I have come today to issue you a warning. Stay away from Xing and the others. They are not someone that an ugly and coarse guy like you can covet.”

Hearing his words, everyone finally found that they had sought Ling Han out because of women.

Sigh, as expected, even the mightiest heroes could not escape from the test of beauties. Ling Han shook his head. “That is not up to you to say!”

“Then you are asking for your own suffering.” Wu Ya moved, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

“Wu Ya, you have gone too far!” an elite of the Demon Quarters declared in displeasure. He stretched out a colossal giant hand, blocking this attempted strike from Wu Ya.

However, it was clear that his strength was inferior. Though he had blocked this strike, his body was uncontrollably trembling, with him stepping back continuously. He retreated at least 300 meters before finally stopping, and two lines of footprints were clearly left behind on the ground. “Mudel, you dare stop me?” Wu Ya demanded coldly, his eyes dark.

“You run over to our Demon Quarters, and dare to commit a crime. Do you think that there is no one in our Demon Race?” that elite of the Demon Race, Mudel, retorted.

Wu Ya and the others had barged in. If they were still allowed to just boldly strut out of here, what would be left of the pride of the Demon Race?

Of course, if Ling Han was not a Monarch Star, he would not be protecting him with such great efforts, either. Both Wu Ya and Xun Feng were well-known elites of the Angel Quarters. If he wanted to prevent them from committing violence, he would have to pay an exorbitant price.

“So what if you guys all attack together? Would you be any match for Xun Feng and me?” Wu Ya demanded calmly.

Mudel was speechless. The other’s words rang true. The gap in strength between them was too wide. Seventh Lotuses were completely outmatched in front of Wu Ya and Xun Feng, and only Eighth Lotus could be a match, but how many Eighth Lotuses were there? …Any Eighth Lotus that could stay in the academy was a monarch tier, and there were at most 10 in a single academy. If they were divided equally over all the quarters, that would be two to three each.

The Demon Quarters had three. The two strongest had left the academy temporarily, and at present, the strongest one was him.

If it was only Wu Ya or Xun Feng alone, he was confident that he could manage to stop them. After all, this was the academy. No matter how arrogant Wu Ya was, he would not dare to act rashly. However, if there were the two of them, he did not think he could stop them.

He humphed. “Do you think our Demon Race all have no backbone? Furthermore, where do you think this is, that you would be allowed to act so willfully and arrogantly?”

Wu Ya laughed loudly. “If I told you that this brat actually dared to conspire against You Yuan’s woman, would you still dare to protect him?”

‘What?!’

Everyone was stunned.

This Ba was really too outrageously bold, wasn’t he? He actually dared covet You Yuan’s woman? Moreover, your taste was too f****** hardcore, wasn’t it? You could actually make a move on a woman of the Angel Race?

Ling Han was rendered speechless. This was really a complete distortion of the truth. It was clearly You Yuan that dared to have improper designs on his woman, yet they were accusing him of it.

“Anyone who dares to interfere further would be making an enemy of You Yuan!” Wu Ya sneered, and grabbed out aggressively at Ling

Han.
