Chapter 2647 - 2647 Final Destination

2647 Final Destination

“Die!” Xiao Yingxiong roared as he unleashed his full strength and charged at Ling Han.

Weng!

His spear thrust forward, yet seven bursts of golden sword light were unleashed. They were more so enveloped in lightning, appearing as weird as could be.

This was the inheritance that he had obtained from this sword mountain—the Lightning of Metal!

!!

Weng!

A spiritual attack surged over at the same time, extremely precise and potent in nature.

Pain immediately stabbed at Ling Han’s mind, causing his vision to go dark. The spiritual attack of an Eighth Heaven supreme monarch star was far too terrifying, and was far superior to what Gu Heyi could unleash.

However, Ling Han had already increased the level of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Even though it still had yet to reach the Eighth Heaven, it had still advanced, after all. Thus, it was naturally able to better resist spiritual attacks.

Ling Han guarded his mind as he continued to slash with his Divine Demon Sword, launching a powerful counterattack.

Ding, ding, ding!

The two of them were locked in an intense battle.

In terms of strength, there was truly little difference between them. However, it was definitely Ling Han who had the advantage.

This was because his Divine Demon Sword was forged from Devouring Metal, allowing its sharpness to be superior to ordinary Celestial Tools. After fighting for an extended period of time, other Celestial Tools would all be severed or shattered by the Divine Demon Sword!

After several thousand more exchanges, Xiao Yingxiong’s spear lost another piece.

This was something that he couldn’t accept. If his Celestial Tool were shattered, what else would he use to block Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword?

“Just you wait!!” Xiao Yingxiong roared in rage. He forced Ling Han back with a flick of his spear before turning around to leave. “The day that I obtain all of the lightning technique inheritances will be the day that I cut off your head!”

He was completely unable to capture Ling Han at this moment. In fact, he was even at a disadvantage. Thus, he resolutely decided to leave, not hesitating in the least.

Ling Han didn’t give chase. He wasn’t any stronger than Xiao Yingxiong, and he had only just obtained victory thanks to his Divine Demon Sword.

“Let’s obtain the inheritance of this place. The more lightning techniques that we fuse together, the more powerful they’ll become!” Ling Han said to the Empress. In any case, Xiao Yingxiong had fled already, so they only needed to worry about raising their own strength.

The Empress nodded in agreement. Right now, she desired power even more than Ling Han. This was because she had been unable to help during the battle just then.

She was an extremely proud person, so how could she accept this?

The two of them walked to the center of the mountain peak, replacing Xiao Yingxiong.

They had already obtained the secrets of the sword formation, so numerous golden symbols immediately materialized in their minds. However, no power entered their body this time, as it had all been absorbed by Xiao Yingxiong.

If they wanted to obtain more power, they would need to wait for one or two epochs for this sword mountain to recover.

Similarly, even if Xiao Yingxiong found the other lands of inheritance, he would only be able to obtain the inheritance of the three lightning techniques. He wouldn’t be able to obtain the power of those lands anymore.

Obtaining the secret technique was very quick. Without the process of acquiring power, grasping the inheritance only took Ling Han and the Empress several days. Because they were afraid of Xiao Yingxiong charging back and launching a surprise attack on them as they cultivated, they decided to leave the sword mountain and enter the Celestial Guest Residence.

After tens of thousands of years, the two of them finally mastered the Lightning of Metal, and fused it together with the Three Lightning Technique, creating the Four Lightning Technique.

“Even though only one of the Five Elements is missing, the might of this technique is still far inferior,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head.

This was clear when looking at the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. This was also a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and just how powerful was it?

The Five Elements Lightning Technique was most likely not weak. However, Ling Han was confident that if he advanced the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to an equivalent level, the Four Lightning Technique would definitely be unable to breach its defenses.

There was only a single reason for this: they hadn’t gathered all Five Elements yet. As such, this Heavenly Venerate Technique was unable to unleash its full might. In fact, it was possible that it could only unleash one-tenth of its might.

Going from four to five elements would be a qualitative change.

“Then we need to obtain the fifth inheritance as soon as possible,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded in agreement, saying, “We have to obtain it before Xiao Yingxiong.” Otherwise, they would indeed obtain the inheritance, but they would miss out on the power.

They exited the Celestial Guest Residence, and continued to advance.

Four of the five lands of inheritance had already appeared, yet it was clear that they were already about to reach the end of this Ancient Tomb.

Large expanses of mountains and rivers flashed past beneath them, with the couple not stopping to communicate with any of the people that they passed. Right now, they only had a single goal: to reach the fifth land of inheritance.

Even though they didn’t waste any time communicating with others, there were always those who obtained information far too slowly. These people had only just received the news that Ling Han and the Empress were outsiders who had come here to train. Thus, they especially rushed over to attack them.

However, how could Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings possibly rival the two of them? These people were naturally suppressed in an instant. However, Ling Han and the Empress also learned some secrets from these Celestial Kings.

According to rumors, the end of this Ancient Tomb not only held the inheritances of paramount techniques, but it even had a passageway that led out of the Celestial King Graveyard!

However, the prerequisite was that one reached the Ninth Heaven!

Thus, all of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had already gone to that place.

Ling Han leaned toward believing this. This was because they indeed hadn’t been attacked by any Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. However, whether or not this rumor was true needed to be confirmed.

Desolate Moon!

It was Desolate Moon who had led people into this Ancient Tomb, and he had even tossed out three scrolls of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. If it were said that the combined strength of countless Celestial Kings was required to open the path to this Ancient Tomb, Ling Han would definitely believe this. However, to offer three scrolls of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll for this?

Ling Han certainly didn’t believe this. This was because simply spreading news about this large tomb would definitely be enticing enough by itself.

The truth was most likely hidden at the end of the Ancient Tomb.

Ling Han glanced at the Empress, and she replied with a nod. With their strength, they could attempt to explore that area.

Seven months later, they arrived before an unbelievably grand palace.

It towered into the clouds, and it was surrounded by arcs of lightning. It appeared dignified and profound.

This was the final destination of this Ancient Tomb. They knew this because there was only a boundless expanse of void after this palace. This void couldn’t be traversed.

Looking from the outside, this palace appeared as desolate as could be. It was as if it were an abandoned land.

‘All of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings are inside here?’

“This is truly uncanny. If so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings are inside there, why isn’t there any noise or commotion?” Ling Han said in a soft voice.

The Empress tightened her grip on her Celestial Tool. Meanwhile, her left hand held onto Ling Han’s right.

Ling Han smiled as he clasped his hand around the Empress’ slender hand. They then strode forward.

This palace was far too tall, so there was actually still a long distance to travel between seeing it and actually arriving before it. When they arrived before the gates of the palace, they saw a group of people furiously attacking the gates.

Strangely, however, it was clear that the gates of the palace were wide open. However, like a crashing waterfall, bolts of lightning blocked the entrance. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This was a group of four people. They were attacking in unison, yet the wall of lightning remained completely unaffected. They were unable to pass it.

Upon sensing Ling Han and the Empress’ arrival, the four people immediately stopped their attacks and turned around.

A smile involuntarily spread across Ling Han’s face. This world was truly far too small.

This was none other than Wang Dongsen and the others, the second-generation young masters from Prosperous Opening City.

In the past, their group had consisted of more than four people. However, it was likely that some of them had died on their way here. After all, this wasn’t Prosperous Opening City where they could act as they pleased.

“Li Long!” Wang Dongsen immediately exclaimed upon seeing Ling Han. When Xiao Yingxiong and the others had attacked Ling Han before, they had caught sight of Ling Han’s true appearance. Thus, they immediately recognized him.

Ling Han’s voice was calm as he said, “Immediately piss off if you don’t want to die!”

“What an arrogant person!” Wang Dongsen said in great displeasure. He was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, so Ling Han should have referred to him as “senior” or “lord” when seeing him. Yet, he actually dared to tell him to piss off?

Even though Ling Han could escape from the clutches of Xiao Yingxiong and the others, signifying his strength, could he possibly rival Wang Dongsen?

“You ruined my father’s grand plans! See how I chop off your head!”
