Chapter 2210: Are you threatening me?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

How arrogant.

For most people, their energy was limited, especially in the case of prodigies. To attain quick success, they should definitely focus on a single type of Regulations, and improve their cultivation level.

…If there were two people with similar aptitude, and one focused on cultivating Regulations of Water, while the other cultivated both Regulations of Water and Fire, it would definitely be the one who focused solely on cultivating Regulation of Water that would improve faster, and in an actual battle, it would also be the former who would be stronger because they could use their superior cultivation level to suppress their opponent.

Only after advancing into the Celestial King Tier where advancement was really too slow would one turn to cultivate other Regulations. Otherwise, they would only be idling their time away.

What did Ling Han mean?

He had cultivated the majority of Regulations, and that was why he said it would be better to ask him which Regulations he did not cultivate.

You were just a mere Dividing Soul Tier, and wouldn’t such excessive greed affect your progress?

Mr Luo faltered for a moment, and then burst out laughing. He was actually not angered.

He had obtained a personal message transmitted through divine sense from the Celestial Kings, commanding that he should properly entertain these four people. And being able to obtain a personal command from the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings regarding them, these four people were naturally out of the ordinary. Thus, though Mr Luo faltered for a moment, he did not think that Ling Han was being too arrogant.

Perhaps this was the exact reason that he had gained the recognition of the Celestial Kings.

“Fine then, what Regulations don’t you cultivate?” Mr Luo asked.

“Seems to be only Regulation of Poison,” Ling Han answered after some thought.

Mr Luo was troubled now. He looked at those majestic great mountains at this moment, and did not know where he should arrange for Ling Han’s accommodations.

“I can stay anywhere,” Ling Han said with a smile. He had obtained nine Source Powers of heaven and earth, and this was the best treasure for comprehending Regulations. Even after he advanced into Celestial King Tier, he could still continue comprehension.

Hu Niu and the Empress did not have any specific requirements, either. They, too, possessed a Source Power of heaven and earth, and could completely break through to Celestial King Tier with that.

As for the Rain Emperor?

He did not need it, either, because he had refined the remains of a Celestial King, and this was more or less equivalent to a Source Power of heaven and earth.

Thus, after a round of questions, all four of them were very carefree, which made Mr Luo slightly depressed. He had never seen such students, and four of them had appeared at the same time.

“All right then, I’ll just randomly arrange your accommodations.” Mr Luo couldn’t be bothered to deal with the headache, and simply handed the power over to the four of them.

“The Herb Mountain then.” The thought suddenly came to Ling Han.

“Ah?” Mr Luo would never have imagined that Ling Han would come up with such an idea. Even if he was an Ascending Origin Tier elite, he was still clearly dazed for a moment, being completely baffled.

Seeing no objections arise from the Rain Emperor and the others, Mr Luo couldn’t help but ask, “Are you sure?”

“Sure.” Ling Han and the others all nodded.

In any case, for comprehension of Regulations, they had Source Powers of heaven and earth and the remains of the Celestial King, and in the case of cultivation, the 10,000 times acceleration effects of the Black Tower was even more powerful, so there was absolutely no need for them to draw support from any external conditions.

What Ling Han needed were the resources that only the Saintly Origin Academy could provide.

“All right then.” Mr Luo nodded. He had obtained instructions from the Celestial Kings that he was to give Ling Han and his group enough independence, so he did not make any further efforts of persuasion.

The four of them found four neighbouring abodes on the Herb Mountain, and then settled down. Of course, the Empress and Hu Niu would definitely be staying together with Ling Han, while the Rain Emperor would be entering into the Black Tower for cultivation.

The brothers discussed cultivation for a while, sharing their knowledge, and both felt that they had derived some benefit from their conversation.

Their arrival in the academy gave rise to a commotion. Very quickly, everyone found out that Ling Han and the Rain Emperor were supreme monarch tiers just like Ji Wuming and Hong Huang. They were clearly only Heaven Souls, yet could match a First Secret monarch tier, or even suppress the latter.

Everyone was discussing them spiritedly. Those like Ji Wuming, Hong Huang, and the others were really too strong, and even monarch tiers would willingly bow to them and follow their leadership, causing the forces of these four people to be stronger than ever before.

Yet now, another two such supreme monarch tiers had come, and they were sworn brothers at that. If they advanced one step further, and also became Immortal Palace Tiers, then wouldn’t it become the very strongest force inside the academy?

Would Ji Wuming and the others just watch as this happened?

The answer was soon revealed.

Merely a day later, a person had arrived in front of the abodes of Ling Han and his group.

This was a First Secret monarch tier, and his flame of life had burnt for at least over a billion years. When Ling Han first set eyes on him, he felt a stabbing pain, and only after channeling his Origin Power did this feeling finally vanish.

This person was very strong; at least, he was stronger than Ji Yutang.

“I am Hu Yan.” This First Secret monarch tier smiled, his smile very gentle. “I have previously stayed in the Imperial Void Sect for a while.”

The Imperial Void Sect?

And what did “previously” mean? He could resign even after joining the Imperial Void Sect?

“I have come on behalf of Lord Hong Huang to invite the four of you to join our Huang Alliance,” Hu Yan was very approachable, his smile gentle and mild.

“Oh?” Ling Han declined to comment. At present, it was only him, the Empress, and Hu Niu here. The Rain Emperor was a madman of cultivation, and wanted to cultivate to the consummate level of Heaven Soul as soon as possible, so he was still in seclusion in the Black Tower.

“Lord Hong Huang knows that Brother Han and Brother Rain have excellent aptitude, and your future accomplishments will definitely be astonishing as well. Thus, he has deliberately left out two positions of vice alliance leader for Brother Han and Brother Rain,” Hu Yan continued.

Ling Han chuckled, and was just about to speak when yet another person appeared.

This was a beautiful woman dressed completely in red, and looked fiery.

“I am Qi Ya.” This woman was also fiery in the way she spoke. “Our Fairy Jia Lan would like to invite the four of you over for a chat to discuss the details of a mutual aspiration.”

Hu Yan frowned, and said, “Qi Ya, all matters depend on the order of arrival. I have already issued an invitation to Brother Han and his group, so you had better wait for next time.”

“What a joke. In our world of cultivators, what order of arrival is there? Everything is based on strength!” Qi Ya’s expression was disdainful. “Our Fairy Jia Lan will definitely inspire awe throughout the Celestial Realm in the future, and become the sole empress. Assisting our fairy to ascend the throne is the truly wisest course of action!”

“Absolute nonsense!” Hu Yan rebuked, and he truly deserved the name Hu?Yan1. When he spoke the word “nonsense,” he did not show the slightest discomfort. “Lord Hong Huang is the only great emperor, conquering through all the ages, and suppressing for all eternity!”

“Humph, you can only speak tough now. Not long after, our fairy will teach Hong Huang a lesson.” Qi Ya’s expression was still filled with disdain.

“Hold on!” Ling Han pressed his hands down. “There is no need for you guys to compete. I have no interest in joining either side, so the two of you had best just return.”

When these words fell, both Hu Yan and Qi Ya shut their mouths. Then, they turned to look at him, their eyes slightly cold.

“Young Master Han, this is an invitation from Lord Hong Huang!” Hu Yan said menacingly, completely shifting his previously gentle appearance, just like a fierce beast that had torn off its pretense, showing its true ferocious colors.

Qi Ya was even more direct. She drew out a long spear, and exclaimed, “Since our fairy has said that she wishes to invite the four of you over, I will definitely accomplish this task!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ling Han flicked the sleeve of his robes, and said, “I have always despised threats, so the two of you had best leave as soon as possible before I truly get angry.”

“Young Master Han is really unwilling to give us some face?” Hu Yan asked finally, his fighting spirit blazing, turning into multiple blades and seals. There was also a clanging sound that resounded through the heavens, and was incredibly domineering.

“Are you threatening me?” Ling Han countered.
