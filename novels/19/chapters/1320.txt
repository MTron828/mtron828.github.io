Chapter 1321 Sand That Excites Even Saints

There was actually a vast plain so deep underground!

“Such a terrifying aura of death!” the North Emperor immediately said. There was an alert look on his handsome face.

Ling Han activated his Eye of Truth to survey this vast expanse of land. His expression involuntarily changed, and he said, “In the past hundreds of millions of years, countless people have battled to death here. Their blood has fused into this land and transformed it into a land of death.”

Faceless grabbed a handful of dirt. His Origin Power swept over it, causing the dirt and rocks to disintegrate into nothing. In the end, all that remained was a speck of golden sand.

They all tensed up in suspense.

Faceless was at the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, and his power was on par with the early stage of the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. Yet, under his refinement, this speck of sand actually hadn’t disintegrated? Was this perhaps Level Nine Godly metal?

“Huh?” The North Emperor took the speck of sand from Faceless’ hand and studied it carefully. After a while, he said, “This speck of sand isn’t as simple as it appears.”

“It’s extremely complex!” the Stone Emperor concurred. He also grabbed a handful of dirt. However, after refining it, he found no speck of golden sand. He didn’t give up, grabbing an even larger handful of dirt to refine. This time, he ended up with two specks of golden sand.

The others also started to grab handfuls of dirt to refine. Before long, everyone had one to two specks of golden sand in their hand. They all started to examine it thoroughly.

Ling Han was no different. These specks of sand contained no energy, yet they gave him a feeling of might and profoundness. It was as if these specks of sand had been part of the tiles of some supreme hall before. However, this hall had been obliterated, and the tiles that it was built with had turned into the sand that they now saw.

While no one was looking, Ling Han tossed a speck of golden sand into the Black Tower so that the Notionless Saint could analyze it.

Surprisingly, however, the orb of light that was the Notionless Saint instantly exclaimed in astonishment upon seeing the speck of golden sand. Even the voice that was emitted by his divine sense was quivering. However, even in the Black Tower, Ling Han could only hear some incomprehensible muttering.

“Senior Notionless, what on earth have you discovered?” Ling Han asked.

“I’ve... seen the sky!” the Notionless Saint replied. This was an extremely strange reply.

‘The sky?’

Seeing the sky in a speck of sand sounded absurd. At the same time, it also sounded comical. This didn’t sound like something that a Saint would utter.

“Senior, can you explain more clearly?” Ling Han hurriedly said.

However, the Notionless Saint continued his incomprehensible muttering as if he had become mad. Not a single part of him seemed like a Saint.

Ling Han was completely speechless. However, he knew that these specks of sand were incredible.

The fact that they could cause a Saint to lose his composure proved that they definitely had an astonishing backstory.

Ling Han’s interest was piqued. He clenched his hand into a fist and forcefully struck the ground.

Pu!

Dirt flew into the air, and everything appeared especially normal. However, Ling Han’s brows furrowed into a frown. This was because the damage caused by his strike was far too small.

Although the Immortal Realm was stable, he had already reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, the force of his strike should have been able to crush mountains and sever rivers. Yet, he had only managed to create a small crater that measured nine meters in diameter?

Peng, peng, peng! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He threw 17 punches in quick succession. At the same time, he released his divine sense to survey what has happening beneath the surface of the land. He discovered that the damage caused by his strikes was so small because most of the force of his strikes had been absorbed by some peculiar substance in the earth.

‘It’s definitely the golden sand!’

The others also discovered this strange phenomenon, and they all started to conduct their own tests. It wasn’t long before looks of surprise appeared on their faces.

This golden sand was extraordinary.

“What kind of place is this?” Many other cultivators arrived at this moment, and they all exclaimed in astonishment. This place was far too large!

“Brat, hurry up and collect this sand. The more, the better!” the Notionless Saint muttered from the Black Tower. His voice was quivering with excitement.

“Senior, what on earth is this?” Ling Han asked.

“I don’t know. However, I can say with certainty that if I had enough of this sand before, I could have reached the medium extreme... no, high extreme or even consummate level of the Genesis Tier!” the Notionless Saint said in excitement. Although he was only an orb of light at this moment, this orb of light was flashing brilliantly as if his expression were changing.

Ling Han was astonished upon hearing this, and he immediately bent down to dig up more of the dirt. He didn’t refine this dirt, instead tossing it all into the Black Tower. There was enough space in the Black Tower anyway, so doing this wasn’t a problem.

Seeing him do this, it was as if the others had received inspiration, and they all started to collect as much of the dirt as they could.

They were prodigies and king tiers of the younger generation, yet right now, they were all bending down and playing with dirt. If word of this got out, people would definitely laugh themself to death! However, regardless of whether it was Chi Huangji, Faceless, Yue Ying, the Cloud Maiden, the North Emperor, or Stone Emperor, everyone was digging up dirt with glee at this moment.

Some cultivators had only just arrived, so they were absolutely clueless as to what was happening. However, upon seeing that everyone was collecting dirt, they naturally started to follow suit and collect dirt as well.

This was a clear example of herd mentality.

Theoretically speaking, prodigies should have been very opinionated individuals. However, what was the current situation? Even the nine king tiers were collecting dirt, so this dirt was definitely some valuable treasure!

All of a sudden, this place became like a bustling farm where everyone was fervently harvesting... dirt.

After a short while, many people stopped collecting the dirt.

This wasn’t because they didn’t want to collect anymore, but because... their Spatial Spirit Tools had already been filled to the brim! They simply couldn’t collect any more dirt!

There was nothing they could do about this, so they started to refine the dirt as they collected it. Anyhow, no matter how large a clump of dirt as, it would only produce a few specks of golden sand after they refined it. As such, they wouldn’t need to worry about their Spatial Spirit Tools not being large enough.

Ling Han quickly discovered that it would be impossible to collect all the golden sand in the place.

This was because there was far too much dirt here. Not only was this plain vast, but it was also incredibly deep. It would be impossible to refine all this dirt!

That being the case, he decided to stop collecting dirt for the moment. Instead, he started to ponder some important questions.

What if there was an origin of this golden sand?

Not only him, but many other people also raised their heads and stopped collecting the dirt, their eyes glimmering with excitement.

Perhaps many of them didn’t know the true value of this golden sand. However, even a fool could guess that this golden sand was extraordinary.

“Perhaps this plain holds some tremendous opportunity.”

“The Mountain River Forest is directly above this place, and the Sun Moon Valley is also not far away. If someone says that the formation of those two places is completely unrelated to this place... they must be absolute fools.”

“Perhaps we can discover the secrets of the Mountain River Forest and Sun Moon Valley here!”

Everyone was feverish with excitement. Both the Mountain River Forest and Sun Moon Valley only opened once every 70,000 or so years. However, if they could discover the secrets of those places, wouldn’t they be able to enjoy the blessing of heaven and earth whenever they wanted?

Ling Han and the other king tiers were even more knowledgeable than these ordinary cultivators. They knew that the “blessing” was actually Celestial Qi that allowed them to comprehend the Regulations of the two realms. By comprehending this, they would genuinely become invincible among those at the same cultivation level.

Everyone continued to advance. However, the tens of thousands of cultivators were scattered far apart, making them appear very much like a bowl of water that had been tossed into a lake—insignificant and measly. As information about the golden sand traveled out, however, it was very likely that those who had advanced further would turn around and come back. Many people would come to this place to explore the secrets of the plain.

Boom!

The shock waves of a battle suddenly traveled over from the distance. However, these shock waves disappeared just as quickly as they had arrived.

Ling Han and the others exchanged a glance. They could all sense that these shock waves had been caused by the four Eternal River Tier elites.

Although the battle had ended quickly, it had definitely lasted for at least 10 seconds. What did this mean?

This meant that the four Eternal River Tier elites had come across another Eternal River Tier elite!

This place... was dangerous!
