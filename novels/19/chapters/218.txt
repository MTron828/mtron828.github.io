Hearing the girl’s words, Ling Han’s impression of Gu Feng Hua instantly improved a considerable amount.

Using tricks to make a girl have no choice but to bathe, and take advantage of the chance to peek on her… this should have been a very despicable act. But from the moment the girl opened her mouth, he was sure that she was no decent girl, which proved that Gu Feng Hua still had his boundaries and had not used those kinds of tricks on decent, honorable girls.

As the saying goes, even thieves have their code of conduct. Though this was quite a bit different, but it was a kind of principle, after all.

…A pervert with principles.

Ling Han covered Niu Niu’s ears, and said, “Does your family know you are so unrestrained, Miss?”

“Giggle!” The girl trembled lightly with laughter and cast a coy glance at Ling Han, then said, “Big Brother, could it be that you’re interested in my master? Though my master is quite advanced in years, but she’s still very attractive, exactly the type of woman that a young man like you has the least resistance to.”

Ling Han shuddered, turned to Gu Feng Hua and said, “Pervert, this is your problem, you solve it!” After saying these words, he picked up Hu Niu and walked towards the lake. Now that the lake was no longer occupied, Hu Niu naturally could have her bath.

“Ya ya!” Hu Niu jumped down from Ling Han’s arms and completely removed all her clothing in a few moments. With a splash, she had jumped into the lake and began to play to her heart’s desire. “Ling Han, come play with Niu!” she said to Ling Han, acting spoiled.

Ling Han waved his hand with a smile. He had no desire to get undressed in front of others, especially when that woman was so shockingly unrestrained in her behavior.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Soon, sounds of battle came from the bushes and after a while, Gu Feng Hua came out with a swollen face that was not much different from a pig’s head. However, there was no sign left of that girl.

Ling Han was curious, and asked, “That woman is only in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, so why is Brother Pervert cutting such a sorry figure?”

Gu Feng Hua threw a disdainful look at Ling Han and said, “A good man does not fight with a woman!”

Ling Han’s mouth twitched. So that was why he had been so harshly beaten up… but that girl should have found out that Gu Feng Hua’s ability was far above her. Thus, she had only given him a beating and ran off to avoid inciting Gu Feng Hua’s killing intent.

In this mystery realm, the benefits of having a good background were much smaller. As long as you weren’t caught, who would know if you had commited murder?

“Hahahaha, why has your cultivation level fallen to the first layer of Element Gathering Tier?” Gu Feng Hua suddenly laughed, then he scratched his head. “When other people cultivate, they become stronger and stronger. But the more you cultivate, the more you regress. En, you indeed have some potential to be a pervert.”

Ling Han could not help but shake his head. Looks like if he did not break through to Gushing Spring Tier, his present condition would attract a lot of aggression towards him.

“That’s odd. Though your cultivation level is lower, but why is it that the feeling you give me is even more oppressive than before?” Gu Feng Hua said, looking a bit baffled and scratched his head, seeming very puzzled.

“Haha, you are indeed a pervert!” In the end, he credited everything to his being a pervert. After all, as long as he was a pervert, anything odd could be easily explained away by him as being perverted.

Ling Han did not want to be stuck in confusion about this point, so he asked, “Didn’t you go back into the mountains to cultivate? Why have you come here again?”

“On my way back, I’ve encountered a goddess and kept trying to hit on her. In the end, I ran into this place somehow, and was separated from that goddess.” Gu Feng Hua suddenly startled, then said, “I won’t chat with you anymore. I still have to go find my dream girl.”

Xiu , he broke into a run, and in a mere moment, there was no sign of him left.

Ling Han shook his head, and drew some clear water from the lake to wash his face.

Hu Niu did not find it that fun playing alone in the water. Thus, she only bathed herself clean then ran onto the shore. Acting spoiled, she had Ling Han dry her and help her wear her clothes before she finally smiled sweetly.

The two of them continued on their way, and witnessed much bloodshed throughout.

This place also contained people of the Nine Nations. It was possible that there might be some who were not randomly transported when they entered, which meant that the people of a nation may appear in the same big area. However, as they get closer to the Ring-shaped Mountain, since there were only four ravines that connected into the mountain’s depths, many of the people from different countries began to encounter each other.

Ling Han’s principle was: if you don’t mess with me, I would be too lazy to bother with you either. As someone who used to be an ultimate elite of Heaven Tier, he was very indifferent to the idea of belonging to a country.

“Brother, help me!” However, he had not managed to maintain his attitude of minding his own business and staying away from trouble for long when he saw a young man swiftly racing towards him from the wilderness. There were two middle-aged men wielding sabers chasing after him, wearing fierce expressions.

One glance was enough for Ling Han to know that this was an attempted robbery and murder.

It was no wonder that this young man had fixed his eye on him. He was dressed very richly—his clothing was made using high quality silk, and the various ornaments hanging from his clothes were all expensive. He was obviously a member of a rich family, and due to the random teleportation, he was separated from the elders of his Clan when he entered this place.

And he was only in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier. That was like an idiot carrying gold and parading around in the streets. It would be strange if he had not attracted others coveting his wealth.

This young man acted as if he was a drowning man who had managed to grasp onto a life-saving straw, and he did not care even if Ling Han looked younger than himself and had a little girl by his side. He simply ran towards Ling Han while screaming loudly at him.

When it was a matter of life and death, his speed miraculously became quite a bit faster than normal, and very soon, he ran behind Ling Han and pointed at the two men that had chased him as he said, “Brother, help me chase them off, and I will definitely reward you handsomely.”

“Yi?” The two pursuers stopped. One wielded a saber while the other held a sword, and they both gave Ling Han a glance before laughing loudly. “And here I was thinking that it was some kind of powerful character. So it’s just a little brat in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier!”

“What?!” the young man exclaimed in shock. Initially, he had thought that since Ling Han dared to bring a little girl with him and walk around so casually in this wilderness, he had to be extremely powerful. He had never thought that Ling Han was only in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier and was much weaker than even him.

Ling Han could not help but sigh. After merging the nine Nuclei, his cultivation level seemed to have dropped drastically. Not only his friends worried about him, but even others would look at him in disdain out in the wilderness. What a depressing thing.

“That’s fine. We’ll just kill them both!” The man armed with a saber looked fiercely at them.

Shua . His words had just left his mouth when he quickly shot forward, raising his sword to slash at Ling Han.

Ling Han merely raised his hand casually and the man’s wrist fell into his hand. The man was only in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, but even if they were at the same cultivation level, with Ling Han’s Five Element Origin Nuclei, he would have several times the power of this man—what more when he had broken through to the tenth layer and had power comparable to the first layer of Gushing Spring Tier.

“Yi?” The saber-wielder struggled but felt as if it was a metal chain that was holding onto his hand, and could not manage to get free at all.

“Fatty, what’s wrong with you? What’s so fun about playing with a little guy? Kill him quickly!” the man holding a sword urged.

The saber-wielder was already breaking out into a cold sweat. In front of him, Ling Han’s face was still very calm, and he even had a sliver of a smile on his lips. However, it was precisely this smile that made him a feel a coldness that seemed to penetrate into his body.

Da da da da… his teeth were endlessly clicking together as he said, “Old Zhang, come quickly and help me. This brat is strange!”

“What’s so strange? He’s just a piece of trash in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier!” the swordsman said disdainfully. “Fatty, this is not funny in the slightest. Kill off those two brats quickly.”
