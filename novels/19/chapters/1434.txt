Chapter 1435 Battle of the King Tiers

The king tiers were dazzled by her beauty. However, this feeling of elated surprise quickly turned into intense jealousy.

‘This breathtakingly beautiful woman already has a partner?

‘Detestable! Absolutely detestable!’

“Celestial maiden, if Ling Han truly wins, we’ll be sure to eat some stones,” someone said loudly. He refused to believe that Ling Han was also a rank two king tier. Meanwhile, Liu Juntian’s younger brother had been killed by Ling Han, so Liu Juntian would definitely go all out and unleash his deadliest attacks. As such, Ling Han was already as good as dead.

That being the case, this masked yet still seductively beautiful woman would immediately become a widow. Although marrying a widow was a little beneath their status as king tiers, what did that matter?

For this woman, it was worth it!

“Yeah, we’ll eat a stone if he wins!” numerous others said while patting their chests, all of them harboring the same thoughts. None of them wanted to appear weak before Empress Luan Xing.

Empress Luan Xing nodded as she remembered all of these people. When the time came, none of them would be able to escape punishment!

Not far from them, Liu Juntian was already burning with rage.

Hu!

The three fire dragons about his head danced and slithered about before one of them suddenly dashed out and swooped at Ling Han.

Liu Juntian was extremely cautious, and this first attack was only a probing one.

Ling Han snapped his fingers in reply.

Xiu!

A burst of Sword Qi slashed outward, instantly shredding the fire dragon into pieces. These shredded pieces then transformed into countless sparks that flittered in the air before vanishing. The fire dragon had failed to cause any damage.

However, Liu Juntian wasn’t worried in the least. If Ling Han couldn’t even withstand this strike, he would be a stain on the title of king tier. What did astonish him, however, was how easily Ling Han dealt with his attack. He was completely unable to determine Ling Han’s strength.

He raised his right hand and lightly made a pushing motion with his palm. Origin Power gathered before forming into another fire dragon. However, compared to the one from before, this fire dragon was at least a dozen times larger. The might that radiated from it was also numerous times more powerful.

Ling Han shook his head, again snapping his fingers in reply. Sword Qi burst forth, instantly reducing the fire dragon to sparks again.

During his 70 or so years on Cloud Apex Planet, his advance in cultivation hadn’t been significant. However, his improvement in the Sword Dao had been simply astonishing. With the help of the Reincarnation Tree and Reincarnation Tea, he was able to make huge progress on this path. In terms of Sword Dao alone, he could genuinely be regarded as a grandmaster of the current generation.

“Still trying to probe me?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “I came here to see king tiers, not to watch monkeys showing off their tricks.”

“What arrogance!!” Liu Juntian said with a humph. However, he finally ended his probing attacks, leaping forward and charging at Ling Han. At the same time, he unclasped his right hand, where a long spear rapidly materialized into existence.

This wasn’t a God Tool that he had retrieved from his Spatial Spirit Tool, but rather a weapon that he had formed using his Origin Power. Frighteningly, this spear was imbued with several divine patterns, making it appear like a supreme elite who was descending from another realm. It exuded a feeling of might and invincibility.

Liu Juntian brandished his spear and swept it toward Ling Han.

This was a secret technique that he had learned from an ancient site. This spear was profoundly mighty, and it was one of his most powerful attacks.

Ling Han didn’t dare to be careless. He was also a rank two king tier, and their cultivation levels were more so the same. Thus, their power would also be equivalent—of course, this would be different if he were a special case like Ding Ping, whose power could exceed his cultivation level by two stars.

In any case, he couldn’t underestimate a king tier like Liu Juntian.

Ling Han finally moved, making a tapping motion with his finger. The Lightning Sword Technique was instantly activated, sending bursts of Sword Qi into the surroundings, all of them incredibly quick.

“How arrogant!!” Liu Juntian shouted in rage. He had only been probing Ling Han before, so it was understandable that Ling Han had responded by snapping his fingers. However, he was already launching one of his most powerful attacks now, yet Ling Han was still responding by merely making a tapping motion?

‘You dissed me for probing you and being unwilling to unleash my trump cards, yet isn’t that exactly what you’re doing?!’

However, as the Sword Qi spread outward, he immediately felt the immense pressure that was radiating from it. The Sword Qi unleashed by his opponent genuinely appeared no weaker than his Origin Power spear. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ordinarily, his spear would be invincible whenever it was unleashed. Even if his opponent were more powerful than him, he would still be able to forcefully rip a hole in their defenses and aggressively attack, killing them in a single strike. Thus, although his power could only surpass six stars, his battle prowess could definitely surpass more than this, reaching seven or even eight stars!

This was the strength of rank two king tiers.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Han’s Sword Qi continued to exchange blows with Liu Juntian’s spear. Both of their attacks were formed from Origin Power, yet under the manipulation of the two powerful king tiers, they appeared incredibly real and tangible. Each time they collided, there would be dazzling flashes of divine patterns, followed by currents of air that seemed powerful enough to suppress all beings between heaven and earth. In fact, these currents of air would even transform into figures of demons.

This intense battle caused the other king tiers to all click their tongues in wonder. At the same time, their expressions also became especially serious.

Right now, each of them was a competitor fighting for a spot to enter the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. Following this, they would ascend the path of becoming a Saint.

Everyone understood that this was a narrow path that only one person could follow to the end. Only one person would be able to emerge from this competition as king!

Now, however, both Ling Han and Liu Juntian were displaying a domineering might that was enough to make them tremble in apprehension. How could they beat such supreme king tiers? Prodigies were divided into levels, and the same went for king tiers. How could rank one king tiers defeat rank two king tiers?

Meanwhile, the faces of some king tiers twitched unnaturally. These were the king tiers who had made a gamble with Empress Luan Xing. If Ling Han emerged victorious, they would have to eat the stones on this mountain peak!

Although eating a stone wouldn’t kill them, them being king tiers and all, this was still something that they definitely didn’t want to do. Firstly, stones would definitely taste disgusting. Secondly, eating stones would definitely feel horrible. Lastly, eating stones would be utterly humiliating, especially for king tiers such as themselves.

‘Liu Juntian, you’ve definitely got to win!’

Liu Juntian naturally wanted to win as well. Not only did he want to win, but he even wanted to kill Ling Han. Following a furious roar, raging flames instantly exploded from his body. These flames then transformed into black divine flames. Along with the dazzling spear in his hands, Liu Juntian appeared much like an ancient demon god.

Ding, ding, ding!

Sword Qi swept toward Liu Juntian. However, the divine flames enveloping him transformed into a suit of armor that surprisingly blocked all of the Sword Qi. Liu Juntian aggressively advanced, and it was as if nothing would be able to stop him.

‘Interesting!’

Ling Han squinted his eyes. This suit of flaming armor wasn’t incredible in its defensive capabilities, but rather devastating in its offensive prowess. It had disintegrated all of the attacks before it, and thus naturally rendered them unthreatening.

Fire-element cultivation techniques weren’t great in terms of defense. However, the person who had created this cultivation technique had raised the offensive power of flames to a pinnacle level, using offense to replace defense. This gave Ling Han an urge to clap his hands and exclaim in wonderment.

Not only this, but the suit of fire armor was also extremely capable of wounding the attacker. After all, would one dare to punch it with their bare fists?

Ling Han chuckled as he balled his right hand into a fist and directly launched a punch at Liu Juntian.

‘This...!’

Liu Juntian was astonished. The secret technique he was using was called the Scorching Flame Armor, and it was also a technique that he had obtained from an ancient mystery realm. Its powerful might was evident, and it was a suit of armor that could burn even elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. If one were at the high extreme, it was possible that they could even be directly incinerated into ashes.

‘You actually dare to touch this armor?’

After a moment as astonishment, Liu Juntian instantly sneered in his mind. His opponent was seeking death!

Both of them were king tiers, and it was very likely that Ling Han was also a rank two king tier. As such, their battle would have needed to drag on for a long time before a victor could finally be determined. However, who told Ling Han to be rash? He was actually facing his most powerful attack head-on! If this wasn’t seeking death, then what was?

‘Since you want death, I’ll grant it to you!’

Liu Juntian didn’t dodge, and thus Ling Han’s fist howled over just like that, directly blasting at his face.

At this moment, Liu Juntian felt extremely peeved even though he could envision Ling Han’s fist being ruthlessly incinerated into ashes. ‘F*cking hell, this person is far too despicable! He’s aiming right for my face! Doesn’t he know the saying to never aim for one’s face?!’

Ling Han’s fist arrived.
