3115 Framed

He Miaoyin had just lost a Meridian Guiding Pill, and found a bottle which contained an alchemical pill on Huan Xue. Was there such a coincidence in the world?

She must be the thief!

Ling Han frowned. He naturally believed that the little handmaiden was not a thief. This was an obvious attempt to frame her.

He had miscalculated. He didn’t expect that he wasn’t the target, but rather his maid was.

As the saying went, even if you hit a dog, you had to look at the owner first. If he interfered, then with “evidence,” he would only be dragged down into the mud as well. He might even be thought to be the mastermind behind it.

And if he did not do anything, then everyone would look down on him. If he could not even save his own subordinate, how could such a person be worthy of becoming the Dao Child?

Bullsh*t!

Ling Han looked towards Li Changdan. Had this gentle and refined-looking person come up with this idea?

He Miaoyin came over aggressively and appeared in front of Huan Xue. She raised her hand, and was about to slap her.

However, her hand didn’t land. It wasn’t because she was soft-hearted, but because there was another person in front of Huan Xue.

It was Ling Han.

“Get lost!” He Miaoyin said coldly.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This is my maid, so it’s not your place to discipline her.”

Hiss, everyone exclaimed in their hearts. Was Ling Han really going to go against He Miaoyin for the sake of a maid?

“How dare you!!” He Miaoyin sneered. Someone beside her came over and told her Ling Han’s identity. She gave an oh, and said, “So you’re Ling Han. No wonder you dare to be impudent in front of me!

“However, do you think I’m afraid of you?”

Her face was full of pride. “Now I wonder if you are the mastermind behind this. Are you the one who ordered this b*tch to steal what belongs to me? And now that you are trying so hard to protect her. You want to cover up the truth, right?”

“I didn’t steal it!” Huan Xue said anxiously.

“Humph, you have been caught red-handed, and you still want to deny it?” He Miaoyin glanced at Huan Xue with disdain.

“That’s right. We’ve caught you red-handed. How are you going to deny it?” Rui Yuanliang said with a smile.

“Sigh, I really didn’t expect Junior Brother Ling to be such a person!” Lao Liyan chimed in, directly targeting Ling Han.

“Hehe.” Tan Gaobo merely twitched his lips with a fake smile.

Li Changdan revealed a pained expression, and said, “Junior Brother Ling, how can you be so foolish…” He shook his head and turned to He Miaoyin. “Junior Sister, can you let this matter go on my account?

“Senior Brother will think of a way to give you a Meridian Guiding Pill.”

Everyone was in an uproar when they heard this. They felt a strong sense of respect for Li Changdan.

Look, this was the real person that they publicly acknowledged as a prodigy of the Ancient Dao Sect.

It clearly had nothing to do with him, yet he had taken on this matter to intercede on Ling Han’s behalf. In fact, in order to exonerate Ling Han, he had even taken on the debt of a Meridian Guiding Pill.

One had to know that he was a Nine Meridians, and he needed the Meridian Guiding Fruit and the Meridian Guiding Pill the most. If he obtained them, he would definitely consume them himself. But now, he was willing to give them away for the sake of his junior brother who was from the same sect. How could they not admire such generosity and kindness?

“Senior Brother Li!” Many people shouted. It was great to have such a senior brother in the sect. In the future, he would definitely be able to become a giant tree that supported the Ancient Dao Sect and protected them from the storms raging outside.

“Alright, for Senior Brother Li’s sake, I won’t pursue this matter any further,” He Miaoyin said as her beautiful eyes swept over Ling Han and Huan Xue, revealing deep disdain and ridicule.

“You’re really lucky to have Senior Brother Li to speak up for you. Otherwise, hmph!” She was still angry. To think that they actually dared to steal from her.

“Get lost, don’t let me see you again!”

Ling Han smiled faintly. Li Changdan really did things beautifully. Not only did he show off his greatness, but he also gave him a blow at the same time, confirming that Ling Han and Huan Xue had colluded with each other, and their supposed crime of theft.

In this way, no matter how much Sun Jianfang liked Ling Han, how could he have the cheek to make him the Dao Child?

Wouldn’t he be afraid of being laughed at if word got out?

“Wait!” Ling Han waved his hand. He had never been the type to allow others to bully him.

They wanted to frame him?

Hehe, didn’t they know that he had an attribute of being extremely lucky?

“You people… are really audacious!” Ling Han shook his head, and pointed at the bottle as he said, “This was clearly something I bestowed upon my little handmaiden. When did it become stolen goods?

“Is this a blatant robbery of what is originally mine?”

Ah?

Everyone was shocked. What was going on?

Logically speaking, even if Ling Han didn’t accept this favor from Li Changdan, he should still try his best to disassociate himself from this bottle and that alchemical pill. He could even say that he had been framed.

However, Ling Han actually said this. This was truly beyond everyone’s expectations.

Was he courting death?

Even Li Changdan didn’t expect this. This matter had gone completely out of his control. He felt a sense of unease that things might develop in an unknown direction.

However, he immediately shook his head. After Ling Han admitted it, wouldn’t that be even more impossible to refute?

‘Humph, I’d like to see how you court death.’

He Miaoyin was furious. This thief stole from her, and still dared to make a false countercharge?

“You scoundrel, how dare you slander me? Fine, fine, fine. If I don’t punish you today, my name won’t be He Miaoyin!” she balefully said. She was already infuriated.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Since you all say that this is stolen goods, I would like to ask you, how do you prove that this is your alchemical pill?”

‘Is there any need to prove it?’

Everyone shook their head in their hearts. Ling Han’s counterattack or, rather excuse, was too weak.

‘Oh, He Miaoyin just said that a Meridian Guiding Pill was stolen, and she found it on your maid. Is there such a coincidence in this world?’

He Miaoyin suppressed her anger, and asked indifferently, “Let me ask you, what alchemical pill is this?”

“The Meridian Guiding Pill,” Ling Han said. Since he had been framed, this pill was definitely the Meridian Guiding Pill.

Everyone was stunned for a moment. ‘You even admitted it yourself. What else was there to say?’

“Humph, humph!” He Miaoyin sneered. She couldn’t be bothered to continue speaking. It was a complete waste of time.

Everyone looked at Ling Han as if they were looking at a fool.

How could such a person become the Dao Child?

What kind of joke was this? If he were to inherit the position of sect master, they would only be crushed to death by the rolling wheels of the great era.

Huan Xue, on the other hand, was extremely anxious. If killing herself could help Ling Han resolve this problem, she would give up her life without hesitation.

Ling Han laughed, took out a bottle from his shirt, and said, “I have another Meridian Guiding Pill here. Could it be that you guys are saying that I stole it again?”

Eh?

Why was there another Meridian Guiding Pill?

Ling Han took out another pill bottle, and said, “If it’s not enough, there’s still one more. Yes, there’s another here too.”

He took out the third pill bottle.

The Meridian Guiding Pills were too precious, and it was not safe to leave them in his rooms, so Ling Han kept them close.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Was this for real? So many of them were all Meridian Guiding Pills?

If these Meridian Guiding Pills were real, then this matter was really undecided.
