Chapter 1908: At the foot of the mountain

There was already not much time left until the agreed time with Yan Xianlu. Ling Han hurried, and continued to increase his abilities in alchemy.

In cultivation, he had already reached the fourth severance peak stage, and there was no further possibility that he could improve any further.

Neither he nor the Empress had refined the Heavenly Dao Jade, but they were instead waiting for an opportunity. For example, when they were fighting with first-rate prodigies, and could directly feel the aura of a fifth severance, then if they were to refine the Heavenly Dao Jade at that moment, they perhaps might be able to succeed in one go.

Other mountain rocks could attack jade, so Ling Han lingered on alchemy. Perhaps he could gain a breakthrough in alchemy, and while he was at it, open the doors to the next stage in his cultivation.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was very expectant. The circles that she mixed around in were initially only the Holy Daughters and Holy Sons of three-star forces, and now not only had she advanced to the level of five-star forces, she could get an invitation from Yan Xianlu, even. There was definitely not any heir of any random Celestial King Tier sect that was worthy of that.

It definitely had to be top-notch emperor tiers, stronger than even Zhao Qingfeng. Otherwise, they would only be worthy of becoming his subordinates. How could they be worthy of becoming his esteemed guests?

“Yan Xianlu, exactly what kind of prodigy is he?” Both Ling Han and the Empress were very curious. Ever since they entered into the Eternal Prosperity Sect, there was talk everywhere about the legend of Yan Xianlu, and it was like he was a second Eternal Prosperity Celestial King.

No one doubted that Yan Xianlu could become a Celestial King, and everyone was rather wondering exactly what heights he would be able to attain in future.

Fifth Heaven? Seventh Heaven? Eighth Heaven? Or even... Ninth Heaven!

At the foot of Three Yang Peak, people gradually came, but not a single person climbed the mountain.

Because there was not a single person that could ascend.

Ling Han had tried previously. He, too, could not ascend. There was a supreme pressure, and even the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water could not resist it.

That was because this was not purely pressure, but also contained the martial intent of a supreme elite!

To say the least, even if it was just pure pressure, it had originated from an eighth heaven Celestial King, and even the Source Power of heaven and earth was only Celestial King Tier-level, but there were still nine heavens in Celestial King Tier. Perhaps it could only be comparable to the First Heaven, or possibly Ninth Heaven. The possibility that it could resist an Eighth Heaven Celestial King was extremely low.

How was he going to go up then?

Even these two Source Powers of heaven and earth were completely helpless. Then, even if Yan Xianlu was at fifth severance, Ling Han did not believe that the former could set foot.

Perhaps this place could not be entered at any time, but rather one had to wait for the time that it opened like some kind of Mystery Realm.

The day the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King achieved dao.

It should be this one day, and that was why Yan Xianlu had said when the three stars aligned.

There were more and more people coming, and they all waited at the side. Some indeed attempted to ascend the mountain, but they were very soon defeated with flushed faces and ears. In the face of Celestial King Tier-level pressure, no matter what kind of supreme prodigy you were, you could only feel powerless and incompetent.

The Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou drew looks. There was no need to mention Bewitching Maiden Rou. She was born delicate and extremely lovely. Though she was not ******, her index of attraction was still off the charts.

The Empress still kept a very low profile, and wore a piece of white muslin on her pretty face, covering her exquisite beauty. However, her perfect figure and incomparable bearing could not be concealed in any form or manner. Her attraction was definitely not inferior to Bewitching Maiden Rou’s.

Since they had the free time now, a great many people began to admire these two women.

Some were more reserved, while some were incredibly direct. They were just looking boldly, completely unrestrained in their attention.

Looking was a right that belonged to everyone, but just staring straight on like that, was that appropriate?

Ling Han strode forwards and arrived in front of a man.

“Hey, you’re blocking me.” This was a young man with a large, tall build. He had a head of dark blue hair, and there were two horns on his head that were similarly exuding a dark blue light.

Ling Han frowned, and said, “If you keep staring at someone like that, it is very impolite.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Haha!” The blue-haired youth hollered in laughter, then looked at Ling Han, and said, “Ugly, have you heard the saying that only heroes are worthy of beauties!?”

“Oh, are you a hero?” Ling Han asked evenly.

“That’s right. I, Zhu Xuege, am the strongest prodigy in this world!” The blue-haired youth stuck out a finger and tapped his chest.

“Hehe, how boastful of you!” Ling Han had not said anything when he heard someone else interrupt coldly.

Among those who were invited here, which of them was not a supreme prodigy?

It should be known that even Zhao Qingfeng was only Yan Xianlu’s subordinate, and was not worthy of becoming his guest.

For this kind of emperor tier, or in fact monarch tier, who would yield to another?

“And who the hell are you?” Zhu Xuege turned around, shouting at that person, his tone very unfriendly.

This young man who had interfered proudly declared, “Liu Feizhang!”

“Never heard of you!” Zhu Xuege snorted.

“Then now you know, and you will remember it for the rest of your life because I am the person that will bestow terrible defeat on you!” Liu Feizhang moved aggressively, stretching out his left hand, which turned into a gigantic golden beast’s claw, clawing out at Zhu Xuege.

“Haha, you are asking for your own humiliation here!” Zhu Xuege did not cower in the slightest. With him brandishing both arms, a dark blue ocean appeared, and there was the sound of massive waves crashing against the coast, greeting the incoming attack with earth-shattering power.

Boom!

The two young prodigies broke into a great battle. Both of them were outstanding characters in the Severing Mundane Tier, and even if neither of them had reached fifth severance, they had traveled a very far distance in the empty vacuum between Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier, so their battle prowess was incredibly astonishing.

Ling Han was shocked. Why had someone stolen his business?

He rubbed his chin. Could it be that he really had a halo of bad luck? Otherwise, why had everything been all well just now, but when he had just spoken a few words, there would be someone coming to blows fiercely?

Though he was very restless, and very much wanted to make a move—he had been concocting alchemical pills over these three years, and did not have a chance to move at all, after all—he was disdainful of joining forces with another, and besides, he could not bring himself to make a move on Liu Feizhang, so he could only step back in great disappointment.

“Yo, does Lord Holy Son want to fly into a rage for the sake of his lover?” Bewitching Maiden Rou laughed lightly, covering her mouth with a hand. Her beautiful figure shook seductively, and was incredibly captivating. “Unfortunately, someone has snatched your business from you.”

“Do you believe that I will spank you?” Ling Han threatened.

“Could you bring yourself to?” Bewitching Maiden Rou looked at him plaintively, looking very pitiful.

Pretender!

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Bewitching Maiden, don’t lose your own measure in your joy. If I go all the way with you, and just leave without a word, whom would you be making your complaints to?”

Bewitching Maiden Rou felt her heart jolt. Facing other men, she was confident that she could twist them around her little finger, and easily play around with them. But Ling Han was different from the rest. It was like his heart was practically forged from iron. If she really slept with him, how could the Holy Daughter of a mere three-star force seek justice from the future chairperson of a four-star force?

Seeing Bewitching Maiden Rou was intimidated, Ling Han’s heart relaxed. Even he could not help but admit Bewitching Maiden Rou was very captivating, but what could he do when the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden allowed her to follow?

“Husband, you are not only capable of attracting trouble yourself, you can also affect others,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said smilingly.

At this time, Liu Feizhang and Zhu Xuege had both become truly angered as the battle progressed. Both great prodigies were using all their abilities, like two suns at noon.

As the Empress watched, her expression was slightly solemn. After a while, she said, “These two people are both very strong! If I didn’t use any trump cards, I would at most be capable of just fighting them to a tie.”

Ling Han nodded. Both of them were not just a bit stronger than Zhao Qingfeng. The Empress had not overestimated them, nor was she underplaying her own abilities, but merely stating facts.

Furthermore, the Empress had her trump cards, but these two probably had theirs too, right?

“You should be able to assuredly defeat them,” the Empress continued, her tone incredibly certain.
