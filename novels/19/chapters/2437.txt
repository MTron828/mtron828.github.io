Chapter 2438: Floating Corpses

“Heh, he was truly seeking death,” someone mused.

“How so?” someone beside them asked.

“Don’t you know? He’s Ling Han!” the person replied.

“Ling Han?”

“Gasp! That Ling Han?!”

The cultivators in the surroundings finally came to their senses. They had all heard the rumor before—three Heavenly Venerates had done battle, and the trigger was none other than a youth called Ling Han. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

No wonder he was so powerful. As someone who could interact with Heavenly Venerates, how could he not be powerful?

Ling Han ignored their reactions. He grabbed the red wolf’s corpse and tossed it into the sea. Those who attacked others needed to be prepared for being killed instead.

No one dared to snatch this corpse. The ill fate of the red wolf was already warning enough.

Ling Han and the three women jumped onto the corpse of the wolf. This corpse was big enough, measuring nine meters in length. Standing on top of it, they didn’t feel squished at all.

With a casual wave, Ling Han sent a burst of energy at the sea, triggering a wave and carrying the “wolf ship” forward.

“Let’s test out the might of the seawater first,” he said.

They would very likely have to battle on the sea, so he had to figure out whether he could touch the seawater or not. Moreover, he had to determine how much he could interact with, if at all.

Ling Han carefully stuck a finger into the seawater.

An aura of death instantly surged toward him, yearning to exterminate his vitality, sending him into an eternal slumber.

Ling Han humphed as he unleashed his Celestial King Tier might, instantly stopping the aura of death.

This aura of death was extremely powerful, though it was still a fair way off reaching the Celestial King Tier. Ascending Origin Tier elites would be unable to block it, but Pseudo-Celestial Kings could face it without fear.

Ling Han nodded in his mind. His physique was astonishing, and he was also brimming with vitality. Thus, he could easily block the infiltration of this deadly aura. However… when he raised his hand, he saw that his palm was filled with a gray matter. This greatly affected the power of his Regulation attacks.

“But my Body Art isn’t affected,” Ling Han said with a smile. This aura of death was similar to the Regulation of Darkness. However, the Celestial Realm most likely didn’t have the Regulation of Darkness. This matter was slightly uncanny, but it was definitely something on the level of Regulations.

Thus, this was one Regulation acting upon another. It didn’t affect his Body Art at all.

“If I have to battle on the seas, I’ll actually enjoy an advantage,” Ling Han said. This sea possessed a mysterious power that stopped everyone from flying. Even with his Celestial King Tier power, Ling Han was also subject to this restriction.

Thus, if they did battle on the seas, even Celestial Kings would have to tread on the seawater. As such, their strength would definitely be detrimentally affected.

“This seems like a battlefield that’s tailor-made for me.”

The Empress and the others also tested their reaction to the seawater. They could also resist the aura of death, yet they would need to exhaust a great amount of energy to do so. This was equivalent to slashing their battle prowess.

“No worry! Let’s head off!”

Ling Han pushed with his palm again, causing the wolf ship to immediately speed up, cruising into the depths of the sea.

Boom!

A towering wave crashed over, measuring over 300 meters in height.

Ling Han stood with sword in hand at the front of the wolf ship. After gathering power for a short while, he unsheathed his sword and unleashed a powerful burst of Sword Qi. Like a wrathful divine dragon, the burst of Sword Qi roared toward the gigantic wave.

Peng!

The two collided, and the wave was violently obliterated.

Hua…

Water splashed down, streaking past Ling Han’s body. However, not a single drop hit him.

Ling Han was brimming with energy, and he didn’t need the three women to help him at all. He could stand here until the end of time.

After several hours, the shore behind them had already vanished on the horizon. Meanwhile, the sea also became much more peaceful and calm.

The Celestial Path also experienced cycles of day and night, and right now, the sun was setting in the west. It was as if a giant fireball were hovering above the sea, fiery red in color and strangely large. However, a cycle of day and night would take three days in the Celestial Path. Thus, the setting sun continued to linger in the sky for a long time.

“Huh? Something’s drifting over in front of us,” Ling Han suddenly said.

The three women all stood up to gaze ahead, only to see that there was indeed some foreign matter drifting toward them. It bobbled up and down in the water.

“It’s a person,” the Empress said.

Ling Han looked carefully, and he said, “It’s the person who set off before us.”

They had personally witnessed this person jumping onto a corpse and setting off into the sea. Right now, Ling Han could say with certainty that this was the same person.

At this moment, he had most likely become a corpse. After all, Ling Han didn’t believe that he could endure the aura of death in the sea for so long.

Ling Han pushed with his palms again, steering toward the corpse.

They drew closer and closer before colliding together.

A wave swept over, turning the corpse around and causing its belly to face the top.

Sure enough, it was that person.

“Being able to arrive here is an indication that he was powerful enough to suppress the waves. However, now that he’s died…” Ling Han paused for a moment.

“That signifies other dangers in the sea,” the Empress continued.

“Be careful,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said.

Even though the four of them were powerful, there were many beings in the world that were even more powerful than them. This was especially the case in unknown environments such as this. They needed to be extremely wary and careful.

All of a sudden, Ling Han was overcome with a sense of indescribable danger. It was as if someone had stabbed a needle between his brows, causing intense piercing pain. He immediately channeled his power, with his eyes becoming intense and his sword ready to attack.

Meanwhile, the Empress and the others had already formed a flawless tacit understanding with Ling Han. They immediately entered a defensive stance, not needing his warning at all.

However, where was this danger coming from?

At this moment, the corpse suddenly opened its eyes!

This was extremely harrowing. A dead person had suddenly opened their eyes, and they more so didn’t possess any pupils at all. Their eyes were a deathly white.

‘F*ck!’

Cold sweat instantly formed on the backs of Ling Han and the others. It wasn’t that they hadn’t seen dead people or sinister beings before. Rather, it was that the aura emanating from this corpse was far too eerie and cold. It was definitely at the Celestial King Tier.

The corpse raised its head and suddenly opened its mouth, revealing a row of razor-sharp teeth. It leaped up to gnash at Ling Han.

Humans definitely didn’t possess such razor-sharp teeth. Each tooth was like a piercing spear, and it appeared as uncanny as could be.

“How pretentious!” After locating the source of the danger, Ling Han surprisingly became calmer instead. He clenched his right fist, and threw a punch at the corpse.

The corpse didn’t dodge, and it instead widened its mouth, aiming to bite Ling Han’s fist.

“You want to see whether my fist is harder or your teeth are stronger?” Ling Han mused. He gladly accepted this challenge, resolutely following through with his punch.

Crack!

The corpse forcefully closed its mouth, biting down on Ling Han’s wrist.

Ling Han cracked a grin. He unleashed the power of his punch, and the teeth of the corpse were completely unable to withstand this might.

Peng!

His punch directly struck the corpse’s throat.

The corpse shuddered violently, and it was as if its eyes were about to pop out. However, it continued to hold onto Ling Han’s wrist, obstructing his movements. It then reached over with its arms to grab him.

Just how long had passed? However, its fingers had already become extremely long and sharp, and it was as if they were steel swords.

“I’m telling you, you’re dreaming,” Ling Han said with a shake of his right arm.

Crack, crack, crack…

The teeth of the corpse shattered, and with a flick of his arm, the corpse was sent flying.

Plop!

The corpse landed back in the ocean, sending a splash of water into the air.

After just an instant, the surface of the sea was disturbed again, with the corpse resurfacing and attacking Ling Han and the others with countless drops of water.

Ling Han slashed down with his sword.

Weng!

The drops of water instantly froze in the air. After a brief moment, they then shot back at an even quicker speed.

Pu, pu, pu!

The corpse was instantly riddled with wounds, yet it didn’t shed a single drop of blood.
