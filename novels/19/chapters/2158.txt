Chapter 2159: Fledgling stage of alliance

‘Huh?’

Ling Han had just been suspecting if his ears had heard it wrongly. Someone as proud as Yi would actually say such words. But upon further thought, Ling Han’s present battle prowess had far surpassed the level of monarch tier, and he had indeed gained the qualifications that would make Yi willingly submit.

He had never been fond of being bound. His first reaction had been to refuse, but when he thought further, his future goal was to become a Heavenly Venerate, and the storm of darkness was a wall that he could not circle around. A great war would definitely break out.

If he went to battle a Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerate, Celestial Kings would naturally need to be there to oppose those 10th Lotus and 18th Lotus elites from the Foreign Realm as well.

Hence, he indeed should develop his own force, and it had to be an incredibly powerful force at that.

Thinking of this, Ling Han changed his mind, and said, “Brother Yi, I have something to tell you. Come, let’s go to an absolutely safe place first.”

Since he planned to take Yi as his capable assistant, Ling Han also chose to become upfront and honest, and brought Yi into the Black Tower.

“This is…” Yi was stunned. It was not that he had never entered a Spatial God Tool, or the blessed paradise that had been created through the great power of Celestial King Tier, but compared with this place, those were like toys made of sand that had been piled up by the hands of a child. The difference was too great.

“This is the internal space of a precious tool of mine.” Ling Han did not directly speak of the origins of the Black Tower, but rather began explaining about the storm of darkness.

As Yi listened, his expression gradually became serious, but there was a fighting spirit burning within his eyes.

Ling Han knew that he had not erred in judgement. This was a man that was brave enough to bear responsibility, and had not chosen to flee because the Foreign Realm was too strong, even if he was presently just a mere Yin Soul.

When he spoke of the fact that Heavenly Venerable Tier was above even Ninth Heaven Celestial King, Yi inhaled sharply. This was a strong blow to his inherent perspectives. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Brother Ling, will we be fighting side by side against the storm of darkness in the future?” Yi was filled with a fighting spirit.

Ling Han laughed, and replied, “Of course!”

“All right!” Yi clapped his hands once, his eyes burning.

“Then I will anticipate the arrival of that day,” Ling Han said.

“Brother Ling, the force of darkness is too terrifying. Don’t you plan on developing your own force?” Yi asked.

Ling Han nodded. “I do indeed have such plans, but there are many elites in the Foreign Realm. If I want to establish my own force, every single member would need to possess powerful strength… Let’s put it this way: they would have to all be Celestial Kings at least, or possess the potential to become a Celestial King.”

Others would definitely kill themselves with laughter if they heard this. Celestial Kings could establish their own great sect, so why would they have to lodge under another person’s roof, and obey the commands of another?

Even for factions like Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces, there would only be about 100 Celestial Kings in the sect. The absolute majority would be those like Ascending Origin Tiers, Immortal Palace Tiers, and Dividing Soul Tiers.

Yet Yi did not see anything strange about it. “Without becoming Celestial Kings, they would not be qualified to stand against the storm of darkness at all. Brother Ling, since you have this idea, I can help you to contact some monarch tiers. There is no need for us to establish a great sect, but we can set up an alliance instead.”

Ling Han nodded. Most monarch tiers were nurtured by great sects, and to say nothing of whether these great sects would be willing to relinquish them, these monarch tiers might not want to leave, either.

But if it was just forming an alliance, that would be different. There was no need to surrender their present status and identity, and they merely had to rally on the same side when they were opposing the storm of darkness.

“All right!” Ling Han nodded. After some thought, he took out a great amount of Reincarnation Tree leaves, which he handed over to Yi. “Take these Reincarnation Tree leaves, and you may bestow them as gifts as appropriate. Consider it a show of sincerity from me.”

“Reincarnation Tree leaves!” Yi couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. This could assist in comprehending Dao, and even Celestial Kings would be happy to use them as tea leaves.

“This space has time acceleration of 100,000 times, and is very helpful for cultivation as well,” Ling Han said smilingly, revealing another “tiny” secret. “Additionally, I am a Four-Star Alchemist, and am presently breaking through to Five Stars. You may talk about this as well.”

Yi was gaping in shock.

100,000 times of time acceleration, and such a colossal space, this was too much. Even when his master went all out, he could only set up a time acceleration formation of around 400 times.

Furthermore, the formation could not be maintained for too long, either.

…How could a Celestial King compare to a Heavenly Venerate?

Heavenly Venerate was an existence that had surpassed this heaven and earth, and naturally was out of the control of this heaven and earth! Initially, the Black Tower had not been so awesome, but added with the Source Power of Time, it was a completely different story.

This was an external object, and Yi could only envy Ling Han’s good fortune, but more importantly, Ling Han was also a f****** Four-Star Alchemist!

That was too much. How could there be such a freak? How could anyone else live with such high standards?

He took a deep breath, and only came back to his senses after a considerably long time. “So Brother Ling is also a Four-Star Alchemist. Then, I will have more certainty in convincing the others.

“Right!” Yi suddenly slipped off the shoes he had been wearing. “This is the treasure I discovered on the divine mountain. After wearing and activating them, speed can soar greatly. It is also precisely because of this that I had been hunted by that member of the Imperial Void Sect.”

Ling Han nodded. Ai Kaifeng wanted to kill him and snatch the treasure, but had not thought that Yi, a Yin Soul, would actually obtain a burst of speed after obtaining these precious shoes, and he had chased him all the way down the mountain. In the end, he just happened to bump into Ling Han, who had turned the situation around and killed himself instead, with Ai Kaifeng surrendering all the treasures he possessed to Ling Han.

Delivering his own life and surrendering treasures as well, what a kind person!

“Brother Ling, in thanks for your help, and also receiving gifts from you, this will be my return gift to you.” Yi handed the pair of shoes over.

Ling Han swept an eye over them. These shoes were woven from bamboo, and were really nothing special to look at. However, what kind of place was this? In the past, two Heavenly Venerates had died together here, and it was very possible that these straw sandals had been worn by Xiao Gu’s last life’s incarnation.

Having been touched by the aura of a Heavenly Venerate, even if they had really just been a pair of ordinary straw sandals, they would become incredibly amazing.

“A gentleman does not take the favorite belongings of others. Brother Yi, I appreciate your good intentions,” Ling Han refused.

Yet Yi shook his head. “If Brother Ling is unwilling to accept, I cannot bring myself to accept Brother Ling’s gift, either.”

“Aiya, pushing to and fro is such a waste of time. Niu will take it!” Hu Niu could not bear to watch, and jumped out to snatch the straw sandals.

The Empress, meanwhile, smiled faintly. The little girl’s action was greatly compatible with her own thoughts. Anything precious would have to belong to the Ling Clan, but it was another story whether they wanted it or not.

Since that was the case, Ling Han did not say anything further. He was not the type to be sloppy, either.

He and Yi discussed some more about building the alliance, and he finally gifted Yi some more Dragon Crystals. Then, he escorted Yi out of the Black Tower, and they went their separate ways.

…Yi had come to adventure in the Western Celestial Realm this time, and now it was about time for him to return. He also had a mission now—to unite the emperor tiers and monarch tiers of the Eastern Celestial Realm as much as possible, and form an alliance to resist the storm of darkness together in the future.

King tiers were unnecessary, as it was absolutely impossible for them to become Celestial Kings. Even if they were brought to the battlefield, they would only be cannon fodder.

Ling Han suddenly remembered that Small Tower had once said that the numbers of Celestial Kings in the Celestial Realm should far surpass the number that was apparent on the surface, but the number of Celestial Kings and Celestial King Tier forces that Ling Han had seen or heard of was not high.

Was it because those Celestial Kings had all gone to fight against the storm of darkness?

The Foreign Realm had been continuously unleashing offensives, but the connecting point could not yet allow Heavenly Venerates to pass through at the moment. When that day really came, a great war that would involve the entire Celestial Realm would definitely break out once more.

Ling Han mused ruefully, and then set out towards the Roc Heaven.
