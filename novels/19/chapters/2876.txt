2877 Can We Have Three More Battles? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han swept his gaze over his son. Sure enough, he would never return if not to ask for a favor. He would only remember his father when he had a favor to ask.

“Did they allow you to return to call for reinforcements?” he asked. This was his son, so he would naturally help no matter what.

“We agreed that we could both invite helpers. However, the helpers can’t be above the Second Tier,” Ling Jianxue said. “Otherwise, what use would it be? After fighting to the death among ourselves, if the Third Tiers and Fourth Tiers decide to take the mine for themselves, how can we compete with them?”

Ling Han was amused, and he said, “So you’re asking me to help? You want me to be that person who speaks up and sends them scrambling?”

!!

Ling Jianxue shook his head, saying, “Since we’ve already reached an agreement, we should play by the rules.”

Ling Han’s son was a fairly stubborn and inflexible person. Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. Being stubborn was a shared trait, but where had he learned the trait of being inflexible?

‘So be it, since this is my son’s decision.’

Ling Han nodded in response. “I’ll help you.”

“And Aunty Xing and Aunty Hu as well,” Ling Jianxue hurriedly added. Ling Han could only participate in a single battle.

Ling Han pursed his lips, and said, “Your Aunty Xing has just advanced to the Third Tier, and your Aunty Hu has just advanced to the Fourth Tier. Are you trying to break the rules?”

Ling Jianxue couldn’t help but feel disappointed. He was someone who always kept his word.

Meanwhile, Ling Feifan stood there murmuring to himself, saying that this was a world where might was right. Yet, his father was so stubborn and inflexible, so how in the world had he given birth to a mischievous son like him? Moreover, his grandpa was also full of tricks and extremely toxic toward opponents, yet somehow none of this had passed down to Ling Jianxue.

Ling Han clapped his hands, and said, “Alright, let’s set off.”

The three of them set off. In Ling Han’s eyes, this was only a small matter, so he didn’t mind going over and helping out a little.

One month later, they arrived at the foot of a large mountain. They then entered the mountain.

After several more hours, a canyon appeared before them. There were already many people waiting there.

They were mostly all Heavenly Venerates, and those who weren’t were all at the Ninth Heaven.

This dimension was far too difficult to reach, with the combusting fundamental particles forming a barrier that was extremely challenging for even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to pass.

Drawing someone into a spatial tool to bring them over?

That was also impossible.

The combusting fundamental particles would affect even the space inside a Heavenly Venerate Tool. Thus, bringing someone in a spatial tool would be nothing more than a death sentence.

Indeed, Ling Han had also left the Celestial Guest Residence in the uppermost space. He had no option but to do this.

Thus, those who were here were all at least Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. It was also because of this that the mines in the dimension were opened up a lot slower than the other dimensions. There were only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to use, and even the Heavenly Venerates would have to get down and dirty themselves.

However, did Heavenly Venerates not need to cultivate?

There was a severe shortage of personnel, which resulted in the mine being opened up extremely slowly. Otherwise, this was nothing more than a damaged high-level dimension, so the mines should have been cleaned up long ago.

The people in the canyon were very clearly divided into two parties. The atmosphere was tense, and it was as if a huge battle might break out at any moment.

“Ling Jianxue, you were gone for so long, yet you only brought back a single helper?” a solidly built man with messy red hair said.

Ling Jianxue wore a slightly awkward expression. He had initially wanted to bring Hu Niu and the Empress over as well, yet he hadn’t imagined that they would have already advanced beyond the Second Tier.

“This is my father, Ling Han,” he introduced.

The red-haired man clasped his hands, and said, “Friend Ling.” The people in his camp all nodded toward Ling Han in greeting. It was clear that they were all allied with Ling Jianxue.

“Huh? Ling Han? This name seems fairly familiar,” someone murmured. However, they didn’t immediately recall why.

“Since the final person has arrived, let us begin the competition,” someone from the other side said.

“Very well; let us begin.”

The two sides drew lots to decide who would send out a person first. They would then take turns afterward. After drawing lots, it was their opponents who would send a person first.

After discussing for a while, they sent out a woman in pink who was as beautiful as flowers.

After reaching the Heavenly Venerable Tier, one would be able to transform themself on a fundamental level. Being transcendent above the Regulations, to say nothing of their appearance, they would even be able to freely change their aptitude. Thus, it was almost impossible to come across ugly Heavenly Venerates. There were only those who were more unique.

“I’m Yu Lan; who’s willing to spar with me?” the female Heavenly Venerate said with a smile.

Ling Jianxue and the others also discussed it for a while before sending out a person.

Their battle lasted three days, yet it was Heavenly Venerate Yu Lan who emerged victorious by a whisker.

For the second battle, Ling Jianxue and the others sent a person out first. However, they suffered another loss.

After six battles, Ling Jianxue’s side suffered six losses in a row. This caused everyone’s morale to be extremely low.

Perhaps they were going to lose all 10 battles?

For the seventh battle, it was their opponent who sent someone out first. It was an elegant young man.

“Gasp! Mi Wenbai is personally going to battle?”

“Do they want to take this seventh battle in a single breath as well? They want to crush our fighting spirit?”

“But Mi Wenbai is already at the peak stage of the Second Tier. I heard that he more so fused together with the power of seven dimensions while he was at the First Tier, so his battle prowess far exceeds that of ordinary elites at the peak stage of the Second Tier.”

“We should just send some random person for this battle. We can still fight for victory in the final three matches. We’ll strive to obtain three veins of ore.”

The cultivators on Ling Jianxue’s side all wore apprehensive expressions. Their opponents had sent out their strongest member, and, truthfully speaking, not a single one of them could rival him.

They would inevitably lose this battle. However, whom should they send?

As Heavenly Venerates, all of them cared about their face. Thus, who would be willing to step forward to suffer a guaranteed loss? In fact, they might even suffer severe wounds from the battle. That would be a great misfortune.

They all exchanged glances. However, no one stepped forward.

Mi Wenbai smiled faintly, and said, “No one is going to accept this battle? Then I’ll consider that a forfeit. I’ll stay on for the eighth battle as well.”

How could he do this?

However, who dared to oppose him?

...

Ling Jianxue glanced at Ling Han, and said, “Father, it’s time for you to do something.”

Ling Han’s mind was elsewhere. He was currently observing the veins of ore here to determine whether there was anything valuable. Thus, he didn’t hear Ling Jianxue’s words. Only when his son nudged him with his elbow did he come to his senses.

“Ah, sure thing,” he replied casually. He confidently strode forward.

Everyone shook their head, lamenting that Ling Jianxue was screwing his father over. This battle was a guaranteed loss, and there was even a possibility of suffering severe wounds, yet Ling Jianxue had actually convinced his father to accept the challenge? Just how dodgy was that?

“You’re not going to forfeit?” Mi Wenbai asked with a smile.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “I’ve never had such a habit.”

Mi Wenbai didn’t get angry, and he said, “Then I’m so sorry… because you’ll develop that habit in the future.”

“Heh.” Ling Han picked at his ears, and said, “Are you trying to defeat me by running your mouth?”

Mi Wenbai’s smile froze. Running his mouth? It was Ling Han who was running his mouth, okay?! His expression turned cold, and he said calmly, “Enraging me will do you no good at all!”

“Enough with the nonsense!” Ling Han said as he strode over. Just how quick were Heavenly Venerates? Even though he wasn’t going at full speed, he still arrived before Mi Wenbai in just three steps. He then threw a punch.

“What audacity—”

...

Peng!

Before Mi Wenbai could even finish speaking, he was already sent flying by Ling Han’s punch.

Peng, peng, peng!

In a single breath, he crashed through a dozen or so mountains, and only then was his momentum stopped. He sank into a large mountain.

This…

Everyone fell silent, with many gasping in shock. This was simply inconceivable.

That was Mi Wenbai! Yet, he had failed to withstand even a single strike?!

Ling Han retracted his fist, saying smilingly, “Can I stay for the other three battles?”
