Chapter 1927: Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood

Even Ling Han was interested now. Yan Xianlu’s strength was undoubted, but this kind of powerful prodigy was actually no match for someone that only ranked ninth in another place?

That was a little hard to imagine.

Most importantly, Yan Xianlu had been exaggerated too much. Just how many people could be intimidated by merely the words of being born on the Celestial Path? Added with the fact that he was a true disciple of an Eighth heaven Celestial King, and was qualified to attain the Ninth Heaven in the future, his defeat was unthinkable and unacceptable.

It should be known that Yan Xianlu had always been considered as the strongest in the Severing Mundane Tier. In fact, once he advanced into the Dividing Soul Tier, he would not need too long to be considered as the strongest below the Immortal Palace Tier.

Lao Song couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Yan, the Wide Prosperity Heaven is actually that strong?”

The Celestial Realm was so huge, and merely the Calm Peace Heaven was enough for someone to spend tens of billions of years exploring. Which of the young prodigies gathered here had not passed the age of a billion?

Regarding the Wide Prosperity Heaven, all they knew about it was hearsay.

Yan Xianlu nodded, and replied, “That is indeed the case.”

“How could that be?” Shan Jitong also broke the silence. “The Wide Prosperity Heaven is ranked equal with our Calm Peace Heaven. There is practically no difference in the overall level of cultivation. How could such a massive disparity appear in this generation?”

Yan Xianlu shook his head, and answered, “I am not sure. My master has probably guessed the reason, but when I asked about it, Master’s expression was extremely solemn, and he said that the Wide Prosperity Heaven has made a very great sacrifice for the Celestial Realm, so it was not strange that they would be boosted by fortune in this way.”

Everyone heard this, and inadvertently was even more confused.

What did having made a great sacrifice for the Celestial Realm mean? What was the sacrifice? Furthermore, how had they sacrificed themselves? It was all completely baffling!

But would the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King speak random nonsense?

They didn’t understand what he meant by sacrifice, but at least they understood that the reason why so many prodigies had appeared in this generation of Wide Prosperity Heaven was because they had been boosted by fortune from heaven and earth.

For example, a few more Divine Fetuses had appeared, and they were all super Divine Fetuses, like Time Element and Space Element. In fact, there were some that had both.

Hence, in a battle of equals, they would definitely have a greater advantage.

In fact, after Celestial King Tier, everyone’s cultivation level would be the same. For example, if they were both at second heaven, yet you grasped three types of Regulations, which was equivalent to three second heaven Celestial Kings, then you would definitely be stronger than they who only grasped one type of Celestial King Tier Regulations.

Regulations were the strongest weapon that a Celestial had.

“Brother Yan, the reason why you have invited us here is to stand off against the Wide Prosperity Heaven?” someone asked. When they heard so much, everyone could guess at some clue.

Yan Xianlu shook his head, but then nodded, and answered, “Yes and no.”

He continued, “Close to 100,000,000 years ago, my master discovered a Mystery Realm that was naturally formed from heaven and earth, and within, there was a Source Power of heaven and earth that was being nurtured. Furthermore, it is close to maturity.”

He paused for a moment. As expected, he saw everyone’s breath quicken in excitement.

Source Power of heaven and earth could be said to be a treasure that was the most valuable in the whole world. Even a Celestial King would be tempted. Allowing one to observe the Regulations of heaven and earth from an endlessly close distance was very significant for those who had not reached the Celestial King Tier.

Furthermore, a Source Power could help one in battle. The strength of it would depend on the situation because while a Source Power of heaven and earth was Celestial King Tier in level, it could possibly be only first heaven in level, but could also possibly reach ninth heaven.

In summary, if one could obtain a Source Power of heaven and earth in the Severing Mundane Tier, that would be too terrifying.

“Because this Source Power of heaven and earth was still being nurtured, my master did not retrieve it. Furthermore, after my master did some observation, he discovered that this natural Mystery Realm was extremely frightening. Aside from a ninth heaven Celestial King being able to barge in by force, even if an existence like an eighth heaven Celestial King dared to be rash, he would still be killed by heaven and earth.

“Not only are Celestial Kings bound by this restriction, even the Ascending Origin Tier, Immortal Palace Tier, and Dividing Soul Tier elites have no way of entering. It is as if the heaven and earth are biased, and wish to gift this fortune only to Severing Mundane Tiers.”

When Yan Xianlu finished saying these words, he very naturally discovered everyone showed an expression of excitement that could not be suppressed. Even Lao Song and Shan Jitong could not hide their excitement.

“Brother Yan, I fear the matter is not as simple as that, right?” Ling Han spoke up. If this Source Power of heaven and earth could be so easily obtained, then what need was there for Yan Xianlu to inform them? He could directly go by himself to retrieve it.

Moreover, why had he deliberately spoken of the Wide Prosperity Heaven just now?

There was no one stupid here, and they all came to the realization.

Yan Xianlu nodded slowly, and answered, “That’s right. There is also a Celestial King from Wide Prosperity Heaven that has discovered this natural Mystery Realm, and also found out that this Source Power of heaven and earth exists. Thus, when the Mystery Realm opens, the Wide Prosperity Heaven will also be contesting with us for it.”

Hearing these words, everyone’s expressions changed.

Previously, Yan Xianlu had already said that even the Severing Mundane Tier ranked ninth in Wide Prosperity Heaven could defeat him, then even if Yan Xianlu was ranked 10th, there were actually so many heaven-defying freaks in the whole Wide Prosperity Heaven.

Then what was the point of contesting!

“Thus, we have to unite,” Yan Xianlu said. “I have a formation technique with me that can be used by 10 people. When it channels, not only can it compound upon the battle prowess of all 10 users, it can even increase their battle prowess tenfold!”

Compound, tenfold!

When everyone heard this, they all looked tempted. That so-called Shi Xiuwen definitely could not be 10 times stronger than Yan Xianlu. In fact, even the strongest prodigy of the Wide Prosperity Heaven could not possibly be so powerful.

Furthermore, Yan Xianlu was not the only one whose power would be compounded tenfold, but rather it was the united power of the 10 of them.

If they really had this kind of formation, there would be no enemy they could not overcome, no battle they could not win.

“Brother Yan, then after obtaining the Source Power of heaven and earth, how is it to be shared?” someone asked. Because Yan Xianlu, Shan Jitong, and Lao Song were all monarch tiers, who could be a match for them in the Severing Mundane Tier?

Yan Xianlu smiled faintly, and replied, “How could you retrieve a Source Power of heaven and earth just because you willed it? It will choose its master on its own. if there is no suitable candidate, it will evade and escape, and there is no possible way that we can compel it by force.

“Thus, we are only earning a chance for ourselves to appear in front of the Source Power of heaven and earth so it could make its choice.

“This... will have to depend on how lucky you are.”

Ling Han asked, “Brother Yan, after talking for so long, what exactly is this Source Power of heaven and earth?”

He already had the Source Powers of Water and Fire. If he obtained another Source Power of heaven and earth of the same elemental alignment, while it would still increase his battle prowess by some, it would not give rise to a fundamental change.

Small Tower had said that he should gather as many Source Powers of heaven and earth as possible before advancing into the Celestial King Tier. If he advanced into the Celestial King Tier under such conditions, he would be able to rush up to astonishing heights.

Thus, if this Source Power of heaven and earth was of any other element aside from Water and Fire, he would try as much as possible to make an attempt for it. If it was not, his enthusiasm would be greatly decreased.

Furthermore, Yan Xianlu had not spoken wrongly. A Source Power of heaven and earth could not be simply retrieved just because you wanted to, but rather it would have to depend on whether the Source Power itself was willing to follow by your side or otherwise.

Ling Han already had two Source Powers of heaven and earth in his body. If the third one was still Water or Fire, the chances of it choosing Ling Han would probably be close to zero.

Similarities would repel each other.

Yan Xianlu cast a second look at Ling Han. What he was concerned about was not Ling Han’s strength, but rather Hu Niu’s sweet attitude towards Ling Han.

Hu Niu was too powerful, reminding him of the heaven-defying freaks of Wide Prosperity Heaven.

He slowly answered, “This Source Power of heaven and earth is of the Wood Element, the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood!”

How strange. Since it was Wood Element, why was it Fiery Flame and Lightning Strike as well?
