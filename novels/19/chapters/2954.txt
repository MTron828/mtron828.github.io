2955 Tremor

How many Sixth Tiers were there in the world?

Thank you readers!

About 100—at the beginning, there might have been more, but internal strife had broken out previously, and there were also some Sixth Tiers that had died, so there were only about 100 of them now, and there wouldn’t be many more than that.

Although Sixth Tiers couldn’t be called supreme elites, they were still one of the few elites in the world. Each of them had the ability to sweep aside the ages.

Yue Borong and the others surrounded Ling Han, all of them filled with killing intent.

Ling Han was a person that had to be killed. Yue Borong, for example, was likely here to avenge the death of his son, while the other six thought that Ling Han was too freakish. Once he gained the battle prowess of Seventh Tier, that would cause immeasurable damage to the Genesis World.

“What do you want?” Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire asked a little timidly. These people were filled with blazing killing intent, which scared her.

“If she is together with this brat, she must be no one good, either. We kill her as well!” a Sixth Tier declared.

Yue Borong was the first to move. Boom! His palm moved, striking out at Ling Han and Jue Huo together.

“Ah!” When Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire saw this palm strike flying towards her, her first reaction was not to dodge or parry, but to grab her head and scream in fright. The sound turned into waves that surged out in all directions.

Ling Han had long since prepared himself. Not only had he covered his ears, he had also channeled over 100 dimensions to defend himself.

Ka, ka, ka! Multiple cracks appeared on the dimensions, but thankfully, they did not shatter.

Even so, Ling Han’s nose was still bleeding. He couldn’t completely avoid this vicious attack.

He was already in such a state, what more Yue Borong and the others. They were all directly sent flying. All the clothes on their bodies were torn and tattered, their skin cracked, and blood was gushing out.

So what if they were Sixth Tiers? Faced with the might of a Seventh Tier, a single cry was enough to have such an impact that their hair was disheveled, and they were bleeding from all their apertures.

Ling Han took advantage of the opening to charge out. He headed directly for Yue Borong. This old bastard had targeted him time and time again; he was too despicable.

Peng, peng, peng! From the very beginning, Ling Han was going all out. His eighth-grade seals were all unleashed, boosting his power by 1,000 times. With his basic power, which was now at the late stage of the Sixth Tier, he had already reached the extent of being able to crush Yue Borong.

Yue Borong was presently in a state of turbulence. Who would have thought that a woman who looked so fragile could actually burst out with such terrifying battle prowess?

He was a Sixth Tier, yet a Sixth Tier was actually unable to block the might of a mere cry. What did this signify?

This woman was a Seventh-Tier ultimate elite.

However, how was this possible?

The Genesis World of the two eras added together only had 10 Seventh Tiers, and even if there would be more in the future, they should emerge from among the Sixth Tiers like Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and Golden Silk Moth, but definitely not be this woman.

Even if his temperament was extremely calm, he was still feeling apprehensive at this moment. It was also because of this that he could only retreat continuously when faced with Ling Han’s barrage of attacks.

The other Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates were also numb with shock. They stared blankly at Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire, and their hearts were in a mess for a moment.

But they couldn’t go on like this forever, right?

“Greetings, Milady!” They all paid their greetings to Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire.

Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire looked at these people blankly. ‘You guys were so fierce just now, and now you’re acting so humble. What do you want to do?’ She asked weakly, “Why do you guys want to hit Niu?”

Pu!

The Sixth Tier elites couldn’t help but gape in shock. One of them even spluttered in his shock. Even the self-restraint of Sixth Tier wasn’t enough.

Niu[1]?

What Heavenly Venerate would call themselves that? Especially when this Heavenly Venerate was an immortal and indestructible Seventh Tier ultimate elite.

Her image instantly crumbled.

“Dare I ask, how do we address you, milady?” a Sixth Tier asked, clasping his hands respectfully.

Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire was instantly keen, and puffed out her chest. “Niu is Jue Huo.”? сom

Jue Huo[2]?

The six Heavenly Venerates exchanged looks, all appearing very puzzled.

Putting aside Seventh Tiers, they had never heard of such a Heavenly Venerate before.

A Heavenly Venerate could not possibly appear out of thin air… Of course, there was an exception in those that came from the Genesis World of the last era.

Hold on, could it be that this person was an ultimate elite of the Genesis World from the last era?

Right, right, right. This was the most likely deduction.

“Greetings, Lady Jue Huo.” The six elites bowed again.

Jue Huo looked very pleased with herself, tilting her chin as she looked left and right. She was very satisfied with this.

The six elites were even more puzzled. Was this really a Seventh Tier ultimate elite?

However, they had all personally experienced the power of this woman. If she wasn’t a Seventh Tier, then what could be considered a Seventh Tier?

They could only watch from the sidelines. Ling Han clearly had a close relationship with this Seventh Tier. If she didn’t speak, how would they dare move to deal with Ling Han?

Were they tired of living?

Ling Han unleashed his full power. In the first place, Yue Borong was no match for him. Added with the fact that he had been wounded by the roar of Jue Huo earlier—even though his injuries weren’t very serious—it would affect his battle prowess some.

Under Ling Han’s wave-like attacks, this effect was also continuously magnified, causing his disadvantage to become more and more obvious.

Yue Borong couldn’t help but feel shocked. How much time had passed? He was already no match for Ling Han?

At this rate, to say nothing of exacting revenge for the murder of his son, even he would have to die helplessly under Ling Han’s fists.

He hurriedly said, “Friends, are you really going to allow this despicable brat to commit crime?”

The six elites looked at each other, and finally turned to look at Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire. However, she had absolutely no intention of speaking, so who would dare make a move?

Was a Seventh Tier ultimate elite mere decoration?

Ling Han’s attacks became fiercer and fiercer. He had to kill Yue Borong in this two-hour-long power burst. Otherwise, even if he used the ninth-grade combination seals, the increase in battle prowess would drop to more than 200 times. In that case, it would be difficult to kill Yue Borong.

After all, he was a Sixth Tier. Throughout history, there were not many that could reach this kind of height. Which one of them was not a prodigy among prodigies, an overlord among overlords?

Yue Borong also knew this very well. He defended with all his might, not hoping to succeed, but merely hoping to survive these two hours.

He drew out a Heavenly Venerate Tool. It was a silver spear, and as the spear danced, it turned into multiple white dragons, possessing great might.

Since Yue Borong had advanced to the Sixth Tier, he had not used a Heavenly Venerate Tool, because the boost to his battle prowess could be considered negligible, but now he had actually unleashed it, which was proof enough of just how terrible his situation was.

Even if there was only the slightest bit of improvement, it was like a straw to clutch at. Just how hopeless was this situation for him? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ling Han roared endlessly. ‘Old bastard, I definitely won’t let you escape this time!’

Weng! He summoned all of his dimensions. In an instant, over 300 dimensions that were close to high-level appeared, illuminating the heavens and forming an indescribable pressure.

Pu!

Yue Borong’s movements froze, and he was instantly hit by Ling Han’s punch, causing him to throw up blood madly. He also spluttered out his internal organs, all of them shattered.

“Milady, please have mercy!” Seeing that Yue Borong was really about to die, the six elites finally couldn’t help but speak up, pleading with Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire.
