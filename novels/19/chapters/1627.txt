Chapter 1628: An ultra tribulation

Ling Han took a step forwards, and had entered into the galaxy.

He could not endure the heavenly tribulation on Wood Figure Planet, or the whole planet would be destroyed by the heavenly tribulation.

‘Hmm?’

Once he had entered into the galaxy, Ling Han sensed an incredibly powerful aura.

A Saint King!

It was the Open Clouds King. He had not gone too far, but was spying on him from nearby instead.

“Damn brat!” Once the Open Clouds King spotted Ling Han, he immediately flew into a thunderous rage. He, too, had a link of karma on him!

Zhong Badu had died at the hand of this boy!

Had he come out to surrender to death?

Crack!

But the Open Clouds King had not yet made his move when he saw the dense thunderclouds. A bolt of lightning had already struck, taking the form of a lightning giant that began its attack towards Ling Han.

He suddenly stopped.

With his strength, he naturally could tell clearly that Ling Han was undergoing the heavenly tribulation for a Saint. Furthermore, he was breaking through from the Eternal River Tier to the Genesis Tier. But the problem here was the commotion was too great—it was approaching... the heavenly tribulation for a Great Saint!

How was this possible!?

The tribulation for a Small Saint was actually equal to the tribulation of a Great Saint; just what kind of freak was this?

The Open Clouds King dared not make a move now. If he was to attack Ling Han at this moment, he would definitely be dragged into the heavenly tribulation, and the Saint King tribulation that would be expanded on that basis... The Open Clouds King dared not even imagine just how terrifying it would be.

However, there was one thing he could confirm, and that it was enough to kill him.

For the sake of killing a Small Saint, he would have to bury himself along with him?

This was something that only an idiot would do.

Furthermore, he did not believe that Ling Han was capable of surviving this kind of heavenly tribulation. What Small Saint was so awesome in this world that he possessed the strength matching a Great Saint’s?

Weng, weng, weng. Multiple golden pathways spread across the galaxy. The Saint Kings of the various Forbidden Lands had also appeared, gathering to watch Ling Han endure the heavenly tribulation.

“Old Geezer Zhong!” a Saint King greeted the Open Clouds King.

The Open Clouds King’s expression was guarded as he nodded at the other. However, he immediately communicated a message that allowed him to instantly grasp a considerable amount of information through his divine sense.

Ling Han had killed Saints before, and it was not just one. There were even two Saint Kings among them!

According to the news that had come from the Netherworld’s side, Ling Han had even killed a great many Heaven Demons!

This brat could merge the Regulations of the two Realms, and was thus valued by the many Forbidden Lands. In future, he could possibly become a core to merge the two Realms into one. Worse come to worst, even if he didn’t merge the two Realms, he could still open the doors to the Celestial Realm, and bring the many Forbidden Lands with him into the Celestial Realm.

At first, he was stunned, but then immediately smirked coldly. Ling Han’s inviting so many Saint Kings over this time round was obviously meant as a tactic to deal with him.

Going along that line of thought, Ling Han should no longer possess the means of killing Saint Kings.

Blazing light shone randomly in his eyes, and he was thinking whether he would take a massive risk—to make a move when Ling Han had finished enduring the heavenly tribulation, and obtain all his secrets in one go.

But the problem was, what if Ling Han had a hidden ace up his sleeve? Maybe everything was only his deliberate scheming, and he actually still had the means to kill Saint Kings?

Then that would be terrible.

The Open Clouds King was not the only one; a good many Saint Kings were also secretly pondering the chances of this. After all, only if they continued to maintain good relations with Ling Han would they be able to enter into the Celestial Realm, and they had been able to cultivate to the level of Saint King even in the Ancient Realm, so after entering into the Celestial Realm, breaking through to the Severing Mundane Tier would definitely not be difficult for them.

A Severing Mundane Ancestor, indestructible through the ages, and having a lifespan that lasted as long as the heavens themselves!

On one side, they could possibly become even stronger, and on the other, they could become indestructible Celestial beings. It was very difficult to decide between the two. More importantly, what if this was just a trap? Not only would they be unable to become Celestial beings, they might even possibly die.

They were really in a tough dilemma.

However, at least for the moment, no one dared make a move. If anyone dared to interfere in this kind of heavenly tribulation, they would definitely be dead!

Ling Han was a little uneasy as well. His present strength was indeed a match for a heavenly tribulation at the level of a Great Saint, but the problem was that he still had to temper his Godly bones. This meant that not only could he not counter, his defenses would also have to sink to rock bottom.

He only hesitated slightly, and then firmed his resolve. He was going to gamble!

He was in a more desperate need for strength now. Wolves were all eyeing him hungrily around him, and he would only be able to protect himself if he had strong power.

Boom, Ling Han shattered his own Godly bones to be tempered under the heavenly tribulation.

“Is he dead?” a few people exclaimed, and felt that it was a true pity.

Some of them felt pity that there would be no one else able to bring them into the Celestial Realm after Ling Han’s death, while others felt pity that Ling Han’s spirit had been destroyed in the heavenly tribulation, and his secrets would also be buried eternally in this heaven and earth with his spirit.

However, they immediately discovered that the aura that belonged to Ling Han had not vanished, especially the Open Clouds King. He could easily grasp the link of karma that was connected to Ling Han, which was still connected to the Zhong Clan.

‘He didn’t die!

“This... he is actually tempering his Godly bones within the heavenly tribulation. No wonder this brat’s physique is so frightening!”

“So this was how he managed to inscribe so many killing formations in his body.”

“But this is taking risks with his life. A mere Small Saint facing the tribulation of a Great Saint is filled with danger in the first place, and he does not defend himself with his full effort. Instead, he injures himself. Is he seeking death?”

“For the sake of strength, this brat is really putting too much on the line!”

The Saint Kings were all astonished. Even they would be moved by such firm resolve.

The Empress, the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, the large black dog, and the others all arrived in the galaxy. They were filled with confidence in Ling Han.

“This brat, he’s incredible!” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. Even he, an elite of the Immortal Palace Tier, was moved. Though he, too, could claim to be a prodigy himself, if his cultivation level dropped to the same level as Ling Han, he would probably be considerably inferior to the latter.

“Of course, it was all taught by this Grandpa Dog!” the large black dog exclaimed proudly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Shua, the Empress shot out a palm strike that turned into a flash of Sword Qi, scaring the large black dog into hurriedly dodging.

“Woman, don’t think that you can be reckless just because you are good-looking. If you push me too far, I will still bite you!” the large black dog barked. The Empress’s battle prowess was too frightening. She had actually torn off a patch of fur from his tail, which caused him much heartache. He had never experienced such a great loss.

Yet the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire only stared at Ling Han, and murmured, “Breaking through with 10,000,000 stars. Even in the Celestial Realm, there are not many that can accomplish such a feat—at least as far as I know, only a few male and female Saints within the larger sects are capable of it!

“But in this place, there are actually two people that succeeded!”

To Ling Han, this was a great danger.

The heavenly tribulation was too frightening. In a short while, it had increased from the heavenly tribulation of a Small Saint to the heavenly tribulation of a Great Saint. This required Ling Han to exert his full effort to be able to stand against such might, but he presently had given up resisting. Instead, he even unraveled his own defenses, and this caused him to suffer greatly.

His Godly bones were shattered with one blast from the lightning giant. Under the overwhelming power of a Great Saint, his physique was really inadequate. The Godly bones that had been shattered in the first place were directly turned to dust, which was a serious threat to Ling Han’s life.

If this went on, he would definitely die.

Ling Han channeled a drop of Indestructible True Fluid so that his body would rapidly rebuild itself. This was not tempering his physique, but rather a move to seek death. He began to actively defend himself against the heavenly tribulation. Since the heavenly tribulation was so strong, he actually did not need to shatter his Godly bones to be tempered, because the heavenly tribulation was strong enough. Even in a complete condition, he would be able to obtain enough tempering.

With a battle cry, he used one celestial technique after another, greeting the barrage of the heavenly tribulation.

Why was the heavenly tribulation for himself and the Empress so strong?

Logically speaking, it had never been so exaggerated when he had broken through from the pinnacle level to the next major tier in the past. ‘I am strong, because I have exerted enough effort, and the heaven and earth should reward me for it instead of laying on punishment.’

This should be because he and the Empress had merged the Regulations of the two Realms!

Ling Han suddenly had a dawning realization. At the essence of the matter, the Ancient Realm was divided into two worlds, and both repelled the other. Though he had merged the Regulations of the two Realms, and they were complete in his body, the Regulations of the Netherworld were still treated with animosity by the Immortal Realm.

As the heaven and earth of the Immortal Realm saw it, it was as if Ling Han himself was an invader from the Netherworld, so they naturally would spare no expense to destroy Ling Han.
