2929 Who is the Chosen One?

Feng Wuding’s confidence was reignited.

He released a battle cry. It was all right. His advantage lay in the fact that he had more power behind him. At present, he was only slightly inferior to Ling Han. When he advanced to the Fourth Tier, he would then be able to surpass Ling Han. At the very least, they would be evenly matched.

When he advanced to the Fifth Tier, he would be able to suppress Ling Han in terms of raw power.

“Take a finger from me!” he said balefully. He gave a tap with his finger, and endless brilliance condensed at the tip of his finger, pressing down towards Ling Han.

!!

This attack was extremely terrifying, as if even the defense formed by a Sixth Tier could be easily shattered.

Ling Han’s gaze became focused. This tap was indeed extraordinary, condensing all of Feng Wuding’s power into a single point; the destructive power naturally increased by tons.

This was a very simple thing to say, and anyone could easily think of it, but the power of Heavenly Venerable Tier was already incredibly condensed, and to compress it further to a single point was really, really too difficult to accomplish.

Feng Wuding being able to do this was indeed very impressive.

However, could he become the strongest prodigy of the Genesis World of the last era and even obtain the inheritance of Genesis World just because of this?

Ling Han shook his head; this was definitely not enough.

He condensed Fists of Fury, and charged ahead to block Feng Wuding’s attack.

Pu, pu, pu, pu, pu! After a few consecutive attacks, multiple bloody marks instantly appeared on Ling Han’s fists. Those were marks that had been forcefully created, but Feng Wuding did not seem to have the upper hand, either, because his finger had twisted strangely.

With the head-on clash, the bones in his finger had also been dislocated, and there were even some fractures in his bones.

Feng Wuding finally withdrew the last shred of his pride, and looked at Ling Han solemnly.

Even the Eternal Destruction Finger could do nothing against this opponent?

This finger technique was something that he had comprehended through countless epochs of deep slumber, and was integrated with some kind of mystical power of the Genesis World.

In the battle against Ling Han, he actually couldn’t gain even the slightest bit of upper hand?

He was filled with extreme jealousy. Even if he was confident that he would be able to crush Ling Han when he advanced to the Fourth Tier or Fifth Tier, he actually did not manage to suppress Ling Han in a battle of equal cultivation levels. Instead, he was at a slight disadvantage, which actually made him extremely jealous and resentful.

“Humph, then let’s have a competition based on background!” he declared.

The two of them exchanged blows, and after more than an hour, the first-grade seal that Ling Han had augmented his power with had already finished releasing its energy. Immediately, it dimmed. However, because Feng Wuding had moved later, this seal of his could be channeled for another 15 minutes.

Ling Han smiled calmly. Weng! All the ninth-grade seals lit up, instantly boosting his battle prowess by more than 200 times.

“Yi!” Feng Wuding was greatly shocked. He never thought that not only did Ling Han possess a first-grade seal, he also had a complete set of ninth-grade seals. The might of this far surpassed a first-grade seal, and under the strike of three consecutive punches, Feng Wuding was throwing up blood.

“Don’t think that you’ve won!” he roared in fury. Weng, weng, weng, weng! Four seals lit up on his body at the same time, and a terrifying aura spread out. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

His battle prowess soared, instantly reaching the point where he could rival Ling Han.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged blows, yet it was hard to decide who was the stronger one between them.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. These were actually another four first-grade seals, and they were combination seals at that.

‘Let’s battle it out!’

The two of them continued to exchange blows, but their raw power was more or less equal, and the Heavenly Venerable Seals were also more or less equal in amplification, so it couldn’t be decided who was the stronger one between them no matter what.

“Humph!” Feng Wuding’s eyes sharpened, and his right hand tapped towards Ling Han. Weng! A shadow appeared, turning into a world.

Dimensional projection!

This wasn’t strange. Top-notch prodigies would definitely nurture dimensions in their bodies. This was a sustainable path, unlike with the Empress, who was extremely strong at first, but she would slowly be caught up with by others as her cultivation level increased.

Boom, the dimensional dimension pressed down. Though its power wasn’t extremely overbearing, it was still a dimension after all, so it brought overwhelming pressure.

Ling Han also channeled a dimensional projection to meet this oncoming attack.

Peng!

Although the collision of two dimensions wasn’t exactly real, with the condensed power of the Heavenly Venerates, it was half-real and half-solid, and therefore still extremely terrifying.

Under the clash of such violent impact, both of them were knocked backwards, but they immediately came charging back and fought fiercely.

“There’s more!” Feng Wuding roared. He actually channeled another dimensional projection.

Ling Han was not surprised. As long as a Seventh Tier lent a helping hand, a supreme prodigy would be able to nurture two dimensions. Ling Han wasn’t inferior, either, and channeled a second dimension.

Peng!

The four dimensions collided, and the ensuing shock wave was naturally even more terrifying.

“What? These two people can actually nurture two dimensions inside their bodies?”

“Th-th-this, no wonder these two people can battle those surpassing their cultivation level. I heard that even those incredibly freakish prodigies could only accommodate a single dimension.”

“How impressive indeed!”

Everyone was exclaiming in shock. As the commotion caused by the battle was too great, it had also attracted people from other forces. In fact, Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang had all been alerted. However, the three of them did not step out to stop the battle. They, too, wanted to know just how strong Feng Wuding, the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era, was.

“Did you think this was my limit?” Feng Wuding sneered. Weng, he launched another dimensional projection.

The third one!

Everyone inhaled sharply. Feng Wuding actually had a third dimension.

This time, even Lin Youlian and the others, as well as Bai Mifan who had rushed over later, revealed shocked expressions. They knew very well that even if a Seventh Tier elite lent a helping hand, that would only allow outstanding prodigies like them to possess a second dimension.

Three dimensions This was unprecedented, and perhaps it would never happen again.

“Hahahaha, Ling Han, how are you going to match that?” Feng Wuding laughed loudly. Wasn’t being suppressed by three dimensions impressive enough?

Everyone was rendered speechless. Feng Wuding was too impressive indeed; as expected of the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era.

“Hold on!” someone suddenly said. This was a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate of the World Alliance. His voice was actually a little shaky. “Don’t forget, when Ling Han and I were fighting, he has already used a dimensional projection once.”

Of course, dimensional projections could be used again and again, but the problem was that the dimensional projection previously had already been destroyed by them. If Ling Han wanted to condense it again, that was definitely not something that could be done in a short while.

...

Since Ling Han had already channeled two dimensional projections, then added with the previous one Hiss!

The Heavenly Venerates of the World Alliance were all stunned. Ling Han wasn’t the slightest bit inferior, and also possessed three dimensions.

If Feng Wuding was the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era, then was Ling Han the chosen one of the present Genesis World?

Ling Han smiled calmly as he channeled another dimensional projection.

Pu!

Bai Mifan instantly spluttered. He possessed two dimensions, and this was something that he had always been proud of. However, he had never seen Ling Han channel a dimensional projection before, and thought that Ling Han had walked the path of accommodating Power of Dimensions in his body. Now that Ling Han was stronger than him, he would definitely surpass him in the future.

It had never occurred to him that not only did Ling Han walk the same path as him, but he even had to look up to him.

Three dimensions!

The members of the World Alliance were even more stunned because they knew that this was actually the fourth dimensional projection that Ling Han was unleashing.

A monster, he was truly a monster.
