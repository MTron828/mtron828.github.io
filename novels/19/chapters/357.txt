Chapter 358: Everything Was A Lie

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Zi Xue Xian was currently engaged in a fierce battle with the three old men.

Ling Han was extremely shocked. Zi Xue Xian really deserved the name of a peerless genius. Though she was one person against three, she actually had the upper hand!

This would really make one grab their head and exclaim in utter shock. Someone in the Shattering Void Tier was actually capable of having the upper hand in a clash against three gods? But that was indeed the reality. Who asked this to be the mortal world, which would suppress the cultivation of gods? And if they were battling on the same level... the ability of a peerless genius to battle one stronger than herself could be displayed to the fullest.

However, gods were still gods after all. Even if their abilities were suppressed, they still had a bottomless pool of power at their fingertips. As long as they could drag out the battle long enough, then Zi Xue Xian would definitely be exhausted, and thus captured.

And the three old men did indeed do so. They merely continued to force Zi Xue Xian to endlessly expend her energy, neither too fast nor too slow.

Zi Xue Xian shouted repeatedly, and scoffed. The Thunder Battle Armor on her body released a white light that transformed into multiple dragons made of thunder that pounced in attack towards those three old men.

This was obviously a powerful move, and instantly made those three old men flustered. They only managed to destroy these thunder dragons after much effort. Zi Xue Xian took advantage of the opening and escaped the battle, though they caught up to her soon after and another fierce battle ensued.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. So it appeared that the Thunder Battle Armor was actually a Level Ten Spirit Tool. If not, how could it possibly become a threat to three gods? Their battle prowess had indeed been suppressed, but that was still battle prowess on the level of the Shattering Void Tier. Against an opponent of the Heaven Tier, they’d be able to kill him with a few blows.

All those years ago, Zi Xue Xian could only be ranked fourth among the seven of them in the Heaven Tier. Had she done that deliberately to conceal her skill, or did Sword Emperor and the others also possess a Tenth Tier Spirit Tool that could dominate her Thunder Battle Armor?

Ling Han sighed. At that time, he had his whole focus on alchemy, and did not consider their ranking in terms of martial arts seriously at all. He had only thought that as long as he could break through to the Shattering Void Tier, he’d be able to push open the doors to the realm of gods and simultaneously suppress Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, that “bandit”. He had no idea that there was such a huge gulf between himself and the rest of them.

Now, he was very clear that he possessed battle prowess of over a dozen Battle Stars and the instillation of power from the Black Tower could raise his battle prowess to the next Tier, and that kind of battle prowess was practically enough to defy logic. As a result, he did not have any such trump card of martial arts in his last life, but was still able to rank as the seventh strongest in the world and stand equal to Sword Emperor and the others. Now that he thought about it, he felt himself flush.

‘F***, a real man doesn’t boast about his past achievements. If I ever see Sword Emperor and the others again, I will definitely thrash them until their backsides burst. Who asked me to spend all my energy on alchemy in my last life? In terms of achievements in alchemy, even Sword Emperor, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and Na Lan Tu have to obediently address me as Grandmaster and beg me to concoct alchemical pills for them!’

Ling Han praised himself internally, then continued to watch the scene.

In truth, though the battle was fierce, it was only repeating endlessly by now. Zi Xue Xian could always turn the tables around in a dangerous situation by using the Thunder Battle Armor and force the three old men into a flustered chaos. She would then take advantage of the opening created and charge out of their siege, which made Ling Han feel a bit bored.

However, the events recorded in the Memory Crystal could only be “broadcast” according to the order in which they had happened, and there was no way to fast-forward, pause, slow-forward, or rewind. Thus, Ling Han could only watch quietly.

Yet, after quite a long time fighting, not only Ling Han was bored of watching the same scene repetitively, those three old men also appeared to have had enough.

“With the Thunder Battle Armor to protect her, if we continue to battle this way, we will not be able to subdue her!” the old man on the left side said.

“Indeed!” The old man on the right side agreed with a nod.

The old man in the center thought for a moment, then said, “Then I shall use a sliver of Divine Power and destroy this Thunder Battle Armor!”

“Then the regulations of this realm would immediately react and expel you, or even wound you severely,” the old man on the left side said, frowning.

“We can no longer take that into account. If we allow her to expose the secret and the people of this realm were able to prepare themselves, it may ruin the plans that the clan has worked on for 10,000 years! Furthemore, if the reason for the failure lies on our side, those other parties will definitely create trouble for us!” the old man in the center said.

“Fine then, you must be careful!” The old man on the left side nodded.

“It’s all right. I will control my power and use only enough to pierce through the Thunder Battle Armor, so the backlash that I will experience from the Power of Regulation would not be too severe!” The old man in the center wore a cold expression. A white electric light floated out of his white eyes, and all of a sudden, his aura spiked up madly.

It was only that one instant, and his power had completely surpassed the Shattering Void Tier!

God Tier!

This was the power of gods.

Ling Han sensed for the strength of this power, and in comparison, his power as one of the Heaven Tier in his last life was like a drop of water set against a great sea, not qualified to be compared against such power at all. Additionally, this kind of power had already far surpassed Asura Demon Emperor he had faced previously.

The other two old men simultaneously shot away, as if they would be implicated as well if they had stayed at their original positions.

They had reacted correctly.

A crack in the empty space appeared behind that old man without any prior signs, and immediately transformed into something like a gigantic mouth. It opened and closed abruptly, swallowing that old man into unknown depths.

Was that the expulsion from the power of the realm? It directly sent the old man out of this world!

Ling Han was delighted. The old man had yet to deliver his attack before being expelled by the power of the realm, so now that Zi Xue Xian had one powerful opponent less that she had to worry about, she should definitely have a chance at winning! Yet he had barely finished this thought when he saw that the very instant before that crack closed up, a white lightning spear was rapidly shot out of it.

This was different from the previous attacks. This lightning spear was at least a hundred times stronger than before, and what was more terrifying was that there were patterns weaving around on this lightning spear and the might exuding from it was enough to make even one at the Shattering Void Tier shiver in fear.

This was the most terrifying attack of a god. It was not power, but rather martial intent, a martial intent that would completely crush its opponent.

Ling Han’s expression took a swift turn. That old man had still managed to deliver his attack at the last instant right before he had been expelled by the power of the realm.

That was too terrifying!

Pu!

Zi Xue Xian was not given any opportunity to avoid nor parry. This spear directly pierced through her delicate body. So what if it was the Thunder Battle Armor she was wearing? A hole was still directly pierced through it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han finally understood. So that was how the hole on the Thunder Battle Armor was created.

“Ah!” Zi Xue Xian screamed. She had received this blow right on her heart and this spear directly pierced through her chest, so her heart must have exploded. Even if she was in the Shattering Void Tier, she probably wouldn’t live for much longer.

Ling Han could not help but tense. Could it be that Zi Xue Xian would fall here?

Xiu , yet Zi Xue Xian, on the other hand, ran like crazy, and as she removed the Thunder Battle Armor, she said, “Boundless Mountain, Clear Harmony Palace Hall has the answer to all. Person of the future, everything that you’ve been told about in the past were lies. The real answer lies there, and you must obtain it. Otherwise, the calamity will be repeated!”

With a toss, the Thunder Battle Armor flew out through the sky, and her figure became smaller and smaller below, and soon disappeared without a trace.

Obviously, the Memory Crystal was on the Thunder Battle Armor.

The Thunder Battle Armor traversed over an immeasurable distance and finally fell down upon the ground. Every pattern had lost its brilliance, and it was as if it had become a most ordinary battle armor. This condition of stillness persisted for about a few days. Then, the scene suddenly stopped, which was probably because there was a limit to the information that the Memory Crystal could record. It was full.

Ling Han’s divine sense automatically left the Memory Crystal and appeared back in the Black Tower. As the master of all in this place, he could very clearly judge that less than the time it takes to take a breath had passed.

Anything that happened in one’s divine sense had no effect on real time. It was as if it was a dream. One might have dreamt of living a whole lifetime, but when one awoke, only a few hours had passed.

Uncountable guesses appeared in Ling Han’s mind. He was also feeling a coldness that came from his very heart.
