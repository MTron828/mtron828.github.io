Chapter 1310 Gold Crushing Three Punches

“Haha, you said it yourself, so you’d better keep your promise!” Ling Han said with a hearty laugh.

“You can say that after you win!” the Stone Emperor said sternly. He activated several secret techniques, elevating his battle prowess by another level.

Ling Han was unfazed by this, and he directly unleashed heaven’s might.

Weng!

As heaven’s might swept outward, the Stone Emperor’s battle prowess instantly dropped by two stars!

This was absolutely terrifying. What kind of concept was having one’s battle prowess drop by two stars? This was equivalent to being weakened by 100 times!

Their battle prowess was already very close to begin with, yet one of them was now weakened by 100 times. Was this still a fair battle?

Ling Han threw a punch, and the Stone Emperor was instantly sent flying.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

The Stone Emperor crushed at least 100 gigantic trees before eventually coming to a stop. Right now, his body was hanging off of a gigantic tree.

Xiu!

His nine-meter-tall body immediately started to shrink. After a short while, he returned to his original size of three inches.

He shook his head vigorously, and only by doing this did he finally regain his senses. He couldn’t help but feel stunned. His opponent actually possessed a secret technique that could affect his battle prowess! This was incredibly astonishing!

Moreover, this secret technique hadn’t weakened him by 10% or 20%, but by a whopping two stars!

One had to realize that even the gulf between a supreme king tier and an ordinary king tier was less than one star!

Before Ling Han, even supreme king tiers wouldn’t have the right to call themselves king tiers. So, how could he possibly fight him?

“How powerful!” the Stone Emperor said solemnly. “Was that heaven’s might? It had to be, because even the might of True Dragons can’t affect members of the Rock Spirit lineage!”

His father was a Rock Spirit who had developed intelligence and eventually become a Saint, and thus he was on the same level as True Dragons. That being the case, even True Dragons wouldn’t be able to affect his battle prowess.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “That’s right, I unleashed heaven’s might! Little Stone, do you still want to continue? If not, then obediently hand me a vial of spiritual liquid!”

“Just heaven’s might alone won’t be enough!” The Stone Emperor shook his head before charging at Ling Han again. A misty light enveloped his body, and he said, “I’ve activated a secret technique of my tribe. For the next two hours, no immaterial secret technique will be able to penetrate my defenses! If I can’t defeat you during this time, then I’ll gladly admit defeat!”

This time, he didn’t enlarge his body anymore. Instead, he chose to remain at his original size of three inches tall. However, when he swung his fist, his power all converged to a single point, making it even more destructive and devastating than before.

Ling Han unleashed heaven’s might as he replied with a strike of his own. Sure enough, heaven’s might was no longer able to affect the Stone Emperor. It seemed as if he wasn’t lying. He was genuinely invulnerable to immaterial secret techniques for the next two hours.

“Heh, you want to defeat me within the next two hours?” Ling Han said with a loud laugh. This was a hilarious joke.

He unleashed his fists at the Stone Emperor.

A while ago, the Stone Emperor’s fists had been as large as the lid of a well, yet at this moment, they were only as small as a fingernail. Compared to Ling Han’s fists, they seemed completely insignificant. In fact, they seemed even more insignificant than an infant’s fists.

However, one would definitely receive a shocking surprise if they dared to underestimate these fists.

One would naturally be at their strongest when in their original form—this was true for all beings.

Now that he was in his original form, the Stone Emperor was undoubtedly more powerful than before. Not only that, but his power was also more concentrated and destructive.

Peng!

Their fists collided together, and the power of the Stone Emperor’s punch all erupted at a single point, generating a devastating force. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Crack!

A cracking sound traveled out from Ling Han’s body. His shoulder had actually been dislocated!

“Impressive!” Ling Han said as he casually popped his shoulder back into place. The force of the Stone Emperor’s strike had been terrifying. Although it hadn’t shattered his Godly bones, it had still affected him noticeably.

Meanwhile, the jaw of the Stone Emperor had already dropped in shock. He was in his original form, yet his strike had only managed to dislocate Ling Han’s shoulder?

‘Holy, bloody f*ck! Which of us is the Rock Spirit here?!’

“Human, you’ve proven yourself worthy enough for me to unleash the Gold Crushing Three Punches!” the Stone Emperor said solemnly.

“Is it very powerful?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Among the spirits of the five elements, the gold element specializes in offense, while the stone element specializes in defense. My father was unwilling to resign himself to this fact, and thus he invented the Gold Crushing Three Punches. He believes that the offensive power of Rock Spirits can even surpass that of Gold Spirits,” the Stone Emperor said.

He started to channel the might of the fist technique. Although he was only three inches tall, the aura that exuded from him was tremendous and astonishing.

Rumble...

The land around his body started to sink layer by layer. It was as if an invisible hand were forcing it down.

He was merely channeling the might of his fist technique, yet it was already displaying such devastation. If one were struck by his fists head-on, just how utterly devastating would the destruction be?

“Do you dare to face my fists?” the Stone Emperor asked. His voice was brimming with pride.

This was a fist technique that had been invented by a Saint. If it weren’t for the fact that he also possessed the bloodline of Rock Spirits, there would be simply no way that he could have mastered this technique. However, it was also because of this fact that this fist technique was so tremendously powerful.

“Why would I not dare?” Ling Han was also brimming with confidence.

When battling against someone at the same cultivation level, who could breach his freakish physique? Even if someone could, they would only be able to do some minor damage. He could easily heal such damage by channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

“Human, even if you lose this battle, you would have still won the right to become my friend,” the Stone Emperor said with a chuckle. He appreciated people who dared to fight head-on against him.

“Wonderful!” Ling Han said with a nod. He also appreciated the Stone Emperor’s frank and forthright personality.

“First punch!” The Stone Emperor dashed over before leaping high into the air. However, because of his small stature, his “high leap” only brought him to the level of Ling Han’s face. He then unleashed a punch.

Ling Han also threw a punch.

Peng!

A formidable power instantly erupted from the Stone Emperor’s small body, sending Lin Han flying backward.

Peng!

Ling Han flew through the air for dozens of meters before finally crashing to the ground. The webbing between his hands’ fingers was cracked and bloody.

‘As expected of a technique invented by a Saint. Impressive!’

Ling Han smiled faintly. This punch had finally managed to crack his defenses. However, this was about all it could do. It was still unable to damage his Godly bones. After all, the toughness of his Godly bones was on par with Level Five Godly metal. Which Mountain River Tier cultivator could shatter such tough Godly bones?

Even power at the peak stage of the pinnacle level wouldn’t be able to shatter his Goldy bones. If one used violent flames to refine him, perhaps they could incinerate him after several days and nights.

“Second punch!” the Stone Emperor roared. His right fist swung over again. Strangely, however, his fist expanded dozens of times in size, while his body remained completely unchanged.

Peng!

Ling Han was sent flying once again. This time, however, he performed a graceful tumble in the air and landed firmly on the ground.

He shook his hand, and said, “This technique is indeed quite powerful. Even my hands are starting to hurt a little.”

The Stone Emperor roared as he threw another punch. This time, his fist transformed into a mountain. It was raised high above his head, and it was as if it could shatter even the sky. Bringing with it this domineering might, the fist ruthlessly smashed down at Ling Han.

Even the North Emperor and Chi Huangji’s battle was affected by the shock waves of this devastating strike. Faceless and the others all shot back in retreat.

The power of this strike had reached the peak stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier!

This was absolutely astounding. One had to realize that those at the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier could only compete against those at the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Yet, the Stone Emperor’s battle prowess had elevated three stars above this limit!

This was an extreme elevation and a tremendously brilliant strike. Even with his powerful bloodline, the Stone Emperor could only unleash such a devastating strike once.

Boom!

It was as if the fist yearned to pierce through the heavens as it bore down on Ling Han with a vast and profound might.
