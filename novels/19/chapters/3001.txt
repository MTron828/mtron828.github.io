3002 Persistence

Feng Wuding looked arrogantly at Ling Han. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After more than 500 billion years, he still hadn’t advanced to the Sixth Tier yet. However, he had already reached the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, and added with the fact that all 100 dimensions had been upgraded to the lower tier high-level dimensions, it was at least equivalent to 1,000 Fifth Tiers working together to inject power into him, allowing his power to reach the late stage of the Seventh Tier.

Now, his strength was already equal to that of Lin Youlian and the others, but he had more room for improvement. As long as he advanced to the Sixth Tier, then to say nothing of Lin Youlin and the others, he would be able to match even veteran Seventh Tiers such as Shatter Mountains and the others, or even to suppress them.

So what if Ling Han hadn’t died? They were both Fifth Tiers, and Feng Wuding believed that his strength had increased extremely quickly, so he was already unafraid.

“You are unconvinced?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

He did not have a good impression of Feng Wuding. It was only because of Zhou Heng and the others that he had repeatedly held back when he had had the chance. However, he had obtained the inheritance of the World’s Will from the Genesis World of the last era, and knew that Feng Wuding was not the Son of Destiny at all, so what was the point of holding back?

He would kill him. F***, just the look of him was annoying.

Feng Wuding sneered. “Just because you have the battle prowess of Seventh Tier, you think you can do as you please? Let me tell you, you are wrong, overwhelmingly wrong!”

Ling Han cracked a smile. “Today, I am determined to use my superior strength to kill you as well. What can you do about it?”

“How dare you!!” Feng Wuding roared. Xiu! His figure soared into the air, and he shouted, “Ling Han, come up for a battle!”

Ling Han ignored him. Instead, he stared at Sealed Emotion, his eyes cold, as if he was looking at a dead man.

“Ling Han!” Feng Wuding shouted loudly. He felt that he had been ignored, which caused him to feel a strong sense of shame and anger.

To Feng Wuding, Ling Han was too much of a bully. The former was the Son of Destiny, the ultimate elite that possessed the might of Seventh Tier!

Ling Han moved, and grabbed out at Sealed Emotion.

“How dare you!!” Feng Wuding also moved, delivering a palm strike at Ling Han.

Boom, the two forces clashed, and the houses in the vicinity instantly collapsed one after another, and the city walls of the surrounding 1500 km crumbled at the same time.

Peng, peng, peng! Countless Heavenly Venerates were sent flying as if they were scarecrows.

The entire encampment had become like a carpet, trembling in waves.

Ling Han’s attack had been blocked, but Feng Wuding’s expression was still filled with a murderous aura. Ling Han actually dared not to give him face, and made a move on his subordinate right in front of him?

Everyone retreated far away. The shock wave just now had caused a considerable number of people to be severely injured, so who would dare to approach blindly?

Sealed Emotion also wanted to dodge, but that attack from Ling Han had been aimed at him. Even if it had been neutralized, he had still sustained more force. He was already severely injured, so how could he still move his body?

He could only place his hopes on Feng Wuding’s ability to block Ling Han’s attack. Otherwise, he would definitely be killed.

He casually sent out another palm strike, and it was still aimed at Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

Boom! Fundamental power condensed, turning into a colossal hand that pressed down on Sealed Emotion.

“Ling Han, you have gone too far!!” Feng Wuding roared in fury. It was not because Ling Han was determined to kill Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. In Feng Wuding’s eyes, Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was not that important that he would be angered by his death. Instead, it was because Ling Han had ignored him. This kind of feeling was the true root of his fury.

Xiu, Feng Wuding charged downwards. As he continued to dispel Ling Han’s attacks, he continued to attack Ling Han so that he would not have the time to make another move.

Peng, the two great forces clashed once more, and then both were annihilated. However, the aftermath of the attack reverberated, causing another large portion of the city wall to collapse, turning into ruins.

Pu!

Sealed Emotion threw up blood like mad. Even if Ling Han’s attacks had not hit him, under the impact of the aftermath, he was still barely able to withstand it.

He looked at Ling Han in shock. This definitely had to be deliberate on Ling Han’s side.

Looking around him, was there anyone else besides him?

Was this guy trying to make him walk towards death in despair?

His heart was filled with resentment. He actually had had a great many chances to kill Ling Han. When he had been in the Celestial Realm, that was needless to say. Even after he had gone to the Flaming Frost Realm, he still had had a great many chances. However, because he had been wary of Zhou Heng and the others, he had not made a move. Afterwards, it had also been because of the news that Ling Han had been “crippled” that he had not taken Ling Han seriously at all.

A moment’s mistake would lead to eternal regret.

Feng Wuding finally arrived. He brandished his fists furiously, blasting towards Ling Han.

Ling Han casually exchanged blows with him. At the same time, he could also attack Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, forcing Feng Wuding to continuously dispel his attacks.

Feng Wuding was clearly the one on the offensive, but he was completely flustered, appearing to be in a very sorry state.

This kind of fierce battle naturally attracted everyone’s attention. Seeing Feng Wuding in such a state, everyone could only stare dumbfounded. Could it be that it was definite that Ling Han’s strength would overwhelm Feng Wuding’s? Otherwise, how could Feng Wuding be in such a sorry state?

Those people from the Feng Alliance were all rendered speechless, and looked towards Sealed Emotion.

Now, he had instead become the key to the battle between Ling Han and Feng Wuding. One wanted to kill him, and the other wanted to protect him. Whoever was stronger would be decided by whether Sealed Emotion was dead or alive.

Regarding this, Sealed Emotion naturally wanted nothing more than to curse.

Why were they treating him like a punching bag?

Even if Feng Wuding had dispersed every attack from Ling Han, Sealed Emotion was still heavily injured under the shock waves of the aftermath. He would probably be dead in about 100 moves at most.

How wronged would his death then be? In a battle between two great elites, he was sandwiched in the middle, and became cannon fodder. Even if he died, he would be an eternal joke.

Sealed Emotion tried his best to leave this eye of the storm, but he had just mustered his remaining power when a shock wave swept over. Peng, the shock wave caused his whole body to tremble, and he spluttered out a mouthful of blood. His vision became completely black, and he almost passed out.

“Ling Han, fight me if you can. What’s the point of using such means?” Feng Wuding roared in fury. He thought that if he went all out in battle, he would definitely not lose to Ling Han.

Ling Han had purposefully used Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable to impede him, preventing him from unleashing his full might in his attacks.

Feng Wuding had once thought of giving up Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and focusing all his power on attack, but if he gave up on his own subordinate in full public, who would still follow him in the future?

Hence, he could only try his best to protect Sealed Emotion, though from the look of things, Sealed Emotion was definitely done for.

Ling Han ignored him. He didn’t care about the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. Similarly, he didn’t care about Feng Wuding, either. He only cared about resolving his matters in the order of priority, and placed Feng Wuding as second place on his list of priorities.

After battling for a few more rounds, Sealed Emotion was already in a tragic state. His limbs had already been forcefully destroyed by the terrifying power.

Ling Han did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy. Previously, how many people of the Celestial Realm had been killed because of the selfish desires of Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, Jiuwu Heavenly Venerable, and Green Flames Heavenly Venerable?

Sympathy?

Was Sealed Emotion worth it? Did he deserve it?”

“Brother Ling, enough is enough.” A gentle voice rang out. Lin Youlian appeared, advising Ling Han.

Xiu, xiu! Xin Qihu, Wu Haoyang, and Bai Mifan also appeared in quick succession.

Four people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess!

Yet Ling Han only acted as if he had not heard anything. Today, no one could stop him from killing Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Feng Wuding. There was no one, definitely no one!
