Chapter 3458: Ice Dragon Lake

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Let’s go!” someone called out. His figure leaped out, and stepped on the frozen surface of the lake. In a few moments, he had already arrived at the centre of the lake, and jumped in through the opening of the whirlpool.

Behind him, a great many people also rapidly followed, leaping into the ice cave one after another.

Ah—” Someone released a terrible scream, the echoes endless.

This was probably because he had jumped at the wrong angle. He did not slide on the ice, but rather fell directly towards the bottom of the lake.

Hearing this terrible scream continue, it could be deduced that the bottom of the lake was really deep.

Ling Han didn’t act rashly. Before understanding the situation, he wouldn’t act rashly.

In a short while, the number of people charging forward decreased, but there was still a small number of people running. However, right at this moment, the frozen surface of the lake suddenly recovered, and became tumultuous waves. Peng, a large wave swept past, and the few people that were running madly were instantly smacked into the water. The undercurrent surged, and no matter how hard they struggled, it was useless. Like heavy lead, they plummeted, and very soon, they could no longer be seen.

No wonder no one had dived to the bottom of the lake previously. It must be that the buoyancy of this lake water was too low.

“Is it heavy water or have they drowned?” Eldest Baby asked Second Baby. Second Baby looked at it for a while, then said, “Neither. This is formed from a bit of saliva from the Ice Dragon fused with a large amount of ordinary water, so it has the effect of heavy water, and can also freeze itself.”

Oh!” The children all nodded, seeming to understand.

Ling Han didn’t understand, and said, “Be more specific.”

“A mature Ice Dragon is an existence above Celestial Path. Its saliva has two characteristics. The first is that nothing can float, and the second is that it is incredibly cold,” Second Baby said. “So, Father, you have seen the effects just now.”

“Just a little bit?” Ling Han asked.

“En.” Eldest Baby nodded, “Otherwise, there would be no need to come into contact with water at all. From afar, it would be able to freeze even Mystery Realm Tiers to death.”

“But those people clearly didn’t freeze to death just now. They were just immersed in it,” Ling Han said in confusion.

“This is something that has been fused with a large amount of ordinary water, and changed under the formation, so the two characteristics have become separated,” Second Baby explained.

Lmg Han finally understood. Under normal circumstances, it would be easy to drown, and there was nothing that could not sink. And at a certain point in time, another characteristic would take effect, freezing the liquid, and from there, a path that led to the bottom of the lake would be revealed.

As for why there was a whirlpool, that must be the effect of the formation. Ling Han circled around in the surroundings, but this was a dangerous place There was no way to leave around the lake, and eveything was enshrouded in a grayish fog. Furthermore, Ling Han only had to walk into the fog, and no matter how he circled around, he would always walk back to the lakeside after a few steps.

Even if Second Baby activated her Eye Technique, it was useless. She couldn’t walk out at all.

In other words, they had to leave through the ice cave in the center of the lake. Ling Han waited patiently, but the lake water did not freeze even after a long time.

He decided to find someone to ask.

“Friend, do you know the rhythm of the lake being frozen?” he asked a young man with a smile.

This young man’s face was filled with pride, and he glared at Ling Han, completely having no intention of replying.

“Shameless b@stard, Father is asking you a question!” Eldest Baby made a gesture of rolling up her sleeves, as if she was going to make a move next.

“You dare to ignore my father? Are you tired of living?!”

“So detestable!” Fourth Baby and Fifth Baby also said childishly.

Lmg Han smiled, and picked up the three babies. Though he was slightly displeased with the other’s attitude, they were complete strangers, so the other was indeed not obligated to answer.

“Apologies, they are just kids, and a child’s words carry no harm,” Ling Han said.

Just because they’re young, they can spout nonsense?” Unexpectedly, this person was actually unwilling to give up the matter.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled in a frown. They were just a few kids, and a child’s words carried no harm. What was there to argue about? Moreover, he, the adult, had already stepped out to apologize, so what else do you want?

“Hit him!” Eldest Baby’s maniacal violent trait had already flared up, and was the first to charge out.

With her move, the remaining children were also in high spirits, and charged out with her.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! After a series of chaotic blows, that young man was already lying on the ground. Thankfully, the seven toddlers had not killed him. Otherwise, he would definitely be a corpse.

However, the children were all in high spirits, and began to draw on the young man’s face. You draw a turtle, and I draw a bird. Occasionally, they would let out laughter, and all of them had their bottoms raised, playing very happily.

Ling Han did not stop them either. Who asked this young man to have been too arrogant previously?

He walked towards another person, and asked with a smile, “Brother, is there a rhythm to the freezing of the lake waters?”

“Yes, yes!” That person hurriedly nodded, a strong wariness still on his face. After all, the lesson from before was right in front of him, so how could he not feel guilty? “Every other day, around noon, the lake would freeze over, and it would not last for only a minute.”

“Thanks.” Ling Han nodded.

He waited patiently, and the Calabash Brothers had also gotten tired of playing around. They all left that unlucky guy behind and returned. All of them said that they were exhausted, and needed some food to nourish themselves.

A day passed, and Ling Han’s expression became solemn. The surface of the lake was about to freeze over again.

He told the kids to get ready, and charge with him later.

At present, the surface of the lake was completely calm, shining brightly, so peaceful that no one could imagine the killing intent that lay within.

However, after only an instant, a ripple suddenly appeared in the center of the lake, which then turned into a whirlpool that rapidly enlarged, its diameter about nine meters.

The cold air assaulted, and the surface of the lake was instantly frozen.

Let’s go!” Lmg Han immediately leaped out, his left arm holding Eldest, Second, and Fourth Baby, while his right arm was holding Fifth Baby, Sixth Baby, Seventh Baby. Third Baby, as usual, hung from his neck, and Floating Wind and Clouds unfolded. All of a sudden, he had soared to four times the speed of sound.

He brought with him a powerful gust of wind, and in a mere instant, he had arrived at the centre of the lake. Then, he leaped down.

Vaguely, he could see another person walking out of the tree hollow. He was clearly very far away, and it was only a short while, yet he could feel overwhelming killing intent, causing even his skin to faintly ache.

At this time, his figure had already descended into the ice cave. Leaning against the ice wall, he rapidly slid downwards.

The bottom of the lake was really very deep. He slid for at least twenty seconds before he reached the bottom, and another passage actually appeared ahead of him.

He couldn’t help but think that if the lake water suddenly unsealed at this time, then wouldn’t he freeze to death below? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Shua, shua, shua! A few more people slid down.

The moment everyone stood still, they all looked alert.

Everyone here was a competitor, and only one person could represent the Fifth Peak to contest for the position of Young Dragon.

A minute quickly passed, and the frozen lake water immediately thawed, but in this area, there seemed to be an invisible force holding up the lake water. The lake water could clearly be seen flowing slowly, but not a single drop fell.

One person quietly took a few steps, then broke into a run, running madly along the tunnel at the bottom of the lake.

The others followed suit, and in an instant, Ling Han was the only one left..
