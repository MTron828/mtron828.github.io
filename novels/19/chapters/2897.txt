2898 Four first-grade seals

“Ling Han, your true power is ultimately inferior to mine,” Xin Qihu said coldly. “This is the difference in pure strength, and not something that the Heavenly Venerable Seals can make up for.”

“Is that so?” Ling Han shook his head. “Since that’s the case, why would you covet the Heavenly Venerable Seals that I possess?”

“Haha, killing you is my priority. The Heavenly Venerable Seals are just a reward.” Xin Qihu laughed loudly. He then channeled an eighth-grade seal, and once again suppressed Ling Han.

Ling Han humphed, and a fifth-grade seal lit up.

!!

Thus, Xin Qihu switched to a seventh-grade seal.

Ling Han next used a fourth-grade seal, while Xin Qihu used a sixth-grade seal. He was always able to suppress Ling Han.

“Don’t you have a first-grade seal? Let me see it,” Xin Qihu said nonchalantly. He was extremely proud and appeared incomparably confident.

“As you wish!” Ling Han finally channeled that first-grade seal. Hong, his power instantly went off the charts, and the ground around him collapsed endlessly. This was a shattered dimension, and it had long since died. Without the slightest bit of suppression, how could it withstand the rampage of Fifth Tier?

If the two of them fought for a while longer, the entire dimension might be destroyed.

However, Ling Han couldn’t care less now. His fighting spirit had been completely ignited, and he only wished for a grand battle.

“As expected!” Xin Qihu nodded. His hands suddenly clenched into fists. Boom, his right fist shone. A blurry seal moved and emitted an incomparably astonishing aura.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a punch, and were sent flying at the same time.

They were actually… evenly matched!

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. His true power was 30 times weaker than Xin Qihu’s. Now, he had channeled a first-grade seal, yet he was only able to tie with Xin Qihu. This meant that… Xin Qihu was using a fourth-grade seal.

Where did it come from?

Was it something that he had comprehended on his own, or had it come from his old man who was a Seventh Tier?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them clashed fiercely with terrifying power. This dimension was already incomparably dilapidated to begin with. Now that the two of them were wreaking havoc, it was naturally even more dilapidated.

Pieces of the ground caved in. Some returned to become Primal Chaos, while other spots spewed out terrifying storms that soared into the skies like giant pillars.

The commotion was so great that it attracted everyone from afar to witness the battle between the strongest prodigies.

“Isn’t that Xin Qihu?”

“His opponent… Heavens, he’s actually a Third Tier!”

“With the advantage of a whole cultivation level, Xin Qihu was actually unable to suppress his opponent?”

“He’s always been the one to defeat his opponent with a disadvantage in cultivation level. Why is it the other way around now?”

“This person is… Ling Han!”

“Legend has it that he has a first-grade seal?”

“That’s right. What he’s channeling now is definitely that; even though I’m a Fourth Tier, I still feel uncomfortable from being suppressed.”

The numerous Heavenly Venerates were all astonished. Ling Han was heaven-defying. Even the greatest prodigy of all eternity could not surpass him, and that was despite an advantage in cultivation level. Without a doubt, Ling Han was going to ascend to the throne of number one of all history.

Some people were elated as defending against Hysteria required an absolute prodigy like this, while others had cold smiles on their faces, coveting the Heavenly Venerable Seals in Ling Han’s possession, and even more so keen on obtaining the secret to Ling Han’s power.

Ling Han, on the other hand, had forgotten everything. He only wanted to have a big battle and display all of his abilities.

“Not bad, not bad. You are very, very strong!” Xin Qihu said with a smile. “However, if your strength is only at this level, you will only die in the end!”

Weng, he switched to another Heavenly Venerable Seal, but not only did his battle prowess not fall, it actually rose to another level.

A third-grade seal!

Ling Han was instantly suppressed. This was a difference of more than 10 times in power, and he was outmatched.

This naturally caused everyone to exclaim in surprise. It turned out that Xin Qihu had actually hidden his strength. He actually still had a third-grade seal that he had yet to use.

This time, Ling Han should be at his wit’s end. He had already used a first-grade seal. Could there be a Heavenly Venerable Seal more impressive and awesome than this?

Ling Han struggled to hold on. Although he was at a disadvantage in terms of power, the difference of more than 10 times in power could only suppress him, and it was still unable to truly defeat him.

With his tenacious personality, how could he give up so easily?

“Your toughness is commendable. However, in the end, you are only a Third Tier!” Xin Qihu sneered. He channeled another Heavenly Venerable Seal. This time, an aura that transcended the ages circulated, making him seem as if he had transformed into a god of war.

Peng, it was only a single punch, but Ling Han was sent flying. He was actually no match for a single blow.

First-grade seal!

Ling Han wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.

He absolutely did not believe that Xin Qihu could form a first-grade seal on his own. It should have been given to him by Xin Fu. It was not strange for a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate to be able to master a first-grade seal. More importantly, it was a matter of how many such Heavenly Venerable Seals they had mastered.

Xin Qihu did not take advantage of the victory to continue his attack. He only placed his hands behind his back. “How is it?”

“So-so!” Ling Han’s fighting spirit was already completely boiling. Hong, his aura once again skyrocketed, and all ninth-grade seals lit up, forming a set of combination seals. In an instant, his battle prowess increased explosively by more than 200 times.

He let out a long howl and charged toward Xin Qihu.

“You’re not the only one with combination seals!” Xin Qihu sneered. Three more seals flashed behind him, and his battle prowess also began to increase rapidly.

Peng!

He exchanged a blow with Ling Han, and was actually not at a disadvantage at all.

‘What?!’

This time, Ling Han was truly shocked. He had not expected that Xin Qihu would actually be able to oppose him with only four seals.

These were also combination seals, but just four of them were enough to contend against him.

…These four were all first-grade seals. Furthermore, they were adjacent to each other, so they could resonate with each other and unleash an amplification of 200 times. They weren’t inferior to the complete combination of the ninth-grade seals at all.

...

Four first-grade seals.

Was this the potential of a Seventh Tier?

A sense of helplessness rose in Ling Han’s heart, but he immediately steeled his resolve. Don’t forget that he was still one cultivation level lower than Xin Qihu. If the two of them were to truly fight at the same cultivation level, no matter how many first grade-seals Xin Qihu used, Ling Han would be able to suppress them with his might.

“Ling Han, what do you think?” Xin Qihu said calmly with a faint smile. He had the initiative and was in control of the battle. Naturally, he was like a cat playing with a mouse.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Nothing much. Wait until I advance into the Fourth Tier, then I’ll come and cut off your wretched head.”

“Humph, will you still have such a day?” Xin Qihu approached closely.

“I’m not playing with you anymore.” Ling Han directly flew into the Void. To him, this was like an ocean, allowing him to soar freely.

Xin Qihu did not give chase. Other than a freak like Ling Han, anyone without the guidance of a dimensional lighthouse would be like a headless fly, and would only lose their sense of direction.

The Void had always been a domain belonging to Hysteria, and no one dared to rashly set foot in it. Even if he had Fifth-Tier battle prowess, he still wouldn’t dare to act recklessly. Unless he was in the Sixth Tier, he wouldn’t be able to match it—and this was only because Hysteria’s main body was restricted by several Seventh Tiers. Otherwise, even Sixth Tiers would be in trouble.

He stood in his tracks as a strange smile appeared on his face. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
