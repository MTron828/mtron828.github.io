Chapter 2229: Beat you to your heart’s content

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Shen Chao could no longer endure.

Originally, he had already been close to the end of his line. Previously, though he had been able to counter aggressively, that had only been short-lived.

…The Regulations in his body were already exhausted completely, and his battle prowess had fallen down to rock bottom.

Now, to say nothing that it was Ling Han, any random Severing Mundane Tier would have been able to suppress Shen Chao easily.

Peng!

Ling Han’s fist slammed into Shen Chao’s face, instantly causing a nosebleed.

However, Ling Han had obviously controlled his force. Otherwise, it would not have been a matter of a little bloodshed with this punch, but rather his whole head would have exploded—he was not Ling Han, who had a tough physique

“Aren’t you very arrogant?” Ling Han slammed another punch over. “Go on then, continue being arrogant!”

He would follow each word with a punch, and Shen Chao’s whole face was immediately bruised and battered all over, quickly swelling to the size of a pig’s head.

“Did I trifle with you?

“No!

“Yet you are so determined to come and trifle with me, f***, are you wretched?

“I have always had one way of dealing with wretches, and that is to beat them up!”

His punches did not end, and the sounds of cracking bones were soon heard from Shen Chao’s body as Ling Han had broken his bones, or even smashed them to bits.

“Ah…” Shen Chao could only moan in agony. Who made it a rule that a monarch tier could not cry in pain when he was being beaten?

The natives were all furious, and summoned their respective weapons, aimed straight at Ling Han.

“Let him go!” they demanded coldly. However, even the strongest elite among them was only a Fourth Secret emperor tier. After all, how could there be so many monarch tiers? Even in this militaristic battlefield, there could not possibly be so many.

One of Ling Han’s hands gripped the front of Shen Chao’s robes as he surveyed the masses. The blood on his face had not been wiped off, and as his cold eyes swept over them, everyone felt a chill rise up from the depths of their heart, and they actually stepped back continuously.

This drove the natives into a rage due to humiliation. They dared to rush up and fight any of the Foreign Race they saw. Since childhood, they had seen many assaults on the city that the Foreign Race launched. When was it that no masses of dead people fell from Clear Heaven Pass, as if it was a shower of rain?

Even this did not make them feel afraid, yet they had stepped back with just a glance from Ling Han. How could they bear with that?

“Let’s go!” They stepped forwards again, and charged onwards, unleashing a united offensive against Ling Han.

Ling Han smirked coldly. Using Shen Chao as a weapon, he flung him around in a mad sweep towards them.

Everyone refrained from attacking, fearing that harm would come to Shen Chao. They did not dare to attack too strongly at all.

“You are too shameless!”

“You’re not a man!”

The natives were all shouting, all of them stomping in fury, and also trying to spur Ling Han on so that he could release Shen Chao and battle them himself.

How could Ling Han possibly pay them any regard? He merely waved Shen Chao around to attack them, and his battle prowess was indeed far surpassing all the others. Aside from that Fourth Secret emperor tier, who else could withstand a few blows from him?

Peng, peng, peng,?figures danced in the skies one after another. They had been kicked or sent flying out by Ling Han, all sprawling out on the ground.

Finally, only that Fourth Secret emperor tier was left, and Ling Han used the Regulations of Time to bind him. The flow of time had slowed down over 10,000 times, so he could only watch helplessly as Ling Han slammed Shen Chao into him.?Pa, the two of them were instantly battered, and tangled up together.

Mei Hua, Lu Zhen, and the other disciples of the academy were all looking at Ling Han with incredible admiration. This was too amazing, and they were completely astounded.

He was just a First Secret, yet could even defeat a Fifth Secret monarch tier. His strength was indescribable.

They also could not understand why Ling Han’s power seemed to be endless. He could not be replenished with Regulations here. Even a Fifth Secret monarch tier had been defeated. Then, was there anyone that could be Ling Han’s match in this heaven and earth?

Half a day later, everyone finally regained consciousness one after another, moaning endlessly as they lay on the ground.

Shen Chao had also awakened. He did not make any sound, and would occasionally glance at Ling Han when he wasn’t paying attention, his expression filled with puzzlement.

In terms of true battle prowess, he was definitely superior to Ling Han, but the power of Regulation that Ling Han could use was endless, and he actually managed to exhaust him to defeat. Of course, if it were not for the fact that Ling Han had an amazing movement technique, and was skilled in the Regulations of Time, and also had an astonishing recovery ability, he would not have been able to last so long either.

But all these factors added together turned Ling Han into a miracle, a First Secret who had defeated him, who was a Fifth Secret.

Monarch Stars were indeed very impressive, but if he was only a First Secret, he could match a Third Secret monarch tier at most. He definitely could not match a Fifth Secret monarch star. This young man was practically a freak.

Ling Han coughed, and said, “Since everyone is conscious now, let’s go back.”

Everyone remained silent. They had been defeated even when they had an overwhelming advantage in numbers and strength. These natives had all become cocks that had lost a fight, losing all of their arrogance completely.

Meanwhile, Lu Zhen and the others were all incredibly excited. Since they entered the 17th camp, the natives had treated them with extreme contempt, and they had even suffered some losses. Now that Ling Han had shown his might here, the natives had lost all their temper, which had naturally vented some of their frustrations.

Ling Han led the way, and they set out, heading towards Clear Heaven Pass.

A long while later, they had finally walked out of the neutral zone. At this time, Nie Heshan and the other 19 teams had long since been waiting here.

Seeing everyone looking crestfallen, as if they had suffered some serious blow, the others asked them what had happened, and thought that they had encountered an attack from some super powerful monster.

“Han Lin, I will smash you into pulp!” Shen Chao’s body shook, and the light of Regulations returned. He had recovered his strength.

This place was already the territory of the Celestial Realm, and he could again channel the power of Regulation, so he had completely recovered to his prime condition.

Ling Han ignored him completely, and directly walked towards Nie Heshan.

“You are courting death!” Shen Chao roared furiously, and set off in hot pursuit of Ling Han, sending out a punch.

Weng!

His movements suddenly stopped, as if an invisible power had completely taken control of his body.

Nie Heshan showed a hint of displeasure in his expression, and he demanded, “As the team leader and a Fifth Secret monarch tier, you think you can bully your teammates?”

It was he that had moved to subdue Shen Chao. It was naturally completely effortless since it was an Ascending Origin Tier elite that had moved.

Shen Chao’s expression was completely defiant. Thus, he was also glaring angrily at Nie Heshan.

He was a Fifth Secret monarch tier, and once he advanced into Ascending Origin Tier, his battle prowess would not be inferior to Nie Heshan’s. Thus, he did not hold much respect for Nie Heshan. Not too long after, he would be able to advance into this level as well, and become his equal, or even emerge completely superior over the other.

“Step down!” Nie Heshan humphed lightly, his one eye exuding a boundless chill.

Shen Chao’s face paled, and he involuntarily stepped backwards.

There was a wide gulf between the Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier. Without forming 11 Mystery Realms, how could he possibly be the man’s match?

Meanwhile, Ling Han said, “Lord Nie, I discovered a strange place within the valley.”

He related the situation that he had experienced, including that eye that had vanished in a flash.

Hearing him say these words, a considerable number of people scoffed mockingly. What a joke, how could there be an Ascending Origin Tier existence in the neutral zone? It should be known that even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not possibly enter within, as they would be crushed forcefully by the majestic power of heaven and earth.

Could Ascending Origin Tier compare with Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier?

Thus, after Nie Heshan heard this, he merely nodded carelessly, and said, “I will make further investigations.” Yet, he had absolutely no intentions of pursuing the matter. It was clear from his expression. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Waving a hand, he commanded that they were to return.

Ling Han was going to speak further, yet Nie Heshan had absolutely no intention of paying him any regard, so he could only dismiss that thought.

After returning to the campsite, Ling Han began to study the celestial medicine he had obtained and that creature..
