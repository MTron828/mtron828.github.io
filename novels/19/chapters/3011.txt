3012 Favor

An expression of scorn immediately spread across the woman in azure’s face when she heard this, and she said, “Brat, who do you think you are? You were saved by Young Mistress, yet you’re actually saying that you can resolve a problem for her? What a shameless boast!”

Ling Han simply replied with a faint smile. He didn’t try to defend himself, nor did he demonstrate his earth-shattering power.

After reaching his level, he would leave many things up to fate.

If the woman in white believed him, he would naturally step forward to help her. If she didn’t believe him, however, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t interfere.

The woman in white also felt like Ling Han was slightly dodgy, so after parking the boat on the shore, she said, “You’re on your own now.”

She retrieved her boat and left with the woman in azure. After taking a few steps, the maidservant even turned around to stick her tongue out at Ling Han.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t pay any heed to this. He slowly wandered around and appreciated the mountains and waters.

There was a question in his mind. Since dimensions were sentient, why couldn’t they act as they pleased?

What power was restricting them?

Ling Han observed the mountains and waters, hoping to draw inspiration and enlightenment from them.

Regardless of how big the world was, it was ultimately made up of countless mountains and waters.

Examining the small to understand the big. It was possible to discover the truth of the world by examining these small details.

Ling Han continued to wander around the territory of the Azure Sky Sect. He was naturally seen by many people, and he was naturally a new face to all of them as well. However, because of his calm and composed expression, everyone thought that he was a new disciple of one of the elders, and it was because of this that they didn’t recognize him. Surprisingly, not a single person thought of him as an intruder.

Elsewhere, the woman in white had already returned to her room. Shortly after, a servant walked over.

“Young Mistress, the lord is calling for you,” the servant said.

The woman in white nodded and followed after the servant. It wasn’t long before they arrived in a large hall.

She curtsied, and said, “Greetings, Father.”

“You may rise.”

The woman in white stood up and scanned the surroundings, only to see two other people in addition to her father, Ning Daolan. One of them looked to be in his forties, and was a sturdily built man. However, the age of an elite couldn’t be estimated by their appearance, so it wouldn’t be surprising even if he were hundreds of millions of years older than Ning Daolan.

The other person was a young man who appeared extremely handsome. However, his eyes appeared slightly sinister, and she immediately developed a bad impression of him.

Ning Daolan pointed at the burly middle-aged man, and said, “Haixin, this is Han Zhan, Senior Han.”

Ning Haixin, the woman in white, curtsied at the middle-aged man, and said, “Greeting, Senior Han.”

Han Zhang laughed heartily, and remarked, “Heh, I’ve always heard that your daughter was a beautiful woman. Sure enough, this is the case!”

Ning Haixin was slightly displeased upon hearing this. Even though this was praise, it was also something that made her feel extremely uncomfortable.

It could only be said that Han Zhang was a crude person.

Ning Daolan pointed at the young man, and introduced, “And this is Lu Yang, Brother Lu. Brother Lu is the fourth son of Celestial King An Teng, and he’s an extremely talented prodigy who might become even stronger than Lord An Teng in the future.”

Ning Haixin curtsied at Lu Yang, and said, “Greetings, Brother Lu!”

“Please rise, virtuous sister,” Lu Yang said. A glimmer flashed in his eyes, and he hurriedly stood up and dashed over in a single step, reaching over to help Ning Haixin up.

Ning Haixin took a step back, causing Lu Yang to grab empty air.

A hint of disgust rose in her mind. This person was far too audacious, and he actually dared to reach over to take advantage of her?

“Haha, it looks like Nephew Lu has taken a liking to your daughter,” Han Zhang said with hearty laughter. “Brother Ning, when should we set the wedding?”

‘What?!’

Ning Haixin was astonished. She was going to get married? Married to this clearly detestable Lu Yang?

She looked at her father, hoping that he would immediately refute this suggestion. To her disappointment and dismay, however, he actually started to carefully consider this question.

It was clear that he wasn’t going to reject this advance. Instead, he was contemplating a good date for their wedding.

Her head suddenly felt light, and she almost fainted on the spot.

She barely heard what her father said afterward, and her mind was simply a scrambled mess. Only at the end did she hear him reply, “After three months, we’ll wait for son-in-law Lu Yang to come and pick up the bride.”

She didn’t know how she returned to her room, and it was as if she had lost her soul.

The woman in azure hurriedly walked over, and asked, “Young Mistress, what’s wrong?”

Ning Haixin was extremely dispirited, and it was with her maidservant’s help that she walked to her bed and sat down. She suddenly burst into tears.

“Young Mistress, what’s wrong? Don’t scare me,” the woman in azure said in bewilderment. Why was the young mistress suddenly crying?

Ning Haixin didn’t reply, and she simply continued to sob.

She was filled with grief. She was going to get married to someone, yet she was only notified when they were deciding on the wedding date? Moreover, Lu Yang clearly wasn’t a good person! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She had an innate ability to tell a good person from a bad person, and she could easily see if someone had ulterior motives or not.

She saw lust and contempt radiating from Lu Yang.

If she married this man, her life would most definitely become a miserable and bitter one. In fact, she might even die from suffocation.

Why was her father betrothing her to this man?

After she calmed down, the answer became extremely obvious.

Celestial King An Teng.

Lu Yang’s father was a Celestial King, and Ning Daolan was someone with extremely wild ambitions—he wasn’t satisfied with remaining at the Ascending Origin Tier.

Even though he was powerful, he would still eventually perish one day. However, becoming a Celestial King would be different. He would become undying, and he would enjoy a lifespan as long as heaven and earth.

Ning Daolan needed to use his daughter to create this opportunity, an opportunity that would give him a chance to become a Celestial King, regardless of how small this chance was.

However, shouldn’t all parents in the world love their children?

No, Ning Haixin knew that her father was capable of doing something like this. This was because she had two older brothers who were capable of supporting the Ning Clan in the future. As for a daughter… She would eventually have to marry someone one day, so wouldn’t it be better to get some benefits out of her marriage?

From a young age, Ning Haixin had already known that her father didn’t love her very much. He only cared about two things.

Firstly, his own cultivation. Secondly, the growth of his two sons.

She stopped sobbing, knowing that her father wouldn’t change his mind.

“Xuan Yi, I’m going to leave this place,” she said with a resolute expression as she looked up.

“Why?” the woman in azure asked, still unaware of the situation.

“Father wants to force me into a marriage with someone who I’m completely unfamiliar with. And that person… is a rascal,” Ning Haixin replied.

The woman in azure hesitated for a brief moment before saying, “Alright, then let’s leave, Young Mistress.”

The two women packed some belongings, and they naturally had Spatial God Tools to hold all their luggage. Others wouldn’t be able to notice anything amiss.

They walked out of Ning Haixin’s room, and they continued to descend the mountain in a calm and composed manner. They didn’t want to alert anyone by accident.

“Huh? Young Mistress, look over there!” the woman in azure suddenly exclaimed as she pointed at the mountain path in front of them.

Ning Haixin looked over, and she couldn’t help but feel astonished.

Wasn’t this the man she had rescued from the Heavenly Treasure Lake just then? Hadn’t she told him to leave? Why was he still wandering around with such a relaxed and carefree expression?

‘Do you really think this place is your home?’

She wanted to walk over and lecture him, but upon recalling her situation, she could only sigh and pretend that she hadn’t seen him.

The two women arrived at the foot of the mountain. However, before they could even leave, they heard a distant voice say, “Young Mistress, please return now.”
