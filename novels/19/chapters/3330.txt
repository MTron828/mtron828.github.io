Chapter 3331: Advice

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ge Qiuyue and Fang Ziping were both Extreme Bone Tier elites, their speed reaching twice the speed of sound. Meridian Opening Tiers couldn’t see their figures clearly at all, and even Blood Transformation Tiers found it a bit difficult. They only knew that the afterimages of the golden whip and the white bone spear were endlessly clashing.

However, seven minutes later, the battle was decided.

“Get lost!” Ge Qiuyue reprimanded softly, and Fang Ziping was sent flying.

Peng! Fang Ziping fell heavily onto the ground. He quickly got back to his feet, and saw that the white bone spear had already been broken in half, and its sharp point had been sent flying to who knew where.

He glared fiercely at Ge Qiuyue, but didn’t make another move.

The two of them had used practically all their techniques just now, and he was indeed at a disadvantage.

“You dare to interfere in the matters of our Lord; this matter will definitely not end just like this!” Fang Ziping said balefully, “Remember, those who go against our Lord will not have a good end. The only result would be being crushed!”

“Get lost!” The response was Ge Qiuyue’s whip.

With a leap, Fang Ziping rapidly retreated. Even if he was no match, how could he not be able to dodge?

“Wait!” Ling Han said. It was clear that Fang Ziping wanted to flee.

Fang Ziping stopped and turned around to look at Ling Han. Could it be that this brat had changed his mind?

Ling Han pointed inside the room, and said, “Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. Immediately apologize to my maidservant and compensate for her losses. Otherwise, when we meet again, I will take your life.”

“Haha, hahahaha!” Fang Ziping laughed loudly. Was there anything more laughable than this?

A Blood Transformation Tier actually dared to threaten an Extreme Bone Tier!

However, Ling Han’s expression didn’t change at all. He simply looked at him coldly.

Fang Ziping could no longer laugh. He seemed to be able to see that determination in Ling Han’s aloof expression; he would definitely do as he had promised.

Even if others had this kind of determination, he would not care, but Ling Han was different.

This was a prodigy who could battle against Extreme Bone Tier when he was only in the Blood Transformation Tier. Although he was far from being able to compare to Hong Tianbu, he could still be considered freakish.

He withdrew his smile, revealing a sliver of killing intent. Since that was the case, he would first kill Ling Han. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’ll remember you!” he said, then turned around and left. With a burst of two times the speed of sound, he was naturally astonishingly fast, and soon disappeared from sight.

Ling Han stared at Fang Ziping’s back until the latter disappeared from sight.

He gradually withdrew the killing intent in his heart. Previously, he was definitely not threatening Fang Ziping, but speaking from the bottom of his heart.

Since you don’t cherish this opportunity, then don’t regret being killed by him in the future.

He clasped his hands in Ge Qiuyue’s direction, and said, “Thank you.”

“No need,” Ge Qiuyue said with a shake of her head. “As a teacher of the academy, it’s my duty to protect my students.”

“All right, I’ll change your accommodations later.” With a wave of her hand, she leaped up, and soon disappeared from sight.

Ling Han returned to the destroyed room and carried Huan Xue out. He first went to Huan Xue’s room and settled her down.

Thankfully, the little female attendant had only been knocked unconscious, and her injuries were not very serious.

He sat down at the side, and a powerful sense of urgency rose up in his heart.

From the moment he had clashed with Hong Tianliang, he knew that there would eventually come a day when he would come into direct conflict with Hong Tianbu. However, he had not thought that he would be standing on opposing sides of Hong Tianbu so soon.

Ling Han wasn’t afraid, but this overwhelming freak was at least a Fifth Extreme by now. If they really came to blows, there was absolutely no way he could be a match, because Hong Tianbu was also a prodigy that could challenge those at a higher cultivation level. His battle prowess was comparable to the Inscription Tier.

Ling Han didn’t think that he could rival Inscription Tier elites. At least, he couldn’t accomplish that when he was only in Blood Transformation Tier.

He definitely had to improve his cultivation level as soon as possible. Even if he couldn’t defeat Hong Tianbu, he had to at least deal with Fang Ziping first.

However, cultivation had to be progressed slowly and steadily; how could one possibly advance by leaps and bounds without a special fated opportunity?

“If some ancient site opens up and I obtain some treasures, I can solve the problem.”

He hoped that Xuanyuan Dingguo would come, and would provide him with another chance to go to some ancient site.

However, he was disappointed. Xuanyuan Dingguo seemed to have disappeared.

After a few days, Ling Han finally found out that Xuanyuan Dingguo and the others had all begun to break through to Extreme Bone Tier.

Previously, Ling Han and Hong Tianliang’s performance in the hunting tournament had been too shocking, seriously provoking these people. Thus, they could no longer hold themselves back, and began to break through.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. Since he couldn’t go to an ancient site, he might as well change his direction.

He had only obtained two ingredients for the antidote for the Soul Departing Pill.

He would find the remaining six.

At present, he did not lack money at all. Anything that could be solved with money was no big deal.

After posting the deal on the platform, Ling Han soon received news that someone had Thousand Leaves and wanted to make a deal with him. However, the other party raised the price by twofold.

It was true that Ling Han had a lot of money, but he was no fool.

He bargained with the other party, and finally reached a deal with a price of five million.

This time, Ling Han didn’t encounter any conmen, successfully completing the deal.

Another few days passed, and he obtained clues about the fourth ingredient. The other party quoted a price of 7 million, and they bargained for a long time. However, the other party gritted his teeth and refused to relent. Ling Han didn’t plan to waste time, so he took the offer.

He was halfway done!

Ling Han’s luck attribute seemed to have taken effect. Very soon, he had obtained the clue of the fifth ingredient, and he had also completed a breakthrough, and that was he had finally unravelled the secret of the circular plate.

Di, di, di! A message came from the optical computer, but Ling Han didn’t have the time to care about it.

He arrived at the small forest, and tossed the circular plate onto the ground. Then, he activated it with his Spiritual Power. There was clearly no change, but Ling Han “saw” clearly that the formation had formed.

He caught a wild boar, and threw it into the area enshrouded by the formation.

The wild boar did not sense anything at all. The moment it broke free from the suppression, it immediately wanted to flee. It had already been completely frightened by Ling Han’s strength.

However, just as its foot moved, xiu, an ice arrow arrived. It had reached at least six times the speed of sound, so how could it be dodged by a wild boar? When the arrow hit its target, it immediately turned into a block of ice.

“The high-level energy mobilized is at least a dozen times more than mine!” Ling Han murmured. He could already use Spiritual Power to communicate with high-level energy, so he naturally could also determine the “range” of the formation.

He couldn’t help but feel fortunate again. At that time, those troublemakers hadn’t been able to fully unleash the formation’s power. Otherwise, he would have been very passive at that time. This should have the power of Inscription Tier.

“However, I have a purple pendant that can neutralize a portion of the formation’s might, as well as the Essence Nurturing Gourd. At most, I’ll only be in a bit of a sorry state.”

Ling Han shut down the formation, and held the circular disc in his hand.

Since formations could also have the effect of communicating with high-level energy, then was it a kind of Spirit Diagram by itself?

Ling Han studied formation patterns, wanting to use them for his own use.

However, after half a day, he had no choice but to shake his head. Humans and formations were different, and there was no possibility of learning from them through reference.

He returned to his room — he had long since switched to a new one. Then, he turned on the optical computer. Previously, someone seemed to have sent him a message.

Looking at it, Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. Someone had contacted him again, and there was the fifth ingredient he needed, the White Scorching Stone.

He was just about to send a message to the other party, when he suddenly felt an uncomfortable feeling, and immediately turned around.

A figure slid in through the window.. When he saw Ling Han turn around, that person couldn’t help but feel surprised, and said, “Brat, your reactions are getting more and more agile!”
