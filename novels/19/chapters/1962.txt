Chapter 1963: Red Spotted Green Bamboo

The four of them advanced rapidly, and after just an hour, a pool that was as black as ink appeared ahead of them. An indescribable stench assaulted them, and there was a green bamboo growing in the center of the pool, long and thin.

The green bamboo was like a drooping rod, close to 300 meters tall. It practically had no leaves. There were only six leaves growing at its highest point, and they bore a crimson fruit.

Now that they had arrived here, the fragrance of the Celestial medicine had instead vanished.

“Red Spotted Green Bamboo!” Ling Han immediately exclaimed.

By now, he was already familiar with all the Celestial medicines in the Celestial Realm. Even if some Celestial medicine had been produced from crossbreeding, he could still discover what its “parents” were from the slightest clues.

Seeing that the three women were still a little puzzled, he explained, “This is indeed a Celestial medicine, but the portion that is valuable is not that crimson fruit, but rather those six leaves. They each contain different Regulations of the Great Dao, and if they are consumed together, they would take effect simultaneously. It would be akin to immersing yourself in great dao, the effects of comprehension would be amazing.

“However, this Celestial Bamboo is a treasure in itself.

“The bamboo pole can be used to forge weapons. Its toughness is at least comparable to Six-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. The older it is, the tougher it is, and if it has reached 100 billion years old, it would be comparable to Nine-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, and can become Ten-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal after 1,000 billion years.”

Starry-eyed, Bewitching Maiden Rou could not help but ask, “Then how many years would it need to become Divine Metal?”

Divine Metal, who did not want it?

Ling Han only quirked his lips, and said, “The limit is Ten-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. It cannot rush up to the heights of Divine Metal. This is a natural limit.”

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s lips pouted, looking very pitiful.

However, in her heart, she was about to go crazy, wanting nothing more than to hang Ling Han up and give him a beating. This damn man was really too unromantic and rude. She was a beauty here, so would he die if he was a little gentler to her?

‘Humph, isn’t it just because you want me to dislike you? I won’t, I will cling to you, and drive you crazy!’

“And there is that fruit too,” Ling Han explained solemnly. “Though it cannot be used as medicine, it cannot be called useless. This thing... is incredibly and extraordinarily poisonous. The moment the poison makes contact with your hand, it would be useless even if you chopped off your hand. Your whole person would immediately be melted into a pool of blood, which is extremely terrifying. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Looking at the color of the bamboo pole, this Red Spotted Green Bamboo should be more or less six billion years old. The destructive power of that fruit should be limited to Heaven soul, or even Immortal Palace Tier.”

The three women all paled. That fruit could kill even Immortal Palace Tiers with its poison, and it was through instantly melting into a pool of blood at that. So terrifying. Though they were all extraordinary—especially Hu Niu, who had a precious treasure that could save her life—they could not possibly survive the blow of an Immortal Palace Tier.

Ling Han pointed at that incredibly smelly pool, and said, “Look at this pool. It has been formed by the poisonous air that has seeped out of the poisonous fruit.”

Hearing him say this, the three women hurriedly pinched their noses. No wonder they felt a little dizzy. As it turned out, they had been poisoned.

Ling Han shook his head with a laugh, and said, “No need to be so nervous. Only actual contact with the poison would cause harm. If it is just the smell alone, it just smells bad.”

Even so, looking at the expressions of the three women, they would still withdraw even if it meant giving up this Celestial medicine.

Women, sigh, women.

Ling Han took a few steps forwards, and began to circle around the pool, studying how he was supposed to retrieve this Celestial Bamboo.

He first moved directly, his Origin Power forming a hand to directly extract the Celestial Bamboo, but it was as if this Celestial Bamboo had been joined with the ground here. If he wanted to pull out the Celestial Bamboo, he would have to pull out the ground here.

If this was another place, this actually wouldn’t be much of a problem, either. With Ling Han’s present power, to say nothing of the ground here, even if it was a few dozen stars added together, he would still be able to carry them easily.

The problem was that this was a natural Mystery Realm, and there was a great amount of Celestial King blood spilled here. There was some nameless change taking place here, so heaving up the ground here became an impossible feat.

He pushed the hand of Origin Power forwards a bit, but sizzling sounds immediately rang out. The giant hand of Origin Power was presently being rapidly corroded, and he could clearly see that a giant hand had become a half, and then disappeared completely.

Ling Han gave a muffled grunt, and when he raised his hand, he saw that a black seal had actually appeared on the palm of his hand, and it was still spreading.

This was the poison of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo.

Ling Han hurriedly channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Weng, golden light appeared on his hand, and an incredibly noble seal appeared, then suppressed, and soon destroyed that black-colored seal.

Such terrifying poison.

He had not made direct contact at all, and it had still been transmitted over from the giant hand of Origin Power, and it could still cause such frightening damage even then. Then if it was direct contact with the poison water, that really would mean instantly melting into blood. He would not even have the chance to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Being capable of killing an Immortal Palace Tier elite with its poison was indeed no joke.

Ling Han frowned. This poison should only be transmitted through direct contact, but why had it taken effect when it was just contact with the air here?

He took a closer look, and gave an ‘oh’. As it turned out, the temperature of the pool was slightly high, so steam was rising from it. And it was this steam that had touched the giant hand of Origin Power, transmitting the poison.

At the beginning, the giant hand of Origin Power was at a high enough point, so it had not been touched by the steam, but when it descended slightly, this caused the poison to explode.

Ling Han shook his head. This really was a little troubling. How was he supposed to retrieve the Celestial Bamboo then?

He turned to look at the three women. If there were more of them, they should be able to come up with more ideas.

The three women all shook their heads. They did not want to risk getting in contact with the poison in the slightest. It should be known that every part of their skin was supple and soft. If it was even the slightest bit damaged, and they were no longer beautiful, what were they supposed to do?

Even Hu Niu was no exception on this point, no longer as carefree as she had been.

Ling Han could only think of an idea on his own.

Use the Divine Demon Sword?

This was a future Celestial Tool, and while it was a little weak at the moment, it should be able to resist the poison.

Ling Han tried it out, and true enough, the Divine Demon Sword had no fear of the poison, and would not be corroded. However, this weapon was only at the level of Three-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool at present, so what could it do to the toughness of the Celestial Bamboo?

If a Three-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool would be cut by a Six-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool, what justice was there left in this world?

Ling Han used another method, wanting to empty out the waters in the pool. Then, he would be able to dig out the roots of this Celestial Baboo, and easily retrieve it.

But the problem was: what vessel could bear the corrosion of the poisonous waters?

The moment lower-level Pseudo-Divine Metal was placed in, it would be turned into dust, and the Divine Demon Sword could not be used like a pail, either.

Ling Han was stuck in a dilemma. This treasure was just in front of his eyes, yet he could only look at it from afar and lament?

His thoughts ran furiously, and he came up with another idea.

Burn!

Ling Han had the three women retreat far away, and then channeled the Nine Heavens Flame towards the pool. Under such intense and blazing heat, he was sure that this pool of water would soon be burnt completely. That would lead to the same result.

Out of Ling Han’s expectations, this pool of water was very hard to evaporate. Half a day had passed, and just a little had been burned up.

As long as there was an effect, that was fine.

Ling Han firmed his will, and decided to just spend his time here.

He pushed the Nine Heavens Flame to its limits. In any case, because of the limitation of his own cultivation level, it was impossible for the Nine Heavens Flame to release the full might of Celestial King Tier, so there was no need for him to worry about damaging the Celestial Bamboo. Additionally, because the Nine Heavens Flame was a Source Power of heaven and earth, there naturally would be no need for him to worry about being countered by the poison.

Day after day passed, and the water level of the pool was also decreasing bit by bit.

He was close to success.
