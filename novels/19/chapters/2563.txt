Chapter 2564: Crashing the Party

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Soon after, the servant brought two people inside. The person in front was filled with a haughty aura, and it was as if he wanted to make sure that everyone knew that he was a second-generation young master. In fact, he seemed just shy of writing “I am super impressive” on his face.

The other person kept a much lower profile. His eyes were downcast and solemn, and he looked much like a puppet. When the person in front of him took a step, he would take a step too. Their footsteps were completely in sync.

They were both Celestial Kings, with one having two ribbons of iridescent light, and one having three ribbons of iridescent light.

“Lu Li!” Tang Yuan said as he saw the haughty person. He wanted to control his emotions and appear as if he had a grasp of the situation, yet he couldn’t help but reveal his resentment.

This was because he had suffered a brutal defeat the previous time they had clashed heads. Not only had his Blood Martial King failed to reach 100 victories, but he had even been killed on the spot. This had caused him to lose an exorbitant amount of money. As a result, he detested Lu Li to the core.

“Tang Yuan!” Lu Li said with a chuckle. Because he had gained the upper hand in the previous clash, he naturally felt a sense of superiority. He looked at Ling Han, and said, “This is the new person you invited? He’s called Li Long?”

“And what about it?” Tang Yuan retorted.

Lu Li ignored Tang Yuan. Instead, he looked at Ling Han, and said, “Become my follower, Li Long!” He immediately started to poach the underling of Tang Yuan, continuing, “If you stay with someone like Tang Yuan, you’ll only be covering your own luster. Moreover, do you know how your predecessor died?

“He was killed by my Blood Martial King!” he said in a menacing voice.

Lu Li’s words were threatening and dripping with malice. If Ling Han didn’t follow him, Lu Li would subject him to the same fate as his predecessor. Ling Han would die at the hands of Lu Li’s Blood Martial King.

Tang Yuan shook with anger. He pointed at Lu Li, and bellowed, “Lu Li, you’re taking things too far!”

Lu Li roared with laughter. “You’re nothing but a defeated opponent! Obediently stand aside!” He turned to Ling Han again, saying, “What do you think? Do you want to die a wretched death, or do you want to bathe in eternal glory?”

Everyone glared at him in anger. This person was far too arrogant and haughty! He had come to someone else’s territory, and he was even trying to openly threaten and poach their followers! He was treating the Tang Faction as if they didn’t exist!

Ling Han completely ignored him. Instead, he was pondering whether he needed to dispose of another second-generation young master before he left.

“You truly disappoint me!” Lu Li said with a shake of his head. “I initially thought you were a smart person, but by the looks of it now, you’re an utter fool!”

Tang Yuan finally composed himself, saying, “Lu Li, just you wait. I’ll definitely make you swallow your own words!”

Lu Li huffed in disdain. “Tell your brat to become a Blood Martial King first. Otherwise, he doesn’t even have the right to battle with my underling!”

Blood Martial Kings could actively challenge other Blood Martial Kings. However, if one weren’t a Blood Martial King, they could only enjoy this privilege after becoming a Blood Martial King.

“This is an easy task,” Tang Yuan said coldly. “Tell your Blood Martial King to clean his neck. It’s only a matter of time before his head hits the deck!”

“Becoming a Blood Martial King isn’t so easy. Call me after you pass this challenge.” Lu Li flicked his sleeve, and continued, “This kind of feast is so boring and meaningless. What a killjoy!

“I’m off!” He turned around to leave.

“You want to leave so easily after entering my territory?” Tang Yuan said in a baleful voice. If he allowed his nemesis to leave so easily, would he still have face to show himself in the future?

“What? You want to keep me here?” Lu Li said with a sneer. “A’Yuan, hold them back!”

The person who had remained silent this entire time stood still. He then turned around.

Clang!

A sword appeared in his hand, emitting a crisp clanging sound. The blade of the sword vibrated, exuding an ice-cold killing intent.

He was a single person with a single sword, yet he radiated with a domineering aura that could seemingly force everyone to retreat. It was as if no one could breach his defenses as long as he didn’t fall.

“Kill him!” Tang Yuan commanded coldly. He didn’t dare to kill Lu Li, but it was naturally no problem to kill one of his lackeys. Even slicing him into pieces would be fine.

A young Celestial King stepped forward, and said, “I’ll go!”

He was also a Third Heaven Celestial King, and his cultivation was far superior to Tang Yuan’s. It was just that his father was inferior to Tang Mingbo. Thus, he could only become Tang Yuan’s underling.

Whoosh!

He dashed forward, and a sword had already appeared in his hand. Like a soaring immortal, he ruthlessly thrust at A’Yuan’s throat.

“Remember, you’ve died at the hands of Guo—”

Pu!

Before he could even finish saying his name, his head had already been sent flying. Blood spurted from his neck.

They were at the same cultivation level, yet he had been beheaded in a single exchange. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Just how immense was the gulf between them?

Most importantly, this A’Yuan was far too ruthless. The father of the person he had killed was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

Even though Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings couldn’t compare to Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, were they beings that Third Heaven Celestial Kings could provoke?

A’Yuan retracted his sword. His eyes were frosty and lacking emotion as he gazed at the others. It was as if he were looking at sheep for slaughter instead of living people.

Everyone was terrified. This person was far too resolute in his slaughter, not hesitating in the slightest. His aura completely suppressed them.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was fairly intrigued as he looked at A’Yuan. His mind continued to replay the sword strike from just then. In terms of power alone, A’Yuan hadn’t possessed a crushing advantage. However, his strike had been far too quick, so much so that his opponent hadn’t been afforded the opportunity to defend.

This person was a worthy opponent.

“Hahaha!” Lu Li roared with wanton laughter. “Tang Yuan, you still want to compete with me? You overestimate yourself! Before my new underling, can your pretty boy even withstand a single strike?”

He strode away, with no one daring to block him.

Only when Lu Li left did A’Yuan finally sheath his sword. He turned around to leave step by step. However, his movements were stiff, and it was as if he were a puppet.

However, even though his movements were strange, no one dared to laugh. Instead, they all felt a cold chill grip their bodies. Only when A’Yuan vanished from sight did they finally feel the warmth in the air.

His killing intent was far too powerful. In fact, it was so powerful that it could subtly affect them and petrify their divine sense. Thus, even if their strength was similar, they would still suffer resounding defeat at his hands.

“Trash! You’re all trash!” Tang Yuan suddenly howled in rage. He swept his gaze across them as he smashed wine glass after wine glass.

Lu Li had specially come to ruin his mood. However, even though he knew this, he still couldn’t prevent it. Thus, why wouldn’t he be enraged?

Tang Yuan continued to smash wine glasses and flip tables. He then turned around to leave. How could they continue this feast? Would he be in the mood to do so?

After just four days, Ling Han was scheduled for his second battle.

According to usual practice, one would rest for a month or so after each battle. After all, it was inevitable that one would be wounded during merciless life-and-death battles. In fact, it wouldn’t be strange for competitors to rest for half a year.

However, Ling Han’s first victory had been far too flawless. He hadn’t suffered any wounds, nor had he lost any vitality. Add to that Tang Yuan’s pent-up anger, and it was only natural that he wanted Ling Han to become a Blood Martial King as soon as possible. Only then could he challenge Lu Li’s Blood Martial King.

Ling Han’s next opponent was a veteran of the tournament. He had participated in over 1000 battles, though his greatest win streak was only seven.

However, to remain alive after participating in over 1000 battles, and to achieve a winning streak of seven, this person clearly possessed admirable battle prowess.

However, it was just that no one invested in him anymore. He simply fought in this tournament to make a living and earn some cultivation resources. Indeed, those who participated in the tournament would all be given a battle fee. The amount would be dependent on their strength and popularity.

The person immediately greeted Ling Han with squinting eyes and a wide smile upon seeing him, saying, “Young one, show me some mercy!”
