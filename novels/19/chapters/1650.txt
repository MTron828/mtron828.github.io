Chapter 1651: Another cultivation system

Xiao Gu did not dodge or hide, and allowed this strike to land, causing a muffled sound on his body. His expression was completely curious as he asked, “Yiyaya?” ‘Why are you people all so weird, to offer greetings in this manner?’

Only now was the middle-aged man shocked. Though he had not used his full power in that strike, he was still unable to accept that it was so easily resolved just like that. Even his face was about to turn green. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He took a few steps backwards, drawing out the distance between himself and Xiao Gu. Then, he began to channel his cultivation technique. Weng, weng, weng. Multiple black halos actually appeared on him. There were a total of nine, but the first eight halos were as black as ink, while the ninth was lighter in color.

This was the display of a cultivation level of their system of cultivation. One black ring represented a single cultivation level, and nine rings was the strongest level here, which was comparable to the Genesis Tier. The darkness of the black ring represented low extreme, medium extreme, early stage, late stage, peak stage, and so on.

In any case, it was a complete process of change.

Previously, Ling Han had already learned about this from the three young men’s mouths. This was not any big secret. If they were interrogated about their cultivation technique, they might resist violently, and would rather die than submit.

Xiao Gu was indifferent, and even slanted its head to one side. It looked left and looked right. But it was only a while before it then focused in on that middle-aged man, leaking out an obvious expression of loathing. “Yiyaya!”

It showed killing intent.

Ling Han was surprised. Though Xiao Gu was baffling, and loved to repeat words, this was only an innocent child in his eyes, yet now it actually showed killing intent. This was stunning to him.

Xiao Gu had also once been a man of this world—fine, at least it was a part of this world. Why would it show such strong animosity towards this middle-aged man like it was facing a strong enemy?

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu released a shout of fury, its eyes suddenly shooting out a green-colored light. Pa, the streak of light landed on the middle-aged man, and suddenly blasted him to pieces.

So what if he was a Small Saint? In front of Xiao Gu, he couldn’t even survive a single blow.

The people around were all stunned before releasing sharp screams as they all turned and fled.

“Yiyaya?” Xiao Gu scratched its head, its expression completely vacant. Why had it been angry just now?

“You’ve gotten into trouble!” There were still some outsiders there, and all of them showed dissatisfaction towards Ling Han and his group.

“The Spiritual Qi and natural resources here are abundant. We have only come to an agreement with them after much difficulty, allowing us to cultivate here and trade resources, yet you guys actually killed someone here. Isn’t this causing trouble to us?”

They all pointed fingers. Perhaps they actually were no longer afraid of them, because they knew that the Yuan Tribe would definitely move to punish Ling Han and his group angrily. Otherwise, who would dare be so insolent in front of Saints?

Ling Han frowned, and said, “You all have your way of handling things, and we have ours. What right do you have to reproach us? On the basis that we are all cultivators of the Immortal Realm, I will not call you to account. If you blurt any more nonsense, I will let you suffer the consequences of your own actions!”

These people dared not speak further. No matter what, there were Saints among these people. How could they possibly trifle with Saints?

But there were still a few people grumbling internally. What were they so puffed up about? They would become corpses in a short while! It was too unfortunate for those three women. All of them were astonishingly beautiful, but what a pity, they would be either killed or defiled by barbarians.

Ling Han saw this, and couldn’t help but feel his killing intent burn. He flicked out a finger, and pa, pa, pa, pa, a few people who had unbearable expressions on their faces immediately died from having their heads pierced through.

F***, did they really think that he was a benevolent person, and would not commit a massacre?

Now, everyone was shivering from fear. Only now did they recall the authority of Saints. They were the strongest existence of the Immortal Realm, and represented the will of heaven and earth. How could they allow insults?

Xiu, xiu, xiu. And it was at this moment that a few figures shot from the depths of the tribe. All of their auras were incredibly strong, as if they were capable of even shattering the heavens.

They definitely were Saint King-level, but because their system of cultivation was different, Ling Han was unable to accurately determine just what level these people had actually reached.

“Kill all of them!” an old man with a crown of feathers on his head commanded. The feathers were as tall as nine meters and incredibly dazzling in color.

Clearly, one only had to look at their head-dresses to estimate every person’s status here. The longer the feathers one was adorned with, the higher his status.

“Yes, Fourth Elder!” the four people by the old man’s side all answered respectfully. They all leaped out, and surrounded Ling Han and his group.

Long Yushan hurriedly drew Long Xiangyue into her Spatial God Tool. Once the battle broke out, that would be a battle of Saints. Merely the slightest scrape, and Long Xiangyue would easily lose her life.

Weng, weng, weng. Those four people all activated their cultivation techniques to the fullest. Black rings abruptly appeared on their bodies. They all had nine rings each, and the darkness of the ninth ring was higher than that of the middle-aged man from before.

Through comparison, these four should be Great Saints.

Xiao Gu again became filled with killing intent, his face showing an expression of fury. He loudly roared, “Yiyaya!”

His eyes glowed. Pa, pa, pa, pa. A green ray of light streaked past. He only turned his head, and the green light swept over those four Great Saint-level elites.

However, this time, the four great elites did not die. They were only split in two by that green light, and could still rejoin their bodies with much difficulty.

The fourth elder showed an expression of shock. Even he was terrified at the sight of this kind of strength, but only after a moment of being startled, he suddenly exclaimed in shock, “Green light! Green light! You, you are the legendary Destroyer!”

He pointed at Xiao Gu, his expression wild.

“Green, light, green, light, you, you...” Xiao Gu again began to imitate his words. Even if he was a native of this place, as long as he did not channel that kind of cultivation technique, and showed the black rings of light, it would be very normal.

The fourth elder cried out repeatedly, and another four elites ******* appeared after only a while. Three of the elites had the same attire as he had, while the last one had a headdress whose feathers were actually 12 meters long!

He was the tribal chief of the Yuan Tribe.

“Fourth, you actually did not manage to take care of these outsider mutts?” The third elder laughed loudly, his voice like a bell. He had always been at odds with the fourth elder, so now that he had the chance, he naturally had to mock him.

Yet the fourth elder’s expression was grim and serious. As he pointed at Xiao Gu, he exclaimed, “He can release green light, the legendary... green light of destruction!”

‘What?!’

The four great elites all paled. It has been passed on through the generations that there would be a day when a man that used green light would appear and destroy everything.

Yet Xiao Gu was still earnestly imitating his words. “Fourth, you, actually...” Then he answered his own question. “He, can, release...” And it seemed he was more and more fluent with his words. In a few more days, he would not speak in clumps like this.

“Charge!” The five of them had solemn expressions as they stretched their hands out towards the skies. Weng, weng, weng. The power of innumerable others of the tribe surged into their bodies in a very strange manner.

That was the power of the nation—or at least something of the sort.

Nine black rings also appeared on their bodies, and they were practically all as black as ink.

“Charge!” Xiao Gu imitated, and it was very fitting for the situation. Seeing the black rings on these people, it also showed a boundless killing intent.
