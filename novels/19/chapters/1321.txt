1322 Venturing into the Plain

The Stone Emperor laughed loudly, and said, “Who would’ve thought that such a place existed in this galaxy.” He formed a series of hand seals, and it wasn’t long before a miniature carriage whizzed over.

Rather than calling this a horse-drawn carriage[1], it was probably better to call it a bull-drawn carriage. This was because the carriage was drawn by a metallic purple-gold bull.

This was none other than the Stone Emperor’s extravagant carriage. Both the animal drawing it and the carriage itself were forged from a piece of Saintly Material. It was so profligate that it could barely be described by words.

“Guys, there’s no time to waste. Let’s hop on the carriage first!” The Stone Emperor was the first to hop onto the carriage, and his body shrunk back to its original of three inches tall as he did so.

“Can’t you expand the size of the carriage?” the North Emperor asked unhappily.

“This is Saintly Material, so there’s no way for me to control it,” the Stone Emperor said with a shrug of his shoulders. “Are you guys getting on or not?”

The others exchanged a glance before all jumping toward the carriage, their bodies shrinking in size as they did so. If they didn’t shrink in size, there was no way they could fit into the carriage. Instead, they would end up standing on top of the carriage.

Standing on top of a Saint Tool? No... Standing on top of two Saint Tools? Wasn’t that seeking death?

Moreover, that purple-gold bull had already developed a bit of intelligence. Once it truly developed awareness, it would become a Saint!

Who dared to stand on top of it?

Fortunately, it was simple for Immortals to shrink down in size. Everyone shrunk to the height of three inches before hopping into the carriage. In fact, this was probably a chariot and not a carriage, as it had no roof. The exterior of this chariot was decorated with carvings of formations that exuded an ancient and profound aura.

There weren’t many people in the chariot, with Ling Han, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, Faceless, Yang Lin, Yue Ying, the Cloud Maiden, and Zuo Quan the only people apart from the Stone Emperor and the North Emperor. No one else had the right to board this chariot.

Although Yue Ying hadn’t become one of the nine kings, her strength had been clear for all to see. Meanwhile, Zuo Quan was able to board thanks to his relationship with the Cloud Maiden. Otherwise, just his Heavenly Body Tier cultivation alone wasn’t enough to impress the Stone Emperor.

Chi Huangji and the others obviously couldn’t board the chariot—they were members of the enemy realm, after all. The fact that they weren’t fighting against each other at this moment was already a sign of impressive restraint. However, this relative peace probably wouldn’t last for much longer.

The chariot sped forward at incredible speeds.

Before long, they had already left the bulk of the cultivators far, far behind. They were truly speeding on ahead. Even Chi Huangji, Tuoba Dong, and the other king tiers couldn’t keep pace with them.

However, after advancing for half a day, they were still stuck in this barren plain. Casting their eyes around, all they could see was empty space. It was as if this plain was endless. Even so, they weren’t discouraged. The larger this underground world was, the bigger and more astonishing the secret that it held.

Groan!

The chariot suddenly jolted as if it had struck something, almost turning over. Fortunately, it was being drawn by a bull that was forged from Saintly Material, making the ride extremely smooth. The chariot only jolted once before immediately regaining its balance.

However, what on earth had it struck?

One had to realize that ordinary materials would be crushed into pulp if they were struck by the purple-gold bull. After all, it was a Saintly Material that was close to obtaining awareness. Perhaps the power of its strike hadn’t reached the level of genuine Saints yet, but it had definitely reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier.

The Stone Emperor stopped the carriage, and everyone hopped off to check out what they had hit.

They found that there was actually a bump in this otherwise flat plain, and it was because the chariot had struck it that it had jolted.

“There’s blood!” the North Emperor said solemnly.

Everyone looked over, only to see that there was a crack in the bump. Blood was gushing from this crack, and an overpowering smell of rotting flesh wafted toward them. It was as if an old corpse several hundred years old was lying beneath this bump.

Crack!

A fissure instantly appeared on the earth, then another, and another. A web of fissures cracked open, and the earth started to tremor lightly.

Peng!

A large hand suddenly reached up from the earth. Like the evil beast from before, this hand was composed of numerous corpses.

On the arm, there was a corpse whose stomach was sliced open and dripping with viscous black blood. It exuded a revolting smell.

This arm pressed down on the earth such that the beast could pull its entire body from the earth. A revolting evil beast instantly appeared before Ling Han and the others.

Like the evil beast that had been killed by the four Eternal River Tier elites, this evil beast was also at the Eternal River Tier. Although it was an evil beast, the aura that radiated from it was still tremendously powerful. It was as if this evil beast were a paragon of evil.

This evil beast naturally saw the chariot and the cultivators, and it instantly drew a deep breath. A ferocious wind immediately lashed the surroundings, forming an overwhelmingly powerful suction force. Fortunately, it had inhaled, and not exhaled. Otherwise, if this evil beast had spat its revolting breath at them, they probably would have fainted right there and then.

Ferocious winds whipped through the surroundings, yet the people on the chariot remained firm and unmoving.

This chariot wasn’t any normal chariot, but one that had been forged from two Saintly Materials. As such, how could it be moved by an Eternal River Tier elite?

“Charge!” the Stone Emperor roared with a humph. He reached over and slapped the side of the chariot. The formations on the chariot’s exterior instantly lit up, intertwining to form a dazzling halo of light. At the same time, the purple-gold bull opened its mouth.

Pu!

A streak of purple light shot out from its mouth toward the evil beast.

This streak of light was astonishingly quick, striking the evil beast’s chest and tearing open a gaping hole in it.

However, the evil beast wasn’t severely wounded because of this. Instead, it howled in anger, and swatted its giant palm at the chariot.

Weng!

Its giant palm arrived before them, yet a sheet of light suddenly burst from the chariot and blocked its strike. Meanwhile, the people in the chariot could clearly see that the giant palm of the evil beast was composed of 17 corpses. Some of the corpses were missing a head, while some of the corpses were missing limbs. There were also some that had viscous red blood flowing over their bodies. This was truly a repulsive and stomach-churning sight.

If it weren’t for the chariot, perhaps everyone here (with the exception of the Stone Emperor) would have been sent flying by the strike. However, this chariot provided them with extremely sturdy protection. Meanwhile, the purple-gold bull spat several more beams of light, dealing significant damage to the evil beast.

However, the more wounded the evil beast became, the more violent and furious it grew. It was wild with rage as it launched a flurry of relentless attacks at the chariot. This evil beast had no intelligence, so it received more and more wounds from the attacks of the purple-gold bull. However, it still continued to attack, showing no signs of wanting to retreat.

Although it seemed like the four Eternal River Tier elites had disposed of the other evil beast very quickly, this was because the Wide Travel Monk King and the others were unfathomably powerful. Although this chariot was also extraordinary, its charioteer was only a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Thus, the power that it could unleash was severely limited.

Anyhow, the evil beast received more and more wounds, which it eventually succumbed to. It was blasted apart, transforming back into a field of broken corpses. Only now was it finally destroyed.

The Stone Emperor hurriedly steered the chariot away from this place. The smell of the rotting flesh was simply unbearable.

They continued to advance, coming across several more evil beasts. Some were more powerful than others, with the strongest being at the Eternal River Tier, and the weakest being at the Sun Moon Tier. The Sun Moon Tier evil beast was only composed of a dozen or so corpses. Moreover, it wasn’t in a humanoid form, instead looking like a slightly larger boulder made of flesh.

After advancing like this for a day or so, a sheet thick mist suddenly appeared before them. They couldn’t see through this mist no matter how powerful their vision was.

The Stone Emperor stopped the chariot. Right now, everyone was wearing a hesitant expression. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Should they continue forward?

This place was extremely uncanny, and perhaps there would be fatal dangers if they continued forward.

“As long we don’t come across living Genesis Tier Saints, this chariot can block anything!” the Stone Emperor guaranteed.

They all exchanged a glance before nodding slowly.

“Advance!”
