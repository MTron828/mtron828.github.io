2767 Shout that caused heaven’s might to retreat

Ling Han chuckled, similarly removed his disguise, took a step forward, and asked, “Huai Jian, do you still recognize me?”

“You?” Huai Jian stared at Ling Han for a while, and then his eyes suddenly lit up. “It’s you!”

On the side, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity also recognized Ling Han, and couldn’t help feeling furious. At that time, if it weren’t for Ling Han who had released Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, the Desolate Eternity might have advanced to the position of Second Tier Heavenly Venerate and become the strongest legend.

However, due to the damage sustained at that time, he had fallen short of success at the final step, and all his previous efforts had gone to waste. For the past one epoch, he hadn’t made any progress at all.

Ling Han nodded. “It’s been a long time.”

His current structure had since improved exponentially by many times, and he had long since ceased to take Huai Jian to heart.

“Good! Good! Good!” Huai Jian sneered. “Back then, you used a Heavenly Venerate Tool to commit crimes. Now, let’s see how you can escape this time!”

Although Ling Han’s side also had a Heavenly Venerate, there were a total of four on their side. The most important thing was that this was their world, where the Empress would be suppressed by the power of the dimension, and furthermore would be unable to extract the local unique power.

As long as there was enough time, the power within the Empress’ body would be exhausted, and she would be easily suppressed.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t have imagined that the Empress had also condensed a core of power, so she didn’t have to worry about running out of power, and her power had reached the level of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate; she alone was capable of conquering this whole dimension.

Ling Han was even more terrifying, having the strength of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate!

“Humph!” The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity directly moved; he was a veteran Heavenly Venerate, and was also the strongest in this dimension—there was scarcely anyone like him, so there was no need for him to have any scruples in doing things.

Ling Han casually waved his hand, and pa, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s big hand was slapped away. “Having finally met again, we should be catching up with one another. What’s the hurry?”

With this movement, everyone was once again dumbfounded.

What was going on? That was a Heavenly Venerate who had just made a move, but he was slapped away like a mosquito in such a relaxed manner? How could this be believed?

“Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” Heavenly Venerates Huai Jian, Yellow Spring, and Chi Yan all frowned. Their insight was fine, and yet this made them frown. How could a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate be so powerful?

It wasn’t as if they had gone to the Celestial Realm, and had been suppressed by the power of heaven and earth there. In that case, it wouldn’t be surprising if they could only unleash the battle prowess of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“A strange junior.” Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s eyes revealed an ominous glint. They had all been warned by Zhou Heng, who forbade them from entering the Celestial Realm for the rest of their lives, so they had never been able to cause trouble for Ling Han.

Now that Ling Han had delivered himself, the Desolate Eternity actually couldn’t do anything about it?

His chest was slightly bulging, and the pitch-black single horn on his head was shining as he was gathering power for a powerful attack.

For a Heavenly Venerate, this was astonishingly fast. Soon, he would have completed building his power, and could immediately strike against Ling Han.

Back then, Ling Han had been able to contend against Huai Jian. Presently, Huai Jian had attained the position of Heavenly Venerate, whilst Ling Han having become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was actually quite normal, and he shouldn’t be underestimated.

Boom, the Desolate Eternity swooped forward with supreme power.

This was an all-out effort, which made even the heaven and earth tremble.

The Empress took a step forward, shielding Ling Han’s body with her own, and then sent out a palm strike towards Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity.

Peng!

Sure enough, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was sent flying, and he slammed into the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords, which collapsed to pieces instantly. However, Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s body did not stop there, but continued to fly towards the sky. Soon, he turned into a little black dot, and could no longer be seen.

Everyone lost their voice, and simply felt chills all over their body.

A dignified Heavenly Venerate was actually removed by a mere slap?

Heavens, what kind of freakishness did this couple possess!

The Heavenly Venerates Huai Jian, Yellow Spring, and Chi Yan were too shocked to speak. Although each Heavenly Venerate was a top-notch genius of the world, they had to admit that Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was the strongest among them.

But the strongest one had been sent flying with a mere slap from the Empress. What kind of huge gap in strength was this?

So what if they were all Heavenly Venerates—they had all gone numb with shock, and they felt a chill in their limbs.

Ling Han smiled lightly. “It’s okay. I’m just here to watch the fun today, since I’m passing by, to see how some old friends are doing.”

How could Huai Jian and the other great Heavenly Venerates believe this?

At that time, the Foreign Realm had almost wiped out the Celestial Realm. If it weren’t for the numerous occurrences of miracles, the current Celestial Realm would have been swallowed up and fused with the Foreign Realm by now.

Now that the Celestial Realm had produced an incomparable elite, would he let them off the hook?

They quickly sent out a wave of divine sense, summoning more powerful elites, with the intention to besiege the Empress together. After all, this was under the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm, and the stronger she was, the more she would be suppressed by the heaven and earth here.

Sure enough, the Empress’s move had triggered targeted attacks against her by the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm, and heavenly tribulation continued to descend endlessly.

She didn’t care at all. When this kind of attack hit her body, she didn’t even feel much. Furthermore, she wasn’t afraid that the Foreign Realm would cut her off from extracting power, as she hadn’t extracted any power from here at all.

A First Tier Heavenly Venerate was still unable to extract the six fundamental powers of the Genesis World.

It was just that the Empress had also become annoyed with being continuously attacked; wouldn’t anyone else be vexed as well?

Seeing this, Ling Han squeezed the Empress’ hand, and said to the heaven and earth, “If you still don’t retreat, do you want me to cripple you?” He released a raging aura, aimed directly towards the heaven and earth.

Immediately, the lighting and thunder that had obscured the whole sky disappeared without a trace.

F***, the heaven and earth could also be scared away?

Huai Jian and the others felt a chill rise up from their limbs. Even they were unwilling to become enemies of the heaven and earth, as the source of their power was after all the unique power of the Foreign Realm. Once they left this world, they could only be regarded as Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and they would only expend their power whilst not being able to absorb any. Their battle prowess would also drop.

However, as soon as Ling Han shouted, the heavenly tribulation simply retreated. What kind of power was this?

The Empress was already strong enough, but judging from the look of things now, it was clear that Ling Han was even more terrifying.

What had happened to the Celestial Realm to have produced two monsters like this?!

Ling Han spread out his hands. “Now, can we catch up on the past?”

As his words fell, xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu, he saw nine Heavenly Venerates arriving together. Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity and Jing Zhongyue also came back, both looking disheveled. In an instant, there appeared 13 Heavenly Venerates and one Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate in this place.

This kind of lineup was extremely powerful, and it also proved that the Foreign Realm was in its golden era because Ling Han had traveled to many low-level dimensions before, and there were not even this many elites there.

“Does the Celestial Realm want to restart the war?” Heavenly Venerate Yellow Spring asked. Behind him, there was a river of death rushing straight into the heavens. This was his dao, and those who touched it would die.

If Zhou Heng hadn’t stepped forward, the Celestial Realm would have been destroyed. Unexpectedly, after only one epoch, it was the Celestial Realm’s turn to turn around and invade the Foreign Realm?

...

Ling Han shook his head with a smile. “I don’t represent the Celestial Realm… Okay, I won’t be joking around with you guys anymore.”

His structure had gotten bigger, and the grievances of the past had also been swept into a forgotten corner by him. He merely sighed. He neither talked about Hysteria, nor thought about taking these people to the Flaming Frost Realm. After all, the two dimensions had been enemies for generations, and it was unknown how many people had died because of it. Ling Han had yet to become noble enough to repay grievances with kindness.

He sat for a while, and then set off. This was also a warning so that these people would not think that Zhou Heng had long forgotten this place after the passing of one epoch.

…There was still Ling Han.

After Ling Han left, all the great Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm were relatively silent.

Indeed, Zhou Heng’s warning had been already an epoch ago, and he had never reappeared, which caused some Heavenly Venerates to become restless, wanting to restart the war. Fortunately, Ling Han came in time; otherwise, wouldn’t they all be killed if they had really started the war?
