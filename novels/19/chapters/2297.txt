Chapter 2298: Underground River

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

They passed the sword around, and dug one after another. Ling Han wasn’t afraid that they would steal his Divine Demon Sword.

Firstly, he was the most powerful among them. Secondly, the Divine Demon Sword contained his martial intent. One would need to be at least several times more powerful than him if they wanted to erase his martial intent. Otherwise, the Divine Demon Sword would automatically attack them.

Everyone heaped praise onto the Divine Demon Sword. Most of them were of the opinion that this sword was forged from precious metals at the Ninth Lotus. However, they didn’t dare to consider the possibility of this sword being an ancestral weapon.

A Sixth Lotus Five Leaves cultivator possessing an ancestral weapon? Was this a joke?

Half a month passed, and it was coincidentally Ling Han’s turn to do the digging.

Crumble.

There was a crashing sound as the crushed stone fell away from them instead of toward them.

Ling Han faltered for a brief moment before being overcome with delight. This mountain was hollow in the middle, and he had dug into this area.

He slashed several more times with the Divine Demon Sword, carving out a hole that was large enough for a single person to pass. He released his divine sense to scout the area first.

The entire center of the mountain was empty. It was a gigantic cavern, and if Ling Han stepped in from the entrance that he had created, he would plummet into a bottomless abyss. Even if the bottom weren’t filled with blade-like rocks, he would still shatter all of his bones on impact.

After all, the pull of gravity here was far too strong. It was like a blade that rested above everyone’s head.

Ling Han explained the situation to everyone. Upon hearing this, they all became solemn.

Ling Han drew Hu Niu, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou into the Black Tower before entering the cavern, and climbing down the cliff.

In fact, the others wanted to enter Ling Han’s Spatial God Tool as well. However, they were too embarrassed to ask, so they could only descend the cliff by themselves. Moreover, they wouldn’t dare to enter the Spatial God Tool of other people anyway. This was because they wouldn’t understand the

situation outside at all. What if they suddenly wanted to come out to take a look, but they still hadn’t arrived on solid ground yet? Wouldn’t they fall to death?

The trust between them hadn’t reached such a high level yet.

Ling Han descended for a long time. In terms of distance, he had already made it dozens of kilometers below ground. However, the gravity here was far too strong; as a result, the speed of his descent was also extremely low. Otherwise, could he not cover a distance of dozens of kilometers in the blink of

an eye?

This place was pitch-black, and he couldn’t see anything more than one meter away from him. Meanwhile, his divine sense was also affected by the strong gravity, meaning that he couldn’t observe things too far into the distance.

Things were already difficult for him, so it was naturally even more torturous for the others. Fortunately, they had Ling Han to scout and lead the way. Otherwise, their descent would have been even slower. Perhaps it might have even been a dozen times slower.

A feeling of vexation rose in Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s mind. Why was Ling Han only willing to draw Hu Niu and the others into his Spatial God Tool? Why didn’t he even ask her?

The more she thought about this, the more aggrieved she became. In fact, there were already tears brimming in her eyes.

Right at this moment, she suddenly heard Ling Han’s delighted shout. “We’re almost at the bottom!”

Everyone was invigorated upon hearing this. They all stopped climbing to look down.

They had been entirely focused on carefully descending just then, so how could they have had any spare effort to glance down? Thus, only at this moment did they discover the faint light below them.

“We’re finally at the bottom.’

They all breathed a sigh of relief.

After descending for a moment, however, Ling Han suddenly furrowed his brows. This was because he could see the bottom clearly now. It was surprisingly an underground river. The speckles of light from just then had come from some unknown matter in this river.

The river flowed silently. In fact, this was a harrowing silence.

Ling Han explained the situation to the others before coming to a stop. He was still around two meters from the surface of the river.

They all descended to the same height as Ling Han to stand beside him. However, not a single one of them entered the river.

Who knew what the hell the river was filled with. What if it were a potent poison?

Ling Han ignored the others as he retrieved some stone and metal from the Black Tower. He tossed them into the river one after another, observing to see if there were any unexpected reactions.

Splash!

Small ripples appeared in the river as the items splashed down and sank. As they were washed away, nothing strange occurred.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before retrieving a small tree to toss into the river. The Black Tower was massive, so he could place all kinds of things inside.

The small tree was much more buoyant than the other items, so it didn’t sink to the bottom. Instead, it floated on the surface of the river as it flowed away.

Everyone was delighted upon seeing this. “We can travel by boat.”

Even though the Black Tower was massive, it didn’t contain everything, At the very least, there was no ready-made boat.

Moreover, they were hanging on the face of a cliff right now, and they were also fighting against the strong pull of gravity. Thus, it would be inconceivably difficult to construct a ship.

Ling Han simply chose a large tree. He then said, “When I say jump, everyone jump onto the tree.”

Everyone nodded in understanding. They knew that Ling Han was definitely going to toss a large tree into the river.

Peng!

Ling Han waved his hand, and a large tree instantly appeared in the river. The tree was massive, and it could easily be used as a boat.

“Jump!” Ling Han shouted. He immediately jumped down.

The others hurriedly jumped after him. They all landed on the tree.

Strangely enough, however, they couldn’t feel the strong pull of gravity anymore after sitting on the tree. After arriving here, it was as if the Regulations of heaven and earth had undergone some tremendous change.

“Will there be a path to leave this place at the end of this underground river?” someone asked. He was truly terrified of this place. He would rather give up on the secret of the armor than stay here any longer.

“Or perhaps it leads to the center of this land, where all the secrets are contained.”

However, Ling Han knew that this was the resting place of an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King. Perhaps they would witness the corpse of this Ancestral King at the end of this underground river.

He was eager with anticipation. This was because he had received some inspiration from the Rain Emperor. If he absorbed the bones of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he could potentially rely on this to create a ninth divided soul.

The Empress and Hu Niu both possessed the talent to become monarch stars. However, because Source Powers and Celestial King Bones were extremely rare, they could only settle for ascending after cultivating four divided souls.

However, if he obtained the Ancestral King Bones here, it would no longer be a distant dream for them to become monarch stars.

At that time, Ling Han would suppress the Ancestral King Bones even if it meant expending the last wisp of power of the Black Tower.

He let Hu Niu and the others exit the Black Tower. They were temporarily safe.

The “boat” remained stable as it flowed down the river. However, their good fortune didn’t last for long, After traveling for two hours, the currents suddenly became rapid. The large tree shuddered violently, and this caused everyone to tense up. This “boat” wasn’t going to capsize, was it?

Ling Han was just about to draw Hu Niu and the others back into the Black Tower. However, the tip of the large tree suddenly sank before floating back up again. A large wave immediately slapped over. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Whoosh!

The sound of water rushed over.

No one knew what the river water was made of, so they naturally tried to dodge. However, they were terrified to discover that they couldn’t move!

No, it wasn’t that they weren’t moving, Instead, their speed had become unbelievably slow. They could only stare in shock as the wave crashed over.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. It wasn’t that they had become extremely slow. Instead, the flow of time had been affected by something.

The flow of time here had become several times slower than in the outside world. It was because of this that they couldn’t move as they desired.

“Hang on!”

If the flow of time had slowed down for him, why could he detect it?

Logically speaking, if the flow of time was different for him and the outside world, the wave should have struck him before he could even come to his senses. How could he have discovered this?

There was only a single explanation for this. The flow of time had affected his physical body, but not his divine sense.

Slap!

The wave crashed over, drenching everyone on the “boat.” However, it didn’t affect them at all..
