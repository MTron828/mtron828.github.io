2718 Ulterior motives

Lou Tianqian had actually invited Ling Han; just what was he planning?

“It should have something to do with Lin Piaoxue,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded. Otherwise, he really did not have any other connection with Lou Tianqian.

“Are you going?” The Empress looked towards him.

!!

“There’s no harm in going,” Ling Han said smilingly. In the first spatial level, he should be invincible. Even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could not wound him. This was because he would be restricted by the structure of heaven and earth.

The Empress nodded; she naturally knew just exactly how strong Ling Han was right now.

The banquet would be held a day later. On the next day, they did some minor preparations, and then set off towards Lou Tianqian’s manor.

This actually could not be considered a manor. It was only an extremely simple house, but because of the existence of Spatial God Tools, this was no issue. The inside could be done up very extravagantly.

There was a guard at the doors, and would only let people pass after receiving their invitations. Though this person was only at the Ninth Heaven, it was forbidden to cause trouble here.

…If you broke any rules at the martial academy, then even the greatest crime possibly would not make you sentenced with death for the sake of the Heavenly Venerate backing you. You would only be thrown into the Celestial King Graveyard. However, it was different here. If you committed any serious crime, you would be immediately executed.

That was because this was the foremost line of battle. Not even the slightest negligence was permitted here; strict obedience had to be ensured.

Ling Han had no plans to disobey this kind of rule, either. He handed the invitation to the other, and after that person took the invitation, he made a “please” gesture, allowing Ling Han and the Empress to enter.

Ling Han and the Empress entered, and shockingly saw a doorway of light flickering. This clearly was the entrance into the Spatial God Tool.

The couple entered through this doorway, and felt a tremor run through them. They immediately arrived at a new location.

In this place, the sun was hanging high, and the temperature was comfortable. There were fragrant flowers blooming all around, making it look completely different from the barren and inhospitable land that they had come from.

On the grassy ground, there were stone tables of different size and color laid out, looking like mushrooms. However, there was actually a pattern to their arrangement and size. The further in front they were, the larger the table, and the further back, the smaller the table.

The arrangements had surely been made carefully. Only those who were in the upper social circles were worthy of sitting at the large tables, while “nameless pawns” could only sit at the small tables.

Ling Han had not yet sat down when he saw Lou Tianqian walk over with a crowd around him. His expression was filled with pride, and he looked a completely different person than when he had been in front of Lin Piaoxue.

This should be his true face: proud and lofty, considering no one worthy of his notice.

“Where is Celestial Maiden Lin?” Lou Tianqian asked the moment he arrived.

Realization dawned on Ling Han. So this was the reason that Lou Tianqian had invited him? He had an ulterior motive.

Ling Han shook his head. “Firstly, I do not know where Miss Lin is. Secondly, even if I did, why should I tell you?”

Lou Tianqian was taken aback, feeling slight disbelief.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King actually dared talk back to him? Th-th-this, who did this brat think he was?

“How dare you!! You actually dare speak in this manner to Young Master Lou?” Behind Lou Tianqian, a man stepped forwards. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and the clan behind him was inferior to the Lou Clan. Thus, he willingly became his lackey.

The Empress stepped out, demanding menacingly, “And who are you?”

He actually dared to shout at her man?

That man glanced at the Empress, and he involuntarily felt short of breath. Just how many men would not be intoxicated with the Empress’s exquisite beauty? He was completely besotted, but did not expect that the Empress would move. Pa! He was sent flying with a slap delivered through the air.

Lou Tianqian’s expression couldn’t help but change drastically. This person was too arrogant; she actually dared to make a move at his banquet. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But the Empress was enchantingly beautiful, her grace incomparable, so much so that he felt that it was very difficult to even feel angry.

This woman was too beautiful. She was probably comparable to that supreme bloom of legends, the most outstandingly talented young princess of the Lin Clan, Lin Youlian, wasn’t she?

He came back to his wits, and said, “Miss, you have gone too far!”

Fortunately, the person who had made a move was the Empress. If it had been Ling Han, he would definitely not have any reservations, and immediately moved to take him down.

Ling Han chuckled. “What’s the harm in a little spar?” He directly established that this was just a spar. Otherwise, they would have gotten hold of a chink in his armor.

“To have a woman stand up for you, aren’t you embarrassed?” Lou Tianqian asked calmly. He turned around, and said, “Gang Dong, you come and have a spar with this person.”

Even until now, he did not know Ling Han’s name. That was because he did not take Ling Han seriously at all, and in fact couldn’t even pluck up the interest to find out Ling Han’s name. Otherwise, he would definitely know that the person that was standing in front of him right now was the recently very famous Ling Han.

Of course, even if he did know, he would not have any qualms, either. That was because everyone thought that Ling Han had just had a great stroke of luck. If it was up to genuine ability, how could he possibly be a match for a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

A man immediately stepped out. He had a very large, sturdy build, and there was actually a bright golden horn protruding from his head.

The Empress was keen and eager. She had just advanced to the Ninth Heaven, so her fighting spirit was presently soaring.

Without another word, she moved directly.

The single-horned man did not expect that the Empress would not speak of any rules or such and move immediately. He was slightly thrown off balance, but it was only for an instant. Immediately, he regained his footing, and launched a counterattack.

Boom!

The two great elites clashed, instantly creating a terrifying aftermath.

Lou Tianqian moved quickly, suppressing the aftermath. Otherwise, this was just a Spatial God Tool, so how could it sustain the clash between two great Ninth Heaven elites? It would definitely be destroyed immediately.

Thankfully, he was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Otherwise, if he was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he would never be able to make it in time.

Though the Empress had just reached the Ninth Heaven, her battle prowess was very extraordinary. Very quickly, she had taken the initiative, and it was apparent that she had the upper hand.

Lou Tianqian was surprised. He had not expected a delicate beauty like the Empress would actually also have such amazing natural talent in cultivation as well. A hint of admiration flashed through his eyes, but he immediately hid it.

His target was Lin Piaoxue, the noble daughter of the Lin Clan. If he could marry her, it would have extraordinary significance.

WIth such a fight breaking out, it also drew the eyes of a great many people around them, and they all watched as the battle progressed.

They all nodded, stunned by both the Empress’s strength and her exquisite beauty. All of them supported the Empress.

When the fighters came to about 500 moves, the single-horned man had to admit defeat. Otherwise, he would be beaten very badly.

This kind of result had long been expected, but when they saw the single-horned man admit defeat, they couldn’t help but feel surprised.

After reaching the Ninth Heaven, there was basically no one mediocre among them. At the very least, they would have the aptitude of monarch tier, and the Empress had clearly just broken through to the Ninth Heaven, yet possessed such amazing battle prowess. This natural talent in cultivation was too terrifying.

“How should I address you, miss?” Lou Tianqian asked smilingly.

“What business of yours is it what my wife’s name is?” Ling Han retorted, and flicked a sleeve. “How boring. This is a complete waste of time.”

“You are truly arrogant!” A woman stepped out. “You can only have a woman step out for you; how shameless.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “It cannot be helped. I am very lucky; I found such a good wife.”

Hearing these words, the Empress couldn’t help but smile. It was like the melting of an iceberg, beautiful beyond comparison.

Everyone felt their heart throb wildly. This beauty was enough to melt even their souls.

“Hehe, the banquet has just begun, so what need is there to rush?” someone asked smilingly, playing mediator. He had no wish for such a beautiful woman to leave in advance.
