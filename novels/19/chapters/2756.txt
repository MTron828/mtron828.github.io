2757 Son and grandson were beaten

Circumstances prevail over men; Ling Han could kill a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate in another dimension. Such strength was too terrifying.

So, it would be better to follow Ling Han to the Flaming Frost Realm.

They were able to cultivate to the maximum limit in the low-level dimension, so they might not necessarily reach the Seventh Tier in a transcendent dimension, but there shouldn’t be a problem with the Third Tier and Fourth Tier.

Therefore, they conversed with each other very happily.

After the wedding ceremony, Ling Han set off together with An Tayun and the other Second Tier Heavenly Venerates to the Two Realm Battlefield.

The presence of so many Heavenly Venerates naturally alarmed the Promise City Realm. In the first place, they were already one Second Tier Heavenly Venerate less, so they could only rely on the power of the dimension to suppress them.

However, when they heard that An Tayun and the others took the initiative to say that they wanted to make peace, they were all surprised.

This first reaction naturally was that this had to be fake. It was too fake. Their realm really couldn’t last any longer, and its destruction was only a matter of time. Now this was nothing more than delivering a huge gift. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Why was this so?

Ling Han related the matter regarding Hysteria, and invited these Heavenly Venerates to go to the Flaming Frost Realm with him.

He was very blunt, and directly said that if they didn’t accept, then he would join forces with the elites of Martial Crystalline Realm to flatten the Promise City Realm.

This threat indeed carried weight. After all, the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was killed by Ling Han.

After thinking through the matter for a few days, the Promise City Realm agreed to Ling Han’s proposal.

The two realms ceased fighting, and went to the Flaming Frost Realm together.

Ling Han led the way, and everyone set off.

Everyone was bringing their families with them. This Flaming Frost Realm was a transcendent dimension, with endless opportunities, so it was naturally a place suitable for the growth of juniors.

With a group of people transmigrating through the dimensions, and due to the presence of so many Heavenly Venerates, it naturally aroused the vigilance of every dimension. Although most of the elites in these medium-level dimensions had gone to Flaming Frost Realm, there would always be one or two top-notch elites who stayed behind to keep watch.

Ling Han stepped forward to speak, explaining that they didn’t have any malicious intentions; they were just passing through to go to the Flaming Frost Realm.

They passed through smoothly, and transmigrated from one dimension to another. At the same time, Ling Han was paying attention to the mark that he had inscribed to see if there was any response from the Empress.

Although the Empress was also a super genius, there was still a gap when compared to him, especially in terms of comprehending the power of the dimension. Due to the exponential increase in difficulty, the gap in the time it would take for them to master the power of the dimension, might be a hundred fold or even ten thousand fold respectively.

Therefore, counting from the Flaming Frost Realm, in the 99th dimension, Ling Han finally discovered the imprint of the Empress’ divine sense. He proceeded to the core of that dimension, and sure enough, he met the Empress there.

The Empress was waiting for him. She had reached her own limits in cultivation, and couldn’t accommodate any more power of the dimension.

When the two met, they hugged each other excitedly.

An epoch was really too long.

After deliberately stopping over for a few days, Ling Han finally rejoined everyone, and they set off once again.

The battle prowess of the Empress was also very strong. She would be able to completely defeat any First Tier Heavenly Venerate. However, she could not be compared with a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. After all, the power of the dimension which she had mastered was far inferior to that of Ling Han.

This was good enough. Obviously, she was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, but was capable of reigning invincible amongst First Tier Heavenly Venerates.

Everyone set off again, and after hundreds of thousands of years, they finally arrived at the Flaming Frost Realm.

“This is a great place!” As soon as they arrived, all the Heavenly Venerates were deeply moved. The Regulations here were more refined and advanced. After reaching the Ninth Heaven here, the chances of advancing a step further to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would be much higher.

Moreover, the level of heaven and earth here was the highest in the Genesis World. As long as there was a good opportunity and one’s talent was good enough, they could become Third Tier, Fourth Tier, or even Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates. Of course, this was only a theoretical possibility.

They were all secretly happy for their decision; it was right for them to come here.

The group soon arrived at the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. Most of the Heavenly Venerates had to arrange for their descendants and successors to enroll into the Martial Academy before they could be at ease to proceed to the Realm Battlefield.

Many people were actually not qualified to enter the Martial Academy, but it didn’t matter, as the Heavenly Venerates could lead them through the Nine Deaths Formation. It was just that they couldn’t think of entering and exiting by themselves in the future.

There were many such people in the Martial Academy, such as Zhuo Kai and so forth. He was acting arrogant in the Martial Academy just because he had a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate for a father.

With so many Heavenly Venerates arriving all at once, the Martial Academy suddenly became lively. Fortunately, the one keeping watch in the Martial Academy was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, who was capable enough to suppress all these Heavenly Venerates. Who would dare to mess around?

Ling Han didn’t bring Ling Jianxue, Ling Feifan, and the others into the Martial Academy, but intended to let them enter the Nine Deaths Formation by themselves. Otherwise, so what if they entered the Martial Academy? Were they there to become profligate young masters?

Of course, he had full confidence in his son and grandson, and believed that they would be able to pass the test.

True enough, Ling Jianxue and Ling Feifan did not fall short of his expectations. They easily broke through the Nine Deaths Formation; even Chen Shuangshuang could only barely pass through, while An Xiu’er lacked aptitude, and could only rely on Ling Feifan.

The furore caused by the arrival of the Heavenly Venerates subsided quickly. Not long after, they set off to the Realm Battlefield, which was an obligation that they needed to fulfill.

Ling Han didn’t go, as he and the Empress were about to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Bewitching Maiden Rou came back from outside, and smilingly said to Ling Han, “Husband, do you know that most people now think you are dead?”

“How is it that I am now dead?” Ling Han asked.

“There hasn’t been any news about you for more than an epoch. Everyone was saying that you had failed in attempting to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and became a dead person of the past,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said as she pursed her lips and smiled.

Ling Han was stunned for a moment, only to realize that he hadn’t made an appearance for an epoch, so it was normal to be suspected of being dead.

With his freakishness, he should have reached the height of Third Tier or even Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate within hundreds of millions of years, but there had been no news in an epoch, so what else would it be if not him being dead?

Ling Han couldn’t help feeling curious; what had become of Ji Wuming, Huo Furong, and the others? They ought to have already become Heavenly Venerates, it was just unknown what heights they had reached at this point.

He simply inquired, and found out that Ji Wuming and Huo Furong had already left the Martial Academy a long time ago and gone to the Realm Battlefield. Not only them, but also Yi, Yan Xianlu, and the other prodigies from the Celestial Realm had gone there.

After an epoch had passed, they had all reached the Ninth Heaven, and were now fighting bloody battles in the Realm Battlefield in search of opportunities for a breakthrough.

As for what happened to them now, Ling Han had no idea. After all, the Realm Battlefield was too far away, and there were so many prodigies. Even if many of those people had been dead for countless years, no one would know.

It would be better to go to the Realm Battlefield in the future.

Ling Han decided to set off with the Empress to find the core of this dimension so as to complete their last step as Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

However, the two of them hadn’t yet set off for the journey when Chen Shuangshuang came looking for them.

“What’s wrong?” Ling Han asked. His daughter-in-law looked worried, as if she had encountered a huge problem. “Did Jianxue bully you?” he asked with a smile.

Chen Shuangshuang shook her head, but couldn’t help shedding tears. “Both Jianxue and Feifan are injured!”

...

“Hmm?” Ling Han immediately stood up. Well, he was still here, yet someone dared to bully his son and grandson.

He ignored the matter of revenge for the time being, and hurried to the place where both father and son were staying together with Chen Shuangshuang. True enough, both of them were lying down with injuries all over their bodies.

Ling Han observed first, and let out a sigh of relief when he found that while the two of them were seriously injured, their lives were not in danger.

Both of them had the alchemical pills that he had concocted, and upon consuming them in time, not only would their lives be fine, it would also not have any negative impact on their future advancement in cultivation levels.

He breathed a sigh of relief before asking, “What happened?”
