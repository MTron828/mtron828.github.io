“Speaking cheekily in front of me does not have the slightest benefit for you!” Heavenborn threatened menacingly.

“Oh, so what about it?” Ling Han retorted calmly.

“You will find that out!” Heavenborn charged towards Ling Han once more. Again, he was sweeping out with a spear, using it like a staff.

Clang!

Ling Han struck out his sword to parry. The Divine Demon Sword blocked the golden spear, but strangely, this golden spear suddenly became whip-like, flexible and soft. The body of the spear twirled around, shooting rapidly towards Ling Han’s face again.

This was not a Celestial Tool at all, but rather Heavenborn’s own arm, and could be changed as he willed.

“Interesting,” Ling Han said, his left hand balling into a fist, which he shot out in a punch.

Peng! Frightening power reverberated, and Heavenborn was instantly sent backwards.

In their first clash, both of them used their respective methods, and it was hard to determine whose battle prowess was stronger.

“Shatter and destroy!” Heavenborn shouted loudly, his arms turning into paddles that began to rapidly spin. This caused great destruction as the Regulations in the surroundings were already very chaotic in the first place. With this spinning action from him, they instantly shattered completely, and could no longer be extracted.

Heavenborn laughed loudly, his arms once again turning into swords that pierced towards Ling Han.

Without Regulations, all Celestial Kings were trash.

His tactic was simple and rough, but it was extremely effective.

The prodigies beneath them were all watching, and they frowned. This was equivalent to forcefully removing the power of Celestial Kings, and making it a physical battle. How many people would be able to withstand this?

This tactic was extremely simple, but there was no way to counter it.

“That’s unless one’s cultivation level is superior to Heavenborn’s, he could then forcefully extract Regulations from farther away.”

“Or lock Regulations within his body in advance, but in this manner, he can only rapidly and suddenly suppress Heavenborn. Otherwise, as time passes, he would similarly be in a dilemma when Regulations are fully expended.”

“The problem here is that Heavenborn’s physique is comparable to Divine Metal. Who would be able to suppress him in a short period of time?”

“There is no way to deal with this!”

“If Heavenborn reached the Ninth Heaven, then he could be considered invincible among Celestial Kings!”

Everyone shook their head. To penetrate through Heavenborn’s physique’s defenses, one would have to surpass the Ninth Heaven, and this was something that only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could do.

How could Ling Han solve this problem? There was no solution!

Yet Ling Han forged onwards bravely. Slicing out with his sword, boom, he also tore a rip in space, slashing Regulations. This was incredibly terrifying.

‘This…!’

Everyone was stunned. This guy did not draw on Regulations, so why was it that he could still unleash such frightening battle prowess?

Boom! The two fighters exchanged blows again, but it was still hard to determine who was stronger.

“The two of them… both have powerful Body Arts!” someone uttered very ruefully.

Heavenborn was especially surprised. Why was his Body Art so powerful? That was because he was the manifestation of the willpower of the heaven and earth, so it was natural that he had long since come into contact with the fundamental power of the Genesis World. However, due to the limits of his cultivation level, he could not draw on this power at all, but he could use the fundamental power to temper himself.

However, how did Ling Han manage to do it?

“What are you? You are only a manifestation of heaven and earth that possesses some unique abilities. If not for that, you would be mere trash!” Ling Han said disdainfully. Heavenborn’s power had not been gained through hard work, but rather this was the way he had been born.

Heavenborn was just like a spoiled young master who possessed boundless wealth from the very moment he was born. Without any need to work, he would be tens of thousands of times stronger than the average person.

“Today, I will let you know what the difference is between what you are born with, and what you have gained through hard work!” Ling Han shouted furiously. His left hand balled into a fist, delivering a series of punches. Peng, peng, peng! Every single punch was extremely heavy, without the slightest sliver of Regulations of the Great Dao, yet was even more terrifying than being repressed by great dao.

In these tens of thousands of years, Ling Han had not stopped cultivation. He continued to use Void Particle Energy to temper his body, and his Body Art had been steadily improving. Even if he had not reached the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven, he was still extremely powerful.

“You actually dare to show off in front of me!” Heavenborn was unwilling to show weakness. One of his hands took the form of a sword, while the other balled into a fist as he clashed with Ling Han.

This was clearly a deliberate action of his, used as evidence of his superior strength.

“I was born powerful, and this is my advantage. Furthermore, how could the effort that I have put in afterwards be something that you can imagine?” Heavenborn attacked with both sword and fist, his power definitely not the slightest bit weaker than Ling Han’s.

“Humph, your physique is as strong as Divine Metal, and this is your advantage, but at the same time, it is also your strongest weakness. You have never felt the pressure of possible death, so how could you possibly ever comprehend the true meaning of cultivation?” Ling Han sneered.

“Are you looking down on my battle prowess?” Heavenborn roared out furiously.

“Just like trash!” Ling Han laughed loudly, attacking aggressively.

Peng, peng, peng! Sword and fist attacked Heavenborn repeatedly, as if this was proof of his conclusion.

Heavenborn’s expression instantly turned dark. Though his physique was tough, and this kind of attack landing on him was completely nothing to be bothered about, just being hit by Ling Han like this was equivalent to saying that Heavenborn was indeed inferior to the other party in terms of battle prowess.

In a battle at the same tier, his battle prowess was actually outmatched?

“As expected, it is Ling Han who is slightly stronger.” In the skies, A’mu and the other big shots began their commentary.

“Martial intent that is formed under the pressure of imminent death is definitely not something that can be compared with strength that one is naturally born with.” Du Shiyi nodded as well.

“Ling Han… has already created his own path. This is true strength, and the doors to the Heavenly Venerable Tier are already halfway open for him.” Even Can Yue expressed a rare word of admiration for Ling Han.

When one had created his own path, that would only be glimpsing the hope of becoming a Heavenly Venerate because attaining the Heavenly Venerable Tier also needed luck.

For the three of them, they had actually created their own cultivation paths as well, yet were still unable to take that last step, and that was because they lacked an opportunity. This depended on a trigger, and it was possible that they would be able to succeed in the very next instant.

No matter how defiant and reluctant Heavenborn was, he could not deny that Ling Han’s battle prowess was indeed superior to his. He humphed. “So what? My physique is invincible, and what solution do you have for that?”

“I will teach you how to behave properly today!” Ling Han attacked repeatedly. His combat abilities had been nurtured through wandering the boundary between life and death countless times, so how could Heavenborn compare?

Heavenborn had absolutely no problem bullying weaklings. Under his overwhelming power, he would be able to win in a few exchanges. Even if his opponent was capable of matching him, Heavenborn would still win with his advantage in physique. However, faced with an opponent like the current Ling Han, Heavenborn’s weakness was completely exposed. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Peng, peng, peng! Heavenborn was hit repeatedly, being thrashed madly.

“Ah!!” Heavenborn released a shout of fury. Though it was completely impossible for Ling Han’s attacks to wound him, being beaten like this in full public still caused him great humiliation.

Only defeating Ling Han would make up for this.

Heavenborn used a powerful attack. Xiu, xiu, xiu! Multiple rays of golden light shot out from his body, turning into many golden arrows.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and only crossed his arms in front of his face as protection. When the golden arrows swept past him, he was unwounded. He stated evenly, “It is not only you who has an absolute defense!”

“Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll!” Heavenborn forced out through gritted teeth. There was a sliver of spirit from the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable within his body, and he had even snatched the Black Tower, so it was naturally impossible that he would be unaware of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Heavenborn knew the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, but did not cultivate it, because it was useless for him. His original physique had already reached the level of Indestructible Divine Metal Physique, and to attain Indestructible Heavenly Venerate Physique, the resources required were really, really too much. Even after he became a Heavenly Venerate, it would be possible that he could only successfully cultivate it a good many epochs later.

Thus, Heavenborn couldn’t be bothered to waste any more time. This would just be pointless effort.

“Heavenborn, try out this blow from me!” Ling Han took a deep breath, his left hand stretching out levelly. Zi, Five Elements Lightning Technique was unleashed, and five-colored lights danced. Supplemented with white lightning, they immediately became nine-colored divine lightning.

Heavenborn’s expression immediately changed as his heart throbbed intensely.
