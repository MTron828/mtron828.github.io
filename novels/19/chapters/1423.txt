Chapter 1424 The empress, too, can be tender and soft as water

empress luan xing did not make another move. the two great emperors were determined to die, so they did not resist the heavenly tribulation at all. very quickly, they were blasted into ashes. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“humph!” empress luan xing still felt that her anger had not been vented. too bad, the heavenly tribulation had ended, and there was not even scraps left of the two great emperors. she couldn’t even feed them to the dogs.

she looked towards the few remaining heavenly body tiers of the two majestic empires, and moved her hand in a pushing motion. pa, pa, pa, these people were immediately turned into a rain of blood, of course. they did not even have the chance to beg for mercy.

qu qiuxue and the others were all numb with excitement. their ruler was too assertive. she alone was enough to conquer all the elites of the two great majestic empires, showing her invincible might.

“your majesty!”

“your majesty!”

they all knelt, not minding at all that they were on their knees. this was a great goddess, and they had to kneel to her.

yet empress luan xing did not even cast an eye on them. she merely smiled at ling han. “wait for me!”

boom!

she shot up into the skies, and continued to pass through her heavenly tribulation. the tribulation also became more and more powerful. though she was unafraid, she worried that the aftermath would bring disaster to ling han, so she naturally had to endure it in the skies.

actually, ling han’s injuries were already much better. he had the foundations of the indestructible heaven’s scroll, and he only had to channel it through his body, and his recovery rate would be extremely quick.

he stood up, and went to check on the rain emperor. “second brother, how are you doing?”

“i won’t die!” the rain emperor laughed, his whole expression filled with satisfaction. “i will definitely be able to take another step on the path of cultivation after this battle. not too long after, i will be able to step into the middle stage of the consummate level.”

ling han was dumbfounded. his second brother was really too awesome, an absolute prodigy that could use actual battle experience to further improve himself. he could even turn the battles he had experienced into his own enlightenment to support his own rapid improvement.

even if he had not met ling han, and did not have the support of his alchemical pills, his second brother’s achievements would definitely still be extraordinary.

a pearl would shine wherever it was.

“senior xu...” ling han turned to look at xu ran. this man had been bringing an elite in the consummate level of the heavenly body tier to run circles with him, and only now did he finally stop.

a muscle twitched in xu ran’s cheek, and he looked at ling han with a strange expression.

only now did he recall something—why had ling han declared that he would ask empress luan xing to dispel the restrictions on him? it turned out that the two of them were a couple! looking at how ling han was willing to give up his life for the empress, and how the empress’s killing intent soared when she came out of isolation, they were indeed a damned... er, a match made in heaven.

and he had actually worried that ling han’s venture to appeal for him would be ignored, and he instead would be suppressed as well by the empress!

“you, you, you’re awesome!” finally, xu ran still gave him a thumbs up. being capable of plucking a supreme beautiful flower like empress luan xing was indeed a feat worth admiring.

qu qiuxue and the others did not dare approach. they were not qualified.

which of these three did not possess the battle prowess of the consummate level of the heavenly body tier? and the stronger they were, the more they adhered to the rules. the difference of a minor level in the heavenly body tier meant a world of difference.

“let’s clear up the mess.”

“all the heavenly body tiers of the two great majestic empires have practically died, and it should be time for our chaotic stars majestic empire to unite the world under our rule.”

“a hegemony that would last millions and millions of years!”

qu qiuxue and the others were all very excited. who would have thought that the circumstances would make such a sudden reverse just when their nation was about to perish, and now it would be them that would be uniting the world under their reign?

aside from qu qiuxue who stayed back to loyally guard empress luan xing, the two ministers and the five generals all left. there was a gigantic mess left for them to clean up.

half a day later, empress luan xing had finishing passing through the heavenly tribulation, and descended.

“your majesty—”

shua!

qu qiuxue had just spoken when empress luan xing brought ling han to her side with a flutter of her sleeve. she took one step, and she was already very far away. at present, she possessed the battle prowess of the eternal river tier, so how fast exactly was she by now?

“hehe, the couple has some quiet words to speak to each other, so why are you butting in?” xu ran laughed loudly.

qu qiuxue’s eyes swept over him, and said, “a thief should not blabber nonsense.” she obviously knew xu ran’s background. otherwise, how could she possibly dare to be disrespectful to an elite in the consummate level?

the rain emperor merely snickered. in the small world, he had already left behind many descendants, and now his full being was focused on cultivation. he had long since set aside the affairs of the heart. however, as the second brother, he still hoped to see that ling han and empress luan xing’s relationship could come to fruition.

he was an emperor, and in the past, he, too, had many beautiful women in his harem. thus, he naturally did not think there was anything wrong with ling han marrying a few wives.

***

ling han and empress luan xing arrived at a green, hilly region. the empress had ling han in her arms, her expression filled with tenderness.

“er... it should be me embracing you, right?” ling han asked weakly.

“you are wounded,” the empress said, her tone not allowing for any refusal. however, she thought for a moment, and then continued, “when you are recovered, i will allow you to embrace me.”

ling han suddenly felt his heart soar, and almost became a beast and pounced on this exquisite beauty. however, he immediately hissed in pain. he had indeed sustained very severe injuries in this battle. he had completely used up all the indestructible true fluid, and even rising from the ashes had been forced out. in the end, he had really been at the end of his line, and was burning up his own life force to continue fighting.

the present him had shortened his lifespan by at least a few million years!

ling han did not take it to heart, though. firstly, he was too young, and wouldn’t the matter be resolved if he found some great herbs to restore his life force? secondly, he had the confidence he could enter into the celestial realm. by then, his lifespan would be unlimited, so that was even less of a concern.

for the sake of his wife, what could he not give up?

“ouch! ouch!” ling han had not cried out even once when his bones had been shattered, yet was now baring his teeth and hissing in agony. he was pretending to be as pitiful as he possibly could be.

it could be seen with a single glance that this was all fake, but empress luan xing did not mind in the slightest. that was how her personality was. if i liked you, i would not change even if the skies collapsed on us. it was a complete investment, and she did not care at all if she would be wounded in the process.

it was very, very difficult for her to fall in love, but the moment she did, it would be a love that was so blazingly fierce that it could burn herself up.

ling han pushed his advantage, and said, “wife, let me kiss you.”

empress luan xing shook her head. ling han was just feeling disappointed, when she suddenly lowered her head and kissed him lightly. “you’re wounded, so i will kiss you.”

ling han was amused. he stretched out his arms and pretended to show his affection, yet he simply held onto the empress’s tender hands. they were incredibly smooth and delicate, and extremely great to feel.

empress luan xing indulged him, and gripped his large hand back. she asked, “where have you been all these years, and what have you encountered?”

ling han spoke casually, only relating the pleasant affairs, passing over the unpleasant events. however, empress luan xing was both intelligent and stubborn, and had him relate even the smallest details, and some matters caused the empress to fly into a fury.

someone actually dared to bully her beloved?

“what plans do you have next?” ling han questioned.

“naturally, i will go with you to the star sand martial arts academy.” empress luan xing did not even consider the question. “i do not have any eternal river tier-level cultivation technique, and even if i managed to make my way upwards through my own fumbling, my future advancement through the cultivation levels would also become extremely slow.

“furthermore, the reason i had established the chaotic stars majestic empire was so that i could draw on the power of the nation so that the nine great clones could reach the consummate level of the heavenly body tier at the fastest speed possible.”

ling han nodded, and said, “all right then. we will head to the star sand martial arts academy together. however, we still have to clear up this terrible mess.”

“why?” empress luan xing asked curiously.

ling han suddenly felt like he was about to go crazy. this empress was a little too irresponsible, wasn’t she?
