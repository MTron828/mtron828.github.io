Chapter 1186: Divine Fluid

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was very simple why Ling Han wanted to head over to check the mountain out. If he were able to camp under the “eagle beak”, then wouldn’t he be able to easily obtain the Thousand Source True Fluid when it eventually appeared?

However, if it were this simple, why would people still wait at the perimeter of the mountain? If such a tactic worked, they would definitely fight to occupy that spot.

In fact, it was because the eagle mountain was very difficult to climb.

Ling Han immediately realized this upon trying to climb the mountain. Devastating winds lashed around the mountain, and he wasn’t able to withstand them even with his powerful physique. He had only taken a few steps before several gashes appeared on his body. If he stayed on the mountain any longer, he would definitely be stripped down to the bare bones.

If the winds became stronger the higher one climbed, then even his Godly bones would be hacked into pieces. In that case, both his body and soul would be obliterated.

‘Is it truly impossible to climb this mountain?’

There were still a few days until the three-month mark, so Ling Han started to experiment with methods to withstand these winds.

However, he quickly found that the winds did indeed become stronger the higher one climbed. The strength of the winds wasn’t in terms of power, though—if these winds possessed strong power, they would blow people off the mountain.

However, he hadn’t been blown off the mountain, and had instead been viciously cut by the wind.

This signified that these winds were formed from the power of Regulations. Thus, they were extremely fatal even though they only possessed ordinary power.

‘The offensive power of these winds is at least on par with the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Otherwise, they wouldn’t cut into my skin and flesh so easily,’ Ling Han speculated inwardly. However, this was only the foot of the mountain. If the strength of the winds didn’t pick up by too much, he could still climb up the mountain if he channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

‘Forget about it. I’ll just wait at the foot of the mountain. With my battle prowess, it shouldn’t be too hard to obtain a few drops of Thousand Source True Fluid.’

The three of them settled down in a remote location. This way, they could enter the Black Tower with relative ease.

Ling Han cultivated and comprehended alchemy. He would occasionally refine a few cauldrons of Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills as well—these pills were good moneymakers.

Several more days passed, and the people around the mountain started to become restless.

The reason for this was simple. They were about to hit the three-month mark, which meant that intense competitions and battles were about to begin.

After all, even Heavenly Body Tier elites yearned to obtain Thousand Source True Fluid!

If one were able to obtain a drop, they would be able to sell it for an astronomical price.

“Oh, that’s right. Senior, do you have any Thousand Source True Fluid that you could give me?” Ling Han turned to Notionless Saint, who was wrapped around the Reincarnation Tree, and continued, “You’re a Saint, so you’re definitely more impressive than Eternal River Tier elites, right?”

“I’ve already refined my body, so how can I still possess Thousand Source True Fluid?” Notionless Saint humphed, and continued, “Anyhow, Saints can’t produce Thousand Source True Fluid. If their corpses don’t disintegrate, the only thing they’ll produce is saintly insects.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘Sigh... What a useless old man!’

Ling Han sighed in disappointment, which caused Notionless Saint to jump up and down in anger. He, a supreme Saint, was actually being disdained by Ling Han!

Ling Han told Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun to stay put. The imminent battle would be terrifyingly brutal, and perhaps even the king tiers would have to flee if they managed to obtain a drop. Otherwise, they would definitely suffer great losses if they were attacked by the masses.

One had to realize that there were numerous bodyguards here. These people were raised by powerful forces, and they had severed their own cultivation level before ingesting forbidden pills to increase their power. Their battle prowess was infinitely close to the Sun Moon Tier, and they wouldn’t be any weaker than those at the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier.

‘As expected, Gao Huang’s greed is truly insatiable. He actually wanted me to obtain three drops of Thousand Source True Fluid for him! I wonder what’s wrong with his brain. How the hell did he come up with such a condition?’

Ling Han shook his head as these thoughts flashed through his mind. Anyhow, he wouldn’t give a single drop of Thousand Source True Fluid to Gao Huang even if there were 100 or 1000 drops available, or even if he were able to obtain half of the available amount. Not to mention, there were only 10 drops available.

Why did he have to please Gao Huang?

“Look! A drop of Thousand Source True Fluid is forming!” someone shouted as they pointed at the peak of the mountain.

Although this mountain was tall, the people here were all immortals. Their eyesight was brilliant, and thus they could clearly see the drop of liquid that was forming on the “eagle beak” of the mountain. However, it wasn’t big enough yet, so it still hadn’t dripped down from the mountain.

Everyone instantly prepared for battle. Obtaining a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid could save them tens of thousands of years of hard work!

Ling Han didn’t move. The wind on this mountain would often change directions, so who knew where this drop of Thousand Source True Fluid would be blown. It would be foolish to jostle for positions at this moment.

Time slowly crept by. Meanwhile, the drop of liquid also became larger and larger. After an entire day, the bead of liquid finally grew to the size of a thumb. It trembled slightly, then rolled off the stone surface of the mountain and floated toward the ground.

Whoosh!

There was a gust of wind, and the drop of liquid instantly drifted in a completely different direction.

Ling Han made his move.

Peng!

He stamped the ground, and he instantly shot out like a cannon. Those who practiced Body Arts were terrifying because they had explosive speed and explosive power.

Xiu!

He became as quick as lightning.

He was far too powerful right now, and the other cultivators couldn’t block him even if he didn’t attack them. In fact, the shock waves generated by his devastating speed swept everyone around him aside.

This was the power of the pinnacle level; this was the power of nine stars!

Everyone unleashed their abilities at this moment.

Meanwhile, numerous elderly cultivators ingested forbidden pills, causing their power to grow explosively. Their power neared the Sun Moon Tier, and they immediately charged toward the drop of Thousand Source True Fluid.

Even those at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier were like mere ants before such tremendous power. Their bones were instantly shattered upon being struck by the elderly cultivators.

However, no one paid any attention to them. The Thousand Source True Fluid was before their eyes, so who would give a toss about others? Anyhow, weren’t they all here for the Thousand Source True Fluid? Thus, whoever was standing here was regarded as a competitor anyway. That being the case, there was no one to blame if one were sent flying or even had their bones crushed.

When cultivators fought over treasures, blood and death were always involved.

Ling Han was already very kind in that he wasn’t killing others wantonly. He controlled his power carefully and merely pushed the others aside. Compared to him, those who had severed their cultivation and now ingested forbidden pills were far, far crueler. They didn’t bat an eyelid as they crushed others to death.

By severing their own cultivation, they had effectively severed their own lifespan. Although their clans and sects would definitely compensate them, there was simply no way they could maintain a positive mental state.

Thus, some of them would purposefully kill in order to vent their frustration and anger on others.

In any case, the Thousand Source True Fluid had already fallen to the foot of the mountain. It landed closest to a gray-robed elder, who laughed loudly, and said, “This drop of Thousand Source True Fluid is mine! You people can wait for another day!”

He reached over to grab the Thousand Source True Fluid. He would immediately flee into the distance once he obtained it, and he definitely wouldn’t linger around this area.

The alchemical pills were only effective for a limited amount of time, and his current power could only be maintained for a maximum of half a month. Moreover, since this was a forbidden pill, it obviously had severely detrimental effects on one’s body. Ingesting one every 100 years was the absolute limit. If two were taken within 100 years... that would be suicide.

Xiu!

A streak of light flashed over, as quick as lightning.

This was none other than the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

The gray-robed elder had no choice but to stop and block the attack. However, this arrow was extremely powerful, and the elder was instantly pushed to the side, causing him to deviate from the divine fluid.

“Damn it!” The elder stomped his feet into the ground with overwhelming power to stabilize himself, and he reached toward the Thousand Source Divine Fluid again.

However, this brief delay allowed several other elites to arrive. They all reached out to fight for the divine fluid.
