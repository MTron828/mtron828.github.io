Chapter 1083: Quashing the Rebellion

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han had returned, and he was incredibly powerful!

The members of the five sects had already developed a fear of Ling Han, and they could only tremble in fear upon seeing him appear. Now that Situ Jian had been killed, they felt an ominous chill shoot through their bodies. All they wanted to do was turn around and flee.

“Ling Han!” The Sword King stepped forward. Although he was relatively young in the five sects, his strength was quite outstanding. Sword cultivators were renowned for their powerful attacks, and his battle prowess could definitely rank in the top 10 or even top five of the five sects.

Pa!

Ling Han swung his fist as he dashed over, and the head of the Sword King was also smashed into pulp.

Gasp!

Ling Han had killed someone at the slightest of provocations. How ruthless!

“Ling Han, you’ve gone too far! You have to realize that there are Sun Moon Tier elites at our ancestral grounds!” the Severing Heaven Saber roared.

Pa!

His head was obliterated just as he finished speaking.

Ling Han had killed three people in a row, each of them with a single punch. There had been no hesitation, and there had been no mercy. What kind of resolution and killing intent was this?

The members of the five sects were all shaken to the core. None of them had seen how Situ Jian and the two others had been killed. They had merely seen a flash, and then the elites had died one after another. If they became the target, there was no way they would be able to block or escape, either.

‘How terrifying!’

Zhang Mo and the others of the younger generation all trembled in terror. It had only been two years, yet what kind of terrifying level had Ling Han advanced to?

“W-what cultivation level are you at?” the Azure Phoenix Divine Empress asked, a bitter expression on her face.

“Heh, my improvements have only been minimal. I feel ashamed to tell you guys.” Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’m at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier. I’ve only just broken through to its early stage.”

Pu!

The rebels all spluttered and choked. ‘You’re showing off, you’re definitely showing off!’

He had only opened the sky two years ago, and everyone had started off from the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier. However, the members of the five sects had cultivation techniques from the Immortal Realm, and it was because of this that 37 people had been able to advance to the Immortal level.

But Ling Han?

He genuinely had no background, and had even been taken away as a hostage. ‘Are you sure you were a hostage and not some elite’s son-in-law?’

“Run!” It was unclear who cried out, but all of the rebels instantly turned around to flee.

The members of the five sects were far too familiar with the might of Immortal level elites. They even more so knew that there existed a massive gulf in power between each sub-minor level of the Immortal levels. Thus, one-star geniuses were already outstanding prodigies! However, Ling Han had actually reached the high extreme, so he definitely possessed a crushing advantage over them. Even 370 of them would be annihilated by Ling Han, much less a mere 37.

What was the point of fighting? They would definitely be killed if they stayed and fought.

“Die!” The morale of the Great Ling Empire couldn’t be any stronger as they charged toward the rebels. The Rain Emperor and the other Immortal level elites were especially fervent as they had just advanced into the Immortal level. They were itching to try their hands out.

“Run!” The Azure Phoenix Divine Empress unfurled her wings as she grabbed onto Dong Ling’er. She and Dong Ling’er both possessed unique bloodlines that allowed them to fly after reaching the Mountain River Tier. This gave them a huge advantage over others at the same cultivation level.

The Rain Emperor swung his fist toward them. Although the Azure Phoenix Divine Empress was a bit disheveled after barely managing to block it, she was still able to soar into the sky.

Who could stop them from leaving now that they were in the sky?

“Ling Han, just you wait! You’re dead meat once I find my way to the ancestral grounds of the five sects!” the Azure Phoenix Divine Empress shouted. She knew that the 30 or so Immortal level elites were no match for someone at the high extreme. This wasn’t a battle; this was a one-sided massacre!

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I had planned to spare you as a favor to her, yet you insist on seeking death!” He used his body like a bow as he notched the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

Xiu!

The arrow transformed into a streak of light as it whizzed through the air.

What cultivation level did he possess right now?

Even if he didn’t use a real bow, and even if he didn’t use the Ultimate Arrow, the might of his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow could still reach five stars!

How could a mere cultivator at the early stage of the low extreme block a battle prowess at the middle stage of the consummate level?

Pu!

The Azure Phoenix Divine Empress and Dong Ling’er both cried out in agony as the arrow pierced through their hearts. The life instantly drained from master’s and disciple’s eyes, and the color instantly drained from their faces as they plummeted to the ground.

Ling Han didn’t pity them in the least. Since they were enemies, what did it matter whether they were men or women?

With him and the Asura Demon Emperor present, the five sects’ advantage in numbers didn’t count at all. They still couldn’t escape the fate of being massacred. Moreover, although the Rain Emperor and the others had only just broken through, they had been able to comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree. Which of them hadn’t experienced decades of comprehension?

Moreover, they had received plenty of resources from Ling Han, with all of them reaching an almost perfect level at the Shattering Void Tier. Even Murong Qing had a battle prowess of four stars, and the Rain Emperor more so had a battle prowess of five stars!

In fact, Ling Han didn’t even need to act. Just his three brothers alone would be able to defeat all of the rebels.

In only an hour, all of the elites of the five sects had already been killed.

Of course, the cultivators at the Shattering Void Tier had also followed the Immortal level elites over. They were also ruthlessly killed.

“Please spare us, Your Majesty!” The remaining rebels all dropped to their knees and begged for their lives. Their cultivation level was too low, with none of them having reached the Shattering Void Tier yet. They were utterly insignificant in this kind of battle, and just a small shred of power could flatten all of them to the ground.

Who would’ve thought that Ling Han would actually appear at this time? Who would’ve thought that he’d be as powerful as a deity?!

This reminded them of when Ling Han had opened the sky. He had born the weight of the sky as he shattered the heavens, appearing extremely mighty and divine.

They had actually tried to rebel against such a person?

F*ck! Had they gone retarded?!

“Seize them! Take them out the gates and behead them!” Ling Han ordered coldly. There were some lines that couldn’t be crossed. Otherwise, how would he rule the empire, and how would he control the populace?

A thought flashed through his mind, and the cultivation of all the rebels was crippled. The imperial guards rushed over and seized the rebels, purposefully punching and kicking them as they did so.

Of course these imperial guards hated the rebels. Ling Han had done so much for the Lower Realm, yet these people actually used the opportunity while he was a hostage to launch a rebellion!

F*ck! They genuinely wanted to kill these animals now!

Ling Han announced his return through the totem. Taking this opportunity, he also explained the events of the rebellion. His voice boomed through every corner of the Great Ling Empire.

“Long live the emperor!”

“His Majesty has returned!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone whooped in joy. Ordinary people were all realists—they didn’t care who was the emperor as long as their lives were peaceful and plentiful. As long as these were satisfied, the emperor was a good emperor.

Ling Han had saved them from the fate of being refined into a Realm Pill; he had saved their lives. He had also taken them into the Immortal Realm, where Spiritual Qi was rich. Although not everyone could cultivate, the environment here meant that they wouldn’t fall sick, allowing their lifespan to extend by many years. Living to 100 years old was no problem at all. This was a massive favor!

Who wouldn’t respect such a good emperor?

Yet there were actually heartless animals who desired to usurp him! F*ck!

Countless people brought eggs, apples, and oranges to witness the executions outside the palace gates. They were going to smash the rebels’ faces with rotten eggs and fruits, causing them to stink even in their graves.

Ling Han invited Yue Kai Yu, Qian Wu Yong, Hu Fengyue, and his other old friends into the Imperial Palace. He hadn’t wanted to reveal that he had returned before, so he hadn’t reunited with these old friends. Now that the survivors of the five sects had been dealt with, he naturally had to reunite with these people.

Ling Han started to hand out large amounts of alchemical pills again.
