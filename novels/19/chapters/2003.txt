Chapter 2004: Selling stones

“Who knows how big the gap is between myself and Ji Wuming,” Ling Han said.

He did not believe that Ji Wuming, too, would be able to obtain natural purple grade Yang Soul Stones, and even if the other party had used a fused purple Yang Soul Stone to break through, the gap in strength between him and Ling Han would still shrink.

But would Ling Han be able to catch up?

Ling Han did not know, either. The reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King was really too awesome, and who knew what kind of terrifying celestial techniques Ji Wuming possessed.

“Then, just battle!” Ling Han’s eyes shone blazingly, his fighting spirit soaring.

They searched around in the canyon for a few more months, but did not find more purple grade Yang Soul Stones, though they did find a considerable number of indigo ones.

“Let’s go and make a sale.”

The four women returned once more into the Black Tower, and Ling Han broke through the invisible wall with the Divine Demon Sword. Exiting through the waters, he floated towards the surface of the ocean.

After breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier, his physique had again improved further, and with the improvement in his own strength, even the water pressure at the ocean bed could not pose much of a threat to him. Furthermore, because he had broken through in this ocean, the heaven and earth would not deliberately target him.

Otherwise, a Dividing Soul Tier would definitely die if they dared to enter into this space.

Ling Han released the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul. The two exchanged a smile, and the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul quickly left. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Naturally, it was to go and sell Yang Soul Stones.

Ling Han released the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou from the Black Tower. Actually, only Bewitching Maiden Rou was slightly inferior. The Empress and Hu Niu were already capable of bearing the water pressure at the ocean bed.

As they traveled, they continued to kill marine creatures on the way. In any case, after the Yang Soul Ocean closed, all the living creatures here would die, so it would be better for them to contribute something for them instead.

“Yi, someone’s ahead.” Ling Han’s eyes were sharp, and he discovered that there was presently a person battling fiercely with a marine creature.

The four of them swam forwards.

Shi Du was a king tier, and he was an unmatched prodigy in his own territory, but after coming into the Yang Soul Ocean, he discovered that king tiers were everywhere, and there was no small number of emperor tiers. Monarch tiers were noble and highly placed, and could only be looked up to.

He withdrew all the arrogance that he had once had, and obediently began battling in this ocean, hunting marine creatures and fusing Yang Soul Stones. His target was very simple, and that was a blue grade Yang Soul Stone.

At first, this could not possibly be realized, but who asked the Yang Soul Ocean to be open for such an extraordinarily long period of time this time. He had close to 800 years to hunt. Then, he could fuse all the Yang Soul Stones he had obtained, and the possibility of him gaining a blue grade Yang Soul Stone would not be too low by then.

However, the bullfight fish that he had encountered this time was really hard to kill. Its strength was in no way inferior to his. If it were not for the fact that it was a little weak in the IQ department, he actually would not want to drag out the battle. It was too dangerous, and there would be a possibility of him sustaining serious injury, or even dying.

Boom, the bullfight fish rushed forwards, and crashed towards him with a frightening might. Brilliant seals shone upon its two sharp horns, causing the might of this charge to become incredibly terrifying.

Shi Du hurriedly boosted all his concentration. The might of this charge was extremely strong, and he definitely could not underestimate it.

He shot out a punch towards that bullfight fish.

‘Hmm?’

Suddenly, he stilled because at the very instant the bullfight fish was about to crash into him, it suddenly did not move.

Peng, peng, peng. HIs fists pummeled the bullfight fish’s body like a furious shower, smashing the head of the bullfight fish into mush.

What was going on?

Why was this bullfight fish not resisting? Was it deliberately seeking death?

Just when he was confused, he saw that this bullfight fish actually moved.

“F***, it’s come back to life!”

Shi Du was surprised, and then his eyes bulged.

...This bullfight fish was not moving on its own volition, but had rather been raised by someone.

That was a young man, and he directed a smile at Shi Du. “Brother, you want any Yang Soul Stones?”

Shi Du would never forget this scene in his life. When he thought about this again afterwards, he felt that there was no difference between him and an idiot at that time, as he could only stare blankly at the man in front of him, having completely no idea what he should say.

“Oh, you don’t? Then I’ll ask someone else.” Ling Han casually tossed the bullfight fish to one side. This was only a peak-stage fourth severance marine creature. He could not even be bothered about the Yang Soul Stone that it had nurtured. Even if he used it as fusion material, it would completely be a waste of time.

“Wait!” Shi Du did not know why he had spoken up. With a sliver of hope, he asked, “Are you selling Yang Soul Stones? What grade is it?”

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “That would depend on what price you can offer.”

With a wave of his right hand, a pile of Yang Soul Stones suddenly appeared in front of him. There were all kinds of grades, from green all the way to indigo.

Shi Du immediately stared dumbly at this sight.

Blue grade Yang Soul Stone was his ultimate target, but the other party had actually taken out indigo grade Yang Soul Stones, causing his heart to throb wildly.

His first reaction was to snatch it for himself, yet his heart suddenly clenched.

Even gathering yellow grade Yang Soul Stones was very difficult for him, but the other man could actually hunt indigo grade marine creatures, so what kind of strength did he have?

Snatching was completely a suicidal action.

He swallowed, suppressed his greed, and said, “I would like to buy this indigo one. How many Star Stones is it?”

“Not much. 10,000,000 is enough,” Ling Han said smilingly. “Additionally, if you don’t have enough Star Stones, you may use Godly metal or Pseudo-Divine Metal to make up for the difference. As long as I’m satisfied, this Yang Soul Stone will belong to you.”

“I-I’ll look!” Shi Du hurriedly exclaimed.

10,000,000 Star Stones naturally was an astronomical sum, but as long as he was alive, he would always be able to earn it back, but if he were to miss out on an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, then there would definitely be no next time.

He was presently a king tier. If he could break through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, this could not allow him to advance to become an emperor tier, yet it would be enough to increase his ranking among king tiers greatly.

Searching all over, Shi Du could only gather more than 6,000,000 Star Stones, and added with Godly metal, Pseudo-Divine Metal, some alchemical pills, Pseudo-Celestial medicines, that was only worth around 8,000,000.

He looked miserably at Ling Han, his eyes filled with stars, just looking at him anxiously.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Fine, I’ll sell it to you cheap.”

“Thank you, thank you!” Shi Du hurriedly expressed his thanks, feeling that Ling Han was the kindest man in this world.

Ling Han was unconcerned. In any case, he could not bring the Yang Soul Stones out of this place, and it would be a waste for him to keep them too. As long as he could sell them, it was good news.

He stowed away all of Shi Du’s wealth, and then stood up and left with the three women.

A few days later, they encountered people again.

This time, it was not just one, but a small team formed of seven people, and they were currently besieging a marine creature that had reached the fourth severance’s peak stage.

Ling Han broke into a smile. Now, he could sell some more.

Xiu, with a single step, he had crossed the distance, and directly killed that marine creature. Then, he asked, “Everyone, do you want Yang Soul Stones?”

Instantly, everyone was dumbfounded, and could only stare stupidly at this person in front of them. It was as if they had encountered the most inconceivable thing that could happen in this world.

“Yes!” someone exclaimed.

Ling Han nodded, and smilingly said, “Clever choice!”

“Hey, you don’t even know who he is, so how could you dare to just reply to him?” a companion rebuked softly.

“Are you stupid? That is Ling Han, the Ling Han that has once fought Yi to a tie!”

“What, he is Ling Han!”

With these words, all seven of them looked at Ling Han with gazes of admiration like they were admiring an ultimate god.

Ling Han was not concerned with that. With a wave of his right hand, he spread out a great amount of Yang Soul Stones, and said, “Everyone, please choose as you will. I guarantee that every Yang Soul Stone is true and genuine, cheating neither old nor young.”

Instantly, the group of seven all stared fixedly, no longer capable of removing their eyes from those Yang Soul Stones.
