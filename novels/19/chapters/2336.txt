Chapter 2337 Who’s the Strongest Monarch Star?

Qi Shuang and Yuan were about to explode in rage. They had only set the goal of guaranteeing the top 200 and fighting for the top 100 out of exasperation. This was because of You Yuan’s death. Otherwise, if they had a choice, would they not want their team to break into the top 50 or even higher?

Now, with Ling Han’s impressive showing, it was clear that he could have brought the Hundred Battles Academy into the top 10. However, he immediately gave up after winning just a single battle. How could they not be enraged?

If he had been incompetent, then he should have acted incompetently the entire time. However, he had clearly given them a glimmer of hope, yet he had immediately bonked them on the head with a huge club. This truly left them feeling dazed and sorry.

The two of them continued to ramble, yet Ling Han directly entered his room, not sparing them any attention.

The Thousand Academy Tournament continued. Each day, more and more academies would be eliminated. At the same time, there were also academies that continued to charge forward, soaring toward a higher rank.

During this process, several prodigies also rose above all others.

Xu Xing, Jing Zhongyue, and Xue Ge!

No one could have imagined that the challengers to Huai Jian’s throne of dominance weren’t the top 10 elites from the previous tournament. Instead, they were new elites who had suddenly risen during this tournament.

In the end, the teams led by Huai Jian, Xu Xing, Jing Zhongyue, and Xue Ge successfully charged into the top four.

“If all goes smoothly, the Eternal Dragon Academy should emerge victorious again,” everyone said in speculation.

The first battle was the Eternal Dragon Academy versus the Three Manifest Academy.

Ling Han especially headed over to spectate this battle. Up until now, he still hadn’t seen Huai Jian’s true appearance. He had only heard others talking about his handsome and elegant nature, as well as how prodigious and blessed by the heavens he was. In other words, this was a man who was covered in countless halos of glory.

The competition began, and the two teams entered the arena.

Everyone’s gazes were instantly drawn to two people. As for the others? Such ordinary people naturally couldn’t attract any attention.

Huai Jian! Xu Xing!

Ling Han had already seen Xu Xing before. Thus, he focused his attention on Huai Jian.

He was a tall and slender man from the Angel Race. Just like all other angels, he was as handsome as could be, and he more so possessed an aura of astonishing charisma. Standing there, he was like the center of heaven and earth. People could only gaze up at him; surpassing him was nothing more than an impossible dream.

His expression was modest, and he even wore an amiable smile. However, there was still an air of authority about him. He was like the sun in the sky, wherein others could only serve as his foil. Before his brilliance, they would lose all of their luster.

However, Xu Xing was truly extraordinary as well. Standing opposite Huai Jian, he was radiating with the wild aura of a ferocious and bloodthirsty beast. No one could bring him to submission.

“Xu Xing is truly very powerful!”

“Indeed, he can rival Huai Jian’s aura. It’s almost impossible to find another person like him.”

“Even if he’s weaker, the gap between them won’t be too large.”

Everyone spoke with emotion. They were overjoyed. The stronger the younger generation, the more prosperous the future of their realm.

The two teams were already engaged in a ferocious battle, with the soldiers fighting against the soldiers and the generals fighting against the generals. No one ran over to interfere with the battle between Huai Jian and Xu Xing. In any case, they didn’t have the right to.

Xu Xing stood opposite Huai Jian, and neither of them moved to attack the other. However, their gazes were as intense as blades as they looked at each other, and the aura surrounding them was so terrifying that no one dared to near them. If they approached, they would be ruthlessly crushed to smithereens.

Whoosh!

Xu Xing moved first, dashing forward as he threw an explosive punch.

He was truly powerful beyond belief. His punch transformed into nine black holes that were capable of engulfing all matter.

Huai Jian moved his hands, forming a ring that materialized the cycle of life and death.

“Six Samsara Realms!” he roared. The ring continued to expand, and it was as if the entire heaven and earth were subject to the control of this ring. Meanwhile, Huai Jian stood in the center of the ring, proud and mighty like the ruler of the world.

Boom!

The nine black holes collided with the Six Samsara Realms. Violent explosions tore through the void, causing devastating bursts of energy to surge into the surroundings. Symbols were also shredded, transforming into a sea of energy.

The shock waves subsided, and everyone was shocked by what they saw. This was because neither Xu Xing nor Huai Jian had suffered a disadvantage during this exchange.

This was simply astounding. Xu Xing could genuinely rival Huai Jian!

“To be regarded as the number one monarch star… Sure enough, you’re quite extraordinary,” Xu Xing said. His eyes were gleaming, and he continued, “However, your glory and achievements will be nothing more than passing clouds and mists. I, Xu Xing, am the strongest monarch star. No one can equal me!”

Huai Jian simply replied with a faint smile. It was as if Xu Xing was nothing more than a disobedient brat in his eyes. There was no need to waste his breath on him.

“P*ss off from the throne!” Xu Xing roared. He instantly launched another attack, his movements as quick as lightning.

Huai Jian responded with calm and composure, with his two hands forming yin and yang as he materialized life and death. Only when one’s comprehension of Regulations reached a supreme level could they channel such power.

Regulations would also experience life and death, so it was to follow that Regulations weren’t the most supreme power in the world. They were simply one form of embodiment of heaven and earth’s magnificent power.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two powerful monarch stars exchanged blows, with each exchange stunning the spectators. Even the monarch stars at the Eleventh Leaf of the Eighth Lotus were dazed and astonished by what they witnessed. Their cultivation level was clearly the same, and they were also mighty monarch stars, so why was the gulf between them so great?

Meanwhile, Ling Han was also relishing this spectacle. This was indeed a battle between the strongest monarch stars. He was greatly inspired, and he even felt a strong urge to leap onto the arena himself. He wanted to battle to his heart’s content.

‘Who’s going to win?’

This was the thought in everyone’s mind.

In the beginning, the answer should have been obvious. Huai Jian was supreme among all monarch stars, with his position firm and indomitable. To even near his lofty height was but an impossible dream for all other prodigies. This was to say nothing of surpassing him. However, upon witnessing Xu Xing’s ferocity, their minds started to waver.

Perhaps… Xu Xing could truly bring with him a new age? An age where he stood invincible?

However, this battle was forcefully brought to a halt.

This was because the remaining members from the Three Manifest Academy apart from Xu Xing had all been defeated. They were unable to fight anymore. Moreover, the battle had already dragged on for one day and one night. According to the rules, when a battle exceeded one day, the team with the most remaining members would be awarded victory.

Thus, it was without a doubt that the Eternal Dragon Academy had won.

Everyone felt sympathetic toward the Three Manifest Academy. They more so felt sympathy for Xu Xing.

Xu Xing couldn’t be blamed for this defeat Instead, it was his teammates who had let him down. However, the academy rankings were only to win glory for the academies. It was the person who topped the Elite Leaderboard who would win the greatest individual glory.

Xu Xing still had a chance.

The following battle was between the Purple Flutter Academy and the Eastern Progressive Academy. At the same time, it was a battle between Jing Zhongyue and Xue Ge.

In the end, the result was identical to the previous battle. After battling for one day and one night, it was impossible to determine the victor between Jing Zhongyue and Xue Ge. However, because the Purple Flutter Academy was more powerful overall, they achieved victory thanks to having more remaining members. They advanced to the finals.

Three days later, the final battle commenced. Huai Jian battled against Jing Zhongyue, with both angels unleashing their glorious strength. Neither was weaker than the other. The spectating elites couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. They were witnessing the arrival of a prosperous golden age for cultivation.

Huai Jian and Jing Zhongyue couldn’t be separated, but the others naturally could. After battling for one day and one night, the Eternal Dragon Academy once again achieved victory thanks to the rules of the tournament. They were crowned victors once again.

Afterward, it was time for the ranking battles for the Elite Leaderboard.

Xu Xing, Jing Zhongyue, and Xue Ge had already risen above all others. Their renown was no lesser than Huai Jian’s. They were all potential candidates to be crowned number one on the Elite Leaderboard. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
