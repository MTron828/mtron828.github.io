Chapter 1763: Insta-kill a third severance

Han Hongfei had left.

He had not left willingly, but had rather been forced into leaving by the elites of the Black Moon Sect.

There was no helping it. This was the territory of the Black Moon Sect, and what had you, a Yang Soul elite, come for? To strut around and show off? Even if an Immortal Palace Tier elite from the Han Clan had come, which the Black Moon Sect could not deal with, didn’t they still have the Fu Clan behind them?

Since the Ding Clan did not have elites on the level of Dividing Soul Tier, whom did Ling Han have to fear?

He and the Empress went to the Ding Clan once again.

“Th-the demon’s here!” When they saw Ling Han, the guards at the entrance all screamed shrilly in their fear. They did not even bother with their job of guards anymore, and hurriedly turned around and fled, yelling sharply as they went.

Ling Han stroked his chin; was he really that frightening?

“Evil brat, have you come to accept your death?” Ding Shan and Ding Song appeared at the same time. In these few days, Ding Shan had also returned from the Black Moon Sect.

“Evil brat?” Ling Han chuckled. “You guys have refined such an evil object like the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, so who exactly is evil here?”

“We have several tens of thousands of clansmen in our Ding Clan, yet more than half of them have been slaughtered at your hand, so if not you, who is the great evil here?” Ding Shan stated menacingly. No matter what, he could not have imagined that a brat that had just advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier would actually bring such a terrifying calamity to his clan.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and he retorted, “Everyone says advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier is severing one’s mortal bonds, but as I see it, what all of you have severed is your conscience!”

“How dare you!!” Ding Shan roared in fury. He charged out, shooting out a fist, and it seemed as if the heaven and earth itself was about to collapse.

Ling Han stood with his arms crossed behind his back, neither moving nor evading, neither parrying nor blocking.

“You’re courting death!!” Ding Shan was so furious even his beard was trembling. He was a third severance elite, and Ling Han actually dared not to move or evade? That was really too arrogant.

But that would be good too. ‘You dare to confront me head-on, and that is a move to court your own death!’

At the side, Ding Song also revealed a cold smirk. This brat was really puffed up with conceit; did he think that he could match even a third severance?

Ding Shan arrived, his entire body wrapped in the power of Time. Regulations had taken the form of chains. Jiang, jiang, jiang, the multiple chains suddenly shot out, making it seem as if his whole person had become a porcupine. He stretched his arms wide to wrap them around Ling Han, wanting to use these Chains of Regulations to pierce directly through Ling Han, giving him an endless agony.

...If Ling Han was allowed to die easily, that would really be letting off this evil brat too lightly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yo, so enthusiastic!” Ling Han chuckled, but his tone immediately turned cold in the next instant. “Unfortunately, I cannot afford to take this kind of deranged, demented embrace from you!”

“Hopefully, you can still be this arrogant later on!” Ding Shan had already pounced on him.

Ling Han moved, his right hand grabbing directly into the power of Time. He, too, channeled the Tide of the Ages, and the two Regulations canceled each other out. Suddenly, a river of time appeared, and some previous memories of their lives could be seen in it, but they were all vague and obscure, and could not be grasped at all.

Ding Shan’s expression immediately became incredibly dramatic because he saw a giant hand that could not be halted reaching out towards his head. It was as if it could not be touched by any technique, and also seemed as if it itself was a manifestation of Regulations, and was thus capable of being so absolutely unrestrained.

He almost died in shock, and hurriedly screeched to a forceful halt, wanting to leap backwards in retreat.

“You think you can escape?” Ling Han smirked coldly. Pa, his palm descended, and grabbed Ding Shan’s forehead.

This position was really too humiliating. A great third severance grand elder, a being with a limitless lifespan, actually had his head held by another. If this spread out, how would Ding Shan have the face to see others in future?

He quickly began to struggle, waving both his arms, kicking his legs madly, and shooting out multiple attacks of power of Regulation, wanting to force Ling Han to release him.

Ling Han gave a cold humph, and with a shake of his right hand, pa, pa, pa, the sounds of bones breaking rang out repeatedly. Ding Shan was like a snake that had been gripped by its weak point[1]. Instantly, all the bones in his body had been shattered. Then, his limbs drooped weakly, no longer having any ability to fight back.

At the sidelines, Ding Song felt a chill seeping from beneath the soles of his feet and directly spreading throughout his whole body.

A third severance grand elder did not even have the slightest ability to resist in front of Ling Han!

This was something that only a fourth severance grand elder could accomplish!

‘My gods!’

“S-second severance!” Ding Song finally managed to see through Ling Han’s cultivation level, or rather, he had finally noticed. Even his lips were trembling.

This was unimaginable.

He had clearly just advanced into the first severance, and only a few days had passed since then, and he was already in the second severance?

Monster, an absolute monster!

How did their Ding Clan become enemies with this kind of monster?

At this moment, Ding Song finally felt regret. Why had they coveted the Hu Clan’s celestial technique, which eventually led to the Hu Clan being completely wiped out all those years ago? What he regretted even further was why hadn’t they made sure that the Hu Clan was completely eliminated? And the consequence was that so many years after the event, a monster the likes of Ling Han had emerged in vengeance.

“Let him go!” Though he was covered completely in cold sweat, he still forced himself to look calm.

Ling Han shook his head, and asked with a grin, “Are you an idiot?”

Ding Song also knew that Ling Han would not let him go, but what other words did he have to say?

“Let him go, and all your grudges with the Ding Clan... will be cleared from now onwards!” he forced out through gritted teeth.

When he said these words, his heart felt suffocated and filled with fury, but what else could he do? Even a Yang Soul elite could only watch helplessly as Ling Han escaped, and this brat’s rate of advancement was so exaggerating. If they didn’t clear their debts, the Ding Clan would really be finished.

As long as it did not involve another three-star force or two-star force, the Fu Clan and the Black Moon Sect would not care about the survival of Dark Moon City’s factions, because no matter how much they fought amongst themselves, Dark Moon City would still be under the rule of the Fu Clan and the Black Moon Sect.

Thus, the Ding Clan could not possibly ask for protection from the Black Moon Sect and the Fu Clan.

A third severance grand elder had been produced through the expenditure of who knew how many resources, and a considerable number of first severance grand elders of the Ding Clan had already died. They really couldn’t afford further loss.

“Cleared?” Ling Han broke into surprised laughter in spite of himself. These people of the Ding Clan were really living in their own world. Could it be that they thought that they were the true victims in this matter?

The Hu Clan had been wiped out, and it was to be considered cleared just like that? He had been targeted repeatedly by the Ding Clan, and it was to be cleared like that? The Ding Clan had refined such an evil object like the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, and they wanted this to be cleared?

‘Cleared your sister!’

Ling Han laughed loudly, both hands gripping Ding Shan’s head, then with a twist, ka, the sound of bones cracking as crisp as frying beans resounded. Then, he threw Ding Shan over to Ding Song. Zhi, Ding Shan’s body skidded nine to 12 meters on the ground, just managing to stop in front of the Ding Song’s toes.

He died!

There was no need for Ding Song to examine closely, and he already knew that Ding Shan was already a fully dead man whose spirit had even been eliminated.

His whole body was trembling, partly because of fury, but more so because of terror.

When had it been that a minor character that was only an ant in his eyes actually possessed the strength to easily kill him!?

His life or death was no longer within his control, and this emotion was too terrifying.

“Grand Elder Ding Song!” A few more people had arrived, and they were all first severance grand elders and second severance grand elders of the Ding Clan. Because there was no longer any need to seek Ling Han, they had naturally all returned.

They had only been one step late, yet discovered much to their shock that Ding Shan had died.

A third severance grand elder actually died in such a calm way; there was no battle that shook the mountains and caused an earthquake. It was as if only a nameless foot soldier like a cat or dog had died.

“Grand Elder!” they all exclaimed in shock, feeling as if the heavens themselves were falling down on them.

“Where is Ding Yaolong? If he still doesn’t come out, your Ding Clan is going to die without any descendants left behind!” With a thought from Ling Han, the three Battle Beasts leaped out of his body, beginning a grand massacre.

All of a sudden, the Ding Clan Manor was drowned out in terrible screams.
