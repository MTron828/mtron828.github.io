2935 Crushed

Thank you readers!

Ling Han really felt like complaining. Why was it Feng Wuding again?

Was he really going to become his wealth-delivering boy?

“Bai, I’ll ask you for the last time, where is Ling Han!” Feng Wuding shouted loudly. His voice was extremely harsh and filled with oppressiveness.

He was completely suppressing Bai Mifan, showing strength that surpassed the latter by not only just a little bit.

!!

Because he had already advanced to the Fourth Tier.

Feng Wuding, as a Fourth Tier, had abilities that had directly soared to the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, and he was presently only in the early stage of the Fourth Tier. He was sure that by the time he reached the middle stage of the Fourth Tier, or at most the late stage, his battle prowess would be able to leap into the Sixth Tier.

The Son of Destiny was indeed extraordinary.

Although Bai Mifan was incredibly freakish, compared with Feng Wuding, he was not just a little bit weaker. His battle prowess was also close to peak-stage Fifth Tier, but while they were both at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, there was still a difference.

Moreover, when it came to Heavenly Venerable Seals, there was also a huge gap between the two of them.

Thus, Bai Mifan was at a complete disadvantage, vomiting blood continuously from the barrage.

“Haha, I don’t know Ling Han like the back of my hand, so how would I know?” Though Bai Mifan was outmatched, his expression was still very carefree. He was completely unconcerned, and fought with all his might.

Would Feng Wuding dare to kill him?

Just like how no one dared to kill Feng Wuding, no one dared to kill Bai Mifan, either. Unless they could destroy him so completely that no secrets would be leaked at all, who in this world would be able to escape the pursuit of a vengeful Seventh Tier elite?

However, though Feng Wuding didn’t dare to kill Bai Mifan, he was completely capable of severely wounding and ruthlessly humiliating him.

This was a grudge between juniors, what more when it was a battle of equal cultivation levels, so even if Bai Fan found out, how could he bring himself to seek out Feng Wuding?

Even if he disregarded his pride, how could Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan and the others be easily trifled with?

Bai Mifan used all his powerful moves, yet he was outmatched. He could only fight and flee at the same time.

“What do you mean by the greatest prodigy of all eternity? You’re nothing but trash.” Feng Wuding smirked coldly. He had suffered greatly at Ling Han’s hands, but within the same cultivation level, only Ling Han could suppress him. Faced with any other prodigy, he was completely at the upper hand.

“Don’t forget. You were almost pummeled into idiocy by my brother,” Bai Mifan mocked.

Feng Wuding’s expression immediately turned dark. The greatest humiliation he had endured in this life came from Ling Han. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ling Han shook his head. In the past, Bai Mifan was such a nice person, filled with sunshine, but now? He had actually learned to speak toxic words; who knew who it was that had led him astray.

If the Empress and the others were present, they would definitely point at his nose, and say, “It’s you, it’s you.”

Bai Mifan was fleeing, but Feng Wuding wasn’t the only one here. There were also two other Fifth Tier elites from the World Alliance, and they both moved to block him.

These two Fifth Tiers were not stronger than Bai Mifan, but they didn’t need to defeat him. They only needed to block him for a while so that Feng Wuding would catch up to him.

“Humph, if Ling Han dares to appear again, I will definitely teach him a lesson!” Feng Wuding said coldly. He was now a Fourth Tier, and his ability could not be compared to when he was a Third Tier. He would definitely sweep aside all others who had Fifth-Tier battle prowess.

“Oh, how do you plan to teach me?” Ling Han said with a smile. With a step, he had already appeared beside Bai Mifan.

When they saw Ling Han, the two Fifth Tiers from the World Alliance couldn’t help but feel shocked. They actually didn’t dare to make a move.

Their psychological trauma was too great. Previously, Ling Han had single-handedly wiped the floor with all nine great Fifth Tier elites of the World Alliance. Now, there were only two of them, so how were they supposed to stop Ling Han?

“Ling Han!” Bai Mifan was startled. He had not thought that Ling Han would actually appear at such a crucial time.

“Ling, Han!” Feng Wuding said through gritted teeth. He was filled with hatred.

Ling Han was unconcerned. “We haven’t seen each other for such a long time, and you have already advanced to the Fourth Tier. Looks like you have obtained quite a number of Great Herbs.”

Even if Feng Wuding’s cultivation speed was astonishing, it was still impossible for him to advance to the Fourth Tier in just a few thousand years. He had to have obtained a considerable number of Great Herbs.

At the mention of Great Herbs, Feng Wuding’s expression darkened even further.

He had already been robbed twice by Ling Han, and was presently filled with anger.

“Ling Han, today, I will show you what the Son of Destiny means!!” he roared in fury, and charged over.

Ling Han casually threw out a punch, appearing to be at ease.

‘You have advanced into Fourth Tier, so how could it be that I have not?’

The slower his progress was, the more explosive his burst of power would be when he actually broke through.

Peng!

It was only a single punch, and Feng Wuding was sent flying, throwing up blood continuously.

“S-Sixth-Tier battle prowess!” Feng Wuding’s face was as white as a sheet. He had Fifth-Tier battle prowess, but even if he was at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, so what? Faced with Sixth-Tier battle prowess, he would only be bleeding and battered.

His expression was filled with disbelief as his pride had suffered a lot of damage.

Wasn’t that so?

He thought of himself as extraordinary; he was the Son of Destiny. However, he was also in the early stage of the Fourth Tier, and his battle prowess was only at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier. Though he could defeat all those with Fifth-Tier battle prowess, he was still very far from reaching the Sixth Tier.

However, Ling Han had reached the Sixth Tier in terms of actual battle prowess.

With such a comparison, wasn’t the gap between the two of them clear at a single glance?

However, Feng Wuding couldn’t accept this. It was one thing for him to be suppressed by Ling Han when he had been in the Third Tier, but now he was already in the Fourth Tier. The higher the cultivation level, the greater his advantage as the Son of Destiny should be.

On the contrary, Ling Han had now left him far behind.

Could it be that his title as the Son of Destiny was just an empty label?

Feng Wuding’s pride couldn’t accept such a result, but no matter how freakish he was, no matter how he used powerful moves, Fifth-Tier battle prowess couldn’t possibly reach the Sixth Tier; the gap was as wide as the sky.

Just like how Ling Han was strong enough, right? But when he was in Third Tier, he could not advance his battle prowess to the Sixth Tier no matter how hard he tried.

Feng Wuding could only be thrashed, and he was very soon battered and bloody, looking just like Bai Mifan.

“Good fight!” Bai Mifan clapped, and at the same time, he was also filled with shock. Ling Han’s battle prowess was already at the Sixth Tier, and he was only one step away from reaching the Seventh Tier. At that time, he would really be standing at the apex, and would no longer be subject to any restrictions.

Ling Han only thrashed Feng Wuding, and did not intend to kill him. Though there was great enmity between him and the World Alliance, Feng Wuding himself actually had not done any evil. It was just very coincidental, and very unlucky, that he had joined the World Alliance.

...

Moreover, Feng Wuding was his wealth-delivering boy. This guy had received priority nurturing from the World Alliance, and had a lot of treasures on him. Ling Han should be shearing him in waves like wool, but he could not bear to kill him.

Just as he was fighting to his heart’s content, Ling Han suddenly felt three terrifying auras sweep towards him.

Sixth Tier, Sixth Tier, Sixth Tier.

As he was startled, the three auras had already approached, and three people appeared.

He didn’t recognize any of them, and they were all extremely unfamiliar to him.

There were a total of around 100 Sixth Tier elites in the Genesis World, and Ling Han had seen over half of them before. Thus, it was normal that he didn’t recognize the three people in front of him.

However these three Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates gave him a strange feeling. However, he couldn’t put his finger on what was off for the moment.

The eyes of these three Sixth Tier elites swept over them, and immediately locked onto Ling Han.

Two Fifth Tiers of the World Alliance hurriedly asked for help from these three Sixth Tiers. “Seniors, please lend a hand to save Feng Wuding. He is the one that the Seventh Tiers”
