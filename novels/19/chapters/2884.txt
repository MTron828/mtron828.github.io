2885 Primitive stone slab

Since an overlapped dimension had already appeared, why couldn’t there be another?

Ling Han and the others headed underground. It was said that some forces had gone deep underground to see if there was a third dimension. As for whether there was one or not, it was currently an absolute secret, and could not possibly be leaked.

The ground structure here was actually very solid. The soil had been compressed, and the same piece of soil was at least 10 times heavier than in the Flaming Frost Dimension. However, due to the lack of the support of the Power of Dimension, this solid layer of soil couldn’t withstand a single blow.

“Aiyo!” Hu Niu suddenly let out a cry of pain. “Niu’s head, it’s going to be split in half.”

!!

Ling Han turned around, and asked, “What’s going on?”

“Niu got hit.” Hu Niu rubbed her head, where a bump had abruptly appeared on her forehead.

Ling Han hurriedly walked back, and saw that there was actually a huge stone slab in Hu Niu’s path. The little girl had crashed into it, and not only did it forcefully stop her, but it also caused a bump on her forehead.

However, this was extremely unbelievable. Hu Niu was a Fourth Tier, and her physique had been tempered by three types of fundamental powers. How tough did her physique have to be? Yet, it was actually stopped by a stone slab, and a bump appeared on her head.

Ling Han looked at the stone slab. It had already shattered. After all, it had been rammed by a Fourth Tier. Other than the Devouring Metal at Great-Accomplishment-level, what other material in the world could be so hard?

Fortunately, Hu Niu had only gotten a little scrape, and was not seriously injured.

Hence, Ling Han focused on studying this stone slab, and discovered that this thing was actually the stone material used to construct the city walls of the defenses in the Realm Battlefield.

This stone material was incomparably sturdy, but it couldn’t be made into any precious tool, because it didn’t have any spirituality.

“There are words on it.” The Empress also walked over.

Ling Han nodded. There were indeed many words engraved densely on it, but they were completely different from any of the existing words, and could not be read.

“Oh, Niu’s head hurts so much. Ling Han, quickly blow on it for Niu,” Hu Niu said, acting spoiled.

All Ling Han could do was hold the little girl in his arms. As he rubbed her small head, he continued to study this stone slab.

“I wonder what’s written here,” the Empress said.

“Let’s get Wally here and ask him.” Ling Han thought for a moment. Although Wally might not recognize it, he was good at deduction. As long as there were enough words, he might be able to decipher it.

He thought about it again. “Forget it. I’ll go look for him.

“You and Hu Niu go on first. I’ll leave a trace of power on you. It can be a light that will guide me back here,” Ling Han said.

The Empress nodded, pulled Hu Niu along, and left first.

“No, Niu wants to be with Ling Han.” Hu Niu struggled, but was unable to shake off the Empress, and could only call out in vain.

Ling Han put away the stone slab and took a step forward. He was already out of the Void, and then tore open Space to return to the Void. However, he was already in a completely different position now—the Powers of Dimension in his body were channeled. He searched for the location of the Flaming Frost Realm, and then spread out his body, shuttling through the Void like lightning.

It took him more than 20 years to return to the Flaming Frost Realm. Then, he found Wally at the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

This guy had stayed in the martial academy all this while, and had no plans on leaving.

“Come, analyze it for me and tell me what the words on it mean.” Ling Han handed the stone slab to Wally. It wasn’t easy for him to find written records in that lost land. Perhaps he could uncover the secrets of that place.

“100 pieces of Divine Metal,” Wally said, after taking a look.

“Yi, why did you increase the price?” Ling Han asked with a smile. He naturally didn’t care about 100 pieces of Divine Metal anymore, but teasing Wally was very fun.

Wally looked at Ling Han seriously. “This is from a completely different civilization. It’s extremely difficult for me to crack it.”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and threw out several hundred pieces of Divine Metal with a wave of his hand. This was the common currency for stone gambling, so he naturally had plenty on him.

Wally didn’t ask him why he gave more. In any case, Ling Han could give more, but he couldn’t give less.

“How long will it take?” Ling Han asked.

“A few years now,” Wally said.

Ling Han was curious. “Then what about in the past?”

“Probably a few hundred years,” he said.

It wasn’t very long, either. Ling Han nodded, and then sat cross-legged at the side, waiting quietly. He had just sorted out his thoughts; he was actually involved with Hysteria. This wasn’t something that could be let go so easily.

The two of them fell silent. One was studying the words on the stone slab, while the other was thinking about his own matters.

Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, seven years had passed.

“It’s done,” Wally suddenly said.

Ling Han snapped out of his deep meditation, and opened his eyes. “Tell me about it.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“There’s a major event recorded on it. The general idea is that an extremely powerful creature appeared and threatened their world, as well as countless similar worlds. Therefore, the elites of their world joined forces with the elites of other worlds to resist this creature,” Wally said.

Ling Han was stunned. Was this referring to Hysteria?

“Be more specific,” he said. “What’s the name of this powerful creature?”

Wally shook his head. “I can’t translate this, because the name itself is meaningless.”

That was indeed the case.

Ling Han nodded slowly, organizing his thoughts in his mind.

Could the powerful living being mentioned on the stone slab be Hysteria? This was too consistent with Hysteria’s description.

However, the time didn’t match.

Hysteria didn’t appear when the Genesis World was born. Instead, after the Genesis World developed to a certain stage, it was a cultivator from a certain dimension that suddenly had an idea, and created such a monster.

From then on, this monster gradually ran out of control. It devoured all the cultivators, living beings, and even the dimension itself, replacing them. From then on, the prelude to the Realm War began.

At that time, Lin Luo and the others should have already become Seventh Tiers. If it was said that two dimensions overlapped and were lost in the Void together, and they knew nothing about it, how could this be possible?

But if it had not been for Hysteria, where would such a terrifying guy have gone? He couldn’t have disappeared into thin air, right?

And there was that dead Seventh Tier as well; he should have been undying and indestructible.

The overlapping of two dimensions could only be done with the combined efforts of at least several hundred Seventh Tiers, which was even more inconceivable.

...

Ling Han sighed. It looked like he was still far from unraveling all the mysteries.

“Will you go to that dimension in the Void to take a look?” Suppressing such emotions, he asked Wally.

“No,” Wally refused immediately without a second thought.

“All right then. Then I will come and visit you again in the future when I have the time.”

Wally scoffed, “You will only come when you need something.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “You’re right.”

He directly tore open Space and entered into the Void. Then, with the sliver of Powers of Dimension he had left on the Empress as a beacon, he traversed the Void.

This naturally took him another several decades before he again returned to that lost primitive dimension.
