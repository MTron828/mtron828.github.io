3067 Facing Hysteria Head-on

Where did Spiritual Qi come from?

The answer to this question was surprisingly simple—the void, and fundamental power.

The dimensions would interact with the void, extracting fundamental power and accumulating it in their cores. The dimensions would then channel this power, and as if becoming alive, they would eject this power in another form—Spiritual Qi.

Thus, even though fundamental power and Spiritual Qi were different, there was indeed some relationship between them.

‘Everything is related to the void and intimately related to the boundless power in the void.

‘In this sense, the unique powers of the dimensions can also be viewed as belonging to fundamental power. They’ve simply undergone a transformation in the dimensions.

‘That being the case, the eighth type of power is still fundamentally a Power of Dimension and a fundamental power. It’s just that it’s countless times more powerful.

‘My body can be viewed as a Genesis World, so will that allow me to create another void? After all, this is the origin of all power.

‘Or can I perhaps accommodate the void directly?’

Ling Han was slightly stunned by his own “delusional ideas.” Even Hysteria only dared to engulf the Genesis World, and not the void.

The void was far too large, and no being had ever been able to reach the edges of this plane. It wouldn’t be surprising even if 1000 or 10,000 Genesis Worlds existed in the void.

‘Forget about this. I should focus my effort on elevating the dimensions in my body to high-tier high-level dimensions. Only by doing this will I possess the power to genuinely rival Hysteria.

‘I also need to find Extermination as well. She’s still in possession of a secret code of life.

‘However, obtaining this secret code of life will be useless if I don’t have enough dimensions in my body.’

Ling Han exited seclusion once to check on the cultivation of his friends and relatives.

Those who had advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier before made almost no progress. The higher one’s cultivation level, the longer it would take one to make any progress. Of course, this was unless they came across some rare opportunity.

Meanwhile, the boundless resources provided to the Ling Clan enabled the new emergence of tens of thousands of Celestial Kings.

Right now, the Ling Clan could completely be regarded as the number one clan in the world—even the established clans of the Seventh Tier elites couldn’t compare to it.

However, the members of the Ling Clan still kept a relatively low profile because of the threat from Extermination.

“Where’s Wang Quanhe?” Ling Han asked.

“That brat…” Ling Jianxue said with a strange expression, “His fortune is truly unimaginable. His cultivation talent is clearly nothing special, yet he’s somehow able to encounter rare opportunities one after another. After all these years, he’s already advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

“Hmm?” Even Ling Han was astonished.

Compared to his children and his grandchildren, he honestly hadn’t put too much effort into raising Wang Quanhe. Yet, Wang Quanhe was still able to become a Heavenly Venerate? This was truly remarkable.

Even though Ling Han could kill a Sixth Tier elite with a single finger now, he was still unable to help a Ninth Heaven Celestial King advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. This was something beyond the Regulations, something that pertained to fundamental power.

Wang Quanhe’s cultivation talent was nothing special, and in order to let him exact revenge as soon as possible, Ling Han further hadn’t attempted to stabilize his cultivation foundations. That being the case, it should have been difficult for him to even become a Celestial King, so how had he suddenly become a Heavenly Venerate?

Was he truly this fortunate?

Ling Han frowned, and said, “That brat has vicious tendencies, and he might even blame us for his clan being massacred. Keep an eye on him, and don’t let him cause any trouble.”

“Alright, I understand,” Ling Jianxue replied with a nod.

Ling Han continued to cultivate in seclusion. Another five billion years passed, and he had already managed to deduce all of the fourth-grade and third-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals. This allowed his cultivation speed to increase by countless folds again.

‘Most of my dimensions have already been elevated to high-tier high-level dimensions, and I’m countless times more powerful than when I last battled against Hysteria. And add to that the explosive power of the third-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals, and I should be powerful enough to rival Hysteria now.

‘Let me take a look at the Realm Battlefield first. I need to make sure that Shatter Mountains and the others are working hard.

‘In addition to that, I also want to find out about Extermination’s current situation.’

Ling Han exited seclusion, and headed toward the Realm Battlefield.

He went to the secondary battlefield first, and after so many years, the mother trees had naturally recovered their numbers already. They gave birth to a relentless enemy army, leading to huge casualties for the defenses.

Ling Han directly charged into Hysteria’s realm, and wantonly destroyed everything in his path. Only after doing this did he casually leave and enter the main battlefield.

To his disappointment, however, Chong Yan and the others had already fled.

Not only had the five of them fled, but even Golden Silk Moth and Ten Thousand Shadows were nowhere to be seen. Only Lin Luo and the six other Heavenly Venerates remained to painfully defend against the enemy invasion.

However, Hysteria was far too powerful, and a simple swing of its tentacle would immediately send the Heavenly Venerates flying. They were almost completely unable to slow down Hysteria’s advance.

The main battlefield was rapidly falling to enemy advance. If this continued, the main battlefield would only be able to hold on for a maximum of a few billion more years. After that, the Profound Negative Realm would become a scrumptious meal for Hysteria.

Ling Han released a battle cry before charging over and swinging his fists.

Whoosh!

He was extremely quick, and he transformed into a streak of light as he charged at Hysteria.

Boom!

A terrifying shock wave blasted into the surroundings as his fist collided with Hysteria.

Peng, peng, peng!

Lin Luo and the others were sent flying back like puppets. Fortunately, the bodies of Seventh Tier elites were indestructible, so they didn’t suffer any wounds.

“Ling Han!” they exclaimed in unison.

What did they just see?

Ling Han had swung a fist and forcefully blocked one of Hysteria’s attacks!

Gasp! There was someone in the world who could actually rival Hysteria?! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even more unfathomable than this was the fact that Ling Han was only at the Sixth Tier.

Sixth Tier! Good heavens!

Just how devastatingly powerful would he become when he advanced to the Seventh Tier?

However, Ling Han knew that the biggest benefit of him advancing to the Seventh Tier would be his body becoming indestructible and him gaining the ability to raise the dimensions in his body to the transcendent level.

As for strength?

In reality, he wouldn’t become much more powerful in the short term. This was because the greatest source of his power was the Powers of Dimension, something that wouldn’t rise in level simply because he advanced to the Seventh Tier. Instead, this was something that he needed to spend a long time cultivating and nurturing.

“Thank you for all your hard work, Seniors!” Ling Han said. He was radiating with an indomitable spirit as he continued, “From today onward, we’ll turn defense into offense and drive Hysteria out from this realm!”

If it had been someone else saying this, their words would have been treated as nothing more than a joke. Now, however, Ling Han’s incredible feat of blocking Hysteria’s attack gave them no option but to trust him.

He… had the right to utter such words.

“Charge!” the Heavenly Venerates roared with renewed vigor. They had defended this place for so many years, and at long last, they had finally waited until the arrival of someone who could turn the tables!

“Ling! Han!” Hysteria shrieked using its high-pitched spiritual waves. It was filled with rage and regret. After failing to kill Ling Han last time, it understood that it had lost its final chance to wipe this person from the face of the world. Sure enough, Ling Han was charging over again, and he was now powerful enough to face it head-on.

“Hysteria, the era belonging to you has already come to an end!” Ling Han bellowed as he unleashed another powerful attack.

The seven ultimate elites assisted him from the sidelines. Even though they were far weaker than Hysteria, they were still Seventh Tier elites, after all, so they could ultimately still provide a little help. In any case, they were indestructible and undying, so they could completely be used as human punching bags.
