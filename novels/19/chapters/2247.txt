Chapter 2248: Crushing Defeat of the Foreign Realm

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm were filled with spirit and inspiration upon hearing this.

How domineering! How inspiring!

When Gaddalon had attacked just then, hundreds of cultivators from the Celestial Realm had been killed. Meanwhile, Yamu’s vicious violence was no lesser, and she had also swallowed many cultivators from the Celestial Realm.

However, whom could they blame for being too weak? If it weren’t for Ling Han’s arrival, not only would Ailean have not helped them, he might have even been killed by Gaddalon and Yamu.

Ling Han had suddenly arrived, and he had sent Yamu flying with a single punch. Now, he had also uttered such inspiring and morale-boosting words, expressing his desire to obliterate the forces of the Foreign Realm. They were naturally as enthused as could be.

Yamu and Gaddalon both wore grave expressions. There was a gap of two cultivation levels between them and Ling Han, and their battle prowess was at least 100 times inferior. It would be useless even if they teamed up. They couldn’t rival Ling Han at all.

No, even if all of the cultivators from the Foreign Realm teamed up, they still couldn’t rival Ling Han.

“Leave! We’ll hold him back!” Gaddalon said. As the most powerful member of the Foreign Realm present, he needed to shoulder this responsibility.

“Understood.” Regardless of how arrogant, violent, and barbaric the cultivators of the Foreign Realm were, they still had no option but to bow their heads before absolute power. They all started to retreat.

“Did I let you leave?” Ling Han asked in a cold voice. His body flashed, and thousands upon thousands of his clones materialized.

Peng, peng, peng!

His clones all attacked in unison, instantly crushing the heads of thousands of cultivators from the Foreign Realm. Their divine senses were also obliterated.

To say nothing of several thousand people, if he wanted to, he could even kill hundreds of millions or billions of people together.

“You’ve gone too far!” Yamu and Gaddalon bellowed in rage. In the past, it had only ever been the Foreign Realm picking on the Celestial Realm. Now, however, a cultivator from the Celestial Realm was actually slaughtering them like chickens. This caused them to burn with unbridled rage.

“Is that so?” Ling Han was completely unfazed as he attacked again.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The cultivators from the Foreign Realm were crushed one after another, with their bodies transforming into clouds of flesh and blood.

“Leave! Retreat!” Yamu and Gaddalon roared. At the same time, they also started to retreat.

If they didn’t flee now, all of them would be trapped here.

“Die!” The cultivators from the Celestial Realm excitedly gave chase.

For so long, they had been forced to harbor and suppress their resentment.

The Celestial Realm had always been a target of invasion. Generation after generation, how many young prodigies had left their corpses here? In fact, some of them couldn’t even leave a corpse.

Moreover, during the two previous battles among the Severing Mundane Tier cultivators and the Dividing Soul Tier cultivators, the Celestial Realm had also suffered an overwhelming defeat. They hadn’t won a single battle.

However, a ferocious person in Ling Han had suddenly appeared, and his formidable might was such that the Foreign Realm was crushed and forced into a hasty retreat. In fact, even their Monarch Star had been sent flying with a single punch. This vented the anger of the Celestial Realm, and it allowed them to fully unleash the flames of fury that had been suppressed deep in their hearts.

Battle, they would battle to their heart’s content.

Boom!

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm charged over like a tidal wave, and the cultivators from the Foreign Realm fled in disarray.

“Friend, you can ignore the small fry, but you definitely have to dispose of those two,” Ailean said as he pointed at Gaddalon and Yamu.

These were two Monarch Stars, and if he allowed them to develop, they would certainly become terrifying Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in the future. It was hard to fathom just what kind of massacre the Celestial Realm would face at that time.

Ling Han nodded in reply. This was war, and there was no such thing as mercy.

Moreover, the Foreign Realm was the invader, so he more so didn’t need to show any mercy.

Whoosh!

With a flash, he had already charged over to block Gaddalon and Yamu.

The single horn on Gaddalon’s head glowed as he glared at Ling Han, and he said, “Yamu, we’re fighting with our backs to the wall. Unleash the ultimate attack.”

A cruel and eager expression spread across Yamu’s face, and she said, “Agreed. Even if we die, we need to take someone down with us.”

They were both channeling some sort of mystical power. Gaddalon’s horn glowed with brilliance, and upon reaching a pinnacle state, it directly dissolved, allowing his battle prowess to explosively rise more than tenfold. Meanwhile, limbs fell off Yamu’s body one by one, and she was increasing her battle prowess through the means of self-harm.

Ling Han didn’t interfere, and he simply observed them with his hands clasped behind his back. He was the true ruler of this heaven and earth.

“Die!” Gaddalon and Yamu roared as they attacked in unison.

Boom!

This was the ultimate attack of two powerful Monarch Stars. Like a tsunami, the roaring wave of energy riled up the entire realm.

Peng, peng, peng!

Numbering in the trillions, countless surrounding stars were shattered into oblivion.

A black dagger was spat out from Gaddalon’s mouth, streaking toward Ling Han. Meanwhile, countless bony thorns formed from Yamu’s abandoned limbs, transforming into a rain of piercing arrows.

They were willing to suffer self-harm to raise their battle prowess, and they were more so attacking in unison. Such was the might of their attacks that even Ninth Secret Monarch Stars would dare not face them head-on.

After unleashing this attack, however, the two of them immediately turned around to flee.

They weren’t fleeing toward the exit, but rather in opposite directions, one to the left and one to the right. They fled into the depths of this realm.

Their speed was incredible, and in the blink of an eye, they had already disappeared from view.

Ling Han raised a hand, gently tapping the space before him. The rushing dagger and the pouring arrows were instantly reduced to ashes.

However, Ailean sighed upon seeing this. The two Monarch Stars had resolutely decided to suffer self-harm to flee from Ling Han. Even Tenth Secret elites wouldn’t be able to stop them. After all, those at the Tenth Secret were still Immortal Palace Tier elites. This was unlike Eleventh Secret elites, whose battle prowess had already reached the stage of the Ascending Origin Tier. Against Eleventh Secret elites, even the violent struggle of Tenth Secret Monarch Stars would be completely futile.

“Friend, who in the world are you?” Ailean asked in extreme curiosity. Since when had the Celestial Realm produced such a supreme prodigy?

Ling Han patted Ailean’s shoulder with a smile, and said, “Didn’t I already say? I’m called the chicken slayer. Alright, it’s time for me to slay some chicken now.” With a flash, he vanished without a trace.

Ailean didn’t believe that Ling Han could catch up to Gaddalon and Yamu. The two of them were only two minor levels below Ling Han, and they had more so fled earlier and in opposite directions as well. Thus, it would be extremely difficult to pursue even one of them, let alone two.

After pondering for a brief moment, Ailean started to pursue the fleeing forces of the Foreign Realm. Even though he had exhausted a great deal of his power of Regulations, one percent of power of an Eighth Secret Monarch Star was still incredibly great.

Gaddalon fled a boundless distance, and he had even relied on the surrounding celestial bodies to hide his tracks. He was confident that he had completely broken free from Ling Han’s pursuit.

A resentful expression spread across his face as he stroked the snapped horn on his head.

In his tribe, the sole horn on their head was the hardest part of their bodies. It could rival Pseudo-Divine Metal of the same level, and it was a place to store their blood essence. In times of danger, they could forcefully combust the blood essence within this horn to gain a huge increase in battle prowess.

However, once they started to combust their blood essence, this process could no longer be stopped. This huge loss of blood essence would not only cause their battle prowess to fall dramatically, but it would also cause their cultivation to revert by a certain degree. In fact, it would even affect their future cultivation.

However, as long as he survived, there would always be an opportunity to regain all this. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He arrived on a star, a newly born star. This was a desolate star with no trace of life.

Gaddalon panted as he sat on a boulder, and he swallowed some alchemical pills to treat his broken horn.

“Oi, don’t sit on my body,” a voice said from below him.

Gaddalon was given a fright, and he instantly jumped up in surprise. He stared at the boulder with incredulity. That was nothing but a stone, one which had neither hands nor feet.

‘Impossible!’

His heart beat like thunder. He had clearly heard Ling Han’s voice just then.

“Are you looking for me?” Ling Han asked.

Gaddalon hurriedly spun around, only to see Ling Han standing behind him.

“Impossible!” he immediately exclaimed.. Even if Ling Han were more powerful than him, it should have still been impossible for Ling Han to approach him so stealthily!
