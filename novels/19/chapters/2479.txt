Chapter 2480: Profuse Apology

??

If Ling Han and the others could only be regarded as troublemakers when they arrived here several hundred years ago, they could definitely be regarded as mighty dragons now.

In terms of the power of Regulations alone, Ling Han and Huo Furong were tied in the first place. They both possessed a Vitality Index of almost 8000.

However, if Body Arts were taken into account, Ling Han would definitely be the most powerful among them. His Vitality Index would exceed 8000, reaching a whopping 8400. This was already approaching the level of Celestial Kings at the peak stage of the Third Heaven.

Of course, this was only theoretically speaking.

How could Celestial Kings be ordinary people? After all, even king tiers found it almost impossible to become Celestial Kings. At a minimum, they had to be emperor tiers. Thus, the Vitality Index of Third Heaven Celestial Kings would most likely be around 8600. This was slightly more powerful than Ling Han. However, if he took into account the Divine Demon Sword as well, Ling Han was confident that he could rival any Third Heaven Celestial King.

Right now, his weakness was surprisingly his physique.

After becoming a Celestial King, he required an exorbitant amount of treasures to practice the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Even though he had taken the treasures of many Ancestral Kings a while ago, he had already consumed most of them. Moreover, these were treasures from a different realm, so they were still a little bit different. In any case, they weren’t sufficient to fund his current cultivation needs.

Only when he left the Celestial Path, and perhaps only when he ventured to the transcendent dimension, could he cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to a higher level.

Even so, his physique had still genuinely advanced to the Celestial King Tier. His Defense Index had exceeded 5000, and this was still extremely astonishing.

Before they could set off, a significant piece of news reached their ears. After so many years of vicious battle, the various forces had finally managed to conquer the remaining areas.

...

According to rumors, these central structures were fairly extraordinary. Not only could they resist the purple light, but they even possessed other peculiar abilities. Some could automatically refine alchemical pills as long as the necessary ingredients were provided, while others could refine tools as long as the necessary materials were put in. Some could even attack by themselves, launching beams of light that could obliterate all matter.

Right now, the situation was already settled, and the various forces were conducting the final round of talks. They had reached a ceasefire agreement, and they had all agreed to fight for the paramount treasure in the central region together. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This also signified that the Dark Frost Celestial King was finally free to target Ling Han and the others.

This information had been gathered by Fu Yuan and Cheng Tao. Their faces were scrunched up in anxiety. This time, they would definitely lose the opportunity to leave the Celestial Path. In fact, even their forces on the Celestial Path would be targeted by the Dark Frost Celestial King. In the future, they might become lonesome souls.

Even though they knew that Ling Han and the others were extremely powerful, they could at most only defeat those at the Second Heaven. If they encountered Third Heaven Celestial Kings, they would definitely suffer defeat.

What they were most afraid of eventually arrived. Several days later, a messenger came bearing a letter from the Dark Frost Celestial King. His words were extremely arrogant and haughty, and he demanded that Ling Han and the others go and profusely apologize to him. Otherwise, he would lock the Transfer Formation in the center of the ruins, forcing them to stay on the Celestial Path forever.

This was a ruthless tactic.

Although it was necessary to travel through the Celestial Path to become a Celestial King, there was only a limited amount of resources here, so the scope of what they could achieve was also limited.

Ling Han and the others were all monarch stars or supreme monarch stars, so if they were trapped here forever, this would definitely be a worse fate than killing them.

“If you understand, then give me a reply,” the messenger said in a haughty tone. Even though he was only at the Ascending Origin Tier, he stood extremely tall and proud before the group of Celestial Kings. It was as if he were the true Celestial King.

In his eyes, since the Dark Frost Celestial King had cast his gaze over, these newly advanced Celestial Kings could only wet their pants and fall to their knees in fright, begging for forgiveness. As a messenger, he naturally had to accept Ling Han and the others’ surrender first.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he raised his right hand.

Boom!

A ball of flames materialized, instantly incinerating the letter. However, a powerful aura rose from the ashes, transforming into a fist that smashed at Ling Han.

This was the handiwork of a Celestial King. They had imbued their paramount power into the letter. Even though this fist couldn’t unleash the true power of a Third Heaven Celestial King, it was still immensely powerful. Indeed, it wasn’t an attack that ordinary First Heaven Celestial Kings could block.

In the eyes of the Dark Frost Celestial King, if Ling Han dared to destroy his letter, he would punish the other party with this powerful punch. Even if it didn’t strike Ling Han, it would still force him to become extremely disheveled as he dodged desperately. This was a display of strength.

This was the lofty might of a Third Heaven Celestial King.

Ling Han extended a finger and lightly tapped at the fist.

Pa!

The fist immediately crumbled, unable to hurt even a single hair of Ling Han’s.

If the Dark Frost Celestial King had personally come to attack him, Ling Han would definitely have faced him in a solemn manner. However, this was simply an attack that had been imbued in a piece of paper. Thus, did he need to treat it seriously?

“Go back and tell your master. I’ll return the favor in a few days’ time,” Ling Han said with a smile.

The messenger was transfixed with shock. He had personally heard the Dark Frost Celestial King say that if Ling Han dared to destroy the letter, he would definitely suffer grave consequences. However, even though these words rang in his ears, his eyes had witnessed a completely different result.

‘Heavens! Just how terrifying is this youth?!’

He hurriedly nodded in reply, turning around as quickly as he could to leave. At this moment, he truly wished that he had wings to soar away from Ling Han as quickly as he could.

He rapidly made his way back, and when he arrived at a camp controlled by the Dark Frost Celestial King, he used a special method to communicate with the Dark Frost Celestial King.

“When is the brat coming?” the Dark Frost Celestial King asked.

In his eyes, he had Ling Han and the others in the palm of his hand. They had no option but to yield.

The messenger stammered in apprehension. He truly didn’t know where to begin.

“Hmm? Why are you hesitating? Hurry up and answer me!” the Dark Frost Celestial King said in a solemn voice. He absolutely despised subordinates who were slow and ineffective.

The messenger gritted his teeth, and said, “That person burnt the letter, my lord.”

The Dark Frost Celestial King faltered upon hearing this. Just how audacious were these outsiders? They even dared to destroy his letter! However, he immediately started to roar with laughter. That person had most likely been wounded by his attack, right? Even if he hadn’t, he would still have wound up disheveled. He nodded, and asked, “How severely was he wounded?”

The messenger wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and replied, “He was completely unscathed… He also said that he would return the favor in a few days.”

The Dark Frost Celestial King faltered again. ‘What? Completely unscathed?

‘How is this possible?!’

Even though that attack hadn’t possessed his full strength, it had still been the attack of a Third Heaven Celestial King, after all. Just how overwhelming had it been?

“Are you trying to trick me?” the Dark Frost Celestial King chided in a cold voice. “Perhaps you didn’t deliver the letter at all?”

Was this subordinate so afraid of death that he didn’t even visit Ling Han and the others? Was he making up excuses now?

“This subordinate wouldn’t dare! This subordinate wouldn’t dare!” the messenger exclaimed as he hurriedly fell to his knees. Even though they were extremely far away from each other, it was as if he could still feel the burning rage of the Dark Frost Celestial King. This terrified him to the core.

He continued to say that this was indeed what had transpired, and that he wasn’t lying about anything at all.

Only then did the Dark Frost Celestial King silently fall in thought. He also believed that this subordinate wouldn’t dare to trick him, especially under his interrogation.

However, how could a measly First Heaven Celestial King who had only just advanced possess such great strength?

“Are there monarch stars among the outsiders?” he murmured to himself. A while ago, he had dispatched two Celestial Kings along with Dongfang Rui to hunt Ling Han down. Now, however, Ling Han was still alive and healthy, while there was no news about the three people who had been pursuing him. This was proof enough of Ling Han and his companions’ strength.

“However, regardless of how powerful he is, how can he rival a Third Heaven Celestial King? Heh, I’ll be waiting for him.”
