Chapter 2112: Celestial Bell

Ling Han’s heart thumped against his chest. If the elements of the Source Powers of heaven and earth were all different, it was extremely likely that he could obtain the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth he needed at once.

He could then create nine divided souls, which would allow him to ascend to the Immortal Palace Tier in the strongest manner possible. If he succeeded, he would most likely be no weaker than Ji Wuming.

‘This is a huge deal!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind. Moreover, not only could he obtain Source Powers of heaven and earth, but even Hu Niu and the Empress could obtain one to two Source Powers of heaven and earth each. At that time, their battle prowess would also rise explosively.

He voiced these thoughts to Hu Niu and the Empress, and their heartbeats also involuntarily quickened.

Obtaining Source Powers of heaven and earth was a matter of fate. Most importantly, however, if one couldn’t even come across Source Powers of heaven and earth, how could they test their fate?

“Stinky bone! Hurry up!” Hu Niu immediately shouted in impatience.

Xiao Gu was leading the way, and upon hearing this, he involuntarily turned around, and repeated, “Stinky bone! Hurry up!”

Whoosh!

Before he had even finished speaking, a gust of wind swept over and chopped his head off. However, he surprisingly continued to speak even as his head fell to the ground.

This was an uncanny sight, and it was enough to make one’s hair stand on ends. At the same time, however, it also made them want to laugh.

Xiao Gu blocked the blade of wind with one hand, and he picked up his head, and casually placed it back on his neck with another. While he did this, his advance didn’t falter at all.

“Look!”

As they walked past a canyon, a green bell suddenly appeared before them.

This green bell was extremely large, and it measured nine meters in height and six meters in circumference. Judging from its appearance, it was most likely forged from bronze. Right now, its surface was filled with green rust, and it was radiating with an aura of ancient age.

With just a glance, Ling Han and the others all felt an overwhelming pressure washing over them. Their bodies became weak, and they could barely remain standing.

“Celestial King Tool!” Lu Hairong exclaimed.

The Roc Palace was a powerful force, so even with its dire situation right now, she could still possess a Celestial Tool. However, Celestial Tools were limited by the cultivation level of their owner, and they were also dependent on the skill level of their creator.

She had refined her own Celestial Tool, and when it was activated, it could even unleash a might that surpassed that of hers. It was because of this that Celestial Tools were so valuable.

However, standing before the bronze bell, Lu Hairong instantly felt as if she would be obliterated by a single shake of the bell.

Even though this was only a feeling, Lu Hairong firmly believed in her senses.

Not only was this bell a Celestial Tool… but it was even a Celestial Tool above the Seventh Heaven. Otherwise, it couldn’t exert such overwhelming pressure on her.

Apart from Xiao Gu, they all felt a strong urge to obtain this bell. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After all, Celestial King Tools were far too valuable.

However, to say nothing of the others, even Lu Hairong didn’t dare to near the bell at all. They could only stare at it from afar. This caused them to feel extremely exasperated.

Such a valuable treasure was sitting right before their eyes!

They walked around, trying to better observe the Celestial Tool. However, after taking two steps, they were astounded by what they saw.

This bronze bell was actually damaged!

This was especially clear from the side. There was a hole on the bell, a hole that ran all the way from one end to the other.

“This hole was caused by a punch,” Lu Hairong suddenly said. Her face then became pale.

This was far too terrifying. Not only had this person’s fist rivaled a Celestial Tool, but it had even penetrated it?

What was Divine Metal?

This was the strongest material in the world! Even Celestial Kings couldn’t damage Divine Metal with their bare hands. If they wanted to damage it, they had to rely on the power of Regulations to refine it.

Celestial Tools that were forged from Divine Metal also maintained this property. However, reality was sitting right before them. Celestial Tools could also be penetrated by bare fists.

“This is… the Bell of Time, the Celestial Tool of the Eternal Celestial King!” Lu Hairong yelped in astonishment.

The Eternal Celestial King had been a paramount Ninth Heaven Celestial King who had lived for heaven knew how many epochs. Originally, he could have lived for countless more epochs. However, eight epochs ago, he suddenly vanished without a trace.

Now, his Celestial Tool had appeared before them, and it had more so been damaged. What did this signify?

The Eternal Celestial King had already been killed eight epochs ago!

“Not only was the Ancestral Roc killed here, but even the Eternal Celestial King was killed here,” Lu Hairong said with emotion. There was confusion and daze in her voice.

The Ancestral Roc, the Eternal Celestial King, and the previous leader of the Roc Palace had all been Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Moreover, they had all been paramount among the Celestial Kings. However, what did this matter? They had still died in the end.

For what reason was she cultivating?

Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings appeared no less vulnerable than her.

“Even the Celestial Tool of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was penetrated by a single punch. The power of this person…” Ling Han murmured.

“Heavenly Venerate!” the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou exclaimed in unison.

Only Heavenly Venerates could possess such Mystical Power.

“No wonder the force of darkness didn’t take this Celestial Tool. Even though it’s damaged, it’s still a paramount treasure. Because the martial intent of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King still remains, no one below the level of Eighth Heaven Celestial King can hope to obtain it,” Ling Han said with a nod.

“In other words, the Celestial King here is definitely below the Eighth Heaven,” the Empress added.

This could be guaranteed. However, this didn’t make them feel any easier.

Even if they were a Fifth Heaven, Sixth Heaven, or Seventh Heaven Celestial King, they could still easily suppress Lu Hairong. The only unknown factor was Xiao Gu. No one knew what his limit was.

“Let’s go,” Lu Hairong said. She had already come to her senses. The enemy was right before them, so how could she hesitate now?

If she became a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, she could resolve the challenging situation that the Roc Palace was currently in. This was her motivation to become stronger.

Whoosh…

A gust of wind blew by, and as it traveled through the hole in the bronze bell, it made the sound of ghosts wailing. The gust of wind then took form, transforming into a man who was dressed in green.

He was handsome and mighty, and he more so possessed an indescribable demeanor that made one want to yield.

The man in green swept his gaze across Ling Han and the others. His eyes were like Divine Swords, and they possessed a peerless divine might.

Lu Hairong hurriedly stepped forward.

Weng!

A sword appeared in her hands, and the symbols on them all lit up in unison.

Whoosh!

She rapidly retreated, taking Ling Han and the others with her. In the blink of an eye, she had already retreated hundreds of meters, all the way to the mountainside.

A gust of wind had traveled past the bronze bell, transforming into the figure of a person. Afterward, a single glance from this person had forced a mighty Fourth Heaven Celestial King to retreat in haste!

Gasp!

This was far too incredible!

“My respects to this senior!” Lu Hairong respectfully greeted the man with her hands still on the hilt of her sword.

This was most likely the Eternal Celestial King, the owner of the bronze bell. Of course, this figure was merely formed from the martial intent left in the bell. The Eternal Celestial King had already died several epochs ago.

The man in green wore a dazed expression, and he appeared slightly confused and perplexed.

Ling Han instantly came to a realization. The Bell of Time had naturally been forged by the Eternal Celestial King. Thus, its Tool Spirit was also born from the Eternal Celestial King’s intent. As such, even though the Eternal Celestial King had already been dead for several epochs, it was still able to form his figure and replicate some of his might.

However, because the Celestial Tool had been damaged, the Tool Spirit had most likely been crippled as well. Because of this, the figure that it created was also in a dazed state.

Weng!

At this moment, Xiao Gu suddenly started to glow.

It was the Celestial Bone!

“Old Bone Demon!” the man in green suddenly exclaimed. Clarity instantly returned to his eyes.
