Chapter 2639: Arrival of Heavenly tribulation

Fu Yunhai’s expression changed drastically as he exclaimed, “Not good! He’s about to advance!”

“How is that possible? We’ve put him under so much pressure, yet he still has the spare energy to advance?” Niu Cangyu’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets.

“What should we do?” Rong Wenlin asked as he sucked in a sharp breath.

Ling Han was already so ferocious at this moment, so once he advanced to the Sixth Heaven, his battle prowess would naturally soar to a new height.

Gu Heyi hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would be so courageous, either. While being attacked by six elites, he unexpectedly decided to set aside some energy to advance. This was truly a gamble with his life on the line. Regardless of if he made a mistake while advancing, causing him to lose his mind, or he were struck by them, both would cause him to be severely wounded.

However, Ling Han had still decided to advance anyway. Moreover, he had succeeded.

However, Gu Heyi immediately regained his composure, saying, “It doesn’t matter. Even if he advances to the Sixth Heaven, his battle prowess will only double at most. We’re still powerful enough to suppress him!”

After breaking through, the cultivation of Celestial Kings would become unstable for a period of time. Thus, even though their battle prowess would increase significantly, it would only be double their original battle prowess at most.

What was the greatest significance of advancing?

It was in order to unlock the path for further cultivation, allowing one to further raise their strength. Otherwise, one would be trapped in the same spot.

Niu Cangyu and the others pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement. Their battle prowess was more than double that of Ling Han, so even if he advanced to the Sixth Heaven, they would still be able to maintain their advantage as long as his battle prowess didn’t reach the Ninth Heaven.

Thunderclouds rumbled overhead. It was clear that Ling Han’s Sixth Heaven Heavenly tribulation was far more powerful than that of the Empress, and this was because he had mastered a fearsome Body Art as well. Moreover, this Body Art was above the Regulations.

Crack!

A bolt of lightning smashed down, carrying with it a magnificent power of destruction.

Gu Heyi and the others hurriedly retreated. No matter how powerful they were, they still didn’t dare to challenge the heavens head-on. Even Gu Heyi could only retreat at this moment. He dared to face the Empress’ tribulation, but he didn’t dare to face Ling Han’s.

After all, that would be seeking death!

On the ground, everyone was wide-eyed with astonishment. They hadn’t expected such a huge turn in the situation.

Ling Han was already on the verge of collapsing, yet he suddenly summoned a tribulation, attempting to advance to the Sixth Heaven. If he succeeded, his battle prowess would definitely enjoy a huge boost, perhaps allowing him to turn the tables and achieve victory.

“Impossible!” someone said with a resolute shake of their head.

“After one advances, their cultivation will definitely become unstable. Thus, his battle prowess can only double at most. That’s nowhere near enough to suppress Gu Heyi and the other elites.”

“Moreover, this Heavenly tribulation is absolutely terrifying. Even if he manages to overcome it, he’ll definitely have to pay a huge price. At that time, he’ll have to face six powerful elites with severe wounds. How can he achieve victory?”

“If you ask me, I’d say that his chance of victory will decrease after he advances.”

“Pei! Outsiders who come here to train all deserve to die!”

These were the people who didn’t think that Ling Han would win. However, there were also those who thought the contrary.

“Freaks like him can’t be measured according to general rules. Others might only experience double the battle prowess after advancing, but perhaps he’s an exception?”

“Moreover, who knows if he possesses some rare treasure?”

“Only time will tell.”

While they were engaged in spirited discussions, heavenly tribulation had already marched over with fearsome power.

The might of this heavenly tribulation was infinitesimally close to the Ninth Heaven, but it still hadn’t crossed this threshold yet. Just as Gu Heyi had predicted, even though Ling Han had advanced, his battle prowess had only doubled, and it was still unable to reach the barrier to the Ninth Heaven.

Upon seeing this, Niu Cangyu, Fu Yunhai, and the others all felt reassured.

They became eager with anticipation. Once Ling Han overcame his heavenly tribulation, they would immediately charge forward to attack him.

Ling Han’s situation was extremely dire. He was already severely wounded because of the six elites, and he was almost on the verge of collapsing. Now, the might of this heavenly tribulation was no weaker than the attacks of the six elites. Combined with his injuries, it was inevitable that he faced the risk of death.

No one could defeat heavenly tribulation. One could only endure it, endure it until it concluded. If they didn’t die, that could be marked down as a victory.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Apocalyptic bolts of lightning blasted down with no reprieve. At this level, Ling Han was already unable to use these bolts of lightning to temper his body. After all, these bolts of lightning were approaching the Ninth Heaven! Any slipup, and he would be killed.

Ling Han wielded his Divine Demon Sword as he battled against heavenly tribulation.

Two hours, six hours, 12 hours…

His wounds became increasingly severe, and Indestructible True Fluid was already spread all over his body. However, he had already exhausted all of it during the battle just then, so he was truly at the end of his rope.

His body was riddled with wounds, and even his bones could clearly be seen. Even though heavenly tribulation was about to conclude, the six elites had already recovered to their peak condition, with each preparing their most powerful strikes. They were going to unleash quick and brutal attacks on Ling Han, killing him in a single exchange.

The direr his situation, the more composed Ling Han became. He was burning with fighting spirit, with his eyes blazing and astonishingly bright.

Right now, he could battle against heavenly tribulation with a relaxed mind. This was because no one would dare to attack him at this moment. Otherwise, they would be seeking death. If he further magnified this heavenly tribulation with his cultivation, only Heavenly Venerates would be able to rival it!

16 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours…

As if preparing for an ultimate strike, the final bolt of lightning still refused to erupt. Finally, a golden fist slammed down from the clouds, with countless arcs of lightning enveloping it. It was as if heaven and earth had thrown a punch.

Everyone paled in shock upon seeing this. Even their breathing became difficult, and some of them involuntarily collapsed to the ground.

This was the true might of heaven and earth.

They couldn’t accept this. Hadn’t they all become Celestial Kings already? Didn’t they already enjoy an equivalent status with the Regulations? Yet, they were actually cowering to the might of heaven and earth?

If a Heavenly Venerate were present, they would definitely scoff at these people. Regulations were merely a set of rules created by heaven and earth. If heaven and earth were dissatisfied, they could easily scrap the Regulations and replace them with something else. Once this occurred, what would Celestial Kings be worth?

Thus, Celestial Kings could only enjoy an equivalent status with the Regulations. Heaven and earth, however? Tsk, even Heavenly Venerates didn’t enjoy such a right—at the very least, low-level Heavenly Venerates didn’t.

Ling Han roared as he charged forward, becoming one with his sword as he soared toward the large hand.

Peng!

However, it was a shame that even though the Divine Demon Sword had always been indestructible, it finally met its match at this moment. It was completely unable to shatter the iron fist, and it was instead slammed down along with its owner, crashing heavily to the ground.

Crackle… Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Arcs of chaotic lightning flashed about, unleashing a devastating and destructive might.

All Regulations were obliterated, with only these arcs of lightning remaining.

Everyone was speechless with shock. This was the genuine might of heaven and earth! Against such overwhelming heavenly tribulation, could Ling Han truly survive?

“He’s dead… He’s definitely dead! Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be severely wounded by that final strike, to say nothing of a newly advanced Sixth Heaven Celestial King.”

“It doesn’t matter even if he hasn’t died. He’s definitely suffered severe wounds, yet there are still six elites waiting to attack him!”

“Mm-hm, by the looks of it, his fate is sealed.”

While they were chattering, the golden fist slowly dissipated. However, the boundless arcs of lighting enveloping the fist continued to crackle as if they wanted to reduce Ling Han to dust before they vanished.

Only after 15 minutes did the fist finally disappear. The dark clouds immediately receded, instantly signaling the end of the tribulation. It was as if it had never existed in the first place.

Everyone craned their neck to see if Ling Han was still alive, or if he had already been reduced to nothingness.

“He’s over there!” someone suddenly exclaimed, pointing in a certain direction.

Amid an expanse of ruins, they could see Ling Han slowly walking out. Even while being struck by that fearsome fist of lightning just then, he had still remained standing upright. Now that the fist had disappeared, he naturally walked over straight away.

“Waagh!” However, Ling Han immediately started to vomit blood. Surprisingly, though, this blood was actually golden in color. In fact, one could even see pulsating symbols within this blood.
