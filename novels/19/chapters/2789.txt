2790 Crime of treason

All of Hysteria’s creations were death warriors. Their only thought was battle, and they had no fear of death.

Hysteria’s goal was not to conquer the entire Genesis World, but rather to devour the whole Genesis World, turning it into a part of its own body. Under this preset condition, any being with intelligence should oppose it.

…Otherwise, when doomsday really came for the Genesis World, would I still be me? Would I still be me?

After advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, one would have surpassed the heaven and earth and transcended. How free and independent were they? Who would be willing to become merely a part of another elite’s body, easily erased at any moment?

!!

Hence, Ling Han trusted these lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops that had developed intelligence. They would definitely not be willing to return to Hysteria’s body, and fight to the death for its sake again.

Hysteria did not care about its own creations at all. Their only purpose was to battle and exhaust the elites of the Flaming Frost Realm, ultimately fulfilling its goal of devouring the Flaming Frost Realm.

“Humph, what do you know?” Immediately, one of the powerful figures glared fiercely at Ling Han.

“Are you planning to commit treason?” He Liqun demanded menacingly. He wanted to pin a severe crime on Ling Han so he would be able to openly make a move against Ling Han when he left this place.

This was a very sensitive topic, immediately causing the elites of the fifth level to all look menacingly at Ling Han. Even Third Tier Heavenly Venerates like Shi Mengyu, Shi Zhonghe, and the others bore baleful expressions.

In the extensive history, there was indeed no shortage of weak-willed Heavenly Venerates that feared death and sided with Hysteria. They would work from the inside while Hysteria’s troops attacked from outside, causing tremendous losses to the armies of the Flaming Frost Realm.

Hence, what everyone despised the most was these traitors. Once discovered, they would be immediately executed.

Yuan Yinglong and his lackeys hurriedly retreated, maintaining a clear distance with Ling Han to show that they had no relations with Ling Han.

Anything else could be tolerated first, and they could normally split ways with Ling Han after returning, but the matter of treason was too serious. If Yuan Yinglong did not quickly draw a clear dividing line between himself and Ling Han, then even if he were killed as well, there would be no one who would declare that he was innocent.

This was a great taboo, an absolute taboo.

“How dare you!!” Wu Feng also glared at Ling Han. In the eyes of a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, now matter how prodigious and freakish Ling Han was, he was still only a minor character. The Flaming Frost Realm had no lack of prodigies, but in the case of traitors, each would be immediately eliminated upon discovery, and definitely could not be spared.

Ling Han chuckled. “Where did you see that I have committed treason? These people clearly want to get out of Hysteria’s grasp, and aspire for a bright future, so why shouldn’t they be given a chance?”

“Once a criminal, always a criminal!” Shen Fei declared coldly, appearing extremely disdainful.

Ling Han pointed at Shen Fei. “You are the criminal here, your whole family are criminals!”

Shen Fei couldn’t help but explode with fury. How could there be such a shameless guy? They had been speaking peacefully, so why had he suddenly started to throw insults? If this had been the fifth level, he would definitely have struck Ling Han dead immediately with a single slap. A mere First Tier actually dared to act so arrogant; this was a sign of great disrespect.

But now, he could only grin and bear it. With a flick of his sleeve, he did not say another word.

“Ling Han, you must not break the greater principles!” He Liqun declared menacingly. There was no chance that he could kill a supreme prodigy for no reason. There were a considerable number of powerful figures that were protecting Ling Han.

However, if Ling Han bore the crime of betrayal, what other mighty figure would stand up on his behalf?

Zhou Heng? Chu Hao? Or… Lin Luo?

None of them would.

Ling Han looked towards He Liqun. “To think that you could actually advance to the Fourth Tier with that kind of narrow-mindedness, this is truly a great shock for me.”

He Liqun’s face involuntarily turned dark as pitch. Wasn’t this just pointing at his nose, nad saying that he was not worthy of becoming a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate?

But thinking about how Ling Han was a freak that was invincible within his cultivation level, he could only forcibly tolerate this.

It was fine. Everything now was for the sake of labeling Ling Han. Once he became a traitor, he would become a public enemy!

“Even this young brother has such intelligence, so why can’t you people have some slight benevolence?” a seven-legged elephantman said among Hysteria’s lingering dregs. He was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, and addressing Ling Han as a young brother was naturally already elevating his standing.

“Talking of benevolence with beasts like you?” Wu Feng sneered. “Then how would we be able to face those of our brothers that have died?”

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Another dozen or more figures landed. That crevice was not very secluded. Furthermore, once their power had attained late stage First Tier, they would be able to force their way in. Hence, as time passed, more and more people arrived.

The balance of power of both sides was becoming even, and it was certain that not too long after, the side of the Flaming Frost Realm would have the upper hand, a definite upper hand, a crushing advantage.

Everyone’s aura involuntarily surged. Now, even if a battle started, they would have no fear.

“Everyone, we are very sincere,” a snakewoman said. The upper half of her body was human, while her lower half was still the body of a snake. However, her grace and allure could not be concealed, causing those who saw her to feel their heartbeats quicken.

“Very sincere, right?” Wu Feng nodded. “Then, surrender yourselves to be captured. This is what I call real sincerity.”

How could these lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops agree to this? They all showed hints of fury. They had already said all the nice words, but was it really so difficult for them to continue living?

“Are you all determined to force us?” a four-headed tigerman asked menacingly.

“Haha, you’ve revealed your true colors now!” Shi Zhonghe laughed loudly. Outsiders would definitely have ulterior motives.

“Move!” Wu Feng said. There were already over 80 of them here. In terms of numbers, they only had a slight disadvantage, so they were completely able to start a battle now.

The two sides instantly became hostile, and battle could start at any moment.

“Wait!” Ling Han stepped out. “Why don’t we give each other a chance? You, you, you, you…” He randomly pointed out a few people. “Can you guarantee that you will not die after the battle ends?”

Those people were all mute. How could this possibly be guaranteed?

“What we are fighting is a long-term war, so every single bit of power has to be made use of,” Ling Han continued.

“You have indeed betrayed us!” He Liqun declared sinisterly.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and then took a stand right in the middle between both sides. “Sure then. Anyone who is going to attack today will have to go through me first!”

“Ling Han!” everyone shouted, all having varying thoughts.

“You truly wish to work for Hysteria?” Geng Xuandan questioned coldly.

Ling Han shook his head. “I am not working for anyone. I only want to unite all powers at disposal to fight against Hysteria, and I have no wish to see a battle that originally could have been avoided cause bloodshed and deaths of our own people.”

“Then there is nothing else left to say.” Wang Xiangrong shook his head as his killing intent blazed.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Immediately, several people moved at the same time, all of them charging towards Ling Han.

He Liqun, Wang Xiangrong, Baili Ge, Geng Xuandan… Basically, they were all the elites that could make their ways into the recent leaderboard of the various levels. These people all attacked simultaneously, their combined battle prowess extremely terrifying.

Ling Han humphed, and threw out a punch. Peng! These people were sent flying backwards at the same time, unable to withstand even a single strike from him.

In this place where cultivation level was suppressed, his battle prowess could attain peak-stage Third Tier, so who would be a capable match for him?

Gasp!

... ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone inhaled sharply. This battle prowess was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

“Now can you listen to me calmly?” Ling Han crossed his arms behind his back, his eyes sweeping over them. Even Second Tier Heavenly Venerates couldn’t help but feel their hearts shudder.

He Liqun had taken a very terrible fall. He gritted his teeth in pain while simultaneously shouting at Ling Han, “Ling Han, do you truly want to become enemies with the whole world?”

Ling Han smiled faintly. “Don’t flatter yourself. You are not yet qualified to represent the world.”

He Liqun gritted his teeth. He was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Whichever medium-level dimension he was in, he was a supreme existence, so why couldn’t he speak for the world?

Xiu, xiu, xiu! More and more people came in, causing the numbers of the Flaming Frost Realm to reach as many as 200. In terms of numbers, they had already attained a complete upper hand.

“Facing traitors, there is no need to speak of rules. We attack together,” Shen Fei declared, and was the first to step out.
