Chapter 1778: Persuasion

‘Young Master Hai? Fu Tonghai?’

Ling Han came to a sudden understanding. Because of him, Fu Gaoyun was now enjoying an ever-increasing amount of support. Moreover, having the support of two three-star alchemists was far too mighty and impressive. It was also because of this that Fu Tonghai was unable to remain calm.

If this continued, Fu Gaoyun would definitely become the legitimate successor to the position of clan leader.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “I’m not familiar with Fu Tonghai, am I?”

“How are you not?” Liu Huaiyu asked with a charming and dainty smile. Her smile was as beautiful as 100 flowers in full blossom. Moreover, her charm techniques were extremely high-level, and they didn’t rely on her selling her body or physically seducing others. Just her movements and her smiles were enough to charm one to the extreme.

“As long as you can converse, there will naturally be something to talk about,” she said. She twirled her hair, revealing a small portion of her smooth and jade-like ear. However, she immediately released her hair to cover it again, and this would make one’s mind become itchy with thirst.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “Yeh, maybe not.”

“Young Master Han, are you trying to make things difficult for this humble servant?” Liu Huaiyu said with an aggrieved expression. Her expression not only elicited sympathy, but it would also rile one’s lust. Upon seeing her expression, one would feel a strong urge to grab her body and toy with her beautiful and voluptuous curves.

However, Ling Han was completely unfazed. Liu Huaiyu’s charm techniques were indeed powerful, and they perfectly complemented the natural charm of her body. However, he faced the Empress every day, so how could he not endure this kind of temptation?

He smiled, and said, “Lady Liu, please return?”

“Young Master Han, are you afraid that your two wives will be jealous?” Liu Huaiyu asked with a silvery laugh. She covered her dainty mouth, and she continued, “With Young Master Han’s godly talent, it won’t be excessive even if you have 200 wives, to say nothing of two wives.

“Moreover...” Her eyes were filled with seduction, and she said, “We still haven’t done anything... yet!”

Her words were filled with ambiguity and temptation. They still hadn’t done anything yet, so did this mean that they would do something later?

Ling Han waved his hand, saying, “Servants, see this visitor away!”

Liu Huaiyu hurriedly dashed over, and exclaimed, “Young Master Han!” She grabbed his arm and lightly swayed it. She then leaned her slender body onto him, and she said, “Don’t be so heartless! If it’s necessary, this humble servant will do anything that you ask!”

Her eyes were filled with pity, and her lips were as red as flames. It was as if she could be easily sparked by others.

Ling Han could clearly feel the firmness of Liu Huaiyu’s breasts through his arm, yet he still resolutely pulled it away from her embrace. “Show this guest the door.”

“Young Master Han!” Liu Huaiyu exclaimed. Her expression faltered, and she immediately wiped the charming expression from her face. At this moment, her expression was filled with seriousness, and it was as if she were an inviolable maiden.

This transformation was far too quick, so much so that Ling Han could barely come to his senses.

“Young Master Han, as the saying goes, it’s in man’s nature to strive for better,” Liu Huaiyu said with a smile. She was still smiling, yet her smile didn’t give off a shred of charm anymore. The transformation of her aura was simply astounding.

“As the saying also goes, a fine fowl perches only on a fine tree.

“Although Fu Gaoyun’s reputation is rising, how can he compare to the profound potential and experience of Young Master Hai?

“If Young Master Han allies with Young Master Hai, that will be an alliance between giants. At that time, the position of future clan leader will definitely go to Young Master Hai. Moreover, Young Master Hai has also agreed to designate Young Master Han as his first subordinate force at that time. In fact, Young Master Hai will even allow you to build your own city!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Building his own city—this was quite a hefty promise.

Of course, Fu Tonghai’s promises were one matter, and whether he fulfilled them was another matter altogether. Making empty promises was extremely easy and common. There was definitely no shortage of people who went back on their word.

Anyhow, Liu Huaiyu’s words were extremely colorful and extravagant.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “I’m destined to become a Celestial King in the future, so are you perhaps underestimating my value?”

Liu Huaiyu was stunned upon hearing this.

She had come across overconfident people before, and she had also come across those who made arrogant claims because they wanted to impress her. Compared to Ling Han, however, their claims were absolutely pathetic.

Becoming a Celestial King?

Gasp!

Celestial Kings were the most powerful beings in the Celestial Realm. Just a single shadow of theirs could crush heaven and earth. These were paramount beings the prodigies and king tiers could only look up to.

In fact, even as supremely talented as he was, Fu Tonghai only dared to set a goal of reaching the Immortal Palace Tier. Perhaps his luck would be explosive, and he might even have a chance to advance to the Ascending Origin Tier in the future. However, the Celestial King Tier? He wouldn’t dare to even dream of this.

Even among Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of top-notch sects who had limitless amounts of resources to burn, only fewer than one in 10,000 of them would ultimately succeed in becoming a Celestial King.

Celestials possessed a limitless lifespan, and Celestial Kings were more so the most powerful beings in the world. According to rumors, they could extinguish their Immortal’s Tribulation with a wave of their hand. These beings were invincible and undying. Even so, only extremely few of them existed in the world.

Why was this?

This was because it was far too difficult to become a Celestial King. Perhaps a new Celestial King would only appear once every 100 billion years or one trillion years.

Thus, Liu Huaiyu would have simply chuckled in reply if Ling Han had made any other bold claim. However, claiming that he would become a Celestial King? She couldn’t laugh even if she wanted to.

In the Celestial Realm, Celestial Kings represented paramount might and invincibility. If one couldn’t reach this height, then they could only gaze up in respect and reverence.

Liu Huaiyu faltered for a long while before eventually stammering, “Young Master Han... what an incredible aspiration!”

However, her words definitely weren’t that of praise. Ling Han was only a measly first severance junior, and he only had the support of two three-star alchemists. Yet, he was actually boasting that he would become a Celestial King?

If word of this spread, others would definitely treat him as if he were an utter fool.

Ling Han’s voice was calm, and he said, “If Fu Tonghai can help me reach the Celestial King Tier, I won’t mind going over to meet him. Otherwise, don’t waste my time.”

‘Holy sh*t!’

Liu Huaiyu almost slapped him in the face. If Fu Tonghai knew how to become a Celestial King, would he still give a toss about becoming the clan leader of the Fu Clan? 100,000,000 positions of clan leader wouldn’t be worth the position of Celestial King!

She was truly rendered speechless.

When others talked business, they all asked for exorbitant benefits while eventually settling for decent prices. However, Ling Han’s request was simply astronomical! How could she reply to him?

“Then... this humble servant will ask for Young Master Hai’s instructions,” Liu Huaiyu said. She finally stood up to leave, and her expression was slightly flustered.

This was the first time that she had become so flustered before a man, and this was also the first time that she had failed to convince her target. This was a crushing blow, and she couldn’t help but suspect that her charm had weakened.

Two hours later, another person came to visit.

This person was none other than Fu Tonghai, one of the four potential successors of the Fu Clan.

He was a charming man, and he was brimming with the demeanor of a king tier. Women would definitely be attracted by him, and men would definitely be impressed by him.

“I’m Fu Tonghai!” he introduced with a loud laugh as he entered Ling Han’s courtyard.

Ling Han nodded in reply, saying, “Brother Hai.”

“Brother Ling, you’re a man of great aspirations, and coincidentally, so am I. Why don’t we team up to build a beautiful future?” There was eager anticipation on Fu Tonghai’s face as he gazed at Ling Han, and his warm enthusiasm was such that he could easily soften others and cause them to impulsively agree to his requests.

It was no wonder that even a seductively charming woman like Liu Huaiyu was willing to serve him. His demeanor and presence were truly outstanding.
