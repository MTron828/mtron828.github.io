Chapter 1348 Zhao Ku

This man was extremely young, looking no more than 25 years old. However, taking into account the incredibly long lifespan of Immortals, one’s appearance definitely wasn’t an accurate reflection of their age.

This person... was actually at the Heavenly Body Tier! However, he was only at the early stage of the medium extreme.

Moreover, he was definitely over 1,000,000 years old as well. However, considering the long lifespan of Heavenly Body Tier elites, he was clearly still in the prime of his life.

He had reached the Heavenly Body Tier at around 1,000,000 years old, and this was certainly a feat to be proud of. Thus, it was no wonder that he had his nose in the air.

“Our respects to Young Master Ku!” The members of the Earth Dragon Sect all kneeled down in greeting.

To say nothing of this young man’s background, just his cultivation level alone was enough to subdue the members of the Earth Dragon Sect.

“Rise,” the young man said with a wave of his hand. He appeared extremely casual and relaxed. He swept his gaze around, and upon seeing that Ling Han and the others were still sitting around and eating, his expression instantly changed.

He turned to face them, saying, “You people, why didn’t you kneel upon seeing me?”

“You dare to make Grandpa Ginseng kneel? Have you eaten too much sh*t?!” The old ginseng jumped up and down in anger. He had already been jealous that this young man had so many beautiful women surrounding him. Now, this young man was even acting so haughty and arrogant! How could he not be infuriated?

The young man had only been slightly irritated before. However, after hearing the old ginseng’s words, his expression instantly became even colder. “12 beauties, what are you waiting for? Capture that ginseng for me! I’ll make sure to pleasure you well tonight!”

“Understood, Young Master!” The 12 beauties smiled as they curtseyed, an alluring blush on their faces and a charming look in their eyes.

The old ginseng couldn’t help but stare. “Beauties, why don’t you come with Grandpa Ginseng instead? My ‘essence’ is definitely extremely nutritious!”

“It’ll be better to make you into ginseng soup!” The 12 beauties attacked in unison. Surprisingly, they were all at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, they were all extremely skilled at a combination attack formation. Not only could this formation unleash their combined power at once, but it could even buff their power by a significant amount. Thus, the power of their strike was almost at the Heavenly Body Tier.

That being the case, how would the old ginseng dare to face it? He gave a weird shriek before turning around to flee.

His cultivation wasn’t high, yet his speed was unbelievably quick. He arrived behind Ling Han in the blink of an eye. He then poked his head out, saying, “Ladies, come get me if you dare!” He then turned to Ling Han, and said, “Little Han, suppress those little vixens for me. Grandpa Ginseng will provide them with guidance every night and make sure that they give up evil and return to good.”

The 12 beauties were furious. How was the mouth of this ginseng so toxic?

“It’s better that we cook you into soup!” They were naturally unafraid of Ling Han. After all, they were even capable of battling against Heavenly Body Tier elites when they teamed up!

Ling Han raised a hand.

Weng!

His aura rippled through the air as it surged toward the 12 beauties.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The 12 beauties instantly collapsed to the ground. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This was heaven’s might, and those who were stronger than Ling Han would have their battle prowess detrimentally affected. As for those who were weaker than him, they wouldn’t even have the opportunity to battle against him. All they could do was lie on the ground and wait for death.

The young man glared at Ling Han, and said, “Impudence! You even dared to attack my maids? Are you seeking death?”

His name was Zhao Ku, and his background was astonishing—he was the only child of an Eternal River Tier elite of the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire. Thus, he was extremely flamboyant wherever he went; he was already accustomed to a life of luxury.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “This matter has got nothing to do with you. I suggest you go back wherever you came from!”

“Haha!” Zhao Ku couldn’t help but laugh in anger. What the hell, they were still in the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire, yet someone actually dared to speak to him like this? His voice became menacing, and he said, “Immediately kneel down and beg me for forgiveness. If I’m satisfied, perhaps I’ll spare your life. However...”

He gazed at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, a look of intoxication on his face. “This woman, she’s mine!”

He had seen many beautiful women before, but he had never seen a woman as beautiful and regal as the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

The 12 beauties had all been chosen extremely carefully. Not only were they beautiful, but they were also extremely talented in cultivation. However, compared to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, the gulf between them was like night and day.

Feng Po Yun and the others were all infuriated upon hearing this. Meanwhile, Jiang Yuefeng and some others immediately spoke back in rebuke. This was their master’s wife!

Ling Han’s expression also became cold, and he said, “You’re seeking death!”

He knew that this young man definitely had an Eternal River Tier elite behind him. However, hadn’t he killed Xie Donglai without hesitation? So, why would he be afraid now?

“Humph! You’re pretty ballsy, aren’t you? However, do you know who I am?” Zhao Ku asked haughtily.

He loved throwing that question at others. Generally speaking, people would all be scared sh*tless when they learned of his identity, regardless of who they were. They would then become incredibly obedient and obsequious, afraid that they would accidentally offend him.

“My father is Zhao Zuyi!”

Zhao Zuyi was a legendary individual in the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire. According to legends, he had been a nameless disciple in some sect before. However, in a stroke of great fortune, he had entered a cave by accident, and discovered the lost ultimate techniques of the sect.

He started to become stronger after this discovery, and he gradually made a name for himself. Afterward, he would always discover great opportunities just as he neared the end of his lifespan. In this way, he continued to become stronger, and he continued to advance to higher cultivation levels.

Hundreds of millions of years ago, Zhao Zuyi had already been an old and seemingly near-death elder. However, hundreds of millions of years later, his condition and appearance were still exactly the same as before.

Right now, he was already over 300,000,000 years old. However, would he come across another great opportunity and advance to the Genesis Tier when he neared the end of his lifespan? No one knew.

However, because he had slowly ground his way to this position from a no-name weakling, Zhao Zuyi didn’t exactly possess the demeanor of an elite. He had all the traits and bad habits of normal people. For example, he was lustful, and he also loved fame. He also had countless wives and mistresses, but for some reason, he only had a single child—Zhao Ku.

In any case, he had named his son Zhao Ku[1] in the hopes of avoiding misfortune. He didn’t want the heavens to feel jealous and eliminate the only descendent of the Zhao Clan.

The members of the Earth Dragon Sect all wore looks of arrogance and haughtiness. Their founding ancestor had been a guard for Zhao Zuyi’s residence before, and although this wasn’t any deep relationship, it was still a little something.

Now that their sect was facing an existential crisis, they had naturally recalled their relationship with Zhao Zuyi. Thus, they had sent someone to ask for help. They coincidentally came across Zhao Ku along the way, and after gifting him a few beautiful women, Zhao Ku had agreed to come over and help.

It wasn’t that Zhao Ku was satisfied with their gifts, just that he had been cultivating for a long time and wanted to go out for a spin.

Ling Han was completely unfazed. Say, he had already obtained the secret technique, the Tide of the Ages, and become intertwined with the karma of some force in the Celestial Realm. So, why would he be afraid of an Eternal River Tier elite?

He looked at Zhao Ku, and said, “If you really want to seek death, I’ll grant you your wish!”

Descendents of elites like Zhao Ku would chase people like rabid dogs if they dared to disobey their will. This kind of dog couldn’t be taught obedience! If Ling Han simply shooed him away, he would definitely use the power of his clan to seek revenge.

Thus, since he would have to offend the Zhao Clan anyway, he might as well offend them all the way and kill Zhao Ku right here and now.

Anyhow, there were so many divine materials hanging on Zhao Ku’s carriage, so it would be a shame if he didn’t plunder it and make them his own.

“How dare you!!” Zhao Ku said with a cold sneer. Did this person really think that he was a profligate individual who could only borrow his father’s name to frighten others? He was an elite at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier! He was a genuine elite of the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire!

Moreover, as the descendent of an Eternal River Tier elite, would he not have powerful treasures to protect himself?

[1] ‘Ku’ literally means bitter or misery.
