2773 Retreat

Enemy attack!

Enemy attack here only meant one thing: Hysteria’s army came assaulting again.

Xiu, the seven young people who had been mocking Ling Han earlier immediately ran back, and paid no further regard to Ling Han.

“Let’s go back too,” Ling Han said.

He, together with the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou, went directly to the city wall, and immediately heard the rumbling noise coming from outside. The earth trembled, and the heaven and earth were moved.

“The attack this time… surpassed those in the past!” someone said.

“Listening to the movement, it’s absolutely terrifying. The scale of this attack is too large,” another person also said, his voice trembling.

It was no wonder that he couldn’t control himself. Under a large-scale attack, they would suffer countless casualties, and a super large-scale attack would not only cause more casualties, but even destroy the entire barrier, forcing them to pull back the defense line.

Ling Han was also a little startled because judging from the shaking of the ground, Hysteria’s army this time was indeed terrifying.

He looked at the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou. “Once the battle begins, go all out.”

The attack this time was extremely frightening. It was very likely that the barrier would no longer exist after this battle. Moreover, the next line of defense had yet to be completely constructed. Therefore, if this line of defense was lost, Hysteria’s army would march straight in unchallenged.

Of course, if they went in too deep, the Heavenly Venerates would not be suppressed by the heaven and earth of the two dimensions, and could fight at full strength, so a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate or a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate would be able to deal with the situation, but this meant a major defeat of the defense line.

The key to the war between the two dimensions lay in territory. As soon as they retreated, Hysteria would be able to forge ahead and devour the area. Such advancement would cause the acceleration of the demise of the Flaming Frost Realm.

Therefore, every inch of land had to be fought for, and could not be lost.

Both the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou nodded. They were also aware of the seriousness of this war.

Boom, the city defense launched an attack first, and the impact of multiple light waves caused great damage. The first rows of Hysteria’s army fell bit by bit, but the people standing at the top of the city wall turned pale in shock.

Because compared to before, the number of fallen troops was too small.

The reason was that… the body of every soldier of Hysteria’s army was shining with metallic light: some golden, some silver, black, green—all various colors, and very vivid.

“Divine Metal!” Everyone gasped.

In the previous period of war, Hysteria’s army came naked, without weapons and armor, but this time… it was different!

Although Divine Metal couldn’t completely block the impact of the light waves, it was the strongest existence at the level of Regulations, after all, and would be able to display some defensive effect. Furthermore, this was only the first spatial level, so the power of light waves was limited.

Had Hysteria not thought of it before?

Obviously it was impossible. It had just manifested into a dimension, but had not always been a dimension, without any reasoning ability.

This only proved that it did not have the ability to create Divine Metal on a large scale before, but now it was capable of doing it.

This was by no means good news, as it simply meant that Hysteria had gotten stronger.

Now everyone was not in the mood to think about this issue. A large number of Hysteria’s soldiers had already flown over the city wall and started a massive attack.

Their individual battle prowess was extremely strong. A three-headed tiger fluttered its wings and landed. The three heads spewed out flames, lightning, and black water, respectively, instantly causing great destruction.

“Ah!” Tragic screams could be heard over and over again. The three-headed tiger possessed the battle prowess of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, but the warriors here were mainly the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings; how could they stop a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate from showing his might?

Just as a single blow was about to cause heavy casualties, a loud bang was heard, and the three-headed tiger was blown up into a rain of blood.

Those few lucky people cast a glance, only to find that the person who had blasted the three-headed tiger with one punch and saved their lives was actually Ling Han!

Coincidentally, they were the ones who had previously taunted Ling Han at the Monument of Heroes. Now they were both shocked and ashamed to be saved by the one they had called “cripple’.”

“Live well.” Ling Han left them with these words, stood up immediately, and charged forwards.

“He, is he really a cripple?”

“No, he’s a hero!”

These people murmured.

***

Ling Han went on a killing rampage. His current strength was extremely high. Moreover, his strength came from himself, and was self-sustainable. Naturally, he wouldn’t be suppressed by the heaven and earth; no matter which dimension he was in, his battle prowess would not change in any way.

Peng!

He punched out, sending out a gust of power, which turned into a ball of light. Peng! A huge black wolf was immediately blown up, but the light ball did not dissipate, and continued to move forward. Peng! Peng! Peng! Seven monsters were killed in a single breath, and finally the energy was exhausted.

And this was just a casual strike for Ling Han.

His body was like lightning, zig-zagging through the long battle lines, and when he did strike, it didn’t matter whether one was Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate or not, as one would be blasted to smithereens anyway.

Everyone could see that a figure was zig-zagging and killing the enemies, displaying an invincible posture.

However, although Ling Han was very fast, he couldn’t cope with the front line that was too long. When he reached the other end, the barrier at that end had already fallen, and a large number of monsters poured into the city, killing on a large scale.

Ling Han roared, and charged back from the other end.

Wherever he was, the monsters at that place wouldn’t survive at all. However, he was only one person, after all, and was not capable of being everywhere at the same time.

“Retreat!” he shouted loudly. “Everyone retreat!”

Zhou Yan also knew that the defense line could no longer be defended. The scale of Hysteria’s army this time was far greater than before, and they were even equipped with Divine Metal, which greatly weakened the role of the city defense. If they were to engage in a fierce battle here, there was no way of knowing how many people would be sacrificed.

He issued an order for the main troops to retreat.

However, Ling Han stayed back. He had had some reservations earlier because the enemies were mixed in together with comrades, but as soon as the people were cleared, he could go all out and fight.

He drew Bewitching Maiden Rou into the Celestial Guest Residence. The Empress was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, and her power came from within herself, just like it was with him. Not only was her strength greater, but her power was also endless, so there was no need to worry about Ling Han’s wife lacking in strength.

Ling Han directly charged out of the barrier, and just like when he had fought with Wu Haoyang back then, he went on a killing rampage, only that this time it was the Empress by his side.

The two teamed up. Boom! They shot out a powerful blast that was like a tidal wave, and group after group of monsters fell consecutively. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

These main troops were not afraid of death, and all of them attacked, trying to kill Ling Han and the Empress.

10 Celestial Kings at the peak of the Ninth Heaven could contend against one Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were enough of a match for a real Heavenly Venerate. This being the case, how terrifying was the battle prowess of a few hundred thousand to tens of millions of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates here when they joined forces?

...

Ling Han didn’t want to give it a try at all. He descended to the ground so as not to become a living target in the skies.

He and the Empress fought among the monsters, using these monsters as shields. They only needed to withstand the attacks of the surrounding monsters, which numbered a few hundred at most—this was completely within the range that Ling Han and the Empress could bear.

Countless monsters had fallen, but still many of them had slipped through their fingers, and were charging towards the main troops.

Ling Han wasn’t able to control these things. Should he quickly give chase, he would definitely become a living target; he had no idea if he could block the attacks of so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Moreover, the war wasn’t just the matter of one person, so there was no need for him to take everything upon himself.

‘Kill!’
