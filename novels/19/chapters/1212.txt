Chapter 1213: Protecting His Disciple

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Wasn’t Ling Han a bumpkin who had come from a small world after opening the sky?

However, the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire had come to help him, and she had even dared to oppose Venerable Trinity. In any case, they were at least able to accept this. She had been suppressed by Venerable Trinity, and the massive gulf between their power had been evident.

It was this mysterious young girl who had descended from the sky that astounded them. She had insta-killed two elites who were at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier.

She was definitely at the Eternal River Tier, right?

Ling Han actually had such powerful reinforcements!

Even Empress Luan Xing felt slightly apprehensive. She hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would have such powerful support.

Although Notionless Saint was at the Genesis Tier, he had already been dead for heaven knew how many years. He had more so refined his own saintly might, so he was nothing more than a nutritious treasure. He would be completely useless in battle.

Anyhow, the young girl was clearly very attached to Ling Han. In fact, her attachment was already beyond all reason. It was as if she could slaughter everyone in the world as long as she could enjoy the warmth of Ling Han.

‘With such powerful feelings, she definitely becomes jealous very easily. Perhaps she’ll even kill me,’ Empress Luan Xing thought.

This wasn’t impossible.

Even Ling Han was astonished. He knew that the Roc Palace was very impressive, them being able to easily enter small worlds and all. This was something that even many large sects couldn’t do. Thus, Hu Niu would have definitely improved in leaps and bounds.

However, one had to realize that his cultivation speed wasn’t slow, either. No, it wasn’t just not slow, it was astonishingly quick! Who else in this galaxy could reach the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier before the age of 30?

Anyhow, he was certain that the Roc Palace wouldn’t let Hu Niu run around by herself. That old woman in cyan was definitely protecting her in secret. That old woman was terrifyingly powerful, so she didn’t need to worry about Hu Niu causing a commotion.

Even so, he was still stunned to discover that Hu Niu had become so powerful. She could kill Heavenly Body Tier elites at will, and her cultivation speed was so fast that he could only admit inferiority.

With Hu Niu as a comparison, could he still refer to himself as a prodigy? No, he was definitely an idiot, a massive idiot!

“Ling Han isn’t an idiot!” Hu Niu said. It was as if she had read his mind. She hugged him and pecked him on the cheek before saying, “Niu will help Ling Han become stronger!”

Everyone was rendered speechless. This young girl had been like a god of death just then, yet she was suddenly like a gentle girlfriend now. They could barely believe that this was the same person!

At this moment, they were extremely jealous of Ling Han.

Who was this person? He had won the heart of a breathtakingly beautiful and stunningly powerful elite. Moreover, this elite was a young girl who could be educated slowly. Just thinking about this gave them a nosebleed.

“Eh...” The pitiable Yang Hao stood up shakily. He had been knocked unconscious by Hu Niu’s stomp just then, so he was still unaware of the current situation. He simply felt very aggrieved. He had been knocked unconscious twice today!

He was the number one prodigy of the Majestic Heaven Sect, and he had more so been taken as a disciple of an Eternal River Tier. However, he had been knocked out twice immediately after enjoying this huge leap in status. How could he accept this?

Boom!

Yang Hao’s black hair shot up as he bristled in anger. Flames burst to life around him—the embodiment of his fury. He glared at Hu Niu.

Apart from her, there was no other newcomer present.

Thus, it was evidently her who had used some unknown technique to knock him unconscious.

He didn’t know what technique she had used, yet he was completely unafraid. After all, this was the Majestic Heaven Sect. Under the effects of his wild fury, he failed to notice the corpses of his two senior brothers lying on the ground. Meanwhile, Gao Huang and Hua Yangwen were still wailing in agony and vomiting mouthfuls of blood.

Yang Hao didn’t see or hear any of this. There was only a single thought in his mind at this moment, and that thought was revenge!

‘F*cking sh*t! Do you all think I’m a pushover?!’

“Hao’er!” Venerable Trinity finally opened his mouth. There was a strong sense of warning in his voice.

This young girl had insta-killed his two disciples, and he had actually failed to determine her cultivation. This astonished him greatly. Her cultivation level and strength definitely weren’t below his.

However, she was far too young, so Venerable Trinity didn’t believe that she could defeat him. What frightened him was her background.

Her sect or clan was capable of raising such a young Eternal River Tier elite—didn’t this mean that they were a Genesis Tier force?

An enraged Saint could annihilate an entire galaxy with a wave of their hand. Even Eternal River Tier elites were like ants before them! This was especially the case with him as he was only at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. The gulf between him and a Small Saint was unfathomable.

Thus, he decided to swallow this loss.

“Master!” Yang Hao felt extremely aggrieved. Why was Venerable Trinity stopping him? Didn’t he see his handsome face being trampled into the ground? Just how humiliating was that?

Everyone around him shook their heads furiously. They prayed that Yang Hao wouldn’t provoke Ling Han anymore.

That person was a bringer of misfortune!

‘Can’t you see? Two Heavenly Body Tier elites have already been killed, and another two Sun Moon Tier elites are clearly in their death throes. If you provoke him any more, you’ll definitely be crushed to death as well.

‘You’re merely a disciple of Venerable Trinity, but what about Han Ling? He’s the lover of an Eternal River Tier elite! Is there any comparison at all?’

Yang Hao was beside himself with fury. However, he didn’t dare to disobey Venerable Trinity’s command. He forcefully suppressed his anger and stood with his hands by his sides.

However, even though he suppressed his anger, would Hu Niu let him off so easily?

These people actually dared to interrogate her Ling Han! They all deserved to die!

She swept her gaze over Empress Luan Xing, and her killing intent was evident. ‘How irritating! I just dragged those other women away from Ling Han, yet another one had come? Fortunately, she isn’t as beautiful as Niu. I can be at ease.’

This was because she hadn’t seen the true appearance of Empress Luan Xing. Otherwise, she definitely wouldn’t feel at ease.

“A measly being like you actually dared to feel jealous of Niu’s Ling Han?!” Hu Niu decided to start from the greatest culprit first. She glared at Yang Hao, and said, “Niu’s going to exterminate you!”

Yang Hao found this quite amusing. She was a young girl who referred to herself as “Niu”1, so how powerful could she be? She was clearly a naive and effeminate girl who had just stepped into the real world.

However, this young girl was far too beautiful. Yang Hao felt that the sum of all the beauties he had seen in his entire life was only barely able to rival the beauty of this innocent girl. His flames of anger were quickly extinguished by her charisma.

Meanwhile, Hu Niu launched an attack at him.

Boom!

It was as if heaven were collapsing as countless meteors rained down from the sky. Raging flames seared through the sky, and the main peak of the Majestic Heaven Sect tremored dangerously. It was an apocalyptic scene.

Yang Hao instantly wet himself in fright.

‘What f*cking cultivation does she have? She unleashed a single technique, yet it’s as if heaven and earth are collapsing and the universe is imploding!’ UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Stop!” Venerable Trinity finally stepped in.

He hadn’t reacted in time when his other two disciples had been killed just then. After all, even he hadn’t imagined that Hu Niu would be so powerful. However, Yang Hao was his newest disciple, and he had extremely high hopes for him. Yang Hao definitely couldn’t die.

This was a technique unleashed by an Eternal River Tier elite.

Weng!

A silver river flowed from his body, and it was as if it could connect past with present. The silver river raised his aura to the extreme.

Pa, pa, pa!

Everyone in the Majestic Heaven Sect collapsed to the ground. This aura was far too terrifying; this was the overwhelming pressure from a transcendent being!

Meanwhile, the silver river formed a barrier around Yang Hao, forming almost the strongest defense in the world.
