3083 Becoming Hostile

Ling Han absorbed energy as if his life depended on it, and new dimensions were born one after another inside his body. While this happened, the older dimensions also continued to grow more powerful, advancing toward the transcendent level.

It was unknown how long had passed, but his body suddenly shuddered at some moment, after which a burst of power surged through him.

One of his dimensions had reached the transcendent level.

Immediately afterward, a second dimension reached the transcendent level, and then a third, a fourth, and so on… The dimensions inside him continued to advance to the transcendent level.

Time continued to fly past. Right now, the number of dimensions inside Ling Han had already gone from over 400,000 to over 1,000,000. Moreover, over half of them had already reached the transcendent level.

There were still more dimensions being born, and there were still more dimensions advancing to the transcendent level.

Ling Han truly didn’t dare to imagine just how powerful he was now.

One transcendent dimension alone was already equivalent to at least 10 ultimate elites at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. Right now, he was about to reach a whopping 1,000,000 transcendent dimensions in his body. Just how devastating would his power be?

It would be far superior to the destroyed Genesis World.

‘Huh?’

Ling Han was slightly surprised. He discovered that the flow of energy had slowed down.

It wasn’t that he was losing to Extermination and absorbing less energy than her, but rather… less energy was being provided to them by the void. Thus, the flow of energy naturally slowed down.

Ling Han pondered this for a moment before coming to a sudden realization. He and Extermination had exhausted the energy in the void.

However, the void was boundless, so how could it be exhausted?

They had never been to the edges of the void, but since it could be regarded as a “small pond,” this implied that there was definitely a boundary. It was only because the void was far too large compared to Ling Han and the others that they had never been able to reach this boundary.

In any case, just how much energy had Ling Han and Extermination absorbed?

Ling Han had cultivated 1,000,000 realms to the transcendent level! This was absolutely terrifying! Extermination was inferior to Ling Han, yet she had probably been able to cultivate at least 100,000 dimensions to the transcendent level as well.

The two of them had actually exhausted the void!

It wasn’t long before the last wisp of energy also disappeared. At this moment, the void had truly become void. Not even a sliver of energy remained.

“What?!”

In the distance, the brawling Hysteria, Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and the others had no option but to stop.

They were unable to extract any more energy from the void to replenish what they were expending. In fact, they couldn’t even sense the fundamental particles anymore.

How could they not be stunned?

Once they used up all of their energy, they would also slowly weaken, with their battle prowess falling from the Seventh Tier bit by bit, all the way until they became mere mortals.

This caused them to feel deep astonishment and fear.

“Hahahaha!” Extermination roared with laughter, and her raven hair billowed in the void. There were over 100,000 transcendent dimensions in her body, and this resulted in her power growing hundreds of millions-fold compared to before.

After planning and scheming for so long, she had finally achieved her goal. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Extermination!!” Hysteria roared. Its previous self had stolen its great opportunity from right under its nose! This caused it to boil with fury.

“Hmph! Just who do you think you are?!” Extermination said as she launched a palm strike at Hysteria.

Hysteria brandished a tentacle to block this attack, yet its tentacle was immediately severed, causing golden blood to spray through the air. This released a small amount of energy back into the desolate void.

“Pathetically weak!” Extermination said coldly.

Everyone inhaled sharply. Hysteria had once been invincible, yet it was now this fragile and weak?

Extermination looked at Chong Yan and the other ultimate elites from the Genesis World of the last era. An eerie smile appeared on her face, and she said, “I’m so sorry that I’ve disappointed you people. However, I had no other option. None of you have grasped the secret codes of life, so how can you possibly advance to the Eighth Tier?

“However, I can still bring you people out of this place and lead you into a new world.

“Perhaps this new world is infinitely large, and perhaps the great opportunities in our current world are nothing compared to what lies in this new world.”

Even though Chong Yan and the four others were extremely pissed off by her words, the only thing they could do right now was to suppress their anger and accept this reality.

Since it was impossible for them to reach the Eighth Tier, then only one other path remained open to them. That was to leave this place.

In fact, they had also tried to enter the doorway of light just then, yet they had suffered the exact same fate as Hysteria. It was as if the doorway didn’t exist at all.

Anyhow, once they left and entered that larger world, perhaps they would quickly find an opportunity to advance to the Eighth Tier?

They would continue to tolerate Extermination for the moment!

Chong Yan and the others flew toward Extermination, all of them eagerly looking forward to a bright and beautiful future.

Ling Han didn’t stop them. He wasn’t in a hurry. Extermination had indeed become countless times more powerful than before. However, had he not?

He could only be more powerful than her!

Everything was within his grasp.

Chong Yan and the four others, as well as Golden Silk Moth and Ten Thousand Shadows, all flew toward Extermination. A glorious future awaited them.

“Extremely eager, aren’t you?” Extermination said with an eerie smile. “Do you want to see the world that lies beyond this small pond?”

Expressions of yearning appeared on the faces of Chong Yan and the others. They had already reached the end of their cultivation path, and it was impossible for them to take another step further. The only way they could advance was by jumping out of this heaven and earth.

Curiosity was a trait shared by everyone. This was especially the case for powerful beings like them, and they were even more eager to see what lay beyond their own heaven and earth.

And the answer to this question… was about to be revealed.

Pu!

A streak of blood squirted into the air.

Something unexpected happened.

Extermination suddenly lashed out, stabbing her hand into Chong Yan’s back and thrusting it forward so that it exited from his chest. Clasped in her slender hand was a beating heart.

“Aaargh…!” Chong Yan wailed in agony.

What did it matter that he was a Seventh Tier ultimate elite? Standing before Extermination, his once invincible physique was now as fragile as paper. It was completely unable to resist her attack.

Extermination withdrew her hand, causing Chong Yan to instantly fall forward into the void. His face was as white as a sheet.

Seventh Tier elites were undying, and they could stay alive even if their hearts were destroyed. However, it was also because of this that each part of their body was extremely precious. After losing their heart, it would take them heaven knew how long to grow a new one.

Why had Extermination suddenly attacked him?

Was she killing her meritorious subordinates now? She no longer had a need for them, so she was going to exterminate them now?

Shatter Mountains, Golden Silk Moth, and the others hurriedly shot back in retreat, their eyes filled with shock and terror as they looked at Extermination.

Once rulers of the world, these Seventh Tier elites were now no longer the high and mighty beings of the past. Standing before Ling Han and Extermination, they were so weak that they were barely worth a mention. Meanwhile, the once peerless Hysteria could only be regarded as a second-tier force.

Hysteria had also tried to kill Chong Yan, Lin Luo, and the others just then, but it had only been able to suppress them and not kill them. In comparison, it was abundantly clear that Extermination and Ling Han were now countless times more powerful than it.

“Why?!” Chong Yan howled in rage. Losing his heart was a grave wound that would require tens of billions of years to recover from. However, the Genesis World had already been destroyed, and the energy in the void had already been exhausted. So, how could he possibly recover?

A cruel smile spread across Extermination’s face. She lashed out again, and the sound of shattering bones sounded again and again. Shatter Mountains, Big Dipper, and the two other ultimate elites from the Genesis World of the last era all suffered harrowing fates. Their arms and legs were crushed, and their hearts and lungs were also plucked.

Was she torturing them?

Lin Luo and the others all shook their heads. No matter how they looked at it, it seemed as if Extermination was exacting revenge on them for some personal grievance.

Extermination… wasn’t truly Extermination. Instead, this person had simply taken control of this body. So, just who in the world was she? What kind of grudges did she hold against Chong Yan and the others?

“Are you people curious about who I really am?” Extermination asked with a cold smile.
