Chapter 1431 Unrefined King Tier

“Halt!” Ling Han and the others were stopped just as they neared the foot of the mountain. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This was a group of extremely haughty youths. They were clearly only the followers of some king tiers, yet all of them were as haughty as could be. It was as if their eyes were on their foreheads as they belittled and looked down on everyone else.

However, one had to admit that these followers were indeed very powerful. They were all at the Heavenly Body Tier, and one of them had even reached the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Perhaps this person’s cultivation was even higher than that of many the king tiers.

However, those who could obtain the title of king tier certainly hadn’t done so because of a high cultivation level. Rather, they had obtained this title because of their battle prowess against those at the same cultivation level.

Only those who could obliterate everyone at the same cultivation level had the right to obtain the title of king tier!

Ling Han glanced at them, and asked, “Why?”

“The king tiers are currently tasting tea and discussing dao, so all uninvolved persons are prohibited from disturbing them!” a youth in purple robes answered indifferently. He didn’t so much as glance at Ling Han and the others.

Ling Han involuntarily chuckled, and asked, “Does your clan own this mountain?”

“N-no,” the young man in purple subconsciously answered, shaking his head as he spoke.

“Then what the hell are you stopping us for?” Ling Han chided.

“You...!” The young man in purple was enraged, flames of anger burning in his eyes. However, upon recalling his master’s words, he forcefully suppressed his anger, waving his hand and saying, “Anyhow, no one is allowed to ascend the mountain today.”

“Then why are there people atop the mountain?” Ling Han asked. He was in quite a good mood, so he started to debate with the youth.

The young man in purple was exasperated, and he replied, “If there’s no one, how can they taste tea and discuss dao?”

“Exactly! Since others can ascend the mountain, why can’t we?” Ling Han chuckled, and continued, “Perhaps the tea is too expensive? Rest assured, this brother is rich. Very rich!”

‘It’s useless regardless of how rich you are. That’s a gathering of king tiers! Even ordinary prodigies don’t have the right to attend.’

The young man in purple was already rendered speechless by Ling Han. How was this person so good at sophism? He paused for a moment before asking, “Do you have the right to attend this gathering? Are you very powerful?”

“Why not?” Ling Han retorted with a smile. “Although I might not look sturdy, I can battle against five of you with no problem!”

“If you can defeat me, I’ll allow you to ascend the mountain!” Although the young man in purple had only exchanged a few words with Ling Han, he had already become extremely annoyed and exasperated. At this moment, he finally couldn’t contain himself any longer.

Ling Han looked at his companions, and asked, “What about them?”

The other followers were all spectating an interesting show at this moment, and they couldn’t help but chuckle upon hearing this, replying, “If you can defeat Wen Dong, we’ll allow all of you to pass.”

“Deal!” Ling Han started to stretch his body.

Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden both smiled faintly. They were wearing cloaks at this moment, with even their beautiful faces covered by their clothing. Otherwise, they would definitely cause a huge commotion. After all, there were far too many Heavenly Body Tier elites here, meaning that ordinary methods wouldn’t be able to hide their beauty.

Beside them, the Rain Emperor had his arms crossed before his chest. He naturally felt it beneath him to battle against such small fry. Anyhow, he wasn’t feeling impatient at all. After all, the king tiers atop the mountain weren’t going to run away.

The young man in purple was called Wen Dong, and upon seeing Ling Han’s strange stretches, he couldn’t help but chuckle in scorn.

“How about this,” he said. “There’s no need for us to battle. I’ll stand here and let you punch me three times. If you can push me back even a single step, I’ll make an exception and allow you guys to ascend the mountain.”

The other followers all giggled and laughed. They were all supreme prodigies, meaning that they were at least four-star geniuses. In other words, they were far more powerful than those at the same cultivation level. Although Wen Dong was allowing Ling Han to punch him three times, it would be incredibly easy for him to withstand these punches as long as he used his Origin Power to guard his body.

“No kidding?” Ling Han asked, purposefully looking toward Wen Dong in mock excitement.

“Why would I trick you?” Wen Dong said in disdain. In reality, what did it matter even if they allowed Ling Han and the others to ascend the mountain? Could they resist the strange power of this strange mountain? Even prodigies such as them found it extremely difficult to resist this power! Only king tiers could resist this strange power as if it were nothing.

“Then please excuse me!” Ling Han said with a chuckle. He was just about to launch a strike, but he suddenly paused, asking, “Should I use my full power?”

“Of course!” Wen Dong answered proudly.

“What if I accidentally kill you?” Ling Han asked apologetically.

Wen Dong felt like pulling his own hair out. ‘You think you can kill me with your measly power? What an absolute joke!’ He humphed, and said, “Punch me as hard as you can.”

“But I can’t! If I truly kill you, your parents will definitely come and cause a ruckus. And also your aunties and grandparents and whatnot! What will I do at that time?” Ling Han shook his head, and it was as if he wouldn’t use his full power no matter what.

Wen Dong’s face twitched, and his voice involuntarily went up a pitch. “I’ve told you to attack, so just bloody attack! If you can truly wound me, I’ll admit that you’re powerful. I won’t complain even if you kill me. The people here are all witnesses!”

Ling Han breathed a long sigh of relief, saying, “Thanks for the assurance!” It was as if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulders.

‘F*ck! Do you truly think that you can kill me?!’

Wen Dong felt incredibly irritated at this moment, and he had a strong urge to beat someone up. However, upon recalling his own promise, he could only humph heavily, and said, “Can you attack now?”

Ling Han was delighted upon hearing this, and he said, “Second Brother, Brother Xu, Wives, have you ever seen such a despicable person before? He’s actually asking to be beaten up!”

“No!” the Rain Emperor and the others replied, smiling as they shook their heads. Even the Notionless Saint was smiling faintly.

Pu!

Even the other followers couldn’t help but splutter with laughter. They felt that Ling Han was far too malicious. He had actually dug such a huge trap for Wen Dong!

Wen Dong was naturally enraged, and it was as if flames were bursting from his eyes. He was just about to attack.

“Hey, what are you doing? Didn’t we reach an agreement?” Ling Han immediately said.

Wen Dong’s raised fist froze in the air. He was a supreme prodigy, after all, so he naturally cared about his reputation. Under the watchful gazes of everyone, how could he go back on his own words? He was simmering with anger as he lowered his fist, and it was as if there were a ball of pain in his chest.

He swore that he would definitely give Ling Han trouble after allowing him to throw his three punches.

Ling Han’s expression suddenly became serious as he started to channel his Origin Power. He raised his right fist and gathered heaven’s might, unleashing a devastating aura into the surroundings.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Many of the surrounding spectators instantly collapsed to the ground.

This was heaven’s might, and it would render those under Ling Han’s cultivation level completely defenseless! Even if one were above Ling Han’s cultivation level, their power would still be forcefully suppressed by two stars.

Wen Dong’s expression changed drastically.

His cultivation was equivalent to Ling Han’s, with both of them at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. As such, he didn’t collapse to the ground in fright. However, upon sensing the formidable aura emanating from Ling Han’s body, an ice-cold chill involuntarily rose in his heart.

This man definitely wasn’t an ordinary Heavenly Body Tier elite. Nor was he a supreme prodigy. He... was a f*cking king tier!

He had been a follower of a king tier for so long, so how could he not realize this?

Wen Dong wanted to cry. They were at the same cultivation level, so how could he block three punches from a king tier? To say nothing of three punches, he wouldn’t even be able to block a single punch!

He had been screwed over!

A look of grief spread across his face. This crude and unrefined king tier had screwed him over twice!

“I admit defeat! I admit defeat!” he hurriedly shouted. If he were struck by this punch, he would truly have died for nothing. After all, hadn’t he said so himself? Ling Han wouldn’t need to take responsibility even if he killed him.

“You’re admitting defeat already?” There was a look of disappointment on Ling Han’s face, and he continued, “You’ve at least got to let me punch you once, right?” He started to haggle with Wen Dong.

“No!” Wen Dong shouted, shaking his head furiously.

Ling Han looked toward the other followers, and said, “How about one of you replace him?”

“No!” the followers shouted, all shaking their heads frantically.

Only then did Ling Han say, “This mountain isn’t owned by your clans, is it? Does it feel awesome and mighty to control entry to this mountain?”

The spectators finally understood that Ling Han wasn’t pretending to be weak to bully them. Rather, he had purposefully pretended to be weak to give these haughty followers a lesson.
