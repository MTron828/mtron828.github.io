Chapter 2458: Tiger Caging Canyon

The Tiger Caging Canyon was a narrow canyon. The cliff walls on either side were thousands of meters tall. They were tall, steep, and thin, as if two sharp blades.

Looking from afar, the cliff walls were enshrouded in a black fog, and looked like a haunted mountain.

“All right, you guys find somewhere to hide,” Ling Han said.

The Empress and the other women left together, while Ling Han took a deep breath, and strode towards the Tiger Caging Canyon.

He was very curious about who exactly was behind this scheme.

Dongfang Rui? Xuan Rong? Yu Wudi? Or was it some other random character?

Ling Han did not hide his movements, and simply strode towards the canyon boldly like that. However, his energy was already adjusted to its prime condition. He could unleash the most powerful blow at any moment.

A while later, he arrived at the entrance of the canyon.

From this angle, the whole canyon was like a monster that was opening its eerie, dark giant mouth, planning to swallow and devour him.

The terrain here was dangerous, with cliffs on either side. The canyon was long and narrow, no wider than nine meters. This was a place very suitable for an ambush.

...

Ling Han held out a hand, clenched it into a fist, and delivered a punch at the cliff.

Peng!

A deep sound rang out from the cliff wall. Bits of rock fell off, but the mountain itself was not damaged in the slightest.

Very firm.

Ling Han appeared slightly surprised. Though he had not used his full power in this punch, the power of this blow was not weak, either, yet it actually hadn’t damaged the mountain in the slightest, which showed just how tough this mountain was.

No wonder they had laid a trap for him here. It was clear that he was to have no way of retreat.

With both ends sealed off, plus sealing off any aerial escape, there was no need for too many people, and he would be an easy target.

Of course, the prerequisite was that all of them had to reach or even surpass Ling Han’s strength. Otherwise, it would be Ling Han that would be getting rid of them in a single stroke.

‘Still, has Yan Xianlu really been captured?’ Ling Han pondered deeply. With Yan Xianlu’s strength as a monarch tier, even if he hadn’t obtained a complete Celestial Seed after so many years, he should have fused a complete one from the Celestial Seed shards that he had obtained.

In that case, when he was attacked, he would have a life-saving card left to play—breaking through to the Celestial King Tier.

Once he became a Celestial King, even if there was a gap in strength, there would be really no way to stop him from leaving if he wanted to, unless the gap in cultivation level was too wide, such as a Fourth Heaven against a First Heaven Celestial King.

Thus, it was very easy for Celestial Kings to determine who was stronger, but to kill a Celestial King was difficult!

The strongest Celestial King on the Celestial Path was only at the Third Heaven, and this kind of Celestial King had no grudges against Ling Han, so how could they make use of Yan Xianlu to lay out a trap for him?

As Ling Han walked, a smile appeared at the corners of his lips as he thought, ‘Am I a little foolish? I clearly know that the whole thing is a trap, yet still jump inside of my own volition.’

He was very displeased that someone would target him in secret, and launch sneak attacks against him, but the other party would definitely appear this time. He just wanted to see who exactly was behind all this.

If Ling Han had the chance, he would kill this damn insect. It was always displeasing to have someone target him from behind.

He strode in. He naturally had his own reasons for daring to be so confident.

The Tiger Caging Canyon was eerie. There were no sounds of birds, nor the growls of wild animals. This place was as silent as a den of ghosts.

After walking some ways, he discovered a wooden pillar erected ahead of him. It was as tall as 30 meters, and a rope hung down from the very top. A person was presently hanging on this rope.

This person was disheveled. The most Ling Han could tell was that this person had to be a man, but the exact details of his appearance could not be distinguished.

Yan Xianlu?

Ling Han called out loudly, “Brother Yan! Brother Yan!”

The person’s limbs drooped lifelessly, his head hanging down on his chest. There was not the slightest movement. It was unknown whether he was unconscious from severe injury or already dead.

Ling Han walked to the foot of the wooden pillar, raised his head, and called out, “Brother Yan, I have come to save you!”

Xiu, he suddenly waved out a hand, and a cold light shot out, flying rapidly towards “Yan Xianlu.”

This was the Divine Demon Sword, but the target that the tip of the blade was pointed at was not the rope above that person. It aimed directly at his mind!

This strike was astonishingly quick as Ling Han had used the Regulations of Space on it, and added with the special ability of the Divine Demon Sword itself, it directly pierced through space, reaching that person’s forehead.

Weng, right at this moment, the dying person immediately “came back to life.” He exuded a shocking aura. It was at the Celestial King Tier, capable of shaking stars down from the skies. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, Ling Han’s battle prowess was comparable to a Celestial King’s, and added with how Body Art would burst out faster, while the Divine Demon Sword was more powerful than the average Celestial Tool, and had gained a special ability, Ling Han was faster.

Besides, that Celestial King had previously withheld his aura completely, pretending to be a dying man. Though he had shown his might now, there was still a process necessary to create that burst of power.

Could he make it in time?

Pu!

The Divine Demon Sword directly penetrated through the forehead of that Celestial King, and only stopped when the hilt of the sword was stopped by his skull.

Instantly, a shower of blood started raining down as the heaven and earth grieved for the death of a Celestial King.

To be frank, this Celestial King had really died too uselessly. He had not even made a single move. In fact, he had not even shown his face before he was insta-killed. This was practically a great humiliation.

Ling Han stretched out a hand. Xiu, the Divine Demon Sword immediately flew back towards him, and fell once more into his grasp.

“Hehe, I have already said that this villain was extremely wily. See, our plot couldn’t succeed, and the force on our side has decreased instead,” someone said with a sneer. Though it seemed like a self-reflection, there was absolutely no sorrow felt for the death of that Celestial King. It was like they were complete strangers.

Ling Han raised a brow. “Yu Wudi!”

“That’s right. It is me.” Yu Wudi walked down slowly from above the canyon, his arms crossed behind his back.

He had completely stabilized his Celestial King Tier cultivation level by now, and the streak of light around him was extremely dazzling. He exuded the unique pressure that belonged to a Celestial King, which would make others hold their breaths and shiver.

Ling Han nodded. “I was just thinking who could be so shameless and lay this kind of trap, and you definitely were one of them.”

Yu Wudi was not angered in the slightest. He had already experienced Ling Han’s sharp tongue before, and naturally knew that he could not debate with Ling Han, or he would definitely experience a loss. He smiled faintly. “These are your last words?”

Ling Han set his eyes on him. “Not bad, there is improvement in your strength. Unfortunately, it is still very weak.”

Yu Wudi’s hands trembled involuntarily, his eyes spitting out blades of ice.

If it were not due to Ling Han, why would he have had to break through so early? If it were not due to Ling Han hindering him, he could have rushed all the way to the height of the middle stage of the First Heaven at least. By then, his battle prowess would have reached the middle stage of the Second Heaven.

But now? Though he had stabilized his cultivation at the Celestial King Tier, his battle prowess had just reached the pinnacle of the First Heaven. This was extremely inconsistent with his aptitude as a Monarch Star!

Feeling Ling Han touch his sore spot, Yu Wudi was naturally very resentful.

“Your good luck ends here. Next, I will make you pay a terrible price, and regret having been born in this world!” Yu Wudi declared menacingly.

“Your words are eloquent but untruthful.” Ling Han waved a hand dismissively. “Whatever tricks you have up your sleeve, just go ahead. With just you, there is still no way to kill me!” Ling Han was equivalent to a Celestial King himself. For a Celestial King to kill another Celestial King, how could it be done without being three Heavens higher in cultivation?

Ling Han was not stupid, and would not retreat and battle to death even while knowing that this was a deadly battle.

“I have already said that there is no need for so much trouble. Once this brat entered the canyon, we should’ve immediately ganged up on him.” Another voice rang out. A second Celestial King appeared. A streak of color entwined around him, his aura shocking.

Ling Han looked over, and couldn’t help but grin. “So it is you? What is it? You have fled previously, and now why do you dare to return?”

Previously, the Blue North Celestial King had allied with six other Celestial Kings to snipe Ling Han, yet Ling Han was the one who had turned the tables on them and killed the Blue North Celestial King, scaring off the other six great Celestial Kings. Meanwhile, this Celestial King who had just spoken was one of those Celestial Kings that had been scared off previously.
