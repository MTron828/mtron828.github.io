What was going on? The maid was clearly caught red-handed, but why did the quantity of stolen goods exceed the quantity that she should have?

“Humph, just because you say this is a Meridian Guiding Pill, does that mean it’s genuinely a Meridian Guiding Pill?” He Miaoyin asked coldly.

“Of course.” Ling Han appeared extremely confident.

“Why should I believe you?” He Miaoyin said disdainfully.

One had to know that this Meridian Guiding Fruit was something that her grandfather had paid a huge price to obtain. What right did Ling Han, a disciple who had just entered the sect, have to obtain it, and even having obtained three of them?

“Get someone to appraise it,” someone said.

Everyone nodded in agreement. Getting someone to appraise it would resolve the matter, simple as that.

Ask who to appraise?

“Let me do it!” A young man stepped forward. He was quite good-looking, but there was a cunning expression on his face.

Eh, this voice sounds a little familiar.

“Brother Nie!” Rui Yuanliang, Lao Liyan, and the others dare not treat him lightly, and collectively cupped their hands in greeting.

Ling Han immediately remembered that this guy was Nie Yang.

This guy seemed to have a powerful background, so it was normal for him to be invited to He Miaoyin’s birthday banquet today.

Nie Yang seemed to have a high status among these second-generation young masters, so when he wanted to be the appraiser, the others were extremely confident of his ability to do so.

However, in Ling Han’s eyes, no matter how he looked at it, this guy seemed to be quite incompetent and unreliable.

Nie Yang uncorked the bottles one by one. After comparing them carefully, he said, “Based on my experience, these four are all Meridian Guiding Pills.”

What?!

Everyone was shocked. They were all genuine?

Hiss, wasn’t it said that Sun Jianfang had only given Ling Han three Meridian Guiding Fruits? Could it be that there were still other Meridian Guiding Pills?

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Couldn’t I have asked someone to refine it to produce a pill?”

This explanation was indeed reasonable, but the problem was, when did the Ancient Dao Sect have a formation alchemist?

“No, there really is!”

“Yes, a few days ago, a mysterious person was selling Meridian Guiding Pills in the black market.”

“Moreover, he even traded pills for fruits. Clearly, he must have mastered the refining method of the Meridian Guiding Pill.”

Some people immediately spoke up.

“What? There’s really someone selling Meridian Guiding Pills?” Some people weren’t aware of this, so they were naturally very surprised.

“If Ling Han knows this person, then it wouldn’t be strange for him to get this person to refine the Meridian Guiding Fruit into a pill.”

“So long as one Meridian Guiding Fruit was refined, it ought to produce at least three or four pills, right?”

“Therefore, it wouldn’t be surprising that three Meridian Guiding Fruits could produce four Meridian Guiding Pills.”

Everyone nodded, all of them leaning towards the fact that these Meridian Guiding Pills were acquired by Ling Han through a trade.

“By the way, do you know who that woman is?” Someone pointed at Huan Xue.

“Isn’t she some junior sister from the sect?”

“Wrong, wrong, wrong. She’s actually a maid. More than a month ago, when I went to Ling Han’s place, I saw her with my own eyes.”

“Hey, now that you mention it, I remember too. There is indeed such a maid.”

“Hiss!”

Everyone gasped in astonishment. The former maid had now become a Two Meridians elite. What did this mean?

Ling Han had to have many Meridian Guiding Pills in his hands, which directly caused his maid to dash into becoming a Two Meridians.

They were about to cry. ‘How extravagant could you be? No matter how many Meridian Guiding Pills you possess, how could you squander them like this?’

How good would it be for him to give it to them? With their natural talent in martial arts, the same amount of Meridian Guiding Pills would definitely be more effective on them.

Therefore, it wouldn’t be strange that Huan Xue had a Meridian Guiding Pill on her; it was probably leftovers from what she had been given.

‘Hmm, I really want to be bestowed with one too.’

Everyone looked at Ling Han eagerly. If not for the fact that their status as cultivators did not allow them to do so, they would all have the urge to hug Ling Han’s thigh and become his lackeys.

Li Changdan was speechless. This matter… was resolved just like that?

As far as he was concerned, there was no solution to this, but Ling Han had taken care of it effortlessly.

He naturally knew very well that the Meridian Guiding Pill found on Huan Xue indeed belonged to He Miaoyin because it was stolen by Rui Yuanliang and the other two, and the three of them did not hide this matter from him.

It was too f*cking strange.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Now surely my little handmaiden’s innocence can be proven?”

He Miaoyin had nothing to say. She had heard it just now. Huan Xue was originally a maid, but now she had become a Two Meridians.

How many Meridian Guiding Pills would he have to spend to nurture a person with ordinary aptitude into a Two Meridians?

Who would believe that such a wealthy person would steal her Meridian Guiding Pill?

Even she wouldn’t be able to believe it.

Ling Han swept his gaze over the crowd. No one said anything else as they all lowered their heads. He then turned his gaze to He Miaoyin, and said, “Since this is a completely false accusation, then apologize to my maid.”

He Miaoyin was stunned. What? He even wanted her to apologize?

What did she do wrong?

Her possession had been stolen. Could it be that it was wrong for her to search for what she had lost?

Ling Han said, “It’s naturally not wrong for you to be looking for lost items, but it’s wrong for you to verbally insult someone before you’ve figured out the situation!” He had not forgotten that He Miaoyin had previously called Huan Xue a b*tch.

Who could be allowed to humiliate his maid?

He had to slap her back in retribution of the insult she had hurled at his maid.

Only then did He Miaoyin remember, and she couldn’t help revealing a proud expression. “So what if I wronged her? She’s just a servant, can’t I scold her?”

“I don’t care who she was in the past, but now she’s my maid. You insulting her is equivalent to insulting me!” Ling Han’s expression became menacing, and his gaze was sharp as a sword as he stared straight at He Miaoyin. “Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

Under his gaze, He Miaoyin couldn’t help but feel a little flustered.

Was this really a young man?

Why did she feel that the other party was an ancient monster, a terrifying Demonic Beast that was currently at the peak of its cultivation? It made her feel an extreme chill from the bottom of her heart. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A smile appeared on the corners of Ling Han’s mouth, and he said, “Junior Sister He, do you not know that the sect has rules? To humiliate a fellow disciple, what kind of serious crime is this?”

Over the past few days, he had been tinkering with the optical computer whenever he was free. He already acquired quite an in-depth understanding of this world. Since he was now in the Ancient Dao Sect, how could he not make himself understand the rules of the sect?

He Miaoyin was stunned. In the sect, humiliating a fellow disciple was a serious crime. If things were to really escalate, even if she was the granddaughter of an elder, she would still be punished. She would definitely be whipped at the mountain gate.

Under her grandfather’s protection, she believed that it wouldn’t hurt even if she was whipped a few times. However, the problem was, how embarrassing would that be?

She quickly calmed herself down, and said, “I was not insulting you, it was directed at her!” She pointed at Huan Xue.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “It’s good that you admit it.”

“What did I admit?” He Miaoyin was getting a bad feeling.

Ling Han said calmly, “According to the rules of the sect, as long as one’s meridians could be detected, whether it’s in a gardener, servant, or coachman, one will automatically be promoted to become a disciple of the sect. Therefore, in the case of my maid… she is also a disciple of the sect!

“Since you’ve admitted to insulting her, do you still want to deny it in front of so many people?”

He Miaoyin was speechless. For a moment, her heart was filled with panic, and her mind seemed to have gone blank.

“Apologize!” Ling Han raised his voice. This shout was like the roll of thunder.

He Miaoyin’s heart was in a chaotic state. She blurted out, “I’m sorry!”
