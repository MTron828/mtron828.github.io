2894 Fighting Fifth Tier

Fei Wu was similarly shocked. He had indeed gained the upper hand, but how much higher was his cultivation level in comparison with Ling Han’s? Moreover, he was a Fifth Tier, and had already crossed the massive threshold of the Fourth Tier!

He believed that only the greatest prodigies of all eternity like Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu were qualified to contend against him while being at the Fourth Tier, yet Ling Han was only a Third Tier.

How could Fei Wu not be dumbfounded by this?

However, they were currently locked in an intense battle. Although he had the upper hand, he was unable to suppress Ling Han at all. How could he possibly be careless?

Thus, he immediately focused all of his attention and battled intensely with Ling Han.

Boom!

The two of them engaged in a great battle. One was a Fifth Tier elite, while the other possessed Fifth-Tier battle prowess, and they were locked in a fierce battle.

Ling Han was only using Fei Wu to test his battle prowess. Thus, as long as Fei Wu did not use any ultimate moves, he would not use any, either.

However, seeing that normal battle prowess was unable to suppress Ling Han anytime soon, Fei Wu quickly changed his tactics.

Weng, a Heavenly Venerable Seal lit up, instantly increasing his battle prowess by more than 30 times.

As expected of a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate; he had mastered a sixth-grade seal.

This time, his power skyrocketed, and he instantly gained an absolute upper hand.

If Ling Han did not react accordingly, he would be severely injured within 10 moves, and would definitely not be able to last more than 20 moves.

Ling Han laughed loudly. He also channeled a seal, and his power increased explosively by more than 40 times.

Originally, he was only five or six times inferior to Fei Wu in terms of power. Now that there was a difference in the Heavenly Venerable Seals, it made up for his lack of raw power, and pulled their battle prowess to the same level.

“What?!” Fei Wu and Qi Xuan cried out in shock at the same time. They had never imagined that Ling Han would actually have mastered a fifth-grade seal.

It had to be known that these sixth-grade seals were not dug out by them, but produced by themselves after countless years of deduction. However, what about Ling Han? He was only a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Moreover, he had just broken through not long ago. Even for those who had remained at this cultivation level for countless years, and were qualified to deduce Heavenly Venerable Seals, what grade of Heavenly Venerable Seals could they deduce?

Seventh grade, at most!

This was too unbelievable. Not only did this young man have freakish natural talent, his tier-surpassing battle prowess was terrifying, and he had even mastered a fifth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal.

A hint of greed uncontrollably flashed in Qi Xuan’s eyes. Although the raw stones here could produce Heavenly Venerable Seals, there weren’t any high-level Heavenly Venerable Seals.

This was a fifth-grade seal. Even he had never mastered one, which was a huge temptation to him.

He was like this, and Fei Wu was naturally no different. Whether it was revenge for the death of his son or coveting the Heavenly Venerable Seals in Ling Han’s possession, both made him want to immediately kill Ling Han and seize all of his secrets.

…He was sure that Ling Han’s secrets were not limited to just a single fifth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal.

“Fate gives rise to three lifetimes, destroying all impermanence!” Fei Wu whispered. Boom! He struck out with his palm, and countless seals flickered. These were definitely not Heavenly Venerable Seals, but their power was astonishing.

A sudden feeling rose up in Ling Han, making him feel as if the world was ever-changing, and he had nothing left to live for.

However, how tenacious was his will? He immediately shattered this negative emotion. He was slightly surprised. Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates really couldn’t be underestimated. They could actually shake his will.

“Do you think that being Fifth Tier only means that one has mastered one more power than at the Fourth Tier?” Fei Wu sneered. “This is only the difference on the surface, but the fusion of four fundamental powers, the number of combinations that can be formed, is unimaginable.”

He delivered palm strike after palm strike, as if he was splitting open the heaven and earth, or as if he was destroying all life. Ling Han was scraped a few times by this force, and his clothes were instantly ripped into pieces, while cracks actually appeared on his skin.

It had to be known that the two of them were at about the same level of strength, but just the force of Fei Wu’s attacks had such power. It was unbelievable.

With a thought, Ling Han also unleashed the Fists of Fury. He did not believe that the Dao he had comprehended would be inferior to that of anyone.

Boom!

He brandished the Fists of Fury. He was like a mad demon, attacking with every move.

Shua, shua, shua! Small wounds continuously appeared on Ling Han’s body from the strong winds, but he paid no attention to them. He just focused his aggressive attacks on Fei Wu.

His attacks were like long rivers and vast seas, each more vicious than the last. Finally, Fei Wu also suffered a punch from him.

Peng, Fei Wu was sent flying, and he spluttered out a mouthful of blood.

Fine, he had spat out all the advantages he had had previously. A heavy blow in exchange for the light injuries all over Ling Han’s body was not worth it at all.

“Trash is indeed trash.” Ling Han shook his head, appearing a little regretful. “You didn’t come up with a good name, so you can’t blame anyone1.”

Fei Wu almost spluttered out another mouthful of blood. If it was any other Third Tier, he naturally wouldn’t take it to heart, but Ling Han was an elite comparable to him, so he naturally couldn’t ignore these words.

‘Are you done? Why do you keep harping on my name? What’s the point?’

“Brother Fei, let’s join forces,” Qi Xuan said. However, he had already sent a punch flying towards Ling Han. He was incomparably ferocious.

Qi Xuan was not in the middle stage of the Fifth Tier, but in the late stage of the Fifth Tier. With the addition of a sixth-grade seal, his battle prowess naturally surpassed Ling Han’s.

Boom, this punch was incomparably terrifying.

Ling Han’s figure flashed, dodging this attack, and he calmly said, “In a battle of Fifth Tier against Third Tier, you still want to join forces?”

“You have no respect for your elders. I just want to teach you a lesson,” Qi Xuan said nonchalantly. At his level, he no longer cared about what others said. Of course, Ling Han’s mouth was especially vicious, and that was another matter.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Seeing the two of you appear together, I guessed that you would definitely join forces with your shamelessness. Otherwise, why would you have come?”

Qi Xuan paid Ling Han no regard at all. He threw another punch.

“Ling Han, why don’t you dare to face it head-on?” Fei Wu also flew over and attacked with all his might. “Weren’t you very arrogant?”

Ling Han was also a little speechless, and said, “The two of you, both Fifth Tiers, joined forces to attack me, and you still want me to face you head-on? Mm-hm, although I’ve already expected your shamelessness, I still didn’t expect you to be shameless to this extent.”

The two great Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates acted as if they hadn’t heard anything. No matter what Ling Han said, as long as they killed him, he naturally would become quiet.

“However, to kill me… do you guys think that is possible?” Ling Han asked calmly.

Hong, the answer to his question came in the form of violent attacks unleashed by two great Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han let out a long cry, and the Heavenly Venerable Sea he had used before immediately dimmed. Replacing it was the only first-grade seal he had mastered.

Instantly, his battle prowess increased by more than 40 times. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Peng, peng, peng! He sent Fei Wu and Qi Xuan flying with three punches and two kicks. In terms of power, he absolutely suppressed them.

...

This time, Fei Wu’s and Qi Xuan’s eyes widened as if they had seen a ghost.

In the face of such power, they were like children who were facing an adult. They were completely powerless.

“What kind of Heavenly Venerable Seal is this? It can actually produce such a terrifying enhancement of power?” they both asked with trembling voices.

“It increased by at least 70 times!”

“No, it should have reached 80 times.”

“This is… a first-grade seal!”

Their eyes lit up in surprise and delight.
