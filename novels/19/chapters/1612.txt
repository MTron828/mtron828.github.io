Chapter 1613: So it’s a misunderstanding

A Great Saint personally arrived, bringing with him the Saintly medicine that the Long Tribe urgently needed as a bridal gift. How could the Long Tribe afford to refuse this offer of marriage?

Moreover, it was actually not a loss to the Long Tribe. Zhong Badu was a newly advanced Saint, and his aptitude was amazing. In the future, it was very possible that he would be able to become a Great Saint or even a Saint King, and was there any better prospective husband for a woman than this?

Long Yushan did not wish to speak much on this matter, and asked Long Xiangyue, “That’s right, why have you suddenly returned?”

Long Xiangyue’s pretty face involuntarily blushed. Bringing her lover back with her to seek marriage from her aunty? This was a little chaotic, and she could not bring herself to say the words.

Yet Ling Han clasped his hands in greeting, and said, “Senior Long, I am Ling Han, and I wish to ask for a dragon horn from Senior.”

Long Yushan’s pretty face abruptly darkened. ‘This is only our first meeting, and you are already having designs on me?’

Even a Saint like Zhong Badu did not satisfy her, what more a Ling Han who was only in the Eternal River Tier.

“Senior, take a look at this first.” Ling Han brought out a cup of Reincarnation Tea, and handed it over to Long Yushan.

Long Yushan’s first reaction was to overturn this cup, yet her hand had just lifted when she suddenly paused.

The aroma of the tea was refreshing to both heart and spirit, making her feel like her spirit had been steadied, as if she was fitting in with the great dao, and filled her with an amazing enlightenment.

Her heart involuntarily throbbed strongly; was this Saintly medicine?

After a momentary pause, she automatically took the teacup, and finished the tea in a single gulp. Suddenly, there were patterns of great dao appearing all over her body, and her raven locks fluttered. A divine multicoloured light shone from her, making her look extremely beautiful and alluring.

She immediately sat down in a cross-legged position, and only after a whole day did she finally reopen her eyes. She couldn’t help but look pleasantly surprised. Her cultivation level had actually advanced a short distance forwards.

It should be known that when one had reached a height like she had, every further step forwards was extremely difficult, and the time needed would be numbered in millions of years. Yet now, with the help from a single cup of tea, she had taken another step forwards. Just how amazing was that?

If she could obtain more tea leaves, and drink this kind of tea every day, what would happen then?

She couldn’t help but look towards Ling Han, seeing him in a new light.

“10 tea leaves in exchange for a single dragon horn, deal?” Ling Han quoted a price.

Long Yushan’s pretty face darkened again. You, a mere Eternal River Tier, actually treated yourself like some important figure, and planned to use a mere 10 tea leaves to trade for the rest of her life? Furthermore, this was not a question of the volume of the bridal gift. She already had a betrothal with Zhong Badu, so how could she go back on her word?

Even if she was willing to, having screwed a Saint King over, what kind of fate would befall the Long Tribe?

“Humph, if it was not because of Xiangyue, I would definitely kill you!” With a flutter of her sleeve, she commanded, “Leave!”

Ling Han was baffled. ‘If you are not happy with the price, we can just negotiate, right? Why do you have to give me this attitude, where have I offended you?’

He was about to say something more, yet Long Xiangyue kept signalling him with her eyes, and he closed his mouth.

“Let’s go!” Long Xiangyue pulled Ling Han with her and left. “Aunty is presently angry. Don’t be anxious, I will work slowly on aunty, and will definitely persuade her to change her mind.”

Ling Han scratched his head, and said, “That’s right, your grand elder should also have dragon horns. Why don’t I just trade with him then?”

Long Xiangyue got such a shock that she delicately shuddered. The grand elder of the Long Tribe was a male. ‘Just what kind of person are you? Not only do you want to have an aunt and niece, you do not even want to spare men?’

This was practically a beast!

Ling Han was even more dumbfounded, and asked, “Is there some kind of misunderstanding here? I only want a single dragon horn. I need it for something, and mean nothing else by it.”

“Ah!” Long Xiangyue gasped. “You really have no other intention besides that?”

“What have you all misunderstood?” Ling Han asked.

Long Xiangyue breathed a sigh of relief internally, yet was also slightly disappointed. Going by that logic, when Ling Han had asked her for a dragon horn previously, it was not because he liked her. Suddenly, her emotions took a downturn, and she ignored Ling Han. She walked ahead on her own.

“Hey, hey, hey.” Ling Han hurriedly caught up to her.

After he repeatedly asked her, Long Xiangyue finally informed him about the significance of the dragon horns to the Dragon Tribe. Ling Han’s expression involuntarily became strange. No wonder this girl had previously been so fierce... Hold on, but her attitude had obviously changed later on, and she even brought him to see her aunty.

“You, you, you, don’t misunderstand, I, too, only want to help you borrow a dragon horn from Aunty. I have absolutely no other intention!” Long Xiangyue hurriedly “explained”. Since Ling Han had previously had completely no idea about the significance of the dragon horn, it made her seem as if she had weird tastes, to actually be so shameless to sell off herself together with her aunty to him.

Ling Han nodded. It was better not to deliberate too deeply on this topic.

Long Xiangyue first brought Ling Han to settle down first, and she then went off to clarify things with Long Yushan. Ling Han really and purely only wanted to borrow a single dragon horn, and had no other intention.

Ling Han rested in his room. He decided to see if Long Xiangyue would be able to succeed first. If she did not, then even if he had to resort to trickery and deceit, he would have to get himself a dragon horn, and then head to the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire to trade for a celestial technique.

Was the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire someone who had experienced the great turmoil of the Celestial Realm?

He should not be. The era of the great turmoil of the Celestial Realm had been much too long ago, and even if a Celestial King entered into the Ancient Realm, his lifespan would also be severed, and he might not live that much longer than a Genesis Tier.

Forget it. He’d ask him when he saw him. He was sure that he could find out more secrets from the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire.

Peng, peng, peng. Not too long after, a knock rang out from the courtyard doors.

Ling Han controlled his Origin Power to open the doors from afar, and saw that there was a man and woman standing at the doorway: Yang Zige and Jing Yi.

“My young master seeks your presence!” Jing Yi stated coldly.

Ling Han’s first reaction was that he couldn’t be bothered. If he wanted to meet him, didn’t he know the way here? What great airs he was putting on! However, he thought the matter over, and changed his mind. He had to clarify the relation between the Open Clouds Forbidden Land and the Open Clouds King.

Thus, he nodded, and answered, “Lead the way.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jing Yi and Yang Zige both showed expressions of indifference. As they thought—if a Saint summoned him, did Ling Han dare to refuse?

The two of them led the way, and brought Ling Han to another courtyard, which was actually very near. After Ling Han had entered, they closed the doors behind him, and stood guard loyally outside.

Zhong Badu was presently sitting in a pavilion in the courtyard and sipping tea, appearing to be very relaxed.

“If you don’t want to die, scram immediately, and never return!” Zhong Badu had his back facing Ling Han, and directly issued a command. In his eyes, when a Saint spoke, it was natural that all common people could only obey strictly.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and asked, “Does your Open Clouds Forbidden Land have an Open Clouds King?”

“Insolence, how dare you directly speak the name of our grand elder!” Zhong Badu stood up in rage, his finger pointing at Ling Han, and his expression baleful.

As expected.

Ling Han nodded. He had not thought that he would meet a descendant of the Open Clouds King at this time and in this kind of situation. He smiled faintly, and said, “If I have the chance, I will pay a visit to the Open Clouds Forbidden Land.”

“Who do you think you are?” Zhong Badu couldn’t help but smirk coldly. Did he really think that he was some kind of important figure? Saying something like paying a visit if he had the chance... He was merely an ant of the Eternal River Tier.

“Since you are unwilling to listen to wise advice, you are courting death!” He humphed coldly, and tapped out a finger at Ling Han. Xiu, a shadowy point of light surged out, and sank towards Ling Han’s forehead.
