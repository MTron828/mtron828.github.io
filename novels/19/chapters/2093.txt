Chapter 2094: Xiao Gu shows his might

“This little girl is really too undependable,” the large black dog mumbled from afar. “So stupid and so indecisive, just how exactly did she become a Celestial King? As expected, all these years she’s spent alive have been the years of a dog— pei, pei, pei[1]! Which bastard invented this line? He really deserves to die!”

Suddenly, he took a sniff, and then a strange expression appeared on his face. “The fierce woman, Ling Miao, has caught up… hehe, just in time, you can help Grandpa Dog to deal with these little brats.”

If someone had heard him call the four Celestial Kings as ‘little girl’ and ‘little brats’, respectively, they would either die of terror or laugh themselves to death. Had this large black dog gone mad, or was his strength powerful to a heaven-defying extent?

The large black dog stretched out a paw, sweeping it through the air. A circular halo of light appeared, and its inner surface was covered entirely with decorative designs, looking like patterns, but also seeming like a character that was incredibly complex at the same time.

What was strange was that the large black dog’s paw extended into the circle, and the part that had passed through it actually disappeared into thin air.

This was Regulations of Space.

“I really can’t bear to part with it. I just managed to steal it with extreme difficulty.” The large black dog drew out a pair of underpants, showing an expression of regret. “However, if I don’t return it to that fierce woman, she will probably chase Grandpa Dog relentlessly for eternity.

“Sigh, just a single sniff energizes me!” The large black dog sniffed the underpants, looking incredibly perverted. His whole expression was one of infatuation, yet ultimately, he still stretched out his paw, and tossed the underpants into the circle, which immediately disappeared without a trace.

“There will be a good show to come.” The large black dog’s regret was swept away, and he immediately became exhilarated.

In the skies, the Full Winds Celestial King moved, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

Since Lu Hairong had already spoken, the word of a Celestial King was naturally as strong as the heavens. There was absolutely no possibility that she would go back on her word.

Ling Han couldn’t even move at all. In fact, being locked down by the divine sense of the Celestial Kings, he could not even complete a single thought. It was as if Regulations of Time had been executed on him, and everything had become overwhelmingly slow.

Xiu, a celestial light streaked past, and Xiao Gu suddenly retreated, stepping in front of Ling Han. The Celestial King bone in his body glowed, as a powerful Celestial King Tier aura seeped out. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What!?” Yu Wenxin’s eyes almost fell out in his shock.

The aura of a Celestial King, how could this be possible!

Could it be that he was battling with a Celestial King? This…!

Did any such Celestial King exist in this world? Not fighting back, and just allowing him to attack. He was so good-tempered that it was practically inhuman.

But the Celestial King Tier aura told no lies. To speak of nothing else, if he was facing this aura directly now, his knees would definitely become weak, and he would not even have the ability to move.

Boom!

This strike from the Full Winds Celestial King was suddenly stopped, but Xiao Gu’s body also crumbled loudly. This was not his original body, and thus had limited defenses. In front of a Celestial King, it could not withstand a single blow.

A snow white bone floated in the skies. It was covered with ancient seals, exuding an air of age, and a powerful Celestial King Tier aura was also spreading out, as if a supreme existence had descended.

“En?”

“Yi?”

The Full Winds Celestial King, Celestial King Yuanfang, Green Wolf Celestial King, and Lu Hairong included, the four great Celestial Kings all showed expressions of shock as none of them had discovered previously that Xiao Gu was not an actual person at all, but just a mere bone.

He was only a bone, yet actually could bear the strike of a Celestial King, and a Fourth Heaven Celestial King at that. This was too inconceivable.

“Celestial Tool?” The four great Celestial Kings all stared at Xiao Gu.

“No, this should be the bone left behind by a Celestial King, and has reached a supreme height in terms of Body Art. That is why it can match the toughness of Divine Metal. Otherwise, being corroded by the power of time, even the body of a Celestial King would gradually lose its vitality. It could not possibly block the attack of another Celestial King.”

“This Celestial King should have reached an astonishing height when he had been alive.”

“Seventh Heaven?”

“Probably not just that, it has to be Eighth Heaven or above.”

The four great Celestial Kings were incredibly shocked. When a person died, everything would be gone. This was an absolute fact that would never change. Even a Celestial King could not possibly be exempted from this rule. But now, this Celestial King bone clearly had developed its own consciousness. This had overturned the unshakeable law.

“En? Yi? Celestial Tool? No, this should be…” Xiao Gu spoke up, repeating the words that the four Celestial Kings had spoken previously without the slightest error.

“…” The four great Celestial Kings.

“…” Everyone beneath them.

A white bone, and it was there speaking in a lively and realistic manner. Furthermore, they were words that others had spoken previously. Just what kind of bizarre scene was this?

Ling Han was speechless. This guy had already become a bone now, yet he was still in the mood to imitate words.

As Xiao Gu copied the words, he was also reforming his body. As blood and flesh interwove, his body reappeared. It was still formed exactly like Ling Han. It looked like he was definitely screwing Ling Han over.

“Yi, this aura?” In the distance, the large black dog scratched his ears and cheek. “There is no way Grandpa Dog would forget after a single sniff, but Grandpa Dog does not have the slightest memory. And looking at the marks of age on this Celestial Bone, it should have existed for a few epochs, at least.

“Furthermore, there is a sliver of a dark aura on the bone, not from those evil creatures, but left behind after fighting and killing those creatures. Only when one had killed too many of those dark creatures could such a strong aura be left behind.

“Could it be that it is an existence even older than Grandpa Dog?

“That’s right. The storm of darkness had not existed just in Grandpa Dog’s generation, but can be traced back to an even farther ancient era. Perhaps this guy had died after battling with the dark creatures.”

When Xiao Gu had finished repeating the words, his body had also been completely reformed. Then, he looked at the four great Celestial Kings in an endearingly silly way.

“Friend, since you have already died, what obsession cannot be let go?” Celestial King Yuanfang said. He was sure that this Celestial King bone could go against nature because the obsessions he had when he had been alive were too strong.

“Friend, since you have already died…” Xiao Gu copied, diligently and unfailingly.

Instantly, Celestial King Yuanfang’s face became dark and ugly. He was still alive and well, so why was it he that had died?

Even the Full Winds Celestial King and Green Wolf Celestial King did not dare speak at this, because Xiao Gu did not take himself as a Celestial King at all. He would directly repeat whatever had been said, and this damage was indeed quite strong.

“However powerful he had been in the past, he is only a bone now, and no longer possesses his past glories,” the Green Wolf Celestial King said to the other two great Celestial Kings. “We’ll join forces, and how could it be that we are still unable to suppress a Celestial Tool with that?”

A Celestial King’s bone, it would be more appropriate to call it a Celestial Tool.

“All right, we’ll work together to suppress it!” The Full Winds Celestial King and Celestial King Yuanfang both nodded.

However, right at this moment, a dragon’s roar rang out from afar.?Boom, innumerable images of Divine Dragons streaked across the skies. The many dragons danced together, their might overflowing the heavens.

Pa, pa, pa, pa.?All four great Celestial Kings actually fell down from the skies simultaneously.

‘What?!’

Everyone was watching with bulging eyes. What was going on here? It was only a dragon’s roar, and four great Celestial Kings actually couldn’t even manage to stand steadily anymore. Who was the newcomer?

This thought had not been completed when another person had appeared above the plaza.

A beauty, a supremely exquisite beauty.

She was dressed in green robes, her complexion as fair as jade. She had a slender nose and almond-shaped eyes, her hair as black as ink, cascading like a waterfall. Furthermore, there was actually a pair of dragon’s horns sprouting out of her temples, their hue the dark blue color of green jade.

And it was this exquisite beauty that was exuding a powerful, mighty aura capable of suppressing heavens and earth.

She did indeed possess such strength because there were eight streaks of light entwined behind her.

Eighth Heaven Celestial King!

Heavens, an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, this was an existence that was practically standing at the apex of the Celestial Realm, a truly supreme existence.

[1] Means that the years she’s been alive were wasted, since she hasn’t learnt anything.
