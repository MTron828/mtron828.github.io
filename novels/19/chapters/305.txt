Chapter 306: Battling the Spiritual Pedestal Tier

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“Old man, come on out. You’ve followed me for so long, you should come out to take a breath of fresh air,” Ling Han said, turning around.

Luo Ji Feng continued to hide himself and did not step out at the first instance. He thought that Ling Han was trying to bluff. How could a brat in the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier possibly discover his tracks?

“So you can be shameless as long as there’s a cloth covering your face?” Ling Han snorted.

Luo Ji Feng was instantly furious, and at the same time, he realized that Ling Han had discovered him. He strode out and asked, “Brat, how did you discover me?”

“I guessed,” Ling Han said simply. “I vaguely felt that there was a bum beetle behind me, and thinking it over, someone who would be following behind another in the middle of the night like this must be a shameful old wretch.”

Luo Ji Feng fumed angrily because of his invectives and shouted in fury, “How dare you!”

“Hehe, I am usually very daring,” Ling Han smiled.

Luo Ji Feng instantly calmed down. An elite of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier naturally could not lose composure like this. He crossed his arms behind his back and asked, “Brat, you probably don’t know my cultivation level yet, right? The Spiritual Pedestal Tier!” He did not wait for Ling Han to make a guess and simply revealed the answer. “I heard that you dared to kill even a man in the fifth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier! This has probably made you smug and conceited, and so you think that I’m also the same, right?

You’re wrong, wrong! Whether it is the Spiritual Pedestal or the Spiritual Ocean Tier, there’s no way you can tell the difference between cultivation levels, and this is precisely going to be the reason for your death!

There are some people you can’t offend, and once you do, your only fate would be death!”

Ling Han laughed loudly and said, “So it is an old wretch in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, sorry I didn’t recognize you! I am indeed quite curious. Cheng Fei Jun is actually able to command an old wretch like you, so from the look of things, you don’t have much to be proud of.”

“Nonsense, Cheng Fei Jun is the one who has to obey my commands!” Luo Ji Feng immediately rebuked, but once the words left his mouth, he could not help but tense up and say sharply, “Damn you, you actually dared to trick me with words!”

Ling Han shrugged and said, “You’re here to kill me anyways. Moreover, a battle between the Spiritual Pedestal Tier and the Gushing Spring Tier would definitely be a one-sided domination. I am someone who is definitely going to die, so what if I know some secrets? Old wretch, let me ask you, which party are you really from?”

Luo Ji Feng was dazed from listening to Ling Han’s words. The first words that Ling Han had said were obviously supposed to be his lines, yet why had they come from Ling Han’s mouth? Though this was a fact, it still made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

A man who was well aware that he was going to die could still remain so calm?

Yet when he heard Ling Han’s last few words, the old man was once again enraged. This brat still dared to call him an old wretch?

“What is the point for a dead man to know so much?” he asked coldly. Being called ‘old wretch’ repeatedly by Ling Han made him feel like he ‘couldn’t bear’ to immediately kill Ling Han. He wanted to toy with the latter for a while before killing him slowly.

Ling Han laughed and said, “A wretch will be a wretch. Never listening to nice words, only brute strength works!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Damn you!” Luo Ji Feng humphed in anger. He really could not bear being repeatedly insulted as ‘old wretch’ by Ling Han, so he planned to first subdue this brat, then slowly torture him. At the same time, recovering the Strange Fire was quite a troublesome task—Cheng Fei Jun had to be at the scene as well, so he had better first subdue Ling Han.

“Small Tower!” Ling Han said lightly. Suddenly, a terrifying power gushed out of his Dantian and instantly circulated through his entire body.

First layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, second layer, third layer... his cultivation level spiked up sharply, and in a short while, reached the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier.

“Yi!” Luo Ji Feng was just about to make a move when he suddenly ceased all movement and said in an utterly astonished tone, “Impossible! Impossible! How can your aura instantly soar up to the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier!?”

From the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier to the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, that was practically a breach through two major Tiers; it was shocking to the point of being horrifying. Who could accept this?

“What is the point for a dead man to know so much?” Ling Han asked. This was exactly what Luo Ji Feng had said to him in reply before.

Luo Ji Feng had already regained his senses from his absolute astonishment earlier. He said, “So what if you are in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier. There is still a gap of a major Tier, and to suppress you would be a complete piece of cake for me! I definitely do not believe that in this tiny place like the Desolate North, there could be a seventeen-year-old in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier who at the same time is also an Earth Grade alchemist. You must have taken some kind of alchemical pill which has temporarily raised your cultivation level.

You would only possess the strength through this kind of upgrade. It is impossible for your martial arts comprehension to have increased as well. You would at most be able to only express the battle prowess of the third or fourth layer.”

In front of me, such battle prowess is practically trash!” he said disdainfully.

Ling Han’s right hand moved and a sword appeared out of thin air—this was no ordinary iron sword, but the Demon Birth Sword!

Today, he was definitely not going to spare Luo Ji Feng.

“This, this, this, this, this, this, what kind of Spirit Tool is this?!” Luo Ji Feng’s expression went through a dramatic change. Even if the martial intent in the Demon Birth Sword had not been restored, a Level Ten Spirit Tool was still a Level Ten Spirit Tool, after all. Merely one look at the patterns engraved on the body of the sword would arouse a powerful feeling of hopelessness, as if one was facing an ultimate elite standing at the apex of strength.

“Level Ten Spirit Tool, Demon Birth Sword,” Ling Han said calmly. He did not hide anything this time round.

“Level Ten Spirit Tool! Level Ten Spirit Tool!” Luo Ji Feng mumbled, powerful greed instantly appearing on his face. “I understand, the basis for your confidence is this Demon Birth Sword! Hahahaha, a Level Ten Spirit Tool is indeed powerful, but you have no way to activate the martial intent within it, so at most, it would only be a threat to me due to how sharp it is!

I have to thank you for gifting me with such an ultimate treasure. Hahaha, only I deserve to have this Spirit Tool!”

“Is that so?” Ling Han extended his left hand, and with a mental command, weng, weng, weng, weng , veins appeared on his hand, shining with a colourful light.

Pu!

Luo Ji Feng instantly choked. This was martial intent, the genuine thing!

“How could this be, how could this be!?” He was instantly driven mad. If one used an alchemical pill to forcibly upgrade one’s own cultivation level, that would only mean a strength upgrade. It was not possible for martial arts cultivation to be upgraded as well.

Could it be that Ling Han was really in the Spiritual Ocean Tier, yet he had only forcibly suppressed his cultivation level previously?

Yet, a seventeen-year-old Spiritual Ocean Tier martial artist who was also an Earth Grade alchemist... no matter how he looked at it, it was nonsense. How could there be such a monster in this world?

No matter how he dared to contemplate, he could never imagine that Ling Han’s soul used to belong to an ultimate elite of the Heaven Tier who was the Alchemy Emperor. Thus, not just Earth Grade alchemist, he could even immediately transform into a Heaven Grade alchemist.

And as long as there was enough power, with his divine sense of the Heaven Tier, how could it be that he could not form martial arts intent?

Ling Han lightly shook the Demon Birth Sword. Weng , the precious sword shone, and two patterns gave off a faint light. This meant that he had managed to revive a portion of the martial intent in the Demon Birth Sword.

Even if it was only a little bit, how awesome was a Level Ten Spirit Tool? A terrifying might washed over him, instantly causing Luo Ji Feng’s heart to tremble like crazy. His legs weakened so much that he had almost fallen to his knees on the ground.

Previously, merely the decree of a Spiritual Infant Tier elite was enough to make Fu Yuan Sheng and the other two Spiritual Pedestal Tier elites only capable of resistance but unable to make a move. A Level Ten Spirit Tool was naturally even more awesome. Unfortunately, Ling Han was only able to activate two patterns after all. Moreover, they were only faintly shining, so the martial intent released from them was too limited. As a result, Luo Ji Feng still managed to keep a large part of his battle prowess.

“I shall accept such a precious sword as my own!” Luo Ji Feng was astonished, but at the same time, he was even more excited.
