Chapter 1805: How Lofty Is Your Goal?

How would Ling Han deal with this formidable paper human?

He had no other plans at this moment, and he simply yearned to exchange blows with this paper human. This was because battling against a powerful opponent could aid him in comprehending the great dao. After all, this immense pressure would force him to unleash his potential.

Moreover, very few people could cause him to feel pain anymore.

Ling Han’s fighting spirit was raging, and he freely unleashed all kinds of celestial techniques. Apart from the Xuanyin Source Water and the Nine Heavens Flame, he unleashed all of his other techniques.

In terms of genuine strength alone, he was naturally no match for a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier elite. However, his physique was far too powerful, so much so that he was essentially undying. As such, what did it matter if he were wounded? He would simply regroup and launch into battle again.

‘A-are you a freak?!’

Nangong Ting turned pale upon seeing this.

Even if his opponent were a Holy Son or a Holy Daughter from a Celestial King Tier force, he was absolutely certain that they couldn’t be any more freakish than Ling Han.

‘Gasp! Who in the world is this person?’

However, a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier elite was a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier, after all. The paper human was incredibly quick, and it had already launched countless attacks in the blink of an eye. Even though Ling Han’s recovery ability was freakish, it was still unable to keep up with the rate at which he was getting wounded. Thus, his wounds became more and more severe.

Nangong Ting breathed a sigh of relief. By the looks of it, Ling Han was finally on the verge of being defeated.

However, Nangong Ting was feeling extremely pained. He hadn’t imagined that it would take so long to defeat Ling Han. This would consume a huge amount of the paper human’s energy, and would thus leave a question mark on how many more times it could be used.

In any case, he could at least obtain the White Demon Tree as well as a breathtakingly beautiful and charming woman.

This was definitely worth it!

Ling Han’s wounds became increasingly severe. Not only was his flesh bloody and mangled, but even his bones could now be seen. Fortunately, his Godly bones were extremely sturdy, so they still hadn’t been broken.

He was extremely satisfied, and he said, “Enough with the fun and games!”

Nangong Ting sneered upon hearing this. ‘You want to end the battle just like that? Do you even have a choice?’

With a single thought, Ling Han immediately summoned 10 flaming Battle Beasts that lunged toward Nangong Ting. Meanwhile, he continued to battle against the paper human.

Nangong Ting cursed in his mind, and hurriedly unleashed a celestial technique to block the 10 Battle Beasts.

However, although these Battle Beasts weren’t formed from Source Power, they were still incredibly powerful thanks to the profoundly high-level fire particles in the surroundings. Each of them could rival the battle prowess of a king tier at the peak stage of the fourth severance, so each of them was more than powerful enough to rival Nangong Ting. With 10 of them present, how could Nangong Ting not be terrified?

In just a few exchanges, Nangong Ting was already riddled with wounds, and he looked just as miserable as Ling Han was.

At this moment, Ling Han circulated a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, fully healing his wounds. He then finally unleashed his trump cards in the Xuanyin Source Water and Nine Heavens Flame. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be powerful enough to dispose of the paper human. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

With these two Source Powers unleashed, his situation instantly took a turn for the better. However, he was still at a slight disadvantage. Upon seeing this, Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. The gulf between Severing Mundane Tier cultivators and Dividing Soul Tier elites was truly far too great.

Moreover, the paper human was only a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier elite!

However, Ling Han should have considered the fact that he was only at the second severance, yet he was already able to battle against a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier elite for so long. This was simply unfathomable.

Meanwhile, Nangong Ting was already starting to show signs of collapse.

He was only at the early stage of the fourth severance, and although he was a king tier, he would still be at a disadvantage even if he came across just a single Battle Beast. Thus, how could he rival 10 of them? Moreover, these were Battle Beasts that had been summoned by a celestial technique, meaning that they were undying and unafraid of being wounded. As such, he couldn’t even threaten them with mutual destruction.

The Flame Control Technique and the Ten Beasts Technique—these were two Celestial King Tier techniques. Combined with the unique environment of this mystery realm, they had now formed this incredibly powerful battle prowess.

Nangong Ting had no option but to command the paper human to rush over and protect him. Otherwise, he would definitely be killed by the 10 Battle Beasts.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t allow this to happen. Relying on his powerful attacks, he forcefully prevented the paper human from rushing over to help Nangong Ting.

Pu!

He violently spat a mouthful of blood. It was far too difficult to battle against a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier elite head-on. After all, its battle prowess could probably rival that of kings among kings at the peak stage of the fourth severance. Right now, he was two entire minor levels weaker, so how could he not spit blood?

In fact, it was thanks to his insane physique that he was able to battle against it until now. If it had been Luo Changfeng or Zihe Bingyun, perhaps they would have already become a corpse by now.

When Ling Han spat his 13th mouthful of blood, the paper human suddenly ground to a halt, stopping all of its attacks.

Nangong Ting had already been brutally killed by the 10 Battle Beasts.

The paper human faltered for a moment before suddenly turning around, and sprinting toward the entrance of the mystery realm. Its speed was as quick as lightning.

Without a master, it was naturally returning to its owner.

However, this mystery realm was heaven knew how far away from the Lunar Sect, so it was hard to say whether the paper human had enough remaining energy to return.

Anyhow, this wasn’t something for Ling Han to worry about. After all, he would head to the Western Celestial Realm after leaving the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. Would the Lunar Sect pursue him through the boundless seas to exact revenge?

He retrieved a spatial ring from Nangong Ting’s corpse. As he was the Holy Son of a three-star sect, Nangong Ting’s wealth was naturally quite remarkable. A satisfied smile spread across Ling Han’s face.

Killing enemies and snatching their wealth was indeed the quickest way to gain riches. Thus, it was best for others not to provoke him. Otherwise, Nangong Ting’s today would be their tomorrow.

Ling Han removed the tree heart of the White Demon Tree. It was a semitransparent fist-sized crystal, and one could see mist-like matter swirling around on the inside.

That was the most concentrated of murderous auras. After refining it, he could use it to comprehend the Regulation of Slaughter.

The Empress stated that she didn’t need this matter. Her path wasn’t that of slaughter, so this tree heart was completely useless to her. In fact, it might even shake her Dao Heart.

Indeed, the Demonized Tree Heart was a precious treasure, yet it was also a double-edged sword at the same time. If one weren’t careful, they might end up wounding themselves instead. They might also undergo a huge change in personality, and that would be equivalent to becoming a completely different person.

Ling Han had full confidence in himself, and he was certain that he wouldn’t be affected by the negative emotions of the Demonized Tree Heart.

After resting for a while, they continued to venture through the plain.

The large black dog suddenly waved at Ling Han, and said, “Brat, come over here!”

“What crappy idea do you have now?” Ling Han asked in irritation.

The large black dog was wearing a solemn expression, and he asked, “Brat, how lofty is your goal?”

“...”

“Why have you suddenly become so serious? I can barely adjust to this,” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“I’m being serious!” the large black dog said with an expression of disdain.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before answering, “My goal is naturally to become a Celestial King!”

“Heh, becoming a Celestial King seems like a huge goal, yet in reality...” The large black dog stood up on his hind legs and clasped his front paws behind his back with a haughty posture before continuing, “Through the countless epochs, do you know how many Celestial Kings have appeared in the Celestial Realm?”

“Don’t tell me there are as many Celestial Kings as dogs!” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“Although that’s slightly exaggerated, there have definitely been more Celestial Kings than you can imagine,” the large black dog said slowly. “After becoming a Celestial King, one can truly break free from the Immortal’s Calamity. Through the countless epochs, heh...”

“Then why are there so few Celestial Kings now?” Ling Han asked in puzzlement. According to the large black dog, there should have been a huge number of Celestial Kings in existence. In fact, even One-Star Cities might have their own Celestial King.

The large black dog’s expression became grave, and he said, “Because they’ve all died!”

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily darkened. ‘Just then, you were still saying that there were as many Celestial Kings as dogs, and that they had already broken free from the Immortal’s Calamity. Now, however, you’re telling me that they’ve all died? Isn’t this statement self-conflicting?’

“Brat, you haven’t understood my meaning,” the large black dog said with a shake of his head. “Why have the Celestial Kings all died? It’s because they weren’t powerful enough!”

Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “You’re seriously confusing me!”
