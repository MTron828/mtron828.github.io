Chapter 2138: Four Seas City

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han shook his head and smiled. “Aunt Wei, I already have a beautiful wife, and am fully satisfied. There is no need to involve others for my sake.”

“No!” Shang Zhiwei shook her head resolutely. She had not succeeded in her own romance, which caused her to develop an extremist personality. Moreover, Ling Han was the heir of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, while An Ran was her disciple. As she saw it, this was the continuation of the affections from the previous generation, and could compensate for her regrets.

One refused repeatedly, while the other was forcibly coercing him, and they bargained over and over again.

Everyone was speechless. Was this still a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? How was it that she now seemed like a matchmaker? Moreover, if Holy Daughter An Ran knew about this, she would definitely fly into a thunderous rage.

…I have not complained about you yet, and you actually dare to reject me? Or so she’d say.

“Child, you really are stubborn!” Shang Zhiwei shook her head, but her eyes were filled with doting adoration. She had truly taken Ling Han to be her own son, and was using this kind of manner to pretend that she had finally married the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

She did not bother to talk any further with Ling Han. With a grab of her hand, Ling Han could not resist at all, and she had used her great power to grab him over, turning him into a mustard seed.

“We return to the Palace!” she exclaimed.

Immediately, the masses subsided like floodwaters. Meanwhile, Shang Zhiwei directly tore a hole into space, and traveled to the Four Seas Palace with a leap.

She had not achieved Dao through Regulations of Space, but having been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King for several epochs, she had abundant time to cultivate other Regulations of Great Dao as well. Thus, she could naturally cast space teleportation easily.

Practically every Ninth Heaven Celestial King was strong in every area. Thus, to dominate over your peers, and become an overlord even among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings was incredibly difficult.

The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King also tore a rip into space, and followed Shang Zhiwei.

He had not reached Ninth Heaven, but even with his natural talent, breaking through one Heaven would need boundless time. He would be blocked by the cultivation level barrier for several hundred million years without advancing the slightest inch. Thus, he naturally would also be cultivating other Regulations in his free time, and Space and Time were definitely the best options for him.

However, even if a Celestial king was going to study these two Regulations, they would need corresponding Celestial medicines, or corresponding Source Powers of heaven and earth. Otherwise, if they just relied on their own studies, their progress could be considered extremely minor.

Thus, he was very soon left so far behind Shang Zhiwei that he could not even see a sign of her.

His brow furrowed in a slight frown. There was something troubling him.

At first, he had planned to confess his feelings to Shang Zhiwei after destroying the Roc Palace because Shang Zhiwei would have already severed the last links she had with her old love. Yet now, Ling Han had actually popped out, causing Shang Zhiwei’s motherly affection to overflow. This had disrupted his plans completely.

He loved Shang Zhiwei, so he naturally could not allow Shang Zhiwei to have another man in her heart, even if she only considered this man as a child or nephew.

Thus, he considered Ling Han as a thorn in his side.

There was another reason. His disciple, Lin Xuan, was also extremely captivated by An Ran, and now Shang Zhiwei actually planned to betroth An Ran to Ling Han. Then, Lin Xuan’s hopes would naturally come to nothing. He was also very fond of this disciple of his, and considered him his own son. Now that his daughter-in-law was being taken, he was naturally displeased about it.

These two reasons compounded together caused the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King’s killing intent to soar.

Of course, there was definitely no possibility that he would make a move on Ling Han.

If he did make a move, with Shang Zhiwei’s insight, she would definitely be able to tell. By then, even if Shang Zhiwei did not kill him on the basis of their previous relations, she would definitely still mercilessly expel him—to say the least, it would be eternally impossible for there to be any outcome between the two of them.

However, was there any need for him to act personally when killing a mere Dividing Soul Tier?

There were more than enough elites that could kill this brat.

For example, his disciple, Lin Xuan, was already at First Secret of the Immortal Palace Tier, and was a monarch tier at that. Wouldn’t suppressing Ling Han be a very simple matter for him?

There were too many cases of failing to pull back in time in a spar, and accidentally killing someone. Even Shang Zhiwei couldn’t do anything about that, could she?

Moreover, with how proud An Ran was, if she found out that Shang Zhiwei had betrothed her to Ling Han, she, too, would probably be stomping with fury, and be the first to jump out and deal with Ling Han.

…An Ran was also at First Secret, and her battle prowess was in fact slightly superior even to Lin Xuan’s.

There would be… abundant opportunities for murder.

The Four Seas Palace was quite far away from the Roc Palace. Thus, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would have to spend seven days to complete the journey.?Shua

, Shang Zhiwei’s figure flashed, and appeared in front of a majestic great city.

The Four Seas Palace was not as simple as just a palace, but rather was a great city on the sea. It floated in the great ocean, as large as a star.

How could a city possibly float on the ocean?

It was not that the great city had been boosted by some kind of formations, and possessed the ability to stay afloat, but rather that there was a gigantic turtle below, bearing its weight. It was endlessly swimming in the ocean, and who knew how many epochs had passed. This great turtle had always been floating just like that on the surface of the ocean, and would eternally continue to float like this.

The Four Seas Palace ruled over this great city, and the true location of their sect was in the core of this city. There was a chain of connected palaces, and they were all sea blue in color. Under the sunlight, they looked like rippling waves.

“Respects for the Imperial Empress!” As Shang Zhiwei passed, the people on the streets all paid their respects.

Though attacking the Roc Palace had practically mobilized all the elites of the sect, there were still a great many servants and protective forces left behind to prevent their headquarters from being completely wiped out while they were off on their assault on the Roc Palace.

When she arrived at the main palace, Shang Zhiwei tossed out her hand, and Ling Han immediately enlarged, returning back to his original size. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Tianyun’s reincarnation,” she said once more, but her tone was now extremely strict.

Ling Han could only act shamelessly. Shaking his head, he said, “Hu Niu is just Hu Niu. She doesn’t have much connection with Senior Tianyun.” At present, he had two things he could fall back on. The first was Shang Zhiwei’s protective affections for him, and the second was the might of the Black Tower that could carry him off in flight away from this place. Small Tower was extremely confident that even a Heavenly Venerable Tier could not possibly stop it from leaving.

Of course, if he could settle matters peacefully, that was naturally best.

Shang Zhiwei looked at Ling Han steadily, supreme assertiveness on her beautiful face, seemingly wanting to intimidate Ling Han into giving in.

Unfortunately, Ling Han was least scared of this.

After a while, Shang Zhiwei suddenly broke into a smile. “An Ran is about to come out of seclusion. You two should get to know each other first.”

If she wanted to capture Ling Han, it would naturally be a piece of cake for her, but unlocking the Tower of Three Realms was another story. Furthermore, she also truly considered Ling Han as her own descendant, and did not want to force Ling Han into doing something that he did not wish to.

Thus, she came up with a very good idea: have Ling Han fall for An Ran, and he naturally would forget about Tianyun’s reincarnation, and obediently hand her over.

Though Ling Han did not want to get to know that An Ran, since Shang Zhiwei did not speak about the matter of Hu Niu, he naturally would not be reminding her. In any case, affections had to be mutual. If he stayed cool and indifferent on his side, how could An Ran actually fall in love with him?

For the time being, that was the plan.

He nodded. “I’ll do as you say, Aunt Wei.”

Shang Zhiwei was very pleased. The affections of the previous generation had no outcome, and she was determined that they would be realized in this later generation.

“Go on, you can walk around as you like in the Palace and in the city.”

He could walk around wherever he liked in the Palace and in the city, but another meaning to her words was that he could not leave the city. That was because Tianyun’s reincarnation was still with him. Before he handed her over, Shang Zhiwei would not let him leave no matter what.

Ling Han excused himself, and exited the main hall. Then, he saw an elder dressed in black robes appear noiselessly. This elder bowed to him in greeting.. “Young Master Ling, this old servant shall show you around first, and arrange accommodations for you as well.”
