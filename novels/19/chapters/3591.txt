Chapter 3592: Energy of Destruction

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A month’s time was actually very fast.

Ling Han felt a sense of urgency. He definitely had to open the formation before the disciple recruitment ceremony began, and leave the Primordial Sect. If he really had to acknowledge the Primordial True Lord as Master in full public, he would feel extremely disgusted.

Even if he was only using a disguise now.

Thus, if he really couldn’t break through the formation, he could only dig out the spiritual spring and flee.

There were still 15 days, 10 days, 7 days until the end of the month!

Ling Han finally had a major breakthrough. He decided to give it a try tonight.

At night, he once again arrived in front of the formation.

He activated his Eye Technique and made another observation. He nodded and said, “At first, there were no weak points here, but the dramatic change of heaven and earth has caused some damage to the formation. Thus, even if there were no weak points before, there would also be weak points now.”

With a leap, he fell into the formation.

The formation’s brilliance flickered, but did not attack him.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. His judgement was correct.

He also felt lingering fear. If he made a mistake and triggered the formation to attack him, he would only be able to wear the Battle Armor to save his life. It was still a question whether he could succeed or not.

Again.

He leaped forwards.

The formation still hadn’t been activated, and it was as if it didn’t exist.

Ling Han activated his Eye Technique, searching for any place where the power of heaven and earth would suddenly change. This was the nodal point, and also the weak point of the formation.

One step after another, and after spending close to half an hour, he finally walked out of the formation.

Ahead of him was a house. It was not very big, and was located in the centre of the entire formation.

Ling Han gave a light push, and the doors opened.

Of course, with the protection of such a powerful formation, what need was there for it to be locked?

There were Night Pearls adorned all over the room, so this room wasn’t dark at night0. Gentle light scattered down, as if it was moonlight.

Where was the treasure?

Aside from these pearls, it could be said that this place was completely bare. There was only a stone table and a stone stool placed in the centre, and there was also a piece of paper on the stone table. En, it should also be animal hide, giving people a feeling of solidity.

Could it be that it was another piece of Void Beast hide?

However, it was still too small, wasn’t it?

With hope in his heart, Ling Han walked to the stone table, and sat down. Then, he looked at the animal hide.

He immediately looked pleasantly surprised.

This was a Spirit Diagram that communicated with a kind of destructive dark energy.

Ling Han glanced at it, and it was as if his soul had been drawn into a strange space. There was incredibly dark energy everywhere, and no matter what it surged towards, everything would be destroyed.

Weng, the dimensions inside his body vibrated simultaneously, as if they were resonating, but also seemed to be joy, causing Ling Han’s body to tremble, and his soul immediately returned.

He stumbled, and almost fell. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

What was going on?

He took a look, and couldn’t help but feel shocked. That was because he had unknowingly placed both hands on the stone table just now, but now, where he was pressing down, there were two pieces missing. They were in the shape of a palm, and there was an additional layer of incredibly dark energy on his hands.

One had to realize that he hadn’t activated his mystical power at all. With a single push, two pieces of the stone table had disappeared?

What kind of terrifying destructive power was this!

Ling Han couldn’t help but stretch out his hand again, and pressed down on the stone table. Wherever his palm touched, the part of the stone table immediately disappeared, as if it had never existed in the first place.

Was this power of destruction?

Ling Han was shocked. When had he grasped that Spirit Diagram? He had actually communicated with this power of destruction, darkness or annihilation?

With a thought, he dispersed the energy in his hand, and looked once more at that Spirit Diagram.

Strictly speaking, he had not completely grasped this Spirit Diagram. He had only learnt a little, and could stimulate a portion of destructive energy — let’s call it Destructive Energy. This thing was really filled with destructive power.

Ling Han continued to watch. He was once again pulled into that dark space, and his consciousness separated from his physical body. It was only when the dimensions in his body shook at the same time that he woke up again. Then, his grasp of destructive energy increased further.

Strange, it was as if the one who had grasped the power of destruction was not him, but rather the dimensions within his body.

Ling Han scratched his head. The reason why he could break through to the Seventh Change was because of the power of living beings of the dimension inside his body. Now, however, he had inexplicably grasped this destructive power, and it was actually thanks to the dimensions inside his body. How could he not find this strange?

If it weren’t for the fact that he had nurtured these dimensions and these living beings himself, he would have suspected that he had fallen into the trap of some powerful being.

Even if his soul would often experience memory lapses, Ling Han still couldn’t control himself and continued to study this Spirit Diagram. After being muddleheaded a few times, Ling Han shockingly discovered that this Spirit Diagram was actually incomplete.

It was possible that it was only half, or even one third of the whole.

He had learnt it, but he was unable to stimulate the energy of destruction to the extreme.

Ling Han wanted to put away the Spirit Diagram, but discovered that this thing could not be stored into a Spatial Spirit Tool.

“No wonder this Spirit Diagram is placed here.” He nodded. Precisely because he could not store it into his Spatial Tool, and because the Primordial True Lord wanted to study it, he could only set up a formation to protect it. Thus, there was a table and stool here for this True Lord to proceed with his studies.

“Looking at this table and stool, there is no dust. Clearly, the Primordial True Lord has been studying this Spirit Diagram all this while.”

“In other words… he still hasn’t mastered the power of destruction.”

“Strange, I learnt it all at once, so what’s so difficult about it?”

“That’s not right. I myself have not learnt it, but rather my body is learning it, so I naturally know how to use it.”

“It’s like… I’m born with it.”

“F***, could it be that this Spirit Diagram has some relation with the Divine Stone?”

Ling Han felt like his head was about to explode. The fact that a Divine Stone could nurture an incredibly complex Genesis World was already an extremely strange thing. Then, this beast hide, or rather this Destruction Energy, was related to the Divine Stone, so it must also have a powerful background.

He could not leave it here.

Ling Han stowed the beast hide away, stuffed it into his robes, and then left.

After stealing such an important item, he obviously couldn’t stay any longer in the Primordial Sect. After all, this thing could be found with a single search.

Then let’s go.

Ling Han walked around the Spiritual Spring again, and took all of the Spiritual Spring. He then stored it away into his Spatial Tool. If he wanted it to fill up again, he would need at least a few years.

He left.

Ling Han quietly descended the mountain with the help of the Void Beast hide. Then, he returned to his original appearance, and strutted forwards.

Xiu, a figure flew down, standing in front of him.

It was an old servant of Niu Jianhua. However, he obviously didn’t recognize Ling Han.

“Uncle, what can I do for you?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Go on.” The old man merely swept an eye over Ling Han, then waved him off, looking impatient.

“Oh.” Ling Han nodded, and strode off.

“Wait!” The old man caught up again, and cast a second look at Ling Han. He frowned, “Your back view looks a little familiar.”

Ling Han’s expression remained unchanged, and he asked, “You’ve seen me before?”

“No.” The old man shook his head again, feeling that he had been overly suspicious. He waved his hand again, “Go on.”
