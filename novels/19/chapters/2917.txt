2918 Another round of killing

It could only be said that old man Bai Fan was really quite humorous as his son and grandson had both been given incomparably weird names by him.

Of course, Bai Fan’s father wasn’t a simple character, either. Had he not set a “good” example, there would have been no such “rising stars” as Bai Chi and Bai Mifan.

Ling Han had always thought that his ability to give names was terrible, but someone had upped the ante in this category, and he was indeed convinced of it today.

“Okay, joking’s over, let’s get going,” Ling Han said with a serious expression.

The four of them set off, heading towards Hysteria’s base camp.

Not long after, they were already drawing near.

After suffering losses once, currently not all of the Hysteria army went to rest, but there were actually some monsters standing guard. All of them were multi-eyed monsters, sending out waves of divine sense, and scanning the surrounding environment.

These sentries were merely Fourth Tiers, but they were indeed completely sufficient as guards.

The figures of Ling Han and the others trembled, and their aura changed immediately.

They transformed into the same appearance as Hysteria’s troops, and their aura was also similar. If one was to just give them a customary glance, it would be impossible to detect their disguise, but it would be different if one was to scan over them carefully as their true colors would definitely be revealed.

It didn’t matter, since these monsters weren’t the intelligent type. In fact, they were extremely dim-witted.

Ling Han and the other three took large strides as they entered the camp. The divine sense of those sentry guards merely swept over them, and didn’t stay long upon them at all.

The four began to look for targets to snipe, and soon locked down on three of them.

“In order to ensure a successful strike, Brother Bai and I will each be in charge of one, while the other will be entrusted to Brother Xuan Feng and Brother Fu,” Ling Han said as he assigned the tasks. “We will kill these three monsters today.”

“Alright.” Bai Mifan and the others nodded in unison. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Neither Bai Mifan nor Xuan Feng asked Ling Han how to break out of the siege once the mission was completed; they believed in Ling Han.

The four took their positions, and then launched an attack simultaneously.

Pu!

As soon as Ling Han made a move, he went all out. He channeled the first-grade seal, thereby boosting his strength to more than 80 times, and his power was unstoppable. The leader monster didn’t react at all, and its head was instantly blown off by Ling Han.

He immediately put away the opponent’s body, and then leapt towards Bai Mifan.

Bai Mifan also attacked with his full strength, his eyes glowing as he projected a world to suppress his target.

But his target was surprisingly strong, and actually managed to withstand this blow.

Seeing that all the monsters around opened their eyes, exuding endless hostility, Bai Mifan shouted again. His left eye also opened wide, and out flew a second world.

There were actually two dimensions in his body!

Boom! This power was too great; the target monster let out a shrill scream, and sent out a spiritual attack in its death throes.

Bai Mifan let out a muffled groan, but the descent of the two worlds continued unabated. Peng! The target monster was instantly crushed to bits.

Boom! This was the projection of two dimensions, so how terrifying was this power? Immediately, a strong shock wave in the shape of a mushroom spread out, charging in all directions. Peng, peng, peng! Countless Hysteria troops were sent flying, and they had no time at all to make a move, giving Bai Mifan buffer time.

When the attacks from further away reached him, Bai Mifan had also recovered from the spiritual attack. He immediately turned around, and rushed towards Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng.

These two people were not as strong as Ling Han and Bai Mifan, so even if they used all their ultimate moves, they still couldn’t kill the target. They only managed to inflict severe injuries on it.

“Don’t bother about it!” Ling Han said, his figure charging over. “Prepare to retreat.”

The four of them charged murderously in a single direction. As long as they could meet at one point, Ling Han would be able to tear a rip in space and take the three of them away.

“Wishful thinking!” a leader monster said coldly. It commanded the troops, mobilized the army to carry out a fierce attack, and kept Ling Han and the others separated from one another, preventing them from reuniting.

Ling Han let out a long roar; even if Bai Mifan and the others possessed freakish abilities, they wouldn’t be able to withstand a simultaneous attack from tens of thousands of opponents with Fifth-Tier power. He had to take them out quickly.

Peng, peng, peng! He channeled the ninth-grade combination seals, and he was unstoppable.

“Brother Bai, keep up with me!” He first joined up with Bai Mifan, and then charged towards Xuan Feng and Fu Yuan.

He teamed up with Bai Mifan, and their battle prowess was astonishing, being invincible all the way.

Just as it seemed like they were about to reach Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng, the situation suddenly changed, and Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng were unexpectedly separated.

Ling Han had no choice but to first charge towards Xuan Feng, who was closer to him. He rescued him, and then rushed towards Fu Yuan.

The three men’s joint forces were unstoppable, yet Fu Yuan was also being pushed back slowly by the monsters, slowly extending the distance between the two sides.

Seeing that Ling Han and the others were all starting to accrue injuries, Fu Yuan immediately yelled loudly, “You guys go first!”

If Ling Han and the others were to leave, then he would definitely lose his life.

“We came together, and we’ll go back together!” Ling Han finally didn’t hold back anymore, and channeled all the eighth-grade seals. Instantly, he became unstoppable. With the boost of nearly 1,000 times the strength, how could the Fifth-Tier monsters possibly be his match?

Leading Xuan Feng and Bai Mifan, Ling Han rushed towards Fu Yuan’s side. He grabbed Fu Yuan, and tore open space without the slightest hesitation. He made his way through it, bringing the three of them together with him.

Xiu, the four of them disappeared immediately. Even if Hysteria’s army also tore through space, it would be impossible to find them.

Ling Han and the others traveled through space, and they soon returned to the Flaming Frost Realm.

“This is truly wonderful!” Bai Mifan clapped his hands and laughed. He knew that Ling Han had to be proficient in some kind of escape method, or it would have been impossible for him to escape when he had broken into the base camp of Hysteria’s army the first time, but Bai Mifan didn’t expect it to be in such a way.

“I really want to go for another round of killing!” Xuan Feng said, his face full of excitement.

Penetrating deep into the army camp and yet being able to leave in one piece was worth remembering for a lifetime.

Ling Han looked at Bai Mifan. “You really hide it too well, you have actually accommodated two small worlds in your body!”

Bai Mifan scratched his head. “I had no intention of hiding it. I initially wanted to use it when I was sparring with you, but you called a ceasefire in the end.”

When Ling Han thought about it, it was indeed so.

“How did you do it?” Ling Han was very curious because Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing walked the same path, but they could only accommodate a single small world. Needless to say, the power of two dimensions had to be stronger.

Ling Han quickly added, “If it’s a secret, then there’s no need to force yourself.”

Bai Mifan smiled. “It’s not a big secret. All it takes is for a Seventh Tier to create a space in the Dantian to accommodate another small world.”

...

“Can a third and fourth small world be accommodated as well?” Ling Han asked.

“No.” Bai Mifan shook his head. “Even if it is just two dimensions, not everyone can accommodate them, and one could easily be sucked dry as the dimensions grow. Perhaps one couldn’t even survive past the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier level at all, and would get blown up by the power of the two dimensions.”

Ling Han shot him a glance. “You’ve said so much, but actually you are just showing off how amazing you are.”

“I’m not.” Bai Mifan’s face was very solemn.

“Yeah, right,” Xuanfeng jeered.

“Beat him up!” Ling Han took the lead in making a move. The three of them joined forces. No matter how freakish Bai Mifan was, he couldn’t withstand it, and was soon screaming loudly as he was getting pummeled.
