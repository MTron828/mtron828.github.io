Chapter 889: The power of regulation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After a moment of distraction, Li Weiwei swiftly halted Ling Han’s movement again, saying, “Do you know why the enrollment test of the Scarlet Heaven Academy isn’t based on battle prowess, but rather martial arts talent, the strength of one’s spirit, and battle skills—these three areas?”

“Oh, why?” Ling Han asked with a smile. Actually, he really didn’t want to indulge in idle chit chat with this crafty and unruly young lady. The Immortal Realm’s regulations were perfected—he had planned to spend the next ten days to cultivate the power of regulation.

Perhaps he couldn’t even scratch the surface with ten days of cultivation, but it was better than squandering the time away.

Li Weiwei was quite vexed. ‘Why is this guy always giving me the cold shoulder? He was like this in front of my father, and still the same now that we are alone!’

One should know that she was one of the three great beauties in the Imperial Capital; who knew how many young elites would want to be alone with her. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

‘This blockhead from a small world! There must be something wrong with his brain, that’s why he doesn’t know how to appreciate my beauty! No, he must be an ice block. That’s right! Otherwise, why would he be called Ling Han 1 ?’

She snorted, and said, “Because if you remain in the Shattering Void Tier longer, you can always improve your battle prowess slightly. But in this world, the most important thing is still advancing through the cultivation levels. Your martial arts talent and strength of spirit will determine the speed of your advancement through the cultivation levels in the Immortal level, and battle skills will be the key to victory in a battle between those of the same level.”

“It makes sense.” Ling Han nodded. This was truly the case, so he certainly agreed.

Li Weiwei had the urge to strangle Ling Han to death. ‘I have said so much, and you merely responded with an ‘it makes sense’ in a dismissive manner?’ She pouted, and said, “Blockhead, I will be looking forward to seeing you being taught a good lesson! Also, after ten days, if I win, then you will have to kneel before me and concede defeat!”

Ling Han burst out laughing. How was it possible that he would lose? He nodded, and said, “That’s a promise! But, what if I win?”

“If you win? Pah! If you win, you win. Don’t tell me that you even want me to proclaim defeat?” Li Weiwei initially wanted to add on some grand speech, but then she recalled the strength he exhibited earlier, and thus immediately changed her mind.

‘I am the daughter of the Left Minister, so I can be this willful. Infuriate you to death!’

Ling Han just smiled, and did not take this to heart. He bypassed Li Weiwei and walked into the house.

Li Weiwei thought to stop him, but after some consideration, gave up on the idea.

It would be better to wait for Luo Ba to challenge Ling Han. At most, it would only be ten days—she would have another match with Ling Han then. She didn’t believe that she would lose to Ling Han in the areas of martial arts talent, strength of the spirit, and battle skills.

As long as she won in one area, she could boast about it—winning in one area was still a win, right? As for the two areas that she lost? Pah, pah, pah! If that blockhead dared to bring this up, she would have his head!

Ling Han returned inside the courtyard, and began practicing his cultivation in seclusion.

Upon stepping into the Flower Blossom Tier 2 , he would be placed above the rest. It would only be ten days away. He didn’t want to stir up any trouble.

The regulations of the Immortal Realm were complete, and just by looking at the limited destructive power of the Shattering Void Tier, it could be deduced that the space in this realm was stable to a terrifying degree. In a sense, the Immortal level was a process of comprehending the power of regulation.

At different stages, comprehension of the power of regulation would be different, and the destructive power would also be different accordingly.

Upon reaching the Genesis Tier, just one thought could break limitless regulations and easily destroy a planet—infinitely terrifying. However, whether it could be done just by attaining the minor accomplishment of the Genesis Tier or one ought to reach the level of perfection, no one knew.

After all, Yi Shuang Shuang was merely in the Sun Moon Tier, while Cheng Yun had only reached the Mountain River Tier, so it would be impossible for them to know the different capabilities of the four minor layers within the Genesis Tier.

Ling Han closed his eyes, letting his spirit come in touch with this world, comprehending the power of regulation.

A cultivator of the Shattering Void Tier would have such preliminary qualification.

Moreover, he had also refined a little Demonic Qi of the Asura Demon Emperor, and attained some power of regulation of the Netherworld. Although the powers of regulation of the two realms were completely different, at least they were on the same level. Inevitably, there ought to be some basis for reference.

Suddenly, he was struck with an idea. ‘What if I could master the power of regulation of the two realms, Immortal Realm and Netherworld, at the same time? One hand is Yin and the other hand is Yang, like the opposing force between heaven and earth. Who could block a strike like this?’

But then, he immediately shook his head. He hadn’t any comprehension of the Immortal Realm’s power of regulation, but what about the Netherworld? He was only now passively mastering traces of it, and still very far from reaching the level of minor accomplishment.

‘Unless there is a chance to go to the Netherworld.’

This wasn’t impossible. There were two weak spots in the barrier of the Immortal Realm. If the Netherworld could storm in here, then the Immortal Realm could also charge out of there.

‘This would require extremely powerful strength. It would be akin to suicide if I go over now! Besides, I haven’t even grasped the power of regulation of the Immortal Realm, why bother to think about the Netherworld?’

He laughed in spite of himself, thinking that he was really too greedy.

A period of two to three days passed by quietly.

Unexpectedly, there was no movement in the Luo Clan. Perhaps they knew that Ling Han would participate in the assessment of the Northern Institution, and planned to settle the disagreement at that time. On the contrary, Li Weiwei seemed to be hooked onto Ling Han. She would come to make a fuss at least every alternate day, but would always leave in anger. She simply wouldn’t learn her lesson, and would come to be angered again the next day.

Ten days passed by quickly. Ling Han stopped cultivating and opened up his right palm—there were traces of interweaving golden light on it.

That was the power of regulation, but it was just too weak.

Limited to the realm, whether it was the Shattering Void Tier, Mountain River Tier, or other levels, there was a limit to the degree of comprehension of the power of regulation. Now, there was still a very huge gap between Ling Han’s current level and the highest limit of the Shattering Void Tier. If this limit was compared to one hundred, then he had not even reached one yet.

‘I may appear to have reached the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, but there is still a lot of room for improvement—it’s truly unsuitable to charge towards Immortal level.’

Just by surveying the Immortal level, one could already tell. Which among those like Xiao Miaoyan and Wu Gaoyuan had not already reached the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier? Their battle prowess had also reached eighteen Stars, but why didn’t they charge towards the Immortal level?

It wasn’t because they weren’t able to, but rather because it wasn’t the right time yet. Charging forward then would affect their battle prowess in the Immortal level.

Who didn’t want to become a One-star, Two-star, or even Three-star or Four-star Genius, or even barely limited to the legendary Five-star Genius!

“Blockhead! Blockhead!” Li Weiwei rushed over energetically. “The admission examination for the Northern Institution has begun. Quickly, quickly! I must defeat you today and make you admit defeat!”

Ling Han gave a wry smile, and said, “Okay, lead the way!”

Li Weiwei immediately rolled her eyes, and said, “Why should I lead the way, do you take me as your servant?”

“I do not know the way,” Ling Han replied.

Li Weiwei couldn’t help but be speechless. This reason was absolutely valid, so she had no basis for a rebuttal. She clenched her teeth in spite—how was it that this blockhead would always find a way to make her angry?

She wasn’t a narrow-minded person, but facing Ling Han would always give rise to a violent impulse in her.

“Come with me!” She led the way in front, but a moment later emphasized, “I am not leading the way for you, rather, you are my follower. Understand?”

Ling Han just chuckled lightly, causing Li Weiwei to almost go berserk.
