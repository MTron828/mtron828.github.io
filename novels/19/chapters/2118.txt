Chapter 2119: Way to leave

“Damn! Damn!”

The Black Dragon King’s fury incinerated the heavens, her killing intent blazing like an ocean. She sent out another palm strike at Ling Han.

“Yiyaya!” A familiar voice rang out. Xiao Gu appeared, but this time, Xiao Gu was no longer in human form, but rather was a bone that was diffused in Celestial Qi. Practically ignoring all rules of space, he appeared instantly in front of Ling Han.

Boom, the Black Dragon King’s strike descended.

Xiao Gu was instantly sent flying. If he was alone, he was considerably inferior to the Black Dragon King, and would not be qualified to block the Black Dragon King’s strike. However, his original body was as tough as Divine Metal, and even after sustaining a blow from the Black Dragon King, he was still undamaged.

A frightening storm of energy surged past. This was the furious blow venting the anger of a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

Hong, long, long, black-colored energy was surging through the entire valley violently, and turning into an ocean. The power of Regulation that did not belong to this realm was flaring, but because it could not achieve resonance and be replenished by the Regulations of heaven and earth, it was already disappearing at an overwhelmingly fast rate.

To the heaven and earth, this kind of energy, this kind of Regulations was a disease. Thus, the body would heal itself as soon as possible, and erase this kind of energy and Regulations.

“Where is he?” Black Dragon King’s figure descended, but there was no further trace of Ling Han in the valley.

“He has definitely not been crushed, but has rather hidden into a Spatial God Tool.”

She had seen very clearly. In the instant the storm of energy attacked him, Ling Han’s figure had disappeared in a flash. In that case, he had to have entered into a Spatial God Tool. However, what kind of Spatial God Tool could remain unharmed after sustaining a blow from her?

“A Celestial King Tool?” An expression of confusion appeared on her face.

“Wherever this brat is, I must find him! He actually retrieved six Source Powers of heaven and earth!

“There are only a total of nine here!

“Damn it, he is really despicable!”

The Black Dragon King stomped her foot. She had thought that only the Eternal Celestial King and Xiao Gu were her greatest foes. She had not imagined that the one to really stab her in the back was what was only an ant in her eyes.

“Don’t let me find you, or I will let you know what hell on earth means!” She swore harshly, her divine sense spreading out, and beginning to search for Ling Han all over the world.

Could she find Ling Han?

The answer was negative.

It was not that the Black Tower’s concealment ability was very strong, but rather that Ling Han was no longer on this mainland. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

…After being struck by the Black Dragon King, the Black Tower had soared to the skies with all the other dirt and dust. Then, it was swept into the vacuum, and instantly blown away by the storm of energy. Very soon, it became unknown how far away it had been swept away.

Within the Black Tower, Ling Han sprawled out on the ground, panting harshly. Just now, it had really been extremely dangerous. If it were not the Source Power of Slaughter and Xiao Gu having each blocking a blow for him, he probably would not have had any time to enter into the Black Tower.

“Too dangerous,” he concluded. If he had to bet his life on the chances of having someone else save him, what if there came a day that no one came to save him?

“However, if I had not taken the risk at that time, I would not have been able to retrieve the Source Power of Slaughter. There was no other alternative,” he continued.

“I can still use Rising From The Ashes, and have the capital to die once.”

He laid down this matter first, and began to inspect himself.

There were a total of eight Source Powers!

He was only one more Source Power away from the maximum limit of nine.

It had seemed to be an incredibly difficult task to manifest nine divided souls at Dividing Soul Tier, and would possibly need an extensive time of tens of billions or hundreds of billions of years to accomplish, but he had not thought that he would be able to retrieve a total of four Source Powers of heaven and earth in one go.

‘To be frank, I really have to thank that Vicious Bear Gang Leader.

‘Additionally, for a daughter-in-law to bring so much good fortune even to her father-in-law, she would definitely bring even more good fortune to my son. En, this daughter-in-law definitely cannot be missed.

‘Still… how am I supposed to leave?’

This was vacuum. The violent energy here could even destroy Ascending Origin Tier elites. No matter how strong Ling Han’s physique was, there was no way it had reached Ascending Origin Tier. In that case, it would only be committing suicide if he left.

Then what was he to do?

Just stay inside the Black Tower, right until he cultivated all the way to Celestial King Tier?

That was impossible. To manifest his Earth Soul and Heaven Soul, he would have to go to a specific location. It was the same for Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier. If he stayed inside the Black Tower, he would only be stuck at Yin Soul Tier for his whole life, and then as time passed, he would be plagued by the Immortal’s Tribulation. There would eventually come a day when the Immortal’s Tribulation strengthened to an extent where his lifespan would be severed.

“Small Tower, is there any way out?” Ling Han asked.

“There are two options,” Small Tower answered in a very calm tone.

There were actually as many as two options?

“Tell me about it.”

“First, I let the Black Tower release its might, and it would naturally be a piece of cake to tear open a rip in space, and return to the Celestial Realm,” Small Tower said. “However, if that were to happen, those old monsters would definitely discover my existence.”

Ling Han sighed. Though this could immediately solve the problem, the new problem that would be caused seemed to be even more troublesome, so he could only skip this option.

“Then, what’s the second choice?”

“You can use the Source Powers of the Five Elements to protect yourself, and would be able to resist the space storm for an extremely short time. Then, you can use the Great Clash of Source Powers, and there is a chance that you can break out of this space,” Small Tower said.

“Then, that’s decided.”

Ling Han did not want to waste any more time, and immediately sat down in a cross-legged position, beginning to deal with the Source Powers of heaven and earth inside his body.

Firstly, it was a very migraine-inducing matter to have eight different Source Powers to get along well. Each and every Source Power wanted to monopolize the world inside Ling Han’s Dantian. This naturally needed Ling Han to play mediator.

And it just so happened that all of them were bosses. If any one of them left Ling Han’s main body, they would have the ability to kill him instantly.

Thus, Ling Han could only harmonize them, and could not suppress them by force. This made him feel very depressed.

Thankfully, he had dealt with all eight of these Source Powers of heaven and earth within 7,000 years, and because time passed swiftly inside the Black Tower, he had actually only used seven years in real time.

“Let’s try out the defense of Source Powers first,” Ling Han mumbled to himself. The Five Elements supported and subdued each other, and could cause a burst of terrifying destructive power. At the same time, they could also form a boundless defense through their mutual support.

He began experimenting.

Even if time passed at an accelerated pace inside the Black Tower, he had still used up what would equate to 4,000 years in real time to finally smoothen out the power of the Five Elements so that they could form Celestial King Tier defense for a very short period of time.

This time was so short that it was practically nonexistent. In an actual battle, it would be too ineffective because when the attack of an elite shot over, it was impossible that it would surge over completely in a single instant. Then, what was the point of blocking the attack for an instant?

However, it was of great help in solving his present dilemma because Ling Han could control when he would sustain the barrage of the storm in the vacuum.

He was an outrageously bold man, and he rushed out of the Black Tower without the slightest hesitation.

Boom, the violent storm of energy immediately assaulted him.

With a?bang, Ling Han immediately retreated back into the Black Tower.

At least half of all the bones in his body were broken, his face as pale as paper. Almost half his life was gone.

‘F***, the time it can be maintained is even shorter than I imagined. When I exited and came back in, I have still been grazed by the storm of energy, and almost died.’ Ling Han felt lingering fear. Even if he could use Rising From The Ashes, to revive in vacuum was actually just committing suicide again.

‘No, I have to make it that the time it can be maintained would be extended just a bit more.’

For the sake of this bit of additional time, Ling Han spent another 3,000 years in real time.

One attempt after another, and though he was still injured every time, the extent of his injuries was becoming lighter. Finally, one day, he did not suffer the slightest injury when he exited and reentered.

“All right, now it’s only the Great Clash of Source Powers. Time to see if it can tear a rip in vacuum.”
