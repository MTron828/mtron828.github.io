Chapter 3513: Formation Scroll

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han followed Zhu Qi, but it was not to the Imperial Palace, but rather the outskirts.

By the looks of it, Chen Fengyan truly trusted Zhu Qi. After all, even the Imperial Princes didn’t know where Chen Fengyan was cultivating in seclusion.

“Lord Ling, His Majesty really thinks highly of you. You have to know that His Majesty has never seen anyone since he went into seclusion,” Zhu Qi said enviously.

Ling Han merely smiled, “Lord Zhu, you are the most popular person in front of His Majesty, right?”

“This old servant is only doing my duty faithfully, and working wholeheartedly for His Majesty,” Zhu Qi said very modestly.

Ling Han still didn’t understand why such a powerful elite was willing to become an eunuch in the palace. It was clear that Mystery Realm Tier had been extremely rare previously.

Forget it, this was his private matter.

The two of them arrived at the foot of a mountain, and continued to climb the mountain. When they arrived at the summit, Zhu Qi told Ling Han to wait for a while, and he went to ask Chen Fengyan for instructions.

After a short while, Chen Fengyan appeared before them. He was dressed in casual clothes, and it was as if he were an ordinary person.

Ling Han hurriedly clasped his hands and said, “Greetings, Holy Emperor.

He was slightly curious, because he felt that Chen Fengyan’s condition was a little strange. In curiosity, he activated his ocular technique, yet was shocked, because this Chen Fengyan was actually formed from a ball of energy, and was not a physical object at all.

“This is my embodiment, not the real me,” Chen Fengyan said calmly, as if he had seen through Ling Han’s thoughts.

A manifestation?

Chen Fengyan saw the puzzled look on Ling Han’s face, and took the initiative to explain, “After advancing into Spirit Transformation Tier, one can transform into a Spirit Body with a single thought. If one’s abilities are not strong enough, or has not cultivated an eye technique, it is impossible to distinguish whether it is real or fake.’

Spirit Transformation?

This was the fifth step on the Celestial Path. Spirit Transformation Tier elites were also respectfully referred to as True Lords, and the strongest elites in the prison were Spirit Transformation Tier elites, who were inconceivably powerful.

Hiss, Chen Fengyan was actually a True Lord of Spirit Transformation Tier? What a powerful guy. He was just a step away from becoming an elite of the Sect Master-level.

Ling Han found this strange. Why did Chen Fengyan treat him so well? This had already surpassed his admiration of talent in the ordinary sense of the word.

“Are you very curious why I have always been so supportive of you?” Chen Fengyan voiced Ling Han’s confusion.

Ling Han nodded, “I am indeed very curious.”

“You saw that monkey at Haiping Mountain, right?” Chen Fengyan changed the

topic.

Ya?’

Ling Han nodded, and said, “That’s my big brother.”

Chen Fengyan’s expression clearly froze. After a long while, he finally said, “I’ve seen you use the Demonic Monkey Fists before, so I already knew that you were related to that monkey.”

‘So that’s how it is. No wonder Chen Fengyan has always viewed me in a new light. As it turns out, it’s because of Brother Monkey.’ Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, what was the relationship between Chen Fengyan and Brother Monkey?

“Your Majesty seems to know Brother Monkey?” Ling Han asked. “Brother

Monkey also said…”

“Say what?” Chen Fengyan asked. It was rare for him to lose his composure. Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Brother Monkey was just joking. He said he would spank Your Majesty’s behind or something.

Chen Fengyan’s expression instantly became extremely awkward. He was a Spirit Transformation Tier elite, and he could be considered an elite on any planet. One step further, and he would be able to become a super elite of the Sect Master-level.

And now someone was threatening that they would spank his behind, how could he accept this?

After being stunned for a while, he finally said, “My Imperial Father once became sworn brothers with that monkey. Ordinarily, I would have to address him as Eighth Uncle.”

Which also meant that there were at least eight people that had become sworn brothers at that time.

Hold on, your old man?

Ling Han looked at Chen Fengyan in surprise. Though he had already guessed this, hearing it from Chen Fengyan’s mouth, he was still a little shocked. Was this really an ancient person from more than two thousand years ago?

Chen Fengyan nodded, and admitted frankly, “That’s right. I came from the last generation. However, when the nation fell, I was sealed, and was only released over a hundred years ago.”

Ling Han instantly thought of many things. Needless to say, the Royal Empire that had been destroyed that Brother Monkey had spoken of was the predecessor of the Dark North Nation. At that time, the old king had died in battle, yet sealed his son. It was only until a change of heaven and earth not too long ago that he appeared.

It was no wonder that Chen Fengyan was inconceivably powerful. As it turned out, he was an existence from the last generation. He was probably already standing at the fourth level of Celestial Path at that time. Perhaps, he had been a True Lord of Spirit Transformation, so he didn’t need to worry about the changes in the environment of heaven and earth.

Going by that theory, this Chen Fengyan was his junior, so he should be calling him… Ninth Uncle?

“Cough.” Chen Fengyan coughed, and said, “We’ll each follow our own way of address. Your relationship with that monkey won’t affect your relationship with me.”

Ling Han looked at Chen Fengyan, and thought to himself, ‘How many times has this Holy Emperor suffered at the hands of Brother Monkey? Is that why he keeps talking about that monkey?

What a pitiful child.

“You’ve been doing quite well recently. Continue to maintain it,” Chen Fengyan said. “Since you’re quite talented in formations, I’ll gift you a formations treasured book that Fourth Uncle left behind years ago.”

He sighed, “Fourth Uncle was prodigious, and could have possibly become the strongest Formation Master in the world. In the battle with the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire, he used formation techniques to kill five of their Sect Master-level characters, but in the end, he still died tragically.”

“Ling Han, regarding the matter of me and that monkey, you definitely can’t tell anyone else about it. Otherwise, the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire will definitely make a comeback, and now is not the time to confront them head-on.”

Ling Han nodded. This Azure Dragon Majestic Empire must be the executioner that destroyed the previous generation’s civilization. Previously, they used the Celestial Sea Planet as a prison, and now a large number of “criminals were fleeing. This should alert them.

At that time, if they discovered that there were still some that had slipped through the net, they would definitely begin another massacre.

However, as long as Brother Monkey managed to escape, he would possess the strength of a Venerate Tier, so what if he had to face the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire head-on?

As he spoke, Zhu Qi came over again, bearing a wooden box, which he handed over to Ling Han.

“Work hard,” Chen Fengyan said.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded. After calculating their seniority, it was really very difficult for him to feel any respect for this “nephew”.

“Go on,” Chen Fengyan said with a wave of his hand. His body trembled, and he transformed into a streak of light that dissipated.

Zhu Qi also bowed slightly towards Ling Han in greeting, and quietly retreated. Ling Han stood at the summit. He looked at the wooden box in his hands. It was already very old, exuding an ancient aura, but it was still very well-preserved.

He simply sat down, opened the wooden box, and saw that there was a piece of animal hide inside. It was clearly placed there, yet gave off an ethereal feeling.

He took out the beast hide. It was incredibly light, as if it did not have the slightest bit of weight.

He unfolded it and took a look. Unexpectedly, this hide was surprisingly long, and he only reached its end after stretching out for close to thirty meters.

The beast hide recorded a large amount of formation patterns. These weren’t the Elementary Level or even Middle Level Level patterns that he had previously grasped, but rather brand new formation patterns. He only looked at the first formation pattern, and his mind was completely absorbed. Who knew how much time had passed before he suddenly came back to his senses. He immediately felt a headache, and his whole person swayed. He felt as if his spirit had been sucked dry.

He couldn’t help but be shocked. These formation patterns were too terrifying, weren’t they? One look was enough to almost empty him out, so how was he supposed to study them?

No wonder there were so few Formation Masters..
