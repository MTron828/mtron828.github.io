2776 Heavenly Venerable Seals

Strange. Why didn’t the Empress have it?

Ling Han then sought out Zhou Yan.

“An incomplete seal?” Zhou Yan was taken aback for a moment, and then inhaled sharply. “Brother Ling, you are truly heaven-defying!”

“What do you mean?” Ling Han was startled and confused by his reaction.

“Do you know what is the very most valuable entity for a Heavenly Venerate?” Instead of answering him, Zhou Yan posed another question.

“What?” Ling Han asked. “Could it be these seals?”

Zhou Yan nodded. “The more Heavenly Venerable Seals you have mastered, the faster your rate of cultivation would be because this is actually a bridge or channel to communicate with the power of heaven and earth. The more channels you have, the more your gains will naturally be.”

He was startled, and then began to inhale sharply. “Brother Ling, you said ‘these seals’? Hiss, could it be that aside from this seal, you have also mastered other seals?”

Ling Han did not hide it from him, and said, “I have a Heavenly Venerate Tool. When it attained Dao, a seal once appeared.”

“You are truly lucky!” Zhou Yan was extremely rueful. “Ordinarily, the Heavenly Venerable Seals that we can obtain are obtained through our Heavenly Venerate Tool, but the seal that is obtained in this manner is the same for everyone because this is the final step that is taken after Devouring Metal has absorbed a sufficient amount of Divine Metal.”

Ling Han nodded. The path of advancement for Devouring Metal was similar, just like how every single disciple in the same sect would be cultivating the same cultivation technique.

“Hence, it is said that there are a total of seven Heavenly Venerable Seals, and this much is also mastered by the majority of Heavenly Venerates. However, some freakish Heavenly Venerates can discover even more Heavenly Venerable Seals through their extensive periods of cultivation,” Zhou Yan said.

“However, this can only be done by a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate at least.

“A case like Brother Ling, when it would appear by itself upon your breakthrough to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, is practically… inconceivable!”

Zhou Yan was filled with envy. This Heavenly Venerable Seal that he had comprehended by himself was what was most suitable to one, and would have the strongest effect of improvement.

“Furthermore, Heavenly Venerable Seals can also be used in battle, condensing the power of heaven and earth, and the might unleashed… would definitely be shocking.”

Ling Han gave an oh. Why had he been unable to use those seals in battle before, then? En, that was because he had still not been a Heavenly Venerate yet, and could not truly draw and use the power of heaven and earth.

“Brother Ling, the Heavenly Venerable Seals have incredibly great implications. For any Heavenly Venerate, they could be considered to be filled with temptation. Thus, you must firmly guard this secret, or even if you have accomplished massive credits for the Genesis World, there may still be people who would scheme against you,” Zhou Yan warned solemnly.

Ling Han was surprised. “Could it be that these Heavenly Venerable Seals can actually be extracted?”

Zhou Yan nodded. “In an encounter with a higher tier Heavenly Venerate, they could refine you forcefully, and there is some chance that they could extract that Heavenly Venerable Seal from you.”

“Brother Zhou wouldn’t be tempted as well?” Ling Han joked.

Zhou Yan nodded. “To be honest with you, I am truly tempted, but I have not lost all reason to actually harm a hero. Moreover, I am no match for you.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. This guy was actually quite interesting.

“Brother Zhou, thank you.”

Zhou Yan nodded. “Don’t worry. I will not leak out your secret.”

“I trust you.”

***

Ling Han returned to his quarters, and told the Empress about what he had found out about the Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Why was it when the two of them condensed the Power of Dimension of various dimensions, no Heavenly Venerable Seals were formed when the Empress broke through?

“There are two possible reasons. Firstly, the Power of Dimension that you have condensed is not enough, and secondly, your battle prowess has not reached that level yet,” Ling Han deduced. “Zhou Yan said that it would have to be a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, at least, that can possibly discover it.

“Your battle prowess is only at the Second Tier, but I have reached the Third Tier. This may be the reason.”

The Empress nodded. Then she’d just wait and see. When she advanced to the Second Tier, her battle prowess would definitely be able to match a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate’s. At that time, she would see if a Heavenly Venerable Seal would appear automatically.

Ling Han made a comparison. He casually dismissed the Heavenly Venerable Seal that was obtained from the Divine Demon Sword, and the efficiency of his extraction of the power of heaven and earth declined to around 25 times, but when he dismissed the Heavenly Venerable Seal that he had just mastered, the efficiency rate dropped to 11 times.

The gap… was incredibly apparent.

Indeed, what was suited to him was what would truly be the most useful.

But this did not affect the value of Heavenly Venerable Seals. As long as there were enough of them, the rate of cultivation could be raised to 100, 1000, or 10,000 times.

“Could it be that the reason why Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian could cultivate so quickly is because they have mastered a considerable number of Heavenly Venerable Seals?” Ling Han murmured. “Then if I want to surpass them, I will need to master even more Heavenly Venerable Seals.”

At present, his rate of cultivation was not much affected by Heavenly Venerable Seals, because he was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate. He could extract power from the heaven and earth, but it still mostly came from himself.

However, after he reached Second Tier, what he would be cultivating would be the fundamental power of the Genesis World, and that could only be sped up by Heavenly Venerable Seals.

“Let’s go to the second spatial level.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ling Han decided to leave. He and the Empress would still have to be suppressed by the heaven and earth here. Not only would it affect their battle prowess, it would also affect their rate of cultivation.

The Empress naturally had no objections. Bewitching Maiden Rou also decided to go with them. Thus, the three of them proceeded to inform the Celestial Administration, and then went to the second spatial level.

When a higher-tier Heavenly Venerate went to a lower spatial level, they would be targeted by the heaven and earth there, but they would not if it was the other way round. Thus, the second spatial level actually did not just contain First Tier Heavenly Venerates. There were also Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, though their numbers were smaller.

There were some Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings that were just training here, and they could be considered to be extremely bold and fearless in the face of death. There were some that were the followers of Heavenly Venerates. Wherever their master went, they naturally would follow. Who knew, they, too, might be able to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

After some consideration, Ling Feifan also took his wife with him into the second level. Both his old man and his old man’s old man were there, so it was safe and reliable.

Ling Han and company went to report to the Celestial Administration here first, and they were each given simple and crude accommodations.

When they found out that Ling Han had come here, Ji Wuming, Huo Furong, and the others all came to visit him.

“You rascal, you had been pretending to be a cripple previously. I had not expected that you would accomplish a battle merit that had never been seen before in the next instant!” Everyone was smilingly saying that Ling Han was a great actor, making them feel rueful for a considerable amount of time. Unexpectedly, it was all just an act.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and apologized repeatedly.

And when the great hero of the first spatial level came here, it also caused a great commotion on the second level. The majority expressed their admiration for Ling Han, but it also caused some people to feel jealous.

Originally, they had been the most outstanding characters of this second level, yet now their limelight had been snatched by a “rookie,” so how could they reconcile themselves to this fact?

In a low-level dimension, anyone who could become a Heavenly Venerate had experienced being tempered for several epochs, and had a stable mental state, but this was the Flaming Frost Realm. Everyone’s speed of cultivation here was much faster, especially so for those super geniuses.

For example, both Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian had become Heavenly Venerates in only several hundred million years, so would their mental states be very steady?

Perhaps, there were some that could maintain their composure, but even more had succeeded at a young age, and had the common failing that all young people had: arrogance.

Thus, it was very ordinary that there would be people who would become jealous of Ling Han.

Ling Han could not be bothered by these things. All he wanted now was to increase his cultivation level.

He could cultivate well here. He manifested the Heavenly Venerable Seal in his mind, and extracted the power of heaven and earth to continuously temper himself.
