3087 One Body

Extermination’s chest rose and fell rapidly.

She was enraged, extremely enraged.

Since Ling Han killed her “people[1],” she would…

“Die!” She charged towards Lin Luo and the others.

Ling Han humphed, and his figure moved swiftly, blocking Extermination’s path.

“Your opponent is me!” he said calmly. Peng, with a punch, Extermination was sent flying.

“What?!” Extermination’s beautiful face paled. In this strike, she discovered that her strength was much inferior to Ling Han’s.

“Damned transvestite, don’t disgust me!” Ling Han could feel his goosebumps rising. Thinking back to Extermination’s flirtatious expression previously, all that remained was incomparable disgust.

Deep down, Extermination was a man, and she was Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand.

Extermination let out a piercing scream. In her opinion, what difference was there in being a man or a woman? Having reached the height of the Seventh Tier, was there still a need to care about gender?

However, after being insulted by Ling Han like this, she really couldn’t tolerate it.

Nonetheless, she did not engage in a fierce battle with Ling Han. Instead, she turned around and chased in the direction of where Hysteria had disappeared.

Only by killing Hysteria and plundering its power would she be able to compete with Ling Han.

…Of course, she was being delusional, but this was also the only solution that she could think of now.

Xiu, she exerted a terrifying force, and her delicate body moved at an indescribable speed.

She gave chase while searching for Hysteria’s life force fluctuations.

There was only emptiness here, and there were no more energy storms, so the aura of life couldn’t be concealed; even a little bit of it would have been distinctively evident.

As Extermination tracked Hysteria down, her figure moved faster and faster.

In just half a day, Hysteria’s figure appeared ahead of her. With two severed tentacles, it looked rather miserable.

Right now, Hysteria had already descended from its strongest level, but it was still unbelievably strong. It could still suppress Lin Luo and all the other Heavenly Venerates by itself.

“Die!” Extermination charged over. Her five fingers were like claws as she grabbed Hysteria.

Hysteria roared and attacked with its tentacles.

Peng!

Hysteria was naturally at a huge disadvantage in this exchange. Compared to Extermination, it was far inferior, and another one of its tentacles got blasted off again.

“Don’t kill it.This one is also mine.” Ling Han’s voice rang out. He was calm and unruffled, just like a person who was protecting his food, warning others not to snatch his food.

Extermination gritted her teeth. She attacked crazily. If she didn’t kill Hysteria and use all its power, she wouldn’t be able to suppress Ling Han. If she couldn’t suppress Ling Han, she wouldn’t be able to leave this space, and could only go crazy in this kind of emptiness and cold desolation.

Ling Han also made his move. How could he allow Extermination to kill Hysteria?

If it was to be killed, he would be the only one to do it.

He easily blocked Extermination with one hand as he fixed his gaze upon Hysteria.

Hysteria’s remaining five tentacles fluttered gently. Facing Ling Han, it felt an unprecedented chill.

Xiu, it moved and pounced forward.

However, its target was actually not Ling Han, but… Extermination.

Was it courting death?

Even Ling Han had not expected that Hysteria would charge over, dashing towards Extermination.

“Not bad, not bad. Since you’re going to die anyway, why don’t you give me your power? At the very least, I’m still a manifestation of your previous life!” Extermination laughed loudly as she extended her slender hand. Pu, it directly pierced through Hysteria’s head.

Boom! Hysteria’s five tentacles surged wildly, and its golden body rapidly dimmed.

Its energy was rapidly depleting while continuously being plundered by Extermination.

Ling Han originally wanted to stop her, but after thinking about it again, he decided to let it go.

In fact, he had absorbed almost 90% of the Void’s power by himself, while the remaining power had been divided between Hysteria and Extermination, with Extermination having taken up 90% of the remaining power.

Therefore, it didn’t matter whether the power of Hysteria was being absorbed by Extermination or not.

‘Let her rejoice in vain.’

Ling Han watched from the side. Very soon, Extermination would know that what she was facing was an insurmountable mountain.

Hysteria’s golden body quickly turned silver, then white, and finally black, as if it was degenerating.

This process was really fast. Extermination shook lightly, and Hysteria then turned to ashes and completely disappeared.

The great calamity that had once harmed the two generations of Genesis World was gone just like that?

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Lin Luo and the others also rushed over, and happened to see this last scene. They couldn’t help but feel slightly emotional.

“Ling… Han!” Extermination shouted loudly. After absorbing the power of Hysteria, her power had increased by more than 10%, and she was filled with confidence, believing that it was enough to suppress Ling Han.

At their heights, even a minute increase in power would have been staggering, not to mention increasing their power by 10%. It could even change the outcome of the battle.

“I’m not deaf, so there’s no need to shout so loudly,” Ling Han said calmly. He even dug his ears, appearing very nonchalant.

“I want you—” Extermination said, but before she could say the words “to die,” she was stunned. Then, she suddenly hugged her head. “Hysteria, you’re really haunting me. I’ve clearly destroyed your physical body, but you’ve entered my mind with your spirit!”

Ling Han’s expression darkened slightly. This “I want you” wasn’t expressed clearly, and was quite ambiguous. Moreover, the person who said this was a damn transvestite. Just thinking about it made one feel disgusted.

“You want to fight with me for control of this body? How naive!” Extermination roared. “Get out! Get out!”

But then, Extermination said, “This body was originally mine. Even though you refined it, it is still more compatible with my soul. I am the master of this body!”

“Get lost. I’ve plotted for so many years before this happened, and you want to reap the fruits of my labor?”

“Winner takes all. Why are you spouting so much nonsense?”

Extermination seemed to be talking to herself, but Ling Han, Lin Luo, and the others all knew that this was actually two souls, Extermination and Hysteria, fighting for control of this body.

This might seem a little confusing. Since Hysteria’s physical body had already been destroyed and returned to its original form, it was better to call “her” Extermination, but Extermination was actually Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand.

The two souls were fighting, and a strange scene appeared. Another head actually grew out of Extermination’s neck.

“You!” the original head shouted sharply. Of course, it represented Yellow Sand.

“Haha, this is my body. Even after being tempered by you for so many years, I can still obtain half of the command,” the new head said. This was naturally Hysteria, the earliest Extermination.

“Get out of here!”

“You’re the one who should get lost!”

The two heads shouted at each other, each commanding one hand to fight.

This…!

Ling Han felt speechless. Was this still the number one ferocious beast of the world?

Why did he look like a freak and a retard?

‘Forget it, I won’t be watching such a show anymore. How disgusting.’ L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Since the two fiends had already merged into one, he would deal with them together.

Ling Han threw a punch at Extermination.

“Ha!” Extermination’s two heads roared furiously at the same time as each one commanded the one hand on either side to meet Ling Han’s attack.
