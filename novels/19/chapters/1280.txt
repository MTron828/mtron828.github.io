1281 Little Beast and Little Bird

Ling Han’s eyes swept over it, and a sliver of killing intent immediately seeped into his gaze.

This was a creature of the Netherworld!

Yet he did not make a move. This little beast had just crossed over into the Immortal level, and its power was extremely weak. Furthermore, it did not seem to have awakened its intelligence. Otherwise, it was absolutely impossible that it would still approach upon spotting two obviously human elites of the Sun Moon Tier.

This small beast looked like a cat, covered all over with snow white fur, soft, bright, and shining with a silvery light. That appearance belonged to the category that one would immediately like it upon a single look. No wonder the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise even with her cool, aloof personality.

“Jiu! Jiu!” The little beast called out towards the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, its drool dripping even more quickly.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden looked towards Ling Han, and said, “Give it a share as well.”

“Did you not see that it is a creature of the Netherworld?” Ling Han asked.

“Still, it is so cute!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden could not resist at all.

The little beast released a soft cry; so adorable.

Ling Han sighed, and could only draw out a bowl to ladle out a share for this little beast. Then, he placed it over, and said, “Little guy, finish this and run off quickly. A glutton like you should obediently stay in the Netherworld. If you came to the Immortal Realm, wouldn’t you just be filling someone’s stomach?”

Little Beast immediately began to flick out its tongue to drink the soup. Perhaps it was too delicious, but its head poked in further and further. In the end, it lost its balance, and both its hind legs were sticking upwards.

Ling Han was surprised. Even eating, and it still had to act cute; the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden would probably be rendered completely incapable of resisting. He turned his head, and true enough, the sympathy in the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s eyes was practically overflowing.

The little beast drank very quickly. Being capable of cultivating to the Mountain River Tier, how could it have no intelligence? Immediately, it chirped out at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden as if it knew that only begging her would be useful.

Indeed, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden turned her eyes towards Ling Han, filled with plea.

Ling Han sighed, and could only ladle out another bowl.

One bowl followed another. This little beast’s appetite was quite amazing.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be moved. It should be known that he used proper ingredients in consideration of the cultivation levels of both himself and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. If it was given to a Mountain River Tier, they could still eat, but they definitely wouldn’t be able to eat too much.

Eating so vigorously like the little beast, they would definitely explode from all the richness. But the fact was that this little beast was still very energetic, playing cute and acting coy. There was absolutely no sign that it was about to explode any time soon.

Strange!

After this little beast had single-handedly finished off half the meat stew, it was finally satisfied. It ran to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and happily wagged its tail, playing cute right to the very end.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was feeling extremely compassionate, and picked up the little beast, combing through its fur. She even gave it a massage, infuriating Ling Han. He had never seen this fierce woman treat him so gently before.

Little Beast seemed to sense Ling Han’s unfriendly gaze, and curled in its claws, ducking into Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s arms.

“Don’t scare it!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden warned Ling Han.

‘I give it food, I give it drink, and now it’s even snatching away my wife?’

Ling Han glared at the little beast, but the little beast showed no weakness at all. It glared back at Ling Han while using its small head to rub against the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden all the while. Obviously, it knew whose favor it should gain.

“Little monster from the Netherworld will be eaten sooner or later!” Ling Han threatened fiercely.

“Jiu, jiu!” The little beast acted spoiled while looking like it had got a terrible scare.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden once again warned Ling Han seriously, causing him to feel very rueful. He had to quickly increase his cultivation level, or even his wife would be climbing over his head.

Ka, just at this moment, a soft cracking sound was heard. Ling Han involuntarily turned his eyes towards that egg that he had kept for who knew how long. Now, as long as he was free, he would take it out for some sunbathing, and that sound had originated from the eggshell.

There was a crack!

Ka, another sound rang out, and the first crack appeared. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ling Han was greatly pleased. Was this guy finally about to hatch?

This was the descendant of the Azure Flame Vulture, and in truth was not of much help to Ling Han by now. However, he had nurtured it by his side for so many days, so he was still very expectant to see a new life break out of its egg.

Knock, knock, knock. The Azure Flame Vulture inside pecked continuously, and the egg shell broke gradually. Finally, the head of a small bird stretched out. This time, it did not continue to peck, but rather opened its beak and began to eat the egg shell. Soon, it chewed out a large round hole.

This egg shell seemed to be extremely delicious because while the little bird had already eaten out a hole big enough for it to come out, it did not look like it had the slightest intention to stop at all. It was still there eating continuously, causing Ling Han to feel a slight urge to break off a piece to have a taste as well.

As a glutton, he felt a heavy pressure.

Ling Han, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and the little beast were all staring. Only when the little bird had completely chewed up the egg shell so that not one bit was left did it earnestly stand up on its small legs and look at the surroundings blankly.

At first, it tilted its head to look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden for a while, and then stared at the little beast. Finally, it turned its eyes towards Ling Han, raced towards him on its two little legs, leaned against his leg, and crouched down to rest.

Did it think that he was its mommy?

Hey, hey, hey. Putting aside the fact that he was male, what part of him looked like a bird? F***, what was wrong with its eyes?

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was thrown over in laughter. This would be the best material to tease Ling Han about in future, and she could talk about it for the rest of her life.

Ling Han shook his head, and sent the little bird into the Black Tower. He keenly sensed that this Azure Flame Vulture would far surpass its mother in the future. It was said that the Azure Flame Vulture had a sliver of the bloodline from the Ancient Divine Beast, Azure Phoenix. If it could awaken its bloodline, this little bird would be very useful.

“Yi, Lady Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden!” An exclamation of surprise was heard, and a few people walked over. They were all looking at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, a burning admiration on their faces.

They were disciples of the Five Sects.

In the Five Sects, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was definitely a legendary character. She had only been in the Immortal Realm for 10,000 years, and had already reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier already. She was the idol of who knew how many people. However, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had long since began to live in seclusion, and only left behind a stunning legend.

Thus, these people were naturally excited at being able to see the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden in this place.

But when they spotted the other person next to their idol, all their expressions shifted drastically. “Ling... Ling Han!”

He was a monster!

In a short few months, there was already a considerable number of elites from their sects that had died in Ling Han’s hands, and this man was also a criminal that had opened the sky—according to the Five Sects’ theory, the Lower Realm was a small world that they had operated for a few million years, producing very astonishing wealth, yet because of Ling Han, all that was now gone forever.

Thus, whether they knew the truth or otherwise, all disciples of the Five Sects hated Ling Han very much.

“Lady Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, this person is Ling Han. He is very dangerous, leave him quickly!” someone called out to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, fearing that she still did not know Ling Han’s true face, and would be wounded if Ling Han went berserk.

Yet the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden calmly said, “I have long since severed my ties with the Cloud Phoenix Sect, and all the matters of the Five Sects are no longer any concern of mine.”

She had long since repaid the kindness that the Cloud Phoenix Sect had shown teaching her, and when the sect had “sold” her off to Xie Donglai, that little bit of remaining kinship she had with the Cloud Phoenix Sect had vanished.

Those disciples of the Five Sects were stunned and furious. What exactly had Ling Han drugged the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden with that she now did not even recognize her own sect!?
