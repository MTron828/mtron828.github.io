Chapter 2343 Ling Han versus Huai Jian

The final battle was about to begin: Ling Han versus Huai Jian.

The seats were filled with spectators. Not only had many great sects and powerful clans come, even supreme monarch stars like Xue Ge and Jing Zhongyue were all present. They naturally hoped that the one who had defeated them could win. That way, they would know that they were just a slight sliver away from becoming the champion.

This kind of mentality was actually very common: it was fine if I lost to you, but you couldn’t lose to anyone else. That would make me seem too incapable.

The Ancestral King of the Four Splendor Academy had also come personally instead of just sending a thought which manifested into human form like before.

He spoke a few words, encouraging everyone to work hard on their cultivation so that they could possibly become supreme monarch stars like Ling Han and Huai Jian. Though everyone knew that this was an impossible feat, they still applauded strongly. They had to give some face to an Ancestral King, after all.

Finally, the prize for the victor was also taken out: an egg about the size of a human head. It was placed on a bed of crimson satin. The whole egg was golden and covered with multiple veined patterns of purple. Upon closer look, these veined patterns were slightly moving, as if it was breathing.

The egg of the Primordial Battle Beast!

Practically everyone turned their eyes to it. That was an existence that was fated to become an Ancestral King. If they could obtain it, they would have a beast pet that was at the Ancestral King Tier by their side. Merely the level of flashiness was already off the charts, what more the awesomeness of having an Ancestral King as their follower?

Too bad, it was going to belong to either Huai Jian or Ling Han.

“It must be Huai Jian’s, no questions asked.”

“That’s right. An Ancestral King obtained it, but was still unable to have it recognize him as its master through blood. Instead, he set it out as a prize. It has all been decided behind closed doors that it would definitely be awarded to Huai Jian.”

“Unless Ba also has a Heavenly Venerate backing him up.”

“If he knows what’s good for him, he will choose to surrender readily.”

Everyone was discussing spiritedly, filled with envy.

To say nothing of them, even Jing Zhongyue, Xue Ge, and the others bore heated eyes. This kind of Ancestral – King-Tier precious treasure was something even they were incredibly tempted by.

“Begin,” that Ancestral King said.

Huai Jian clasped his hands behind his back, his expression gentle as he said, “I have seen you fight before. You are indeed very strong, but there is still a certain distance between you and me. This is not because your natural talent is inferior, but rather that you have advanced into Eleventh Leaf too late, and have not reached a level of perfection in the way you use your own power.”

He paused. “Just forfeit.”

When everyone heard this, they all bore impressed expressions of admiration.

Huai Jian had always been cordial to others, but he was filled with inner pride. It was clear from just these words. He was filled with confidence, and was sure of his own victory. There was absolutely no way that Ling Han could be a match for him, but it was not that he was completely self-centered, either. He pointed out why Ling Han was not a match for him, exhibiting fully his dominance as the top Monarch Star.

Ling Han chuckled, and replied, “I have always been best at finding my own weaknesses in battle to improve myself. It is rare that I would have such a good opportunity, so please offer your guidance, Brother Huai Jian.”

Huai Jian was still all smiles, but his expression now carried a sliver of coldness. He had the ambition of conquering the world, and wished to create an empire that had never been seen before by turning around and attacking the Xuan Ni Realm after he became a Heavenly Venerate. He wanted to build his own force, and those like Ling Han and Jing Zhongyue were all targets that he wished to recruit.

Ling Han was his first target. Huai Jian was going to use his own domineering demeanor to make the former submit to his authority.

And now, Ling Han’s reaction displeased him greatly

That was fine. He could beat Ling Han’s pride into submission.

“All right then, let’s have a spar,” Huai Jian said smilingly. The wings behind him flapped, and his whole body emanated a golden brilliance that was extremely dazzling. It was as if he had turned into a god of war in golden armor, and others could not help but want to kneel down at his feet in worship.

This was Regulations of Light, which had the effect of entrancing the hearts and drumming up morale. If this kind of secret technique was used on one’s own troops in battle, everyone would be energized, and kill their enemies with no concern for themselves. Here, Huai Jian naturally could not possibly be drumming up Ling Han’s fighting spirit. Instead, he was just showing how strong he

was.

Where the light radiated, visibility and divine sense would all be restrained, and in fact one would even become blind.

Ling Han similarly channeled the Regulation of Darkness, but he was not a true member of the Demon Race, so he did not have any special natural talent in the manipulation of Regulation of Darkness. Thus, he merely spread out the darkness in a small zone, forcing the light out in a range of about 30 meters.

In comparison, Huai Jian had control of an entire 5 km. It was like Ling Han was a helpless child that was in the shadow cast by a giant.

“Divine Sword of Light!” Huai Jian exclaimed lightly. Xiu, xiu, xiu, millions of divine swords shot out all at once, shooting from various angles, and blasting towards Ling Han together.

It was clear that he had sensed that Ling Han’s physique was extraordinarily tough, and as they were not allowed weapons in this kind of battle, he gave up the idea of a battle at close quarters. Instead, he launched a long-range attack.

Ling Han shot out a punch. Peng, peng, peng, the Regulation of Slaughter unfolded, surging out of the zone of darkness. A boundless killing intent struck, instantly shattering the attack of light into smithereens.

If anyone was even touched, they would definitely be driven into madness. This killing intent was too terrifying.

The Divine Sword of light immediately shattered completely, and the zone of light also shrunk, decreasing from a diameter of 5 km to 4.5 km, but it still had the absolute upper hand.

“Regulation of Slaughter?” Huai Jian was surprised.

Members of Angel Race like him or the Demon Race were all born with fortune because they had an affinity with the Regulation of Darkness or Light by nature, so when they cultivated, it would be twice the result with half the effort. Thus, it was basically that the Regulation that every member of the Angel Race or Demon Race was the most skilled in was definitely the Regulation of either Darkness or Light. Yet Ling Han’s accomplishment in the Regulation of Darkness was actually inferior to his accomplishment in the Regulation of Slaughter!

This guy was really too willful, wasn’t he?

It was not that you couldn’t cultivate other Regulations, but no matter what, you had to push the level of Regulation of Darkness to the limits of your present cultivation level first before you proceeded to study other Regulations, right?

Wasn’t this just putting the cart before the horse?

“The results of unbridled greed!” Huai Jian rebuked, and flicked out a finger. Instantly, light condensed, turning into a massive spear that was as long as 300 meters. The body of the spear was covered with seals of Light.

“Go!” he exclaimed lightly. The divine spear of light shot out, blasting towards Ling Han.

In the zone of light, its speed was high to an extreme extent. In a flash, it had already drawn close to the zone enshrouded by the Regulation of Darkness, and only then did it slow down, but because this zone was really too small, the divine spear pierced through this barrier in an instant, and arrived inside the zone of Darkness before further slowing down.

The whole process took no more than a millionth of a microsecond, and the tip of the spear had already drawn close to Ling Han’s face. In fact, it was even visible that even the skin on Ling Han’s face was rippling because of the murderous aura borne by the spear’s tip.

It was at this moment that Ling Han moved, even faster than lightning.

Pa, he immediately got hold of the spear’s tip.

Huai Jian was unworried, and exclaimed lightly, “Explode!”

The whole divine spear of light immediately exploded. Boom, the seals turned into an ocean, bearing incredibly terrifying destructive power.

Everyone shook their head. The gap between Ling Han and Huai Jian was really too vast. In just two to three moves, the former was already out of the running.

However, a strange scene appeared. An explosion actually occured in the zone of light as well, and its scope was becoming larger and larger. Finally, the explosion in the zone of darkness had completely vanished, and Ling Han was seen standing proudly, completely unscathed.

“Regulations of Space!” Huai Jian’s brow creased into a frown.
