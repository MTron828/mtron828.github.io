Chapter 1752: Learning how to refine a Celestial pill

Xiang Yan was about to go crazy, while Fu Gaoyun felt gloomy. He recalled how he had repeatedly begged Xiang Yan to take him as a disciple before, and the latter completely ignored him. Yet now, it was Ling Han who was doing the ignoring, and Xiang Yan was still unwilling to give up.

This comparison really made him almost want to cry.

“I don’t care. With how proficiently you have grasped the Regulations of Fire, it would be too much of a waste for you not to be an alchemist!” Xiang Yan shook his head. No matter what, he could not let go of such a prodigious alchemy genius.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “How about this? In any case, I will go to the Fu Clan. In the future, outside of cultivation, I will ask Senior for guidance as well.”

Th-th-this, he had gained the favor of an alchemist, and he was actually bargaining like this as if he was very reluctant?

If one posed too much, he would definitely be struck by lightning.

However, Fu Gaoyun and Fu Xiaoyun were very pleased because it was clear that Xiang Yan had a very high opinion of Ling Han. In that case, as long as Ling Han could stay in the Fu Clan, the possibility of Xiang Yan leaving would be extremely low.

Xiang Yan said a few more words of persuasion, but could only agree reluctantly.

He looked at Bei Xuanming, and the fury in his heart instantly had a target for venting. He grabbed Bei Xuanming with a single move, and threw a series of punches at him.

Who asked this brat’s words to be so unpleasant?

Bei Xuanming was incredibly depressed, yet could only endure the beating.

Putting aside the fact that his strength was far inferior to Xiang Yan’s, even if his strength matched the latter’s, or even surpassed it, he would not dare resist, either.

This was a three-star alchemist!

He was almost throwing up blood in his fury. He had really hit rock bottom in his luck today. FIrst, he had sustained a beating at Ling Han’s hands, which was then followed by a three-star alchemist. Furthermore, if this matter was made known to the sect master of the Lunar Sect, he would probably give him another thrashing.

...You actually dared to offend a three-star alchemist? Just how much trouble were you trying to draw to our Lunar Sect?

After Xiang Yan had vented his anger, he strode off. Then, he reminded Ling Han repeatedly that he was to visit him once he had the time.

“Brother Ling, I’m convinced!” Fu Gaoyun gave Ling Han a thumbs up. Ling Han was probably the only Severing Mundane Tier that dared to put on airs in front of a three-star alchemist.

Meanwhile, Bei Xuanming humphed. Then, he turned around and left. He really had no face to show himself.

“Great!” Fu Gaoyun couldn’t help but clap as he looked at Bei Xuanming’s receding back. “I disliked this guy from the first moment I saw him. Brother Ling, it would be better for you to become my brother-in-law instead.”

Ahead of them, Bei Xuanming suddenly stumbled. Then, he shot forwards quickly, and disappeared in an instant.

“Brother!” Fu Xiaoyun blushed slightly.

Yet Fu Gaoyun was uncaring, and continued, “Just look at my brother. Not only is he an outstanding talent, his natural talent in cultivation is astonishing, and he has further gained the favor of Elder Xiang. Where are you going to find such an outstanding man?”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Too bad, too bad. Such an outstanding man is already taken.” He wrapped his arms around the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, showing that he was already satisfied with what he had.

“Che, isn’t it very normal for men to have many wives[1]?” Fu Gaoyun was still unwilling to give up.

Ling Han’s expression became a little strange. If he counted Hu Niu and the others, he seemed to have eight lovers already. The positions of three wives and four concubines was not even enough.

“Come, let’s go and have a drink.” He changed the topic.

“Let’s drink, let’s drink.” True enough, Fu Gaoyun forgot about this matter once he spoke of drinking. He still had an arduous task ahead of him, and that was to improve Ling Han’s taste in music, or his music sense, in short.

...At present, there was nothing that he could pick about in Ling Han’s personality, but his music sense was really too horrible.

With the two men heading off to drink, Fu Xiaoyun accompanied the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Women naturally would be chatting about topics that interested women.

Ling Han and Fu Gaoyun only ended their drinking spree by the next day’s morning. Then, Fu Gaoyun discovered to his grief that that song of Descending Lotus Flower was deeply implanted in his head. The moment he touched the strings of the qin, he would automatically play it.

Oh no. Ling Han’s music sense had not been improved, and it was his music sense that had deteriorated instead.

This time, the Fu Clan had still recruited a considerable number of prodigies, and they were all young king tiers that had attained a flawless severance—previously, the so-called small test did not actually have any decisive significance. It was only set up so that these king tiers would not become too arrogant, and to take them a notch down.

This indeed was very effective. These king tiers had all curbed some of their pride, and knew that prodigies like them were still not qualified to put on airs in front of the Fu Clan yet.

Ling Han asked Fu Gaoyun for help in buying a great volume of Level 20 Godly metal. He wanted to send the Divine Demon Sword up to the level of Divine Metal—even if it did not manage to reach the level of Divine Metal, it could still probably attain the level of One-Star or Two-Star Divine Metal.

There was definitely no lack of Level 20 Godly metal in the Celestial Realm.

However, this required a great amount of Star Stones. Though Ling Han had earned much, and also robbed a considerable amount, this number was still a drop in the ocean compared to what was needed to advance the Divine Demon Sword to become a Celestial Tool.

Thus, he soon went off to find Xiang Yan, and asked him for some guidance on how to refine a Celestial pill. In future, he would be able to earn money on his own.

Xiang Yan had high hopes of him, and only feared that he would not come. As long as Ling Han asked a question, he would reply without holding anything back.

Once Ling Han returned, he comprehended Dao beneath the Reincarnation Tree. However, even so, he had only begun to refine the most basic Celestial pill a month later, and the result was that the cauldron exploded—as expected.

But Xiang Yan got a great shock.

“You are practically inhuman, brat!” the old geezer exclaimed in shock. “Though I have already had a high estimation of you, I previously thought that it would already be very impressive if you could begin refining pills 10,000 years later, yet you actually only used a month’s time!”

One had to interweave the Regulations of the Great Dao to fully understand the pharmacology of Celestial pils, and this was an incredibly complicated matter. Even 10,000 years could not be considered a long time.

But Ling Han had the Reincarnation Tree. One day was equivalent to 100 years, and a month would mean 3,000 years. In truth, he had also spent a very long time. It was only that Xiang Yan had completely no idea.

“Looking at your rate of advancement, you would be able to refine the first cauldron of Celestial pills in 10 years’ time at most.” Xiang Yan was very envious of Ling Han. Even he could only admit his defeat in front of such a prodigious alchemy genius like Ling Han.

He would only be able to refine the first cauldron of Celestial pills after 10 years?

Ling Han shook his head with a sigh; it was really difficult!

But such a speed was already overwhelmingly fast. Most alchemists that could successfully refine a Celestial level pill in a million years’ time counting from the time they first got in contact with it to successful refinement would belong to the category of genius, and even if it took 100,000,000 years, don’t think it was too long, either.

Who asked for lifespan to be unlimited after the Severing Mundane Tier? They had more than enough time to expend, but what was crucial was if there would be so much Celestial medicine to allow your squandering.

There was no helping it; they could only progress slowly.

Ling Han even asked Fu Gaoyun to investigate the matter of the Roc Palace, while he, the Empress, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden left. Since they had already advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, he was going to return to Dark Moon City, and call the Ding Clan in for a good accounting of old debts.

At present, there were only three people that he was no match for, and they were Ding Yaolong, Ding Shan, and Ding Song, but what other member of the Ding Clan was capable of standing against him?

Though Zhang Chong had advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, he had not gained the favor of the Fu Clan. Thus, he was going to return to Dark Moon City with Mao Dai and his daughter. Hence, Ling Han went along with them. They used a massive ship, and after a good few months of traveling, they returned to Dark Moon City.

In these few months, Ling Han had spent every single day comprehending Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree. Not only had he completely stabilized his cultivation level, he had even forged forwards into the middle stage of the first severance—Celestial level meant cultivation of Regulations, and power was only secondary.

Of course, if the level of Regulations was too high, and power was too weak, the balance would be lost. But the standards of measuring cultivation level would no longer take power into consideration, only Regulations. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Empress had also refined a considerable number of portions of Heavenly Tribulation Fluid, and had grasped two kinds of Lightning Element secret techniques. Now, she was going to improve this kind of secret technique up to Celestial level, and further increase her own battle prowess.

Ling Han leaped down from the ship. On this return to Dark Moon City, he was filled with confidence because he was already a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder.

‘Ding Clan, it’s time for you to pay a little interest.’
