Chapter 1374 Who“s This Retard?

This was far too astonishing. A quasi-level nine alchemist who was under 500 years old!

Although Lin Shuying was only 200 years old, there was no way that she could become a level nine alchemist if she didn’t break through to the Heavenly Body Tier, and if she couldn’t become a level nine alchemist within 300 years, there was no way that she could compare to Ling Han.

Of course, this comparison was because they still didn’t know Ling Han’s true age. If they knew that he wasn’t even 50 yet, they would definitely go completely numb with shock.

“First place goes to... Ling Han!” Lin Xin announced.

There was no doubt about this result, nor was there any objection. Who dared to claim that they had refined an alchemical pill more difficult than the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill?

However, because Lin Shuying had won first place in the first three rounds, she still managed to claim first place overall, even though she had come second in this last round, and even though this last round weighted far more than the first three rounds. Ling Han could only settle for second.

However, no one believed that Ling Han was genuinely less capable than Lin Shuying. He had only come second because he was still too young. Moreover, he hadn’t obtained the memory of some ancient alchemy grandmaster and whatnot. Otherwise, judging by his impressive performance throughout the first three rounds, his results could have definitely been even better.

Although Lin Yuqi felt that it was a shame that Ling Han couldn’t claim the first place, she was still very satisfied with his results.

This was already enough!

Ling Han had claimed the second place! This was enough to secure the Anyuan Branch a whopping 99 spots to enter the Medicine King’s Cave!

After returning to their courtyard, Lin Yuqi couldn’t suppress her excitement any longer. She immediately leaped into Ling Han’s arms, and said, “Handsome little brother, we’ve accomplished our mission! How about a kiss?” She puckered her alluring red lips.

Upon seeing that Ling Han was unfazed, a thought suddenly occurred to her, and she suddenly slapped her own bottom.

Pa!

There was a crisp crack as her shapely bottom undulated in a mesmerizing and intoxicating manner.

Bewitching! She was far too bewitching!

“Aunty!” Han Xinyan exclaimed in complete and utter embarrassment. She hurriedly dragged Lin Yuqi away. In the beginning, Lin Yuqi had tried to set her up with Ling Han. Now, she was trying to make Ling Han become her uncle. What on earth was she playing at?

Ling Han knew that he couldn’t endure this for much longer. He was a normal man, and his willpower to resist beautiful women was only so strong.

He returned to his room and hurriedly entered the Black Tower. He then tangled passionately with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Only then did he rid Lin Yuqi’s mesmerizing and seductive figure from his mind.

In the future, everything would be solved with Empress Luan Xing by his side. She was the most charming and attractive woman, and a single glance at her would allow him to view all other beauties as ordinary women.

After three days, Lin Yuqi couldn’t help but press Ling Han to set off.

They couldn’t not leave! People came one after another, all trying to recruit Ling Han and persuading him to leave the Anyuan Branch. It was as if they could agree to any condition as long as Ling Han agreed to join their branch family.

For example, the Beisha Branch had even offered to betroth Lin Shuying to Ling Han. However, the condition was that Ling Han had to join the Beisha Branch first.

Although Lin Yuqi believed in Ling Han’s self-control, she was still worried that his willpower would weaken with time. After all, perhaps one or two beauties couldn’t compete against her charm and seduction. However, what about 10? Or 100?

It was best to leave as soon as possible.

The three of them set off on their return journey. Lin Yuqi and Han Xinyan would return to the Anyuan Branch first. There was still half a year until the mystery realm opened, and this wasn’t a very long time. During this half a year, they would pick 99 suitable branch members to enter the mystery realm. Of course, one of these spots was already reserved for Ling Han.

Ling Han and the two women agreed on a place to meet. After arriving there, Ling Han entered the Black Tower and continued to immerse himself in the world of medicinal ingredients, improving his identification ability.

Time quietly crept by. It wasn’t long before half a year flashed by.

Ling Han finally exited the Black Tower in satisfaction. He had already memorized all 810,000 types of medicinal ingredients. Even if someone were to slice up and mix all of these medicinal ingredients together, he would still be able to separate and reconstruct them. Moreover, his speed would be insane.

If they were to hold the intra-clan competition again, he would definitely become the undisputed champion, winning first place in all of the events. Moreover, his victories would be resounding and crushing.

Three more days passed, and Lin Yuqi finally arrived.

This time, it wasn’t just her and Han Xinyan. Instead, she was leading a large cohort of people. Counting them carefully, there was a total of 99 people, including Ling Han.

In other words, these were the people who had been chosen to enter the Medicine King’s Cave.

Moreover, apart from Lin Yuqi, there was still another Heavenly Body Tier elite among this group. He looked to be under 30 years old, and his face was a picture of pride and haughtiness. It was as if he believed that he was number one in the world.

“You’re Ling Han?” that person asked in a condescending tone. There was a hint of disdain in his voice, and he said, “Don’t think that you’re a hero just because you won all these spots for the Anyuan Branch! A servant is a servant, after all. Don’t let your ego get to your head!”

‘Holy f*ck! It’s a retard!’

Before Ling Han could even reply, he was quickly dragged aside by Lin Yuqi. However, a look of displeasure instantly spread across that person’s face when he saw this.

“Who’s that dumb c*nt?” Ling Han asked.

“Just ignore him,” Lin Yuqi hurriedly replied. “He’s called Lin Zihong, and he’s the son and only child of our branch leader. Although he’s not very talented in alchemy, he’s a very talented cultivation prodigy. He’s already reached the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier after cultivating for just 600,000 or so years.”

Ling Han didn’t think much of this. Only at the medium extreme? He could suppress him with a single hand.

“I know you’re powerful!” Lin Yuqi said with a sweet smile. “However, don’t drag yourself to the same level as him. He’s merely jealous after hearing about your brilliant feats.”

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Are you sure that he’s merely jealous about my feats?” Lin Zihong was clearly interested in Lin Yuqi, yet this bewitching woman was now sticking closer to him than ever. Thus, it was inevitable that Lin Zihong would feel extremely jealous. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In reality, Ling Han was the victim of all this mess.

“In any case, just ignore him!” Lin Yuqi put on a delicate and fragile demeanor, and said, “Just listen to me, okay? Just pretend that I’m begging you, okay?”

Ling Han couldn’t endure this, and he immediately left with a flick of his sleeves. He entered the carriage and closed his eyes. Without seeing or hearing them, he wouldn’t feel annoyed.

Lin Yuqi smiled faintly. Although Ling Han always treated her with mock disgust, he still treated her as a friend. Otherwise, with his strength and personality, he would definitely beat Lin Zihong into a true retard.

This time, there wasn’t just one carriage. Instead, there was a line of carriages that carried the 99 people. These carriages slowly rocked their way to the ancestral grounds in Azure Rain City again.

Almost all of the 100 branch families had arrived again, with one of the branch families only sending one person to participate. This wasn’t because they couldn’t find more people, but rather because they had only won one spot to enter. Who told them to achieve the worst results?

Meanwhile, the Anyuan Branch which had been in the last place before had won the second place this time, thus allowing them to secure 99 spots. This naturally surprised many people.

Lin Zihong wore a haughty expression as if all of this was his doing. Like a peacock spreading his plumage, he was as ostentatious as could be.

However, regardless of how showy he was, few people were willing to interact with him. Instead, an endless stream of people went to visit Ling Han, even though he stayed in his own room most of the time. This caused Lin Zihong’s eyes to go red with jealousy.

“He’s nothing but a small alchemist! What does he have to be proud of?” Lin Zihong was extremely bitter, feeling vexed that Ling Han was stealing attention away from him.

“Seventh Uncle, just let that brat be arrogant for now. When we enter the Medicine King’s Cave in a few days’ time, we’ll find a chance to secretly dispose of him. What do you say?” a lackey suggested.

Lin Zihong’s eyes lit up, and he said, “That’s a good idea. I can make an excuse and separate us into two groups, saying that we’ll be able to come across more opportunities this way. I’ll put him into my group and then find an opportunity to dispose of him!”

“Exactly! Seventh Uncle, you’re an elite at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, while that person is only at the low extreme. Moreover, he’s only at the early stage of the low extreme. He’s nothing compared to you!” the lackey continued in an obsequious voice.

“You even dare to flirt with the woman that I like. You’re simply seeking death!” Lin Zihong spat in a sinister voice.
