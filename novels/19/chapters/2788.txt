2789 A chance

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then said smilingly, “Sure!”

It was indeed like what Shi Mengyu said. When a Heavenly Venerable Seal came into existence, anyone could be taught, but once they learned it, it could only be passed on, and could not be taught.

The others did not have any disagreement, either. They hadn’t seen the Heavenly Venerable Seal yet, after all, so there was naturally no need for them to rush to make a move.

Everyone entered into the crevice. Though the pressure had lessened considerably, there was still some pressure. Those who were weaker couldn’t pass through at all.

!!

The crevice was very thick. The further they advanced, the stronger the obstructive force became, but it was still within tolerable limits.

After only 30 minutes, they had come to the end of the crevice. A massive space appeared ahead of them, and there were corpses lying everywhere, so many that one would feel numb at the sight.

This was the true battlefield from all those years ago.

The bodies here numbered in hundreds of thousands; there was an astonishing number of them.

Everyone released their divine sense, and immediately proceeded to do a search, looking for the whereabouts of the Heavenly Venerable Seal.

This place was frighteningly quiet and also shockingly huge, and adding all the bodies lying all around, there was an indescribably repressed atmosphere in this place.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled slightly in a frown. Previously, Heavenly-Venerable-Tier monsters had charged out. Then, were they the only monsters that remained, or… only a portion of them, and more could appear at any time?

“Are you worried that there might be other surviving dregs of Hysteria’s troops?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han nodded. “It is possible that chaos will occur in the space here. If there really are any lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops, they will be having Third Tier’s battle prowess, so we can’t let our guard down.”

Though Ling Han, too, had battle prowess at the Third Tier, if he was ambushed in a moment of carelessness, perhaps he would really die.

The Rain Emperor and the others all nodded. Among the people here, only Ling Han’s battle prowess had reached the Third Tier. The others would not be able to put up any kind of resistance at all.

They walked on for a while, but aside from dead bodies, there were only more dead bodies here. There was no sign of the Heavenly Venerable Seal.

“Where is the Heavenly Venerable Seal?” someone asked, slightly agitated.

Boom!

Someone moved, blasting apart the pile of bodies, wanting to see if this kind of seal could be buried beneath them.

With someone taking the initiative, the others moved as well. Peng, peng, peng! Bodies flew everywhere in the air. The majority of them were Hysteria’s troops, but there were also some that were the people that had sacrificed themselves for Flaming Frost Realm all those years ago, and they, too, were sent flying mercilessly.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. It was one thing for Hysteria’s troops, but to treat even those who had sacrificed themselves for the Flaming Frost Realm like this, that was going a little too far.

Furthermore…

Ling Han called out loudly, “Stop. There may still be lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops here.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, no one listened to him. The Heavenly Venerable Seal was too important; everyone wanted to be the first to get hold of it.

Corpses were still flying everywhere, and Ling Han’s expression involuntarily darkened. He would not allow these people to disrespect the remains of past heroes.

Peng! Suddenly, a figure shot into the skies, exuding an aura of peerless dominance.

This was not a corpse, nor was it one of the people that had entered here. Instead, it was a wolfman that was around 30 meters tall. It had grown out arms and legs, but it still had the head of a wolf. However, there were over 100 tentacles growing out of its back, and the sight was terrifyingly creepy.

One of Hysteria’s creations! Ling Han immediately confirmed inwardly. Many arms, many legs, many eyes… The unique trait of Hysteria’s creations was that they always had a great number of a particular organ, and this wolf-man was in line with this unique trait.

However, within Hysteria’s troops, wolves would be wolves. They would not become wolf-men, but now this was a wolfman. Though his whole body was covered with fur, his eyes were still exuding the light of intelligence.

With the kind of existences that Heavenly Venerates were, after they had left the control of Hysteria, it was very easy for them to develop their own intelligence.

This wolfman had buried himself under the pile of bodies all this while, and it wasn’t right until someone had swept aside that pile of bodies that he finally shot out from beneath the corpses.

“Lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops?”

“Kill!”

Everyone discovered his presence, and all of them moved, planning to kill this wolfman.

“Wait!” This wolfman sent out a wave of divine sense. “I have already gained intelligence, and am no longer under Hysteria’s control. I am willing to fight alongside you against Hysteria.”

“Humph, how could the words of monsters be believed?” Shi Zhonghe sneered. He had already drawn a sword, which he slashed out madly at the wolfman.

From his very first move, he was going all out. Not only did he use a Heavenly Venerate Tool, he was also channeling a Heavenly Venerate Technique at the same time, and boosted himself with Heavenly Venerable Seals while unleashing his battle prowess to the extreme, wanting to kill this wolfman as quickly as possible

There was naturally no need to speak of any rules in a battle against one of Hysteria’s dregs. All of them, Shi Mengyu, Geng Xuandan, and elites from the third level, Wang Xiangrong and Baili Ge, charged, unleashing their full strength.

Though that wolfman was in the Third Tier, it could not be helped that power would be suppressed here, and he was at an absolute numerical disadvantage as well, so how could he hold up against the mad barrage of attacks from so many elites. Immediately, he was battered and exhausted.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Right at this moment, piles of corpses burst apart by themselves one after another, and elites successively streaked out from beneath them.

Tigermen, lionmen, birdmen, snakewomen… There were at least 100 of them, and they were all surviving dregs of Hysteria’s troops.

Hiss, there were so many of them?

Everyone was taken aback. There was only a limited number of them that had entered here, no more than 20-odd. Merely in terms of numbers, they were overwhelmed by the other side.

However, those like Geng Xuandan, Shi Zhonghe, and some others were still calm. They were all prodigies that could be considered invincible among those with equal cultivation level. They did not fear a disadvantage in numbers—at least the 100-plus Heavenly Venerates here would not be enough to suppress them.

Everyone stopped, and the wolfman sighed in relief, and repeated, “Every word I have said just now is true! Though we are Hysteria’s creations, we are only its tools for war at the same time, easily sacrificed at any moment.

“However, after we have developed intelligence, we no longer wish to work for Hysteria. Our only desire is freedom.

“Thus, do not force us to become your enemies!”

Geng Xuandan and the others exchanged looks, and they all shook their heads.

Outsiders necessarily had their ulterior motives. They definitely could not be trusted.

However, humans were presently at a disadvantage in terms of numbers, so it would be better for them to go along with the wolfman first. When the main troops came in here, they could then eliminate all these surviving dregs.

“Oh, then what do you guys want?” Shi Zhonghe asked.

“All we want is to live peacefully. In fact, some of us can even join you in the resistance against Hysteria, and we will change shifts once every 10,000 years or so,” the wolfman said. Originally, he had had 19 heads, but seven of his heads were now severed, and the injuries were still very fresh.

The person who had wounded him would definitely have been incomparably powerful to inflict such injuries that still hadn’t healed over several epochs.

...

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu! A few more figures descended, yet they were great elites from the fifth level, such as Shen Fei, Wu Feng, and… He Liqun!

As more and more elites had come, everyone naturally felt more and more confident. By now, they were no longer afraid of battle, because this kind of battle would definitely cause a tremendous commotion, and draw the people from the surface down here. By then, wouldn’t this mere 100 or so lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops be dealt with in an instant?

“Milords, what do you think?” Shi Zhonghe looked towards Shen Fei and the others.

Shen Fei immediately sneered. “Why would we want these beasts to join us? Could it be that so they can attack us from the inside while Hysteria is launching an assault on us? Kill them, kill all of them!”

When these words fell, the eyes of these 100-plus lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops all blazed with killing intent.

…Since you wanted to kill me, it was naturally impossible that I would just raise my head and wait for death. If it came to worst, they could just have a life-and-death struggle.

Ling Han thought for a while, then suddenly stepped out, and said, “Everyone, since these people have already developed self-awareness, why don’t we give them a chance?”
