3238 Shuttle Steps

If this was said by Feng Zisheng, Ling Han would be able to understand a little.

For example, if Feng Zisheng had betrayed the country or suffered a strife, his status would not be guaranteed. If he was reduced to the point of fleeing, he might indeed need to entrust his daughter into someone else’s care.

But if it was Butler Mu… what position did he have to make this request?

Ling Han looked at Butler Mu in surprise. ‘Although you’re the Feng Clan’s butler, aren’t you interfering a little too much?’

Butler Mu shook his head. “Do you think Young Miss will be happy if she marries a man she has never met for the sake of benefits?”

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “Then why won’t Butler Mu bring Miss Feng away?”

He was only in the Meridian Opening Tier, and even if he could barely match a Fifth Change Blood Transformation Tier, he was still far inferior to the Extreme Bone Tier.

No matter how he looked at it, Butler Mu was more suitable than him, right?

Butler Mu looked at him and said after a while, “I hope you can consider this matter carefully. Also, I hope you can help Young Miss when she needs help.”

“This is the Shuttle Steps technique.” He took out a thin book from his pocket. The paper quality was very new.

“Consider this as your pay.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “As long as it’s within my capabilities, I’ll help.”

“Alright.” Butler Mu nodded. He tossed the book to Ling Han, then strode away.

“Shuttle Steps,” Ling Han muttered. As he walked, he flipped through the book. Illustrations immediately entered his eyes, and mnemonic chants continuously appeared in his mind.

“Not bad. After using it, you can increase your speed by three times.”

“However, this consumes too much mystical power. In addition, it also has a huge requirement on one’s physique. Otherwise, as you run, both your legs might be crippled in the process.”

“Going by this, I owe him a big favor.”

A strange expression appeared on Ling Han’s face. Putting aside the question of whether Butler Mu’s point of view was correct or not, he was just a butler. Wasn’t it a little too much for him to be so concerned about Feng Ruoxian?

It was confirmed. This wasn’t the attitude of a butler at all. It was more like the attitude of a father.

Could it be that Feng Ruoxian was the illegitimate daughter of Butler Mu?

All of a sudden, countless thoughts of gossip arose in Ling Han’s mind.

“I don’t need to deliberately pay attention to her. If Feng Ruoxian really begs me, then I’ll help her as much as I can. However, as long as she’s in Huju City, what kind of trouble will she encounter?”

“Forget it. Let’s go back to camp.”

A night passed, and Ling Han first invited Sun Jianfang to the campsite. There was only one day left until the deadline the little old man had mentioned.

He did not know what would happen tomorrow, so he could only try his best to prepare.

Ling Han took the book about Shuttle Steps and carefully studied it. With his comprehension ability, it naturally came easily to him. In just half a day, he was already able to use this movement technique.

He sprinted with all his might and used Shuttle Steps. His speed instantly increased, but he did not accelerate to the maximum.

This was necessary.

This was because his speed was already close to the speed of sound. After running, the air resistance was extremely huge, causing him to suffer a huge burden. Now that he had increased his speed by a little more, the bones in his entire body were already creaking.

Could he break through the speed of sound?

Ling Han’s strength was comparable to Third Change Blood Transformation Tier, but his physique was definitely much weaker. After all, his level of being was one whole cultivation level lower than Blood Transformation Tier.

Breaking through the speed of sound was an ability that only Blood Transformation Tier elites possessed, and it was determined by their physique.

Ling Han circulated his mystical power within his body, and then his footsteps sped up. Peng, a huge sonic boom sounded behind him, and sand and stones were sent flying in all directions.

He had reached the speed of sound!

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. With the use of Shuttle Steps, his speed finally broke through the sound barrier.

It could be said that this speed alone could form an extremely destructive force. If he ran wildly on the streets, the sonic boom formed could make the people nearby deaf, shatter glass windows, and even cause houses to collapse.

Only half a minute later, Ling Han couldn’t take it anymore, and had no choice but to stop. He felt his entire body heating up, especially his legs, as if they were about to burn.

“My current limit is to sprint at the speed of sound for half a minute, at most forty seconds. Otherwise, my body might disintegrate,” Ling Han muttered to himself.

“Is there a way to temper my body?”

Ling Han went back to research, and very quickly discovered that there was indeed a way to improve his physique.

It was no other than to have his physique tempered by various forces from a young age to increase the strength of his muscles and bones. He also had to use medicine for direct ingestion or soak himself in a medicinal bath to stimulate the strength of his cells.

“This consumption is very high. It also requires consistent perseverance. It’s impossible to support this consumption of various resources without strong financial resources.”

“On the contrary, as long as mystical power is used to cover the body, it can have the same, or even better, defensive effect. Therefore, very few people are willing to spend this time and money to temper their bodies.”

Ling Han shook his head. He had started his career in the Genesis World with body refinement, and had directly obtained a body refinement precious technique that was Heavenly Venerable Tier-level, causing his physique to be incomparably tyrannical. Even if he encountered an opponent whose cultivation level was much higher than his, he would not be afraid, and his opponent would not be able to injure him at all.

“There’s no Body Refining Technique for sale here, so it’s unrealistic for me to hope to be able to buy one.”

“Could I use the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll?”

“Yes, the two worlds are completely different, but I’m still me. Nothing has changed.”

“The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll is useless to others, but I’m different because I came from the Genesis World.”

“I’m sure it won’t work if I use it exactly as it is, but I can make some modifications.”

Ling Han’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. He had stood at the peak of the world in the Genesis World. It wasn’t difficult to improve a Heavenly Venerable Tier-level technique, but the difficult part was how to merge it with this world.

“If the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll can be improved, how many other secret techniques can I take out into this world?”

“Let’s give it a try.”

Ling Han immediately returned to the campsite and began to think hard.

He was the type to be very patient sometimes, and sometimes, he was super impatient. He would do something immediately the moment he thought of it.

All the way from morning to midnight, Ling Han finally made some progress.

“It’s feasible! It’s really feasible!” He nodded. “However, this requires a huge change. If I change it like this, perhaps everyone in this world can cultivate it.”

“Enemy attack! Enemy attack!”

At this moment, a sharp voice sounded in the sky above the camp. Clang, clang, clang! The alarm sounded. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ling Han was quick-witted. Half a month’s time was up.

What kind of enemy could make it so unsafe to stay in the city?

Ling Han hurriedly scuttled out. At this time, most people had already come out, because Lian Xuerong had already made preparations. Not a single person slept at night, and everyone was fully armed, without the slightest bit of disheveled appearance.

“Enemy attack? How many people are there?” Lian Xuerong also appeared and asked very calmly.

On the watchtower high above, the soldier’s face was twitching. He lowered his head and said in a trembling voice, “Count… Countless!”
