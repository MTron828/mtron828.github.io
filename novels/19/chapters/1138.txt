Chapter 1139: Becoming a Seed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“How dare you!!” Gan Shiyun shouted in rage. “You’re merely a lowly follower, yet you actually dare to steal my God Tool? Are you trying to belittle the Majestic Heaven Sect?”

Gan Shiyun wasn’t wrong to say this. One of them was a disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect, while the other was only a follower of another seed. Not only that, but she was also a seed. Meanwhile, Ling Han couldn’t even be considered a disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect.

However, their cultivation levels were similar, yet she, a seed, couldn’t even defeat another seed’s follower. What face did she have to seek help from the sect?

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “I understand. I won, so I took something as my spoils of battle. If you want it back, fine. Defeat me first!”

Defeat Ling Han. It was that easy. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

These words had always only been spoken by the seed-level prodigies. Now, however, a mere follower was saying it in an extremely arrogant manner.

Hu Feiyun nodded, and said, “That’s right, that’s right! This is Ling— Han Lin’s spoils of battle!” She was only adding more fuel to the fire.

To say nothing of Gan Shiyun, even the other seeds wore looks of anger. They felt as if they—along with their dignity—were being walked over. They shot hostile glances at Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Are you people going to shamelessly gang up on me at the slightest of disagreements? Haha, come, I’ll take whatever comes my way. You can challenge me one-on-one, or you can all come at me as a group. It’s all up to you! However, don’t forget to submit to me if you lose!”

This infuriated the seeds even more.

The fact that they had become seeds signified that they were invincible against those at the same cultivation level—even if they had opponents, it would be their fellow seeds. However, they were being belittled by a mere follower now, so how could this not stoke their anger?

These people had been arrogant and prideful even before they had entered the Majestic Heaven Sect!

Hu Feiyun clapped her hands, and exclaimed, “Han Lin, you’re so amazing!”

This Ninth King had been completely spoiled and pampered, and she was even a little ditzy on top of that. As a result, she couldn’t read the mood at all.

However, none of the seeds stepped forward to challenge Ling Han, even though they were all incandescent with rage.

This was only natural. Gan Shiyun was definitely one of their stronger members, yet she had still been defeated, even after summoning her replica Goddess Furnace. Would the results change if they challenged Ling Han? No way! Perhaps there was only a tiny number of Mountain River Tier cultivators who could suppress this freak—those king tier prodigies who had formed five Mountains and Rivers!

If one couldn’t reach the true pinnacle of the Mountain River Tier, they could only be referred to as prodigy, super genius, or supreme prodigy. They were quite some way off becoming a king tier prodigy.

“Hehe.” There was a drawn-out laugh, and a skinny man suddenly appeared among the onlookers. His aura was obscure, yet sensing just a tiny bit of it was enough to elicit a feeling of apprehension from the depths of one’s soul.

He was a supreme elite!

The seeds hurriedly clasped their hands in greeting, and said, “My respects to Elder Hai Yun!”

Their expressions were especially respectful.

This was because Elder Hai Yun was a Heavenly Body Tier elite!

Although they were all seed-level prodigies—being a seed meant that 90% of them could advance to the Sun Moon Tier, and most of them to the peak stage—only less than one-tenth of them could eventually become Heavenly Body Tier elites.

This was already an optimistic estimate.

Thus, how could they not suppress their pride and arrogance before such a supreme elite?

Elder Hai Yun waved his hand. He turned his gaze to Ling Han, and the more he looked, the more surprised he became. Fortunately, his expression was hidden by the air of Primal Chaos that shrouded his face. Otherwise, the onlookers would definitely be stunned. A Heavenly Body Tier elite was actually this surprised?

“Young man, are you interested in joining our sect?” Elder Hai Yun smiled, and said, “I can guarantee that you’ll become a seed!”

Everyone was stunned by his words, yet at the same time, they all felt that it was reasonable.

Ling Han was able to defeat Gan Shiyun—a seed—with ease. Moreover, their cultivation levels were the same. This was enough to prove just how terrifying Ling Han’s abilities were. If a prodigy like him couldn’t enter the Majestic Heaven Sect and become a seed, what kind of awkward situation would the other seeds be placed in?

However, the Majestic Heaven Sect had its own rules. It had never accepted a disciple outside of its recruitment periods that occurred once every 100 years. This was a custom that had been developed since long ago. However, Elder Hai Yun had actually broken this rule for Ling Han the first time that he saw him. This was naturally astounding.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before answering, “I’m willing to join the Majestic Heaven Sect.”

This had been his plan all along.

Elder Hai Yun laughed heartily and appeared especially satisfied. He nodded, and said, “The rest of you also choose some followers. Han Lin, come with me in a while. I have some things to say to you.”

“Understood,” Ling Han said with a respectful nod. This was the respect that one had to show to Heavenly Body Tier elites.

Gan Shiyun’s entire body shook in anger. What could she do now?

Ling Han had also become a seed, so she couldn’t even borrow the power of the sect.

No!

She definitely had to wash this humiliation away. If she wasn’t powerful enough, she would seek help from others; she would seek help from those true freaks.

Ling Han swept his gaze around the surroundings. He then strode toward the man and woman who had stepped out to help him just then.

Now was different from just then, and his status had already changed completely. The crowds parted to let him through, and they all gazed at him with eagerness and fervor. They hoped that he would choose them as his followers.

Many beauties also winked at him, their expressions as charming as could be.

If they were chosen by Ling Han, they would definitely be willing to give even their bodies. Anyhow, being able to follow a seed-level prodigy was like a sparrow reaching a branch and being able to transform into a phoenix.

It was a shame that Ling Han paid them no attention at all. He directly walked past them and arrived before the man and woman. Meanwhile, the Ninth King also followed behind him. She was incredibly bored here, and she had finally come across an old friend. Thus, there was naturally a lot that she wanted to say.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “This brother, are you interested in becoming my follower? Also, your junior sister can become her follower.” He pointed toward Hu Feiyun.

Hu Feiyun cocked her head and looked at the beauty in green, not appearing to have any objections. She really couldn’t care less whom she took as a follower. Since Ling Han had given her a suggestion, she naturally wouldn’t turn him down.

The senior brother and junior sister duo was delighted by Ling Han’s proposal. However, they were also feeling a little nervous and afraid.

“I have to accept your gesture of goodwill for stepping out to help me. The most important thing to a cultivator is their disposition, and the actions of you two have won my admiration,” Ling Han said.

The pair exchanged a glance. Then, they both nodded.

“I’m called Fan Ru,” the senior brother said. “My junior sister is called Chen Xiao. Thank you for taking us as your followers, Young Master Han and...” He looked toward Hu Feiyun, whose name he still didn’t know.

“She’s Hu Feiyun,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Chen Xiao immediately curtseyed, and said, “Greetings, Master!”

Hu Feiyun hurriedly pulled her up, and said, “Just call me Feifei. I don’t like others referring to me as master.”

Chen Xiao nodded in understanding. She immediately developed a good impression of Hu Feiyun.

“Okay, let’s enter the sect,” Ling Han said with a smile. He missed Shui Yanyu dearly, and he also wanted to reunite with his three brothers.

He walked side by side with Hu Feiyun, while Fan Ru and Chen Xiao walked a few steps behind them.

The other seeds also started to select followers, and the atmosphere instantly became boisterous as everyone clamored for a spot.

Ling Han had Fan Ru and his junior sister follow Hu Feiyun first while he went over to visit Elder Hai Yun. He followed Elder Hai Yun to a residence on the main mountain peak. Clouds swirled around the peak, making it seem like heaven on earth.

“This isn’t your real appearance. Are you being hunted after offending too many people?” Elder Hai Yun cut straight to the point.
