1274 Heavenly Tribulation of the Old Ginseng

Ling Han sheathed his sword.

Peng!

Zhu Liyun’s headless corpse collapsed to the ground in a heap. Meanwhile, her head also fell back down from the sky. However, she still wore an intoxicated expression, and it was as if she hadn’t noticed the arrival of her death.

Shock spread across Xie Donglai’s face. Just then, he had almost been intoxicated by the Misty Soul Capturing Flower as well. Fortunately, he had been far away enough, and he had also tempered his divine sense before. As such, his willpower was strong, and it wouldn’t be that easy for him to fall victim.

However, it was a completely different story for his two elderly servants. They were still confused at this moment, and it was as if they had even forgotten their own identity.

‘What a terrifying demonic flower!’

However, Faceless was completely unaffected. He was simply curious, and he asked, “Brother Ling, is this the Misty Soul Capturing Flower?”

“As expected of Brother Faceless!” Ling Han said with a smile. “This is indeed the Misty Soul Capturing Flower.”

He held the Misty Soul Capturing Flower in his left hand while he held his Divine Demon Sword in his right. He strode toward Xie Donglai.

Xie Donglai’s expression changed drastically. He gritted his teeth, and a golden paper seal instantly appeared in his hand. He slapped this seal onto his chest, and a powerful golden light immediately burst into the surroundings, causing Ling Han and Faceless to involuntarily turn their heads away.

This light was far too blinding. In fact, it was genuinely capable of ruining one’s eyes.

When they turned back around, that orb of golden light had already enveloped Xie Donglai as well as his two elderly servants and soared into the sky.

In the Immortal Realm, only Heavenly Body Tier elites could grasp the more profound Regulations of heaven and earth and achieve the ability of flight. However, the Regulations were extremely chaotic in the Two Realm Battlefield, so it would be even harder to maintain flight for long periods of time.

Yet, the speed of the golden orb that enveloped Xie Donglai and his two elderly servants was incredibly quick. It was evident that this divine seal wasn’t the work of a Heavenly Body Tier elite.

There was an Eternal River Tier in the Xie Clan, so it was only normal that he refined some divine seals for his descendants.

However, the Xie Clan had so many members, and there was no way that an Eternal River Tier elite would spend all his time refining divine seals. Thus, these divine seals were probably still tremendously valuable in the Xie Clan. Thus, Xie Donglai probably only had one such divine seal, even with his lofty standing.

Such a divine seal was genuinely a life-saver.

Xie Donglai was afraid that Ling Han would target him with the Misty Soul Capturing Flower, and he was even more afraid that Faceless would suddenly attack him. The latter would truly plunge him into a perilous situation. To him, facing a cultivator at the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier would be no different from facing an elite at the Heavenly Body Tier. In both cases, he would be absolutely no match for them.

Ling Han shook his head as he put his Divine Demon Sword and Misty Soul Capturing Flower away. In reality, the effectiveness of the Misty Soul Capturing Flower was fairly limited. At least, it was completely useless against Faceless. It was clear that the stronger one’s willpower, the stronger their resistance against the Misty Soul Capturing Flower’s intoxication ability.

Faceless wasn’t a nosy person, and he didn’t ask Ling Han about his animosity toward Xie Donglai and Zhu Liyun. Instead, he continued to discuss dao with him. Another seven days passed, and only then did he reluctantly bid farewell to Ling Han. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Their discussions of dao had benefited him immensely, and also given him a wealth of inspiration. Thus, he decided to enter seclusion for a few months or even one or two years so that he could work toward the peak stage of the pinnacle level.

Ling Han also entered the Black Tower.

Three months had already passed, and he could temper his body in the immortal flames again.

People often said that things were difficult the first time but easy the second. However, after tempering his body in the immortal flames two times, Ling Han was only left with memories of pain and suffering. If it were possible, he truly didn’t want to be burned to ash again.

However, in order to become stronger, he resolutely leaped into the cauldron again.

Three days passed, and Ling Han crawled out of the cauldron. Like before, he had transformed into a tiny infant. However, if one looked closely, they would discover that he was at least seven months old this time. This was already a huge improvement from the first time, when he was at most three months old.

This represented his improved understanding of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, especially the part that pertained Rising From The Ashes.

“If I’m killed, I’ve almost got a two percent chance of rising from the ashes and returning to my peak power now,” Ling Han murmured to himself. However, this number was still too low. Out of 50 deaths, he would only be able to revive once. Such a probability was unacceptably low.

“However, I can ingest Berserk Blood Spirit Pills again!”

Rising From The Ashes would help his physique become stronger. However, this effect would only start to slowly become obvious with time. Meanwhile, the effects of Berserk Blood Spirit Pills were extremely evident. Once he took and digested one, his cultivation level would immediately advance by one sub-minor level.

Ling Han sat under the Reincarnation Tree for three days, digesting a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill and also comprehending dao.

He had already advanced to the middle stage of the medium extreme, but his comprehension of this cultivation level was still lacking slightly. After all, he had only comprehended dao for “three years”. The higher one’s cultivation level, the harder it would be to comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

He cultivated in seclusion for a few more days in order to stabilize his cultivation level. Only then did he return to Wolf Fang City.

Several months had passed, and he needed to visit the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. They had finally reunited after 10,000 years, yet they had only seen each other a limited number of times. Both he and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden missed each other immensely.

He went to the Purple Moon Army, and had a lover’s conversation with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. However, when he wanted to become more lovey-dovey, he was instantly swatted away by the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

‘Sure enough, this savage lady hasn’t changed a single bit!’

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was easily embarrassed, and she had instinctively swatted him aside upon seeing him move in for a kiss. In the end, Ling Han wasn’t able to realize his fantasy of kissing her.

“This savage lady... I’ll punish you when I advance to the consummate level!” Ling Han murmured to himself when he left the Purple Moon Army’s encampment.

Right now, he was genuinely no match for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Moreover, they obviously couldn’t engage in a life and death battle. Thus, he was absolutely helpless in front of her.

“Oh, isn’t this Little Han?”

“Why does it look like you’ve swallowed 100 flies?”

Rabbit and the old ginseng appeared before Ling Han, and immediately started to tease him.

A menacing look appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he threatened, “If you two don’t shut up, I’ll cook you into ginseng and rabbit meat soup!”

The rabbit and old ginseng continued to joke and laugh, completely unafraid of Ling Han’s threat. They had their arms around each other’s shoulders, and they looked like a pair of delinquent friends. It was just that Rabbit would occasionally drool when glancing at the old ginseng. It was entirely imaginable that one of them might disappear at any moment.

“Little Han, do you want Grandpa Ginseng to teach you a few techniques? I guarantee you’ll be able to win over the heart of any woman,” the old ginseng said shamelessly.

Ling Han chuckled in scorn. The old ginseng’s techniques most likely involved lying, cheating, deceiving, and kidnapping.

The old ginseng’s expression suddenly became serious, and he said, “Oh, that’s right, Grandpa Ginseng is about to break through to the Sun Moon Tier. So, I’ve especially come to ask you to become my guard.”

Ling Han shook his head upon hearing this. He had thought that they had finally discovered their conscience and come to visit him. As it turned out, they had only come looking for him because the old ginseng needed to face heavenly tribulation.

However, this was good news. He could take this opportunity to freeload some tribulation again.

“Fine, let’s go.”

The three “people” found a relatively desolate area, and the old ginseng immediately started to face his heavenly tribulation. He was extremely confident that he could pass the tribulation. However, his vitality would definitely fall drastically after going through heavenly tribulation. If he were targeted by someone at that time... After all, who wouldn’t want to eat Godly medicine?

Although the Immortal Realm had rules stating that one could only target Netherworld beings in the Two Realm Battlefield, who would know if someone secretly killed an ally outside of Wolf Fang City?

The main problem was that heavenly tribulation would cause a huge commotion and attract the attention of many people in the surroundings.

Boom!

Thunder instantly rumbled across the sky as the old ginseng stopped suppressing his cultivation level. Dark clouds converged above him.

The old ginseng started to face heavenly tribulation. Meanwhile, Ling Han actively jumped toward him to freeload his heavenly tribulation. He would take this opportunity to further comprehend heaven’s might.

“This brat is truly a freak!” Rabbit exclaimed as he ran far away. He didn’t want to be swept up in heavenly tribulation. After all, only freaks like Ling Han would actively provoke tribulations.
