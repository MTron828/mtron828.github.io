Chapter 3345: Birdman

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The poisonous mist gradually dispersed, and everyone’s eyes searched. They saw Ling Han standing proudly, and the snake woman was lying on the ground. There was an obvious fist mark on her pretty face.

No one could speak. A powerful Third Extreme who had cultivated high-level energy and possessed a natural talent was put down just like that.

It was like a dream.

Meanwhile, Ling Han knew he didn’t get off unscathed either. Though he had knocked out the snake woman, she had struck him several times in a row, and even the energy of Stone was unable to completely protect him. The back of his hand was already dripping with blood.

If that was all, that would only cause a little pain, at most, but when the flesh split open, the poison would also enter the body. This was the real fatal part.

He hurriedly took out a few Hundred Neutralization Pills and ingested them, but they did not have much effect on the snake poison. The poison was only temporarily suppressed, and had not been dissipated.

Pa, pa, pa. A lone round of applause rang out, and a cloaked figure walked out, and said, “Being able to defeat Sister Snake, you are really quite impressive for a human. However, where did you learn the techniques of our Demon Race from?”

“Hand over this technique, it belongs to our Demon Race!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle coldly. What kind of reason was this?

The Demonic Monkey Fists was a technique that Brother Monkey had taught him, so what did it have to do with these people?

“If you’re envious, then be envious. Don’t put on any airs!” he said disdainfully.

“Then I can only take it by force!” The cloaked person shook his arms, and the cloak immediately left his body, revealing the head of a bird. His two massive wings had also spread open, and added together, they were as long as three meters.

Ling Han was astonished, and he said, “Who would’ve thought that you’re actually a birdman!”

The birdman was furious, and exclaimed, “I am of the eagle race, and my name is Ying Changkong!”

Damn it, he actually dared to call him a birdman. You are the f****** birdman here, and your whole family are birdmen.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and said, “In other words, not only are you a birdman, you are also a fighter jet among birdmen.”

Ying Changkong’s expression became uglier and uglier, but in the end, he sneered and said, “I have the cultivation level of Fourth Extreme. In Extreme Bone Tier, with every difference of a single minor level, the gap in power is about 5 million kg or so.”

“Although you’re freakish, your original power is only around 5 million kilograms. Moreover, you’ve already used up your explosive power. Even if I throw a light punch, you won’t be able to block it.”

This was the honest truth. The power of an Extreme Bone Tier elite was too strong. Otherwise, any prodigy would possess the ability to battle an opponent on a higher cultivation level.

Ling Han remained calm and collected. He still had a trump card. Although he didn’t want to expose it in public, he definitely couldn’t lose now.

Now, he was not only representing the Dark North Nation in battle, but also representing the human race!

Though it was said that he was weaker by a major tier, so it was fine even if he lost, but since Hong Tianbu could defeat the opponent who was superior by a major tier cultivation level, why couldn’t he?

“Come!” He merely crooked a finger.

“Ignorant and foolish.” Ying Changkong smirked coldly. With a flap of his wings, he rose into the air.

The space here was extremely narrow, so it was not suitable for him to unleash his full potential. However, his opponent was too weak, so there was no need for him to use his flying ability. He was only soaring into the air to strengthen his aura.

Woosh. With a flap of his wings, he evoked a powerful gust. This was the strength of a Fourth Extreme elite. In addition to the already worn down condition of this place, the entire basement was quaking and was on the verge of collapse.

Ling Han’s expression was cold. He slanted a glance at Ying Changkong, and said, “Birdman, within three moves, I will make you kneel down and proclaim your surrender.”

“Haha!” Ying Changkong sneered, then roared, “Don’t call me bird man!”

He flapped his wings and swooped down at Ling Han.

Ling Han crossed his arms behind his back, looking like he was an elite. He gave off an air like, ‘as long as you pounce, I’ll be able to deal with you with a single punch.’

This show-off.

“You are courting death!” The members of the Demon Race on Young Master Hu’s side all declared coldly.

Ying Changkong had already pounced over, but he immediately discovered that something was off. Why was it so cold?

He had not even finished the thought, when he saw an ice arrow shoot towards him at an astonishing speed.

Where had this come from?

Ying Changkong hurriedly dodged, but the speed of the ice arrow had reached the level of Inscription Tier, so how could he possibly dodge?

Pa, his wing had already been hit by an arrow. This target was too big. Instantly, frost spread out, instantly engulfing his whole wing.

If that was all, with Ying Changkong’s strength, he wouldn’t have collapsed just like that. However, new ice arrows shot out one after another.

After Ying Changkong was hit by the first arrow, it meant that he could no longer dodge the subsequent arrows of ice.

Pu, pu, pu, pu! He was hit repeatedly. Not only was his wings covered with ice, but even his body was covered with ice. His entire body was frozen, and he couldn’t move a single finger.

Ling Han used his spiritual power to shut down the circular plate formation, then grabbed it back.

Seeing this scene, everyone couldn’t help but feel stunned. Retrieving something from a distance, how was he able to do such a thing that was like a myth?

“Spiritual Power!”

“Extremely powerful too. Otherwise, it could not possibly give form to something intangible, and take things from a distance.”

“Hiss, this guy is also a Formation Master. He activated the formation just now and restrained that birdman!”

“This… isn’t Hong Tianbu also proficient in formation techniques? It’s said that he’s already been a High Level Formation Master for a long time, and now this guy is actually one as well.”

“Heavens, who exactly is this guy?”

Ying Changkong didn’t die, and Ling Han managed to stop the formation in time. Otherwise, his vitality would definitely be forcefully erased by the ice. Even so, he could only become an ice statue now, completely unable to melt down.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I said I would defeat you within three moves, and you still don’t believe me?”

Young Master Hu finally couldn’t sit still any longer. Ying Changkong was his most powerful subordinate. If this person was defeated, then it would be the same no matter who he sent.

He was an Inscription Tier martial artist. If he made a move, he would naturally be able to easily defeat Ling Han.

But to bully the weak like this, he would be humiliated.

However, the pride of the Demon Race had to be regained. How could they be inferior to the Human Race?

“Merely a human!” Young Master Hu stated calmly, “To secretly learn the techniques of our Demon Race, I will take you down first, and then seek out your Council Chairperson, and ask him properly!”

He made a false accusation, and said that Ling Han had stolen the techniques of the Demon Race. Then, it was only natural that he would make a move now, and he was not bullying the weak with his superior strength.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. Who said that the Demon Race was upright? They completely reversed the perspectives. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He laughed loudly, and said, “What’s the point of saying such self-deceitful words? Come, let’s go all out in battle. Do I fear you?”

His trump card was the circular plate, but his opponent was an Inscription Tier martial artist, so it was very difficult for him to use it to its full effect. Thus, he needed to use the flying swords at this time. Combining the two moves together, perhaps it would be effective.

It was only a possibility. Inscription Tier elites were too strong.

“Impudence!” Young Master Hu strode forwards, bearing down on Ling Han, “Remember my name, Hu Sihai!”

He released the intimidation unique to Inscription Tier elites, and added with the fact that he himself was a demonic tiger with a terrifying viciousness, the pressure he created was naturally extremely terrifying, making everyone shiver as if they were facing a fierce beast of the primitive era.

Peng!

Right at this moment, the wall above their heads suddenly shattered. Boom! The entire underground arena instantly collapsed..
