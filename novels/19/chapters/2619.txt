Chapter 2620: Forest of Lightning

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was like a ruffian. Deep inside the Ancient Tomb, another group of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings ground to a halt before bellowing in rage.

This was naturally Kong Si and the others.

Ling Han paid no heed to this. He had already reached the end of the passageway, so he held hands with the Empress as he walked out.

Crackle!

What welcomed them was a saber-like arc of lightning that measured 300 meters in length.

!!

The Empress roared, and was just about to draw her sword. However, Ling Han immediately stepped in front of her as he threw a punch.

Pa, pa, pa!

Countless sparks flew into the air as the lightning smashed into his fists.

“The destructive power of this lightning has reached the Sixth Heaven, so you’ll get hurt if you try to face it head-on,” Ling Han said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The Empress nodded upon hearing this. No wonder it was said that only those above the Sixth Heaven could enter this area. In reality, what was required was a battle prowess above the Sixth Heaven as only with it could one block these arcs of lightning. Otherwise, one could only flee in disarray.

Gazing into the distance, it was clear that this was a forest. There were innumerable towering trees that were all glowing blue and decorated with fat and healthy leaves. Countless sparks flashed among the trees, and these sparks would occasionally join together to form an arc of lightning.

Looking closely, the veins of the leaves were also brimming with terrifying arcs of electricity.

“These are Blue Lunar Lightning Trees!” Ling Han exclaimed in shock.

Blue Lunar Lightning Trees were a type of mysterious tree that drew from the Regulations of Lightning for nutrients. When they matured, they would be enveloped in lightning, and even occasionally unleash arcs of lightning into the surroundings. These attacks would possess the destructive ability of a Sixth Heaven Celestial King.

Moreover, these trees would also bear Lightning Core Fruit, a paramount treasure for Celestial Kings who practiced the Regulations of Lightning.

Ling Han swept his gaze around, yet he was unable to find a single Lightning Core Fruit.

This wasn’t strange. He had arrived here so many years after the others, so it was only natural that the Lightning Core Fruits had already been taken by the others.

Perhaps the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were unable to dig out the Jade Essence Pearls, or perhaps it was beneath them to do so. However, picking the Lightning Core Fruits would be as easy as raising their hands. Thus, who would reject this bountiful offer?

Ling Han turned to the Empress, saying, “You can enter the Celestial Guest Residence to digest the Jade Essence Pearl first. Do your best to advance as soon as possible.”

“Sure!” Without another word, the Empress immediately entered the Celestial Guest Residence. This place was filled with lightning that possessed the destructive ability of Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings, so it would only cause Ling Han more trouble if she remained by his side.

Ling Han strode forward.

Pa!

Upon stepping into the forest, he instantly became a target for the brimming arcs of lightning.

Crackle…

Arcs of lightning cracked down at Ling Han.

“Haha! Even Eighth Heaven heavenly tribulations are a walk in the park for me, so what harm can this do?” Ling Han didn’t try to dodge or block the lightning at all as he walked through the forest.

Pa, pa, pa!

Arcs of lightning crashed into him, yet they failed to leave even a single mark.

Ling Han’s physique had already reached the Sixth Heaven, so even if he stood there unmoving, Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings would still need to exert a huge amount of energy to breach his defenses.

Ling Han strolled through the forest of lightning as if he were strolling through a park. He was looking for Lightning Core Fruit that the others might have missed.

However, it was a shame that they had all been picked.

“What Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? Just how stingy are they? They’re even picking Lightning Core Fruits!” Ling Han spat. These people had completely cleaned this forest of Lightning Core Fruits, not leaving a single one.

“Forget about it. I should hurry out of this place.”

However, he faltered just as he was about to make his way out.

“Strange… If this is the tomb of a Heavenly Venerate, then what’s the point of having this forest of Blue Lunar Lightning Trees?

“To block tomb raiders? What a joke! Will a Heavenly Venerate set up a Sixth Heaven obstacle to block others?

“Hang on!”

Ling Han stood still. After pondering for a moment, he started to wander around the forest again.

Passing through this forest wouldn’t take a long time. However, going around it again and again was extremely time-consuming. After seven days, Ling Han finally stopped again. His eyes were tightly shut, and he silently brought up the images of the past seven days in his mind.

“This is a formation. However, it’s not a formation used to attack or stop others. If I’m not wrong…”

Ling Han didn’t open his eyes. Instead, he started to walk just like that. After half an hour or so, he came to a stop and opened his eyes. What appeared before him was a Blue Lunar Lightning Tree that measured more than 300 meters in height.

“Sure enough, this is the formation eye!” A smile appeared on his face. “The intention of this formation eye is to…”

Ling Han walked up to the tree, and sat cross-legged beneath it.

Crackle!

All of the lightning in the forest immediately converged toward him, crackling as it smashed into him.

“…pass on a Celestial technique!”

Ling Han roared with laughter as he gathered the arcs of lightning into his palms.

“Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning,” he murmured. Arcs of lightning flowed into his body, instantly transforming into numerous symbols that imparted some kind of secret technique.

One couldn’t obtain this secret technique simply by sitting under this tree. Instead, they needed to first comprehend the layout of this forest and understand how to manipulate these arcs of lightning and fuse them into symbols. Otherwise, it would be impossible to obtain any information.

Ling Han called the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou out as well, allowing them to practice the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning alongside him. Having been left by a Heavenly Venerate, it was certainly no ordinary technique.

This was the formation eye, and Ling Han had also comprehended the layout of the entire formation. Thus, these arcs of lightning wouldn’t carry any destructive ability as they crackled over. Instead, they could help one comprehend the Regulations of Lightning.

Ling Han and the others were advancing far too quickly, so they could only choose a single Regulation to focus on. However, none of them had chosen to focus on the Great Dao of Lightning. Thus, being able to comprehend it right now was a huge help to them.

The three of them sat cross-legged as they greedily absorbed the power of lightning and comprehended the mysterious nature of the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, 3,000 years had already passed.

The lightning in the forest was almost completely absorbed by Ling Han and the others, and they had also continued to ingest Jade Essence Pearls while they had done so. Add to that the acceleration of time, and a whopping 3,000,000 years had already passed in their eyes!

The Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning was naturally mastered by them. With the help of the Jade Essence Pearls, their cultivation level also improved by a significant amount.

Ling Han reached the middle stage of the Fifth Heaven, while his two wives had already reached the pinnacle level of the Fifth Heaven. They weren’t far from advancing to the next level.

“It’s a shame that we finished all of the Jade Essence Pearls. Otherwise, it would have been amazing if we had advanced to the Sixth Heaven in a single breath,” Ling Han said with emotion. Once he advanced to the Sixth Heaven, he would possess the ability to battle against ordinary Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Even if he came across Ninth Heaven monarch stars, he would still be able to leave with ease and composure.

“Our cultivation speed is already too high. We can’t be too greedy,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said with a smile. If this had been in the past, she wouldn’t have even dreamed that she could one day become a Celestial King.

Meanwhile, the Empress rubbed her hands in anticipation. She was hell-bent on surpassing Heavenborn so that she could crush this detestable person who dared to wound her husband.

“Let’s go. We’ve already absorbed all of the lightning in this place,” Ling Han said.

He extended his right hand.

Crackle…

Azure lightning danced in his palm, appearing as terrifying as could be.

A satisfied smile spread across his face. “The might of this Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning is quite astonishing. If I strike with this palm, even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings will tremble in fear.”

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou was feeling extremely happy. She didn’t have a Celestial Tool, so learning this powerful secret technique was a huge boost to her battle prowess.

“Huh?!”

Ling Han was just about to speak, yet he immediately looked up ahead, only to see five people walking over—four men and one woman. A man was in the lead, and he had seven ribbons of iridescent light around him, which caused him to radiate with an astonishing aura.
