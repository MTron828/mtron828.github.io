Chapter 2209: Enrolled into the academy

However, even so, it was still a piece of cake for the Rain Emperor to suppress Ji Yutang.

Perhaps when the Rain Emperor experienced another heaven-defying stroke of luck, he could further boost his battle prowess, and be truly ranked in the top tier.

The Rain Emperor shot out countless punches. He had long since walked out his own path, but at that time, his cultivation level was too low, and he had still been far from reaching the height of Regulations. But it was a different story now. He had blended Regulations in, and the Rain Emperor’s path had also truly become clear.

In front of many eyes, the Rain Emperor completely had the upper hand, with each punch stronger than the last, suppressing Ji Yutang completely.

Ji Yutang was initially embarrassed and furious. He, a great First Secret monarch tier, was actually being suppressed by a Dividing Soul Tier. But it was quickly followed by great shock, because there was not just one such freak in the Saintly Origin Academy.

And this kind of person would have boundless future prospects. The heights they could reach was not something that he could even imagine.

Which also meant that no matter how humiliated he was today, he would not have a chance for revenge in future—the purpose behind establishing the academy was to nurture talent, and even more effort of nurturing would be concentrated on a prodigy like the Rain Emperor. If anyone dared to touch a hair on the head of the Rain Emperor, just see if those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t explode.

When he thought about this, Ji Yutang’s fighting spirit naturally declined greatly.

Continuing the battle would only result in a terrible defeat, and he would not be able to get revenge, either, so what was the point in fighting?

“Humph, I am a First Secret monarch tier, and I disdain from bullying a mere Dividing Soul Tier!” Throwing down a line that fitted the situation, he suddenly turned and left.

Of course, no one would believe his nonsense, but his strength was obvious. Who would dare to expose his wounds right in front of him?

The Rain Emperor did not pursue. He closed his eyes slightly, pondering on his own shortcomings in the previous battle.

What was so terrifying about prodigies?

It was that they would never be satisfied with their own achievements. Instead, they would continue to cautiously and conscientiously advance to a stronger level.

Ling Han also felt strange. They had created such a great ruckus, but why was there still no movement from the academy? Could it be they really wanted them to sweep through the entire academy?

Inside the academy, several powerful figures were gathered for discussion.

“These four youths are not bad, especially those two men. They have both attained Dividing Nine Souls,” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King said. He was the Eternity Celestial King, his cultivation level carrying on through eternity. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A second Ninth Heaven Celestial King nodded, and said, “The invasion from the Foreign Realm is close at hand, and massive changes have also taken place in the heaven and earth. Otherwise, not even one prodigy that has attained Dividing Nine Souls may appear in a whole epoch.”

His title was Everlasting Youth, and he was a veteran among veteran Celestial Kings.

A third Ninth Heaven Celestial King said, “Even if they have cultivated to Dividing Nine Souls, it is not definite that they would become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and so many Dividing Nine Souls prodigies have appeared this time. Would it be possible that an even stronger existence could emerge?”

His title was Treading Clouds, and he was also a veteran Celestial King.

“Heavenly Venerable Tier?” The Eternity Celestial King thought for a moment, but then shook his head. “Becoming a Heavenly Venerate is not possible through mere effort and natural talent. The heaven and earth would suppress you, and without finding a suitable trigger, there would be no way to cast off the shackles of heaven and earth, and advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

“That’s right. The heaven and earth would not allow an uncontrollable force to appear. Through the ages, just how many Heavenly Venerates had there been?” the Everlasting Youth Celestial King agreed.

“But this time, the invasion of the Foreign Realm will directly affect the survival of the heaven and earth. Perhaps the heaven and earth will also change to a limited extent. See, isn’t the appearance of the Dragon’s Gate Mountain a compromise from the heaven and earth?” Yet Treading Clouds Celestial King had a different opinion.

A thought suddenly came to the Eternity Celestial King, and he exclaimed, “If your deduction is correct, then wouldn’t that mean that those three”—he pointed at the skies—”have all been born for the calamity?”

“Otherwise, I definitely do not believe that anyone can surpass Regulations,” Treading Clouds Celestial King said. “Just how long have the three of us stagnated in the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier? Yet it is still complete darkness ahead of us, and we cannot glimpse the slightest sliver of a chance to advance further. It is this heaven and earth that has restricted us, just like the restrictions on the height of Regulations.”

“Unless the heaven and earth loosens the restrictions, there will be no one that can step out of the pinnacle of the Celestial King Tier.”

“Which also means that the invasion of the Foreign Realm is actually a chance?”

“Maybe.”

“This group of youths, as well as Imperial Void, Zi Luo, Na Dong, and the other newly promoted Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings all have a chance of snatching this opportunity to transcend the heaven and earth.”

The three Celestial Kings looked at one another, and all of them sighed.

Even among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, there were differences in strength. The three great Celestial Kings that they had mentioned like Imperial Void, Zi Luo, and Na Dong were well-known figures even among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Some have only advanced into Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier for only tens of billions of years, while there were some that had been at this level for as long as five or six epochs. However, true overlords among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings all had a chance of breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Yet they were still quite some distance away, and were not qualified for that.

“When we defeat the troops of the Foreign Realm this time, I wish to journey into the Foreign Realm,” the Eternity Celestial King suddenly said.

“Are you mad?” The Everlasting Youth Celestial King paled. “The heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm is completely different from the Celestial Realm. The Regulations we cultivate would be completely useless there. After entering that place, we would only be able to battle by depending on the Regulations that are locked within our bodies. Once they are fully exhausted, our strength would decline to an inconceivable level, which may only be at the Severing Mundane Tier.”

This was applicable for Foreign Realm elites. That was why the Celestial Realm had been able to hold on for so long.

“Brother Everlasting Youth, in this heaven and earth, there was never any possibility for us to stand out. But when we reach the Foreign Realm, while we would still have to start from the very beginning again, there is a chance that we could leap from a small pond into the bigger ocean, and have more space for development?” The Eternity Celestial King proposed another point of view.

“That’s right.” The Treading Clouds Celestial King nodded. “The overall level of cultivation of the Foreign Realm is higher than ours. Otherwise, it would be us that would be the invaders. Since that is the case, the chances of breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier would also be considerably increased there.”

“We can attain the Ninth Heaven, and that means that our natural talent and aptitude is all top-tier. As long as we were given a chance, why wouldn’t we be able to break out of Ninth Heaven?”

Everlasting Youth Celestial King was silent for a while, and then said, “All of that would have to depend on the final battle. If we lose, there is no need to mention anything else.”

“Naturally.” The other two Celestial Kings nodded as well.

Only if the Celestial Realm was secured would they be able to think of other matters. Otherwise, when the nest overturned, would there be any egg remaining intact?

“All right, enroll these four young people into the academy. It is not proper to have them continue to block the gates,” the Treading Clouds Celestial King said smilingly. He stretched out a hand, and tapped a few times on empty air. Instantly, a decree appeared above the academy.

“The four of you, don’t cause any more trouble. Enter the academy immediately, and there naturally will be someone to make arrangements for you.”

The words were very frank and straightforward, with absolutely no beating around the bush.

Ling Han smiled slightly. He rose up and stowed the table and chairs all into the Black Tower. They could cause trouble, but if they did not behave even when a Celestial King had spoken, that would only be a suicidal course of action.

They entered into the academy, and an Ascending Origin Tier elite immediately approached. Smiling, he said, “Youths, follow me.”

Ascending Origin Tier was really not much in a Celestial King Tier force, and they could not put on any airs at all.

Yet Ling Han and the rest did not dare treat him lightly. There was a need to give adequate respect to an elite.

They entered into the academy, and the Ascending Origin Tier elite introduced himself. “My surname is Luo, and you may address me as Mr Luo.”

“Mr Luo.” Ling Han and his group went with his flow.

Mr Luo nodded, and then asked, “What Regulations do you mainly cultivate?”

Whatever Regulations they cultivated, they would be placed on the mountain that corresponded to that Regulation. Cultivating like this would mean half the work with twice the results.

Ling Han scratched his head, and said, “Mr Luo, you should ask me what Regulations I don’t cultivate. I would be able to answer that better.”

“…” Mr Luo.

Means that no member escapes unscathed from a family disaster, which, in this case, refers to the Celestial Realm..
