1474 Difficult Battle

Regardless of whether it was Ling Han or Empress Luan Xing, both were incredibly proud individuals who could accept defeat but certainly not humiliation.

Thus, they definitely wouldn’t give in to the senior disciples!

However, their situation was extremely dire, with an additional six Eternal River Tier elites joining in on the battle. It was useless regardless of how powerful they were. The gulf between their cultivation levels and numbers was far too great to overcome. In fact, being able to resist for so long was already a miracle.

Moreover, Ling Han’s wounds still had yet to fully recover, and he had more so already consumed all of his Indestructible True Fluid as well as used Rising From The Ashes. Right now, he was in his weakest state.

However, the more this was so, the more his fighting spirit burned. At this moment, his fighting spirit was soaring into the skies.

The spectating disciples were astonished by what they saw.

“This new disciple is genuinely impressive. His fighting spirit is so intense!”

“How many Heavenly Body Tier cultivators dare to battle against 12 Eternal River Tier elites? And their soaring fighting spirit... To say nothing of battling against them, just facing this many Eternal River Tier elites is enough to make one go weak at the knees.”

“However, they’re already at the end of their power. They’re destined to lose.”

“Naturally. No matter how powerful they are, they still can’t break the tradition of the academy. That’s tradition, and new disciples must taste some hardship.”

The disciples were all impressed by Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing’s strength. However, when it came to the problem of achieving victory, no one had any confidence that they could win.

Right now, they were only being attacked by senior disciples at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Taking into account the current battle situation, those at the medium extreme, high extreme, and consummate level all felt it beneath themselves to participate in the battle. However, if the senior disciples at the low extreme couldn’t defeat these two new disciples, then those at the medium extreme and high extreme would naturally jump in to help.

The tradition couldn’t be broken!

Xiu!

Another elite at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier joined the battle.

This was also the last elite at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier in the eighth campus.

The situation became even direr. Even though only one more person had joined, the pressure on Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing instantly exploded by more than tenfold.

Perhaps this was the last straw that would break the camel’s back.

In the distance, a handsome and elegant youth stood proudly on a mountain. He was dressed in white, and his face was smooth and jade-like. There was an azure glow around him, making him appear like a mighty and divine king.

There were many senior disciples around him, though not a single one of them dared to near him. Whenever they glanced at him, there would be boundless respect and reverence in their eyes.

This was a giant among the senior disciples. His name was Ren Feiyun, and he had already reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier 7,000,000 years ago. Right now, he was already at the peak stage of the consummate level. His strength was unfathomable, and he was more so only a step away from reaching the Genesis Tier.

However, it was this step that severed the path of many people. Among the hundreds of nearby galaxies and thousands of nearby great stars, which planet didn’t have cultivators at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier? However, in the countless years that had passed, how many of them had managed to break through and advance to the Genesis Tier?

What did it matter that one was supremely talented? Perhaps they could reach the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier in just 10,000,000 years. However, in the remaining 400,000,000 years of their life, they could only spend it in a menial matter, gradually watching themselves leaving youth and stepping into old age. Their vitality would also continue to weaken, all the way until their eventual death.

Even so, these kinds of beings could still be regarded as supreme beings no matter where they went. Beneath Saints... they were invincible!

A smile spread across Ren Feiyun’s face, and he said to himself, “At that time, even I chose to bow my head. That left a weakness in my mind, and even until now, I still can’t see any hope of breaking through.

“If I head over to help and resolve their situation, perhaps I can elevate the state of my mind.

“However, they have to at least withstand this wave of attacks. Otherwise... they won’t have the right to justify my interference.”

Beneath him, Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing were already on the verge of defeat. They were battling against 13 Eternal River Tier elites! They were at a crushing disadvantage!

“Nine Bodies, Chaotic World Technique!” Empress Luan Xing roared softly.

Weng!

Nine beams of brilliant light instantly burst from her body, soaring into the sky. They then shot back down, fusing into her body and elevating her cultivation level by a significant amount.

This was a secret technique of the Nine Deaths Heaven Art. It could draw on the power of her nine bodies, thereby allowing her power to grow explosively for a short period of time.

“Shatter!” She aggressively charged forward, ripping a hole in her opponents’ defenses.

Ling Han also seized this opportunity to charge forward. He held the Divine Demon Sword in one hand and the damaged wooden sword in the other as he dashed toward the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple. This senior disciple had been wounded before, and he was more so showing signs of exhaustion after battling against them for so long. Thus, he was the weak link among the 13 Eternal River Tier elites.

Shua!

Ling Han slashed down with both swords. Even though the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple was at the Eternal River Tier, he still didn’t dare to face this attack head-on. He could only choose to retreat. After all, he was aware of just how powerful these two swords were. If he were directly struck by them, he would definitely suffer severe damage to his Origin Power. In fact, he might even suffer damage to his life force!

However, even though his retreat was quick enough for him to dodge the swords, it wasn’t quick enough from him to dodge the Sword Qi that burst forth from them. Wounds appeared on both his chest and abdomen. At this moment, he appeared to be in a very sorry state.

Meanwhile, Ling Han didn’t feel good, either. After launching the attack, he was met with the wild counterattacks of the 12 other Eternal River Tier elites. He suffered heavy blows to his waist, legs, abdomen, and chest. As freakish as his physique was, he still couldn’t help but cough up mouthfuls of blood.

In any case, it was still thanks to his powerful physique that he could withstand their attacks at all. If it had been another person, they would have definitely been rendered immobile, if not killed.

Ling Han was drenched in blood, yet he was still standing as straight as a spear.

The silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple was already unable to battle any longer. There was a haughty look in Ling Han’s eyes as he gazed at the 12 remaining elites. It was as if he were a large mountain that would never collapse, one that people could only look up to.

“Is there anyone else?” Ling Han roared. Although he was wounded, his aura had elevated to another level.

The 12 elites were momentarily dazed by his domineering aura. However, they quickly came to their senses, with rage emerging on their faces. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

‘You’re far too arrogant!

‘Even though the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple has lost the ability to battle, your wounds aren’t light, either! Although you used wounds to exchange wounds, we still have 12 other members! Is it not abundantly clear who can afford to exchange wounds for wounds?’

The senior disciples were all furious as they attacked. They definitely had to teach this new disciple a harsh lesson and reinstate the reputation of the senior disciples.

Meanwhile, there was a murderous aura on Empress Luan Xing’s beautiful face. Ling Han had been wounded, and she could see this clearly. There was a stabbing pain in her heart. She was enraged, and Origin Power started to surge from her body like waves. This Origin Power was intertwined with her rage. At the same time, her hair started to billow and dance in the air like snakes.

Under her wrathful rage, her bloodline had surprisingly awakened one step further.

“Die!”

Neither side wanted to retreat, nor was any room for retreat. The only option was to fight until a victor was determined.

Ling Han continued to exchange wounds for wounds, causing another three elites to lose their ability to battle. However, his own wounds also became increasingly severe. There was almost no good skin on his body, and through his battered flesh, even his Godly bones could be seen.

This caused everyone to feel numb with shock and astonishment. They were all moved by Ling Han’s willpower and fighting spirit.

It was definitely no coincidence that he had made it to where he was now.

‘Fight, fight, fight!’

It appeared as if Ling Han would collapse after being struck by one more attack. However, in reality, he picked himself up time and time again. It was as if he were an undying god of war.

Meanwhile, the number of his opponents continued to slowly decrease. Right now, there were only... seven senior disciples remaining!

At this rate, if Ling Han didn’t fall, it was truly possible that he might defeat all 13 of the Eternal River Tier elites.

Could Ling Han really persist until the end?

His body was swaying and drenched in blood, and it was as if he could barely maintain his balance. Only his eyes remained incredibly bright and dazzling.

Xiu!

A figure in white suddenly appeared at this moment, and he radiated with a powerful aura that seemed as if it could suppress the heavens.

He was Ren Feiyun, an elite at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier!
