2954 Guidance

The learning ability of a Seventh Tier was naturally strong. In just a few days, that female supreme being had already learned how to speak, but her intelligence could not be praised. She was still stuck at the level of a three-year-old child.

Thank you readers!

Ling Han taught her how to restrain her aura. If this continued, the skin all over his body would be cracking.

The red-clothed woman learned for a few more days, and finally learned how to control her aura. If she did not take the initiative to reveal herself, even a Sixth Tier would not be able to discover how strong she was.

Ling Han let the Empress and Hu Niu out of the Celestial Guest Residence. When the two women saw an exquisitely beautiful woman suddenly appear, they couldn’t help but feel surprised.

The beauty of this woman was definitely not inferior to theirs.

“Who is she?” Hu Niu asked curiously.

“Who is she?” the red-clothed woman also asked, her head slanted. She was like how Xiao Gu had once been. Her favorite hobby was mimicking the words of others.

“I unearthed her from a raw stone.” Ling Han spread out his hands helplessly.

“Yi!” The two women were curious, and stared at this woman.

The woman in red also stared at them, her head slanted and her eyes similarly filled with curiosity.

Why were these two people different from Ling Han?

“Don’t underestimate her. She is a Seventh Tier,” Ling Han said.

‘What?!’

The Empress and Hu Niu were both given a fright. There was nothing more terrifying than elites of the Seventh Tier in this world.

“Husband, what kind of luck do you have that you can even unearth a Seventh Tier elite?” the Empress mused ruefully.

Previously, Ling Han had already unearthed a Seventh Tier, but that had been a corpse, unlike this one, who was a living being.

If this spread out, it would definitely scare a large number of people to death.

Meanwhile, the woman in red giggled. She was just a child, and loved to cause trouble and be mischievous.

“What is your name?” Hu Niu asked curiously.

The red-clothed woman slanted her head to one side. “I do not have a name.”

Hu Niu couldn’t help but feel excited. “Then Niu will give you one.”

The red-clothed woman clapped her hands, and said, “Okay!” She seemed to find Hu Niu’s words interesting, and parrotted, “Niu wants a name.”

“That’s wrong. Only Niu can use the name of Niu,” Hu Niu insisted.

Hu Niu was very excited. This was naming a Seventh Tier, so she felt a great sense of accomplishment.

“Your name will be Bao Mei, then.” She finally came up with a name after thinking for a long while.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grit his teeth. In the past, he had given Hu Niu this name. Did this little girl still want to bring his naming skill to greater heights[1]?

“She’s all dressed in red, so why don’t we just use this as inspiration for a name?” the Empress suggested. It was rare for her to be interested in the matters of others.

After all, this was about a Seventh Tier.

“Bao Mei sounds nice!” Hu Niu insisted.

“Chi Yi is more suitable.” The Empress did not back down[2].

The two women were at loggerheads again, both wanting to obtain the right to name a Seventh Tier.

“Jue, Jue Huo,” the red-clothed woman suddenly spoke up. She pointed at herself. “Niu likes this name.”

Fine, neither woman realized her wish.

Meanwhile, Hu Niu jumped up. “Don’t snatch Niu’s exclusive property of Niu!”

The red-clothed woman, Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire[3], giggled. “Niu is Jue Huo!”

No matter how Hu Niu flew into a thunderous rage, protesting repeatedly, Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire was completely unconcerned, and firmly believed in this self-proclaimed name.

Ling Han tried to ask her about what had happened before she had fallen into a deep slumber, but Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire couldn’t remember anything. She had only just begun learning how to speak, so how could she still have any of her previous memories?

“Come, let’s go check out other areas.” Ling Han gave up.

“Jue Huo is a Seventh Tier. Can she bring us to a deeper dimension?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han nodded. “Haha, you know me best.”

“Nonsense, Niu knows you too!” Hu Niu Niu hurriedly said.

The four people directly proceeded downwards, planning to just forcefully barge into the next dimension like this.

In a short while, the flames formed by the fundamental particles were seen burning fiercely. The closer they were to the core of the group of dimensions, the more terrifying the pressure became. It was enough to incinerate even Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates and turn them into ashes. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ling Han pushed out Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire, but this female supreme being did not have much courage at all. With a sharp scream, she immediately fled back.

However, she was too strong. Amidst a sharp cry, the eardrums of Ling Han and the others all burst, causing blood to flow out.

It was as if those fundamental flames had also suffered a blow as they dimmed and were extinguished one after another.

Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire couldn’t help but be startled. She had not thought that the might of her cry would actually be so great. Out of curiosity, she released another sharp cry. The sound rumbled out, and extinguished the flames that were even farther away from them.

Ling Han hurriedly drew Hu Niu and the Empress into the Celestial Guest Residence, and then used his own power to protect them. Otherwise, even if they were protected by a Heavenly Venerate Tool, so what? The people inside would definitely be shattered into blood by the impact.

Meanwhile, he covered his ears with his hands. However, he was still unable to prevent his skin from being ripped apart. Blood started to flow from his seven apertures.

“Stop! Stop! Stop!” he called out.

Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire was so excited that she completely ignored his existence. When she finally discovered that there was something off with him, Ling Han had already become a bloody figure. All the skin on his body had long since been torn apart beyond recognition.

“What’s wrong with you?” she asked as she cocked her head to one side, her expression that of complete innocence.

Ling Han was rendered speechless. He had been wounded to such a state, yet he still couldn’t exact revenge, which made him feel gloomy.

But to say nothing of the fact that he was no match for her now, even if he was, how could he bring himself to bully a child?

Forget about it. He was definitely going to suffer this loss in silence.

“Come, come, come. Let’s step out first, and I will teach you a few moves.” Ling Han sighed.

If he wanted Jue Huo to pave the way for him, he would first have to teach her how to control and use her power. Otherwise, he would be dead before he could even enter into the next dimension.

Jue Huo still wanted to play, but when she saw Ling Han walking back, she could only follow gloomily.

Next, Ling Han taught Jue Huo how to use her own power.

A Seventh Tier was a Seventh Tier, and Jue Huo learned very quickly. She probably would be able to perfectly control her own power in a few months’ time.

However, after only a few days, Ling Han was discovered.

This time, it was people from the Flaming Frost Realm. There were a total of seven people, and they were naturally all Sixth Tiers.

Yue Borong?

Ling Han immediately recognized one of them. This old geezer was indeed intent on killing him, working so hard to find him.

“Ling Han, I’ve found you!” Yue Borong said in a baleful voice.

Ling Han gave an “oh.” “Then congratulations.”

‘Congratulations?’ Yue Borong humphed. ‘Do you think this is a game?’

“Now that I’ve found you, it means that your time of death has come,” he said balefully.

Ling Han was naturally unconcerned. There were merely seven Sixth Tiers; so what if they ganged up on him? Could it be that they could insta-kill him? As long as they could not insta-kill him, he could tear a rip into the Void and return to the Genesis World. No one could pursue him.

‘Moreover, I still have a Seventh Tier by my side, so why don’t you guys give it a try?’

“Then just bring it on, and see how I will deal with you,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Attack. There is no need to be polite,” Yue Borong declared coldly.

The seven Sixth Tiers surrounded Ling Han, all of them exuding an eerie pressure.

[1] Hu Niu’s suggestion, “Bao Mei,” means “Panther Girl,” which is in similar vein to her own name, Hu Niu or “Tiger Girl”.

[2] The Empress’s suggestion literally means “crimson dress”.

[3] Jue Huo directly translates to “Absolute Fire”.
