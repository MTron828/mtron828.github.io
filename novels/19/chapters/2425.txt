Chapter 2426: Scene of ruins

When Ling Han looked around, there really were masses of people here. There were many heads of black hair as far as the eye could see. Of course, there were also oddities, people who had red, green, golden, or even other more outrageous colors of hair. These were mostly wild beasts taken human form. Though they now had human form, they were still different in the end.

At present, everyone was extremely silent, and were seated around that ruined garden, as if there was a Celestial King there that was presently passing on his teachings, and teaching them supreme knowledge.

No one attempted to barge into the garden and pluck the celestial fruit. They seemed unusually well-behaved.

Ling Han glanced at the three women, and nodded. “Let’s go.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The four of them strode forwards. They already possessed the mark of a Celestial Seed, and as they comprehended, their strength had increased, and was heading towards the level of Pseudo-Celestial King Tier. Now, they really feared no one.

They were just about to pass the others when someone in front of them immediately shouted, “Don’t you know the rules?”

Ling Han smiled. “There are rules?”

“Of course!” that person declared proudly. “Without enough strength, you would not be qualified to even enter here. Do you see that side? Just stay there!” He pointed at a corner.

Ling Han looked over. That was already outside of the garden, and there were a great many people seated there too. However, there was clearly still a lot of empty space in the garden, yet they did not take another step further.

Clearly, those were all weaker people, and that was why they could only stay outside. The fruity fragrance they could absorb there would naturally be considerably weaker.

Ling Han turned back around, and smilingly said, “I am very strong!”

“Pu!” That person scoffed. He had never seen such a shameless person that would actually praise himself!

“Greetings, Grandmaster Ling!” Their conversation had alerted those in the area, and when an outsider spotted Ling Han, he hurriedly stood up, and bowed towards him respectfully. The reverence and fanaticism in his expression was practically about to spill over.

Ling Han nodded very casually. “What is your name?”

“I am Fu Dong!” the person quickly replied in excitement. Though he was only an Ascending Origin Tier, and could also advance into Celestial King Tier himself, in front of Ling Han, he was willing to play the role of a lackey.

It could not be helped. Not only was Ling Han a Five-Star Grandmaster, his own battle prowess was even more terrifying. In the future, he would definitely become the strongest Celestial King… or at least one of the strongest.

Ling Han gave an oh, and stated smilingly, “Brother Fu.”

Fu Dong was even more excited. ‘Who said that Ling Han was not an easy person to deal with? He’s very polite. As for those that spread the gossip, heh, they were just jealous.’

When the person from earlier saw this, his expression involuntarily changed to shock.

He was a local resident of the Celestial Path, and naturally would not recognize or know of Ling Han, yet he knew Fu Dong because the latter had fought his way in with true strength, and had proven that he had the right to stay here and cultivate.

But this kind of elite was actually so humble and modest in front of Ling Han, looking completely like he was willing to become a subordinate to him. This was enough proof of just how powerful Ling Han’s strength was.

He couldn’t help but feel a sense of lingering fear. If he and Ling Han really came to blows, he would definitely be seeking his own humiliation.

He hurriedly lowered his head, and became a coward.

“Hey, why are you sticking your head in the ground?” Hu Niu asked delicately. ‘He actually dared to look down on Niu’s Ling Han. Niu expresses that Niu is very angry, and is going to hit him when he is down.’

That person did not even dare to say a single word, and only pretended like he had not heard anything.

Though this was very embarrassing, it was still much better than being pummeled in public.

Ling Han merely smiled, and did not take it to heart. He just looked at that jade-green Celestial Tree and the majestic mist of purple that was rising from it, which made it look extremely noble. He asked Fu Dong about the origins of this Celestial Tree, but the latter was not sure, either. He had just arrived a month earlier himself, and only knew that the depths of this garden were extremely dangerous. Not one person had managed to barge their way in.

“Do you see those damaged weapons there?” Fu Dong pointed at a few weapons that were scattered all around the Celestial Tree. They were a sword, a saber, a spear, and a halberd, and they were stabbed into the ground. However, every single weapon was already damaged, and their previous glory was concealed.

“As long as one gets too near, these weapons would show their might, which is very frightening.” Fu Dong felt a sense of lingering fear, his face pale. “I have seen it with my own eyes. One person was very confident in his own strength, and wanted to forcefully barge in. As a result, that damaged saber automatically slashed out, its divine light dazzling over 5000 km, and directly cut that person so badly that both his form and spirit were destroyed.”

Ling Han nodded. Without protection that was strong enough, this Celestial Tree would not last until his arrival.

“I’ll try it out,” Ling Han said to the three women.

The three women all nodded. They knew that Ling Han’s present strength was practically at the Celestial King Tier, and added with the might of the Divine Demon Sword, even a First Heaven Celestial King had been chased off. This naturally qualified him to venture in.

Fu Dong’s expression was also feverish. He, too, was filled with confidence in Ling Han. He was one of the witnesses of the battle between Ling Han and the Blue North King. Though he had not seen much of it, with his strength, he had witnessed with his own eyes how the Blue North King had fled.

Was that still not enough?

The guy that had previously been scared out of his wits revealed a cold smirk. ‘He wants to barge in and pluck the fruit? You are just seeking death!’

Peng!

He felt a sudden pain in his head, and was already sprawled down onto the ground. He flew into a rage, and hurriedly got back to his feet again. He turned and saw Hu Niu was clenching her little fist, glaring angrily at him. He was just about to flip out when a sudden chill rose up in his heart. Though he had been caught unawares, just how strong did she have to be to be able to strike him down with a single punch?

With this in mind, his fury immediately subsided like floodwaters. He once again dipped his head, and returned to being a coward.

Ling Han was completely unconcerned about this kind of trifling matter. He merely stared ahead before striding forwards.

His main goal was naturally to retrieve the celestial fruit, but the four broken weapons were also within his range of retrieval.

…Being capable of easily killing an Ascending Origin Tier, these four weapons were probably forged from Divine Metal. Though they were now damaged, they still had powerful might.

He was not interested in Celestial Tools, but Divine Metal could be swallowed by the Divine Demon Sword, and it could continue its evolution.

“Another here to commit suicide?”

“Hehe, foolish outsider.”

“He probably thinks that his strength is very great, yet has forgotten that this is the Celestial Path!”

As he passed, quite a number of people were sneering, but because they discovered that Ling Han was heading towards the Celestial Tree, they made no move to stop him. In any case, he would soon be killed, so why should they waste the effort?

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and a terrifying pressure spread out, instantly silencing all of them.

These locals all exchanged looks, and they could see the shock and even fear in each other’s expressions.

How could there possibly be such a strong person in this world? They felt as if they had been glared at by a Celestial King, and were almost scared out of their wits.

Ling Han withdrew his gaze, and continued onwards.

Weng, he had just placed a foot within the 30-meter range of the Celestial Tree, and a dazzling light immediately rose up from the ground. Multiple veined patterns appeared on the ground, and when they joined together, they formed an extremely complex seal.

Ling Han was surprised. He discovered that the environment around him had immediately changed. The ruined pillars were now complete and extremely tall; the broken walls were mended, and looked like white jade. Beautiful and ornate designs covered them, emanating a divine air. Luxuriant flowers spread out like silk, leaves as green as jade. This looked like a paradise on earth.

Ling Han knew that this was an image of this place from when it had been in its age of prosperity. Unfortunately, something had happened, and this place had become a place of ruins.

He exerted the power of Time, and attempted to trace history.

The scene changed, and the scene from eons ago truly appeared!
