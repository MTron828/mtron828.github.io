3046 Suppressing the five ultimate elites

Gasp!

Shatter Mountains couldn’t help but gasp.

A Seventh Tier’s physique was indestructible and invincible, so the flick of this finger only smashed the hand formed from the energy that was condensed by Shatter Mountains, and not his physical body. However, it was really too easy for Ling Han. With just a light flick, Ling Han already diffused his attack.

Furthermore, although his hand wasn’t injured, he felt a slight pain.

This was too terrifying.

Shatter Mountains looked at Ling Han, and couldn’t help but have an illusion of him that had faced Extermination all those years ago, and him facing Hysteria now. This was because only these two existences could cause him pain.

Would Ling Han become the second Extermination, the second Hysteria in the future?

He felt an inexplicable chill and a sense of regret.

What he regretted was that he didn’t kill Ling Han back then, or perhaps there was no need for him to become enemies with Ling Han in the first place.

Unfortunately, it was already too late.

“Old thief, why have you returned?” Ling Han asked calmly.

Shatter Mountains naturally would not lose his arrogance. He said indifferently, “Do I have to report to you when I do things?”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I have no choice. I can only send you into the Realm Battlefield again.”

“Insolence!!” Shatter Mountains roared, and raging thunder instantly appeared in the sky. He was an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier, and heaven and earth paled against his fury.

“Old man, I’ll completely suppress you today!” Ling Han charged over.

Although Shatter Mountains was very stubborn, when he saw Ling Han charging over, his first reaction was actually to turn around and run away.

Good heavens!

Upon seeing this scene, the Celestial Kings in the place of enlightenment all went numb with shock. They could only find it to be completely unbelievable.

Even someone as powerful as Shatter Mountains, an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier, actually didn’t even dare to take a single blow from Ling Han?

Ling Han let out a long howl, and was already chasing after him.

As Shatter Mountains was an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier, his speed ought to be the highest in the world, which no one could surpass.

However, a terrifying thing happened. Ling Han was rapidly closing the distance between him and Shatter Mountains.

Shatter Mountains didn’t need to turn around to sense Ling Han coming nearer to him, and he couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.

How much time had passed, and Ling Han was already going to completely crush him?

He hurried on with all his might, wanting to join forces and combine the power of the five ultimate elites to resist Ling Han together.

Even if the five of them were still unable to suppress Ling Han, he believed that if the five of them joined forces, they would at least be able to stand against Ling Han.

However, Ling Han’s speed also decreased, as if the explosive force had passed, and he was already powerless. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even so, he was still slightly faster than Shatter Mountains and was approaching step by step.

More than 10 days later, Shatter Mountains arrived at Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment.

“Chong Yan, quickly come out!” Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate howled, his voice transforming into a shock wave that could destroy heaven and earth.

Peng, peng, peng! The sound wave surged over, obliterating everything in its path.

Just as it was about to smash into the place of enlightenment, a large hand shot out with a grabbing motion. Peng! The sound wave was instantly extinguished as it surged past the large hand on both sides.

Chong Yan appeared. He stood in the sky, and couldn’t help but have his mouth agape when he saw a pitiful Shatter Mountains running toward him.

He was too shocked. A dignified Seventh Tier ultimate elite was actually in such a miserable state?

Of course, he wasn’t aware that Shatter Mountains had previously been suppressed by Ling Han and thrown into the Realm Battlefield. Otherwise, he would now understand why Shatter Mountains was in such a miserable state, not even daring to take a single blow from Ling Han.

Despite being in a state of shock, Chong Yan still hurriedly made his move. He couldn’t just watch his old friend being abused by Ling Han like a dog, right?

Seeing that Chong Yan made his move, Shatter Mountains’ confidence finally increased greatly. He also turned around and delivered a strike towards Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and threw a punch. Peng! As he fought two ultimate elites alone, tremendous force reverberated, and even the sky was torn apart. The energy of the Void turned into a waterfall that fell from an infinite height.

Chong Yan and Shatter Mountains were both sent flying. They were no match for Ling Han at all.

What?!

Chong Yan’s face was filled with disbelief. Previously, the five ultimate elites had also joined forces to resist Ling Han, and though they had similarly not been able to gain the upper hand, how could it have been such a one-sided battle?

Shatter Mountains wasn’t too shocked. After all, he had been ruthlessly trampled on by Ling Han many years ago. However, he hadn’t expected that Ling Han would be more than 10 times stronger than back then.

Despite having cultivated another four dimensions, he was still far inferior to Ling Han.

Ling Han charged over. Peng, peng, peng! He pounded on both of them randomly.

Even though Shatter Mountains and Chong Yan had joined forces, they were still far from being a match for Ling Han. Fortunately, their Seventh Tier physiques were indestructible, so even after they lost to him, they could still escape, and went on to find another Seventh Tier to deal with Ling Han together.

They found Big Dipper, but even with the three ultimate elites working together, they were still easily crushed by Ling Han. Thus, they could only continue on their way to Half Moon.

The result was the same. They were no match for him.

In the end, the four ultimate elites sought out Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather.

The five ultimate elites came together to face Ling Han once again.

Last time, they had already been thoroughly beaten up. To Seventh Tier elites, this was a great humiliation.

This time, they were full of confidence. Not only were there more dimensions, but all of them had leveled up to high-tier high-level dimensions. One of them was more than two of their previous selves.

The five of them were roughly comparable to 12 or even 13 peak-stage Seventh Tiers.

However, their confidence was actually worse than before because Ling Han had become even stronger.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Now that everyone is here, it saves me the trouble of running back and forth a few more times.”

He attacked forcefully. Boom, his battle prowess skyrocketed.

The five ultimate elites were all dumbfounded. They had thought that Ling Han was already strong enough, but now they realized that Ling Han had not used his full strength at all.

How was this possible?

Even an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier shouldn’t be this powerful, but Ling Han was only in the Sixth Tier—Sixth Tier!

“You deliberately didn’t use your full strength just now because you wanted to catch us all in one fell swoop?” Chong Yan’s face was filled with disbelief.

When had a Seventh Tier ultimate elite ever fallen to such a state?

“That’s right,” Ling Han said calmly. He began to reel in the net, intending to capture all five ultimate elites.

Chong Yan and the others resisted with all their might, but what was the use?

Back in the past, when Ling Han had encountered them, he could only have fled, and had not even dared to take on a single move. Now that Ling Han’s strength had instead reached a level where he could crush them, it became the five people’s turn to be helpless.

What made them feel better than Ling Han was that they were Seventh Tier, and their physiques were indestructible, so they did not have to worry about being killed by Ling Han.

Ling Han stacked the five ultimate elites together like a pyramid, and used a powerful force to suppress them, causing Chong Yan and the others to be unable to move.

He sat on the pile of human flesh and crossed his legs, appearing extremely relaxed.

If anyone were to witness this scene, their eyes would probably pop out of their sockets.

Those were ultimate elites of the Seventh Tier, and there were five of them.

“How should they be dealt with?” Ling Han muttered. “Should they be suppressed beneath the lavatory for an epoch, or spend an epoch at the entrance of the lavatory?”

What difference was there?

The five ultimate elites were all cursing, but being suppressed by Ling Han, they could only cry out loudly.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Answer a few of my questions. If you satisfy me, I can consider sending you to the Realm Battlefield instead.”

The five ultimate elites were silent for a moment before asking, “What do you want to know?”
