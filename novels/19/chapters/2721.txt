2722 Pursuing Heavenborn

“You guys only know how strong Lady Lin and Lord Xin are, but do you know why they are so strong?” the person from before asked calmly. His name was Zhao Fukang, and he was also a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

The grand elder of the Zhao Clan was only a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, yet was known as “one who knows all.” He had a great understanding of other Heavenly Venerates—it was mostly because he was a gossip.

“Please explain, Brother Zhao,” Lou Tianqian and the others all asked.

Zhao Fukang nodded. “Everyone knows that one would have to draw that unique power of heaven and earth to advance into the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and use this power to temper himself, and the moment you can use this power, that means that you have set foot into the First Tier of the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

!!

This was something that everyone knew, so everyone naturally did not show much of a change in expression as they continued listening to him.

“However, there are some people… whose natural talent is extraordinary. At peak-stage Ninth Heaven, or even earlier than that, they are able to draw the fundamental power of the Genesis World, and temper their physique in advance.”

“What?!”

Shock waves instantly spread through the whole crowd as everyone’s eyes immediately grew wide. They were in a state of absolute disbelief.

Wasn’t this a joke?

The path of cultivation was a process of gradual progress, just like how a Celestial King would have to cultivate advancing from one Heaven to the next. It was impossible that one could directly leap from the First Heaven to Fifth Heaven in a single stroke.

Hence, just how could being able to use the fundamental power of the Genesis World to temper one’s physique before the Ninth Heaven or even before reaching the Celestial King Tier be believed? Furthermore, these were the six great fundamental powers; that was something that even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could not possibly sense!

…If they could sense it, they would have become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

This was a mere fantasy, an absolute joke.

Zhao Fukang only smiled, and did not take everyone’s reaction to heart at all. He continued, “With some coincidental chance, added with one’s own freakish talent, it is indeed possible. Just think, using the fundamental power to temper his physique, just how strong would his power have to be?

“Though Ling Han is only at the Ninth Heaven, in essence, he is actually a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Furthermore, he is tempered by the fundamental power of the Genesis World, so his strength is even stronger than that of other Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that are on the same level.

“Unless… you, too, could take this step by using the fundamental power of the Genesis World.”

When these words fell, a dead silence fell over the whole area.

How were they supposed to defeat this kind of freak?

“However, there is no need for you guys to feel dejected, either.” Zhao Fukang’s words took a different turn. “Though Ling Han is presently very aggressive, and he can in fact still be supreme over the rest of the world even after becoming a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, there would no longer be any difference between him and other Heavenly Venerates of the same tier after advancing to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.”

At that time, everyone would have grasped one of the fundamental powers of the Genesis World, as well as that unique power of the realm, so there would naturally be no difference among them.

Everyone nodded, but very quickly shook their heads again.

Becoming a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate? That was easier said than done!

The majority of people here might not even be able to reach the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and if they did, it would be no issue for them to advance to become First Tier Heavenly Venerates, but to reach the Second Tier? If they were lucky, one out of every 10 people here could succeed.

In other words, there were at least 90% of them that would be eternally crushed by Ling Han, and there was no hope for them to ever catch up to or surpass Ling Han.

Just the thought of it was dispiriting.

“Sigh!” Someone sighed.

“Sigh!” Even more people were sighing.

Ling Han’s name once again rang loudly through the entire barrier after this battle.

Previously, he had indeed become well-known, but everyone had thought that was because his luck was especially good, and that was why he had managed to kill over 10,000 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and made his way into the general leaderboard in a single stroke. But now, he had battled Lou Tianqian and over 20 other Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates all by himself, fighting to the point that He Yufeng did not dare to accept his challenge. Just how strong and domineering was that?

How many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates would be able to accomplish the same feat?

And when the news that Ling Han was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King spread out, everyone was even more stunned, yet a number of them also scoffed in response. Wasn’t that a joke?

This had to be a huge joke. It had to have been done by someone who was deliberately trying to push Ling Han onto a high pedestal. Another example was the matter of the rankings previously. Anyone with eyes could tell that this was the case with a single glance. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yet Ling Han was completely unconcerned about this. All he had wanted was to vent the anger accumulated on the last occasion. He Yufeng had also wanted to kill him at the time, but Ling Han would leave this debt for collection at a later time.

Whoever owed him, he ultimately would collect on their debts.

“Little Han, we can move now.” The large black dog suddenly came over.

Ling Han raised a brow. “Heavenborn left the city?”

The large black dog nodded strongly. “This day has finally come.”

Previously, he kept monitoring Heavenborn, and the moment the latter left the city, he came to find Ling Han.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han nodded.

The man and dog left the city, and did not take the Empress or invite the Rain Emperor. It was fine for the two of them to do this; this was not something that was appropriate to be widely known.

The large black dog was an expert in tracking. His head was lowered all the time along the way, his behind raised high, and he was occasionally sniffing here and there before they continued their journey.

Over 20 days later, they arrived in a canyon, and could hear sounds of battle coming from within.

They walked closer, and saw that Heavenborn was presently fighting with a snowman monster.

This snowman monster was several hundred meters high, and possessed Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess, and though Heavenborn had already advanced to the Ninth Heaven, his battle prowess had not reached the height of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier yet—or rather, he was just a little bit away from that height.

But even if he was suppressed in terms of battle prowess, this was still not a one-sided battle. This naturally was due to his physique. Even if he sustained a heavy blow, or even if a large hole had been pierced open in his gut, he would be able to immediately recover.

This was much too exhausting. If the battle continued on in this manner, there would eventually come a day when this snowman monster would die of exhaustion.

But a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was still a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. WIthout eight to 10 years, this was not even thinkable.

Ling Han naturally had no interest in waiting for so many years, and was just about to stand up and join the battle, but as he watched, Heavenborn’s body suddenly spread out, becoming over 900 meters tall. Then, it was as if Heavenborn turned into a piece of cloth as he wrapped around the giant snow monster.

Seeing this scene, Ling Han couldn’t help but stop and continue watching.

This cloth that Heavenborn had transformed into was astonishingly huge. When one had reached a cultivation level like theirs, size was actually not the key factor here. Transformation was only the matter of a single thought for them. Thus, this cloth that he had transformed into was also extraordinarily huge, wrapping around the giant snow monster in a single stroke.

The giant snow monster struggled strongly, but the toughness of Divine Metal added with Heavenborn’s own power securely bound this giant snow monster. This “cloth” very quickly wrapped tightly around the giant snow monster. Then, in a flash, Heavenborn regained his original appearance, but his stomach was now large and rounded.

This was equivalent to having devoured this giant snow monster!

This was astonishing; a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had actually swallowed a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate by force.

Tong!

Suddenly, one spot on Heavenborn’s lower abdomen stuck out. That was the strong counterattack of the giant snow monster he had swallowed. It wanted to charge out of him, but the skin of his stomach was extremely tough, and the giant snow monster was unable to blast out of his stomach.

Heavenborn grunted, and wisps of black Qi exuded from him. From the look of things, it was a little like those Celestial Kings that had been infected by Hysteria’s spiritual power, yet it was clear that he was self-aware.

Weng, weng, weng! One after another, seals appeared on his body. They surpassed Regulations, and were extremely profound and mysterious.

“This monster is quite strong. I will need at least 10,000 years to digest it,” Heavenborn mumbled. “However, if I get a few more, I will be able to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.”

“I am very sorry to inform you that you will no longer have that chance!” Ling Han said calmly.

Heavenborn immediately turned around, and demanded, “Who?”

At present, he was several hundred meters tall, so this shout was also extremely loud and resounding.
