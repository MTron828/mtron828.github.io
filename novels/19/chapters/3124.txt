3125 Dao Child!

“Thank you, Senior Brother Li,” Ling Han said, as he waved the pendant in his hand before striding off.

“Senior Brother, you’re being too petty. How can you ask for the return of something that you’ve given away?” Ling Han didn’t even turn his head. He merely laughed loudly and left.

This pendant was of great significance. If he snatched it away, it would probably be even more painful than giving Li Changdan a good beating. In fact, it would make him feel even worse than being seen naked too by others.

Because in Ling Han’s opinion, Li Changdan’s personality belonged to the cunning and reserved type. Even if he was humiliated, he could endure it, and then wait for an opportunity to take revenge, just like a venomous snake.

Therefore, Ling Han only took away the most precious thing of the other party, which would make Li Changdan’s heart ache whenever he was to think about it.

The fog surged, and it quickly covered Ling Han, disappearing him from Li Changdan’s field of vision.

“Wu!” Li Changdan cried like an injured wolf.

He had lived for 21 years. Aside from when he was very young, the moment that he started cultivating, he had become a genius that everyone had to look up to. After so many years, he was too used to enjoying the admiration of others.

But at this moment, it only took one battle, and all of his glory had vanished into thin air.

This let him know that he wasn’t as strong as he thought.

…

Ling Han placed the pendant right in front of his eyes, and examined it carefully.

This pendant was carved out of purple-colored wood. As for what type it was, Ling Han couldn’t recognize it. After all, his understanding of this world came from the optical computer, and there was no complete introduction.

Moreover, this was most likely a material from the ancient era, and had long been extinct.

The pendant looked very ancient, and yet appeared to be quite ordinary. He really couldn’t make out what was so special about it.

There were no formation patterns on it, which was beyond Ling Han’s expectations.

Then how did he break through the fog?

Ling Han discovered that holding this pendant did not have much of an effect.

Should he wear it around his neck?

However, the thread was already broken. So how could he hang it around his neck?

Ling Han thought for a moment, wiped the pendant, and then kept it close to his chest. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As expected.

Ling Han pondered whether this was really due to the need to stick it close to one’s flesh.

Not necessarily.

He wasn’t an ordinary person, but an existence that had once reigned supreme in a world.

Sticking it close to the body, was it so that it could absorb the body’s heat, or was it because there was blood circulating in his body?

‘Let’s give it a try. Becoming a master through blood bonding is also something quite common.’

He cut his finger and let the blood drip onto the pendant. Instantly, Ling Han felt his hand tremble slightly, as if something was gushing out of the pendant. It could not be seen, but it was indeed there.

The strange thing was that the blood on the pendant was completely absorbed in an instant, as if nothing had happened.

Ling Han observed it carefully, and discovered that this pendant had become even warmer. Purple qi filled the air, and it looked like a piece of jade.

The change in the pendant itself might not be obvious, but one could clearly see that the area of the mist dispelled by the pendant had increased.

This meant that the drop of blood was effective, and had indeed strengthened the pendant’s effect.

Why didn’t Li Changdan do that?

Blood bonding was a very common occurrence in the small worlds of the Genesis World, Ancient Realm, or the Celestial Realm.

Why didn’t Li Changdan give it a try?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and couldn’t help but smile. It was common in the Genesis World, but here?

Who would let himself bleed for no reason?

After all, the martial arts here had just begun to rise, and everything was still in a state of ignorance.

It didn’t matter. It was now in his hands anyway. It was none of his business if Li Changdan didn’t make any progress in his study of it.

Ling Han strode forward. The pendant was working, dispelling the fog within a few feet of him. Although this wasn’t much, it was enough for Ling Han because he had a considerable understanding of formations to begin with.

Soon, he arrived at the exit.

“Will many people be shocked to see that I’m the first to walk out?” he muttered, but his footsteps did not slow down at all. After a few dozen steps, he walked out of the great formation.

He Miaoyin was waiting at the exit. When she saw someone come out, she subconsciously thought that it was Li Changdan, so she hurriedly pounced over like a bird returning to the forest. “Changdan—”

However, she was immediately surprised to discover that this person was not Li Changdan, but the brat who had humiliated her at her birthday banquet.

Although He Miaoyin had already managed to stop in time, Ling Han still moved to the side as a gesture of giving way. It was clear that he despised her attitude.

He Miaoyin was already extremely displeased, and now she was almost angered to death.

“Senior Sister, I heard that you and Senior Brother Li are about to get engaged. Your behavior… isn’t too good, right?” Ling Han purposely acted embarrassed, as if He Miaoyin really wanted to throw herself into his arms just now.

He Miaoyin was stunned, and then she realized that Ling Han was teasing her, which caused her to almost lose control.

However, she still suppressed the anger in her heart, and said in a low voice, “Why did you come out? Where’s Senior Brother Li?”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I think I saw that Senior Brother Li. Seeing that a junior sister was in trouble and he went to help her, I came over first.”

How was this possible!

Of course, He Miaoyin wouldn’t believe it. Li Changdan knew what this competition meant. At such an important moment, how could he be so ignorant?

“You’re talking nonsense!” she snapped.

“Believe it or not, it’s up to you.” Ling Han ignored her. Sun Jianfang and the other elders of the sect had already walked over, and so did the other disciples of the sect. All of them had expressions like having seen a ghost.

It was actually Ling Han who was the first to walk out of the great formation and win first place in the audition.

In other words, he was the Dao Child of Ancient Dao Sect.

He Guan was first shocked, and then in disbelief. In the end, he calmed down, while his face turned extremely gloomy.

He was too disappointed.

In order to pressure Sun Jianfang, he had paid a huge price to get Tan Jing, Lao Feng, and Qi Wu to agree to help him, creating an excellent opportunity for Li Changdan.

In his opinion, who could be Li Changdan’s match under such conditions?

Yet it just so happened that the first person to walk out of the ancient formation was actually Ling Han.

In other words, not only had He Guan paid such a great price for nothing, he even allowed Ling Han to ascend the position and become the Ancient Dao Sect’s Dao Child, as well as the next sect master.

Trash, Li Changdan, this trash!

Sun Jianfang laughed loudly. The reason why he had agreed to confirm the candidates for the Dao Child in advance and used such a method was because he had had full confidence in Ling Han.

As expected, Ling Han did not disappoint him.

“I hereby announce that Ling Han is the Dao Child of the Ancient Dao Sect,” Sun Jianfang announced to everyone as he turned around.
