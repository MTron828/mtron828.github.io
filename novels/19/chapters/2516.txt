Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Brother Lin, we truly don’t need to worry about this brat?” Fu Yueyun asked, changing the topic back to Ling Han.

Lin Xiaoyang smiled faintly as he placed down a stone. He then said, “That brat has strong opinions, and Junior Brother Zhou has already said that we simply need to give him space to grow. There’s no need to worry about him.”

“Alright then,” Fu Yueyun said with a nod. He then continued, “I’ve set my eyes on that fire girl, and I’m planning to take her as my disciple. You guys won’t try to compete with me again, right?”

Lin Xiaoyang involuntarily laughed, saying, “No, definitely not.”

Fu Yueyun nodded in satisfaction upon hearing this. He then placed a stone in reply.

Lin Xiaoyang was slightly curious as he asked, “Brother Fu, why didn’t you choose Heavenborn?”

Fu Yueyun shook his head, and replied, “At the current stage, Heavenborn is indeed more outstanding. However, he’s the culmination and embodiment of a dimension’s willpower and essence. Even though he has a huge advantage in this sense, I predict that the Third Tier will be his limit. Moreover, that will be after heaven knows how many hundreds of epochs.”

Lin Xiaoyang raised his thumb, praising, “Brother Fu is truly thorough in analysis. My father also remarked the same thing about this person. Moreover, he has a violent and ruthless personality, so who knows how many troubles he’ll end up causing.”

“Sigh, this is a rare chance to rest in peace for a few days. In a while, we’ll have to leave the dimension to battle with Hysteria again. I truly relish these peaceful days,” Fu Yueyun said with a sigh.

Lin Xiaoyang smiled faintly, and said, “Brother Fu, there’ll eventually come a day when we dispose of Hysteria and return to our respective homes. At that time, it’ll be difficult for us to meet again.”

Right now, in order to face Hysteria, the elites from countless dimensions were gathered here. However, once Hysteria was defeated, everyone would naturally return to their own dimension. As such, it would naturally be difficult for them to meet again. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I dearly wish that this brat is as Brother Zhou says, becoming a main force in the victory against Hysteria in the future,” Fu Yueyun said as he gazed into the distance. It was as if his gaze could pierce through all matter as he observed Ling Han, who was currently challenging the Nine Deaths Formation.

Lin Xiaoyang smiled faintly as he pinched a stone in his fingers. He had always been an optimistic person.

......

***

Ling Han suddenly shivered, feeling as if he had been observed by some devastatingly powerful being. However, as he looked around, all he could see were layers of dense fog. He saw nothing else.

‘Was it just my imagination?’

He shook his head. There were definitely Heavenly Venerates in the martial academy, so perhaps there had been a Heavenly Venerate observing him just then. With their paramount power, how could the Nine Deaths Formation possibly block their vision?

Ling Han strode forward.

Whoosh!

Clouds and mist gathered before him, transforming into a leopard that viciously lunged at him.

Peng!

He obliterated it with a single punch.

“Its Vitality Index was around 5600. That’s indeed powerful enough to trouble ordinary Celestial Kings.”

In fact, ordinary Celestial Kings were already emperor tiers. After reaching the peak stage of the First Heaven, their Vitality Index would reach around 5600. Now that the formation was producing such types of opponents, it was no wonder that most Celestial Kings would face a great deal of trouble.

After all, monarch tiers were pitifully few in number.

Ling Han continued to advance. Meanwhile, the formation also continued to produce opponents to face him. Sometimes there would only be a single opponent, while at other times there might be two or even three opponents. This would greatly trouble most ordinary Celestial Kings. In fact, it might even force them to flee.

However, Ling Han could easily defeat all of them with a single punch.

It didn’t take him long to exit the land of fog. What appeared before him was a city.

This city wasn’t large, yet it was surrounded by a wall. Moreover, the city gates were also closed.

On the two sides of the city were mountains that towered into the clouds, forming a canyon that the city sat in. In fact, the city was the checkpoint that blocked this path. If one wanted to continue forward, they would have to pass this city first.

Ling Han didn’t find the sudden appearance of this city strange. Nor was he astonished by the appearance of the towering mountains. After all, he was inside a formation, so he wouldn’t be shocked even if stars and the core of the world appeared.

He arrived before the city gates, only to see that it was filled with messy scrawls and symbols. However, even though they appeared messy at first sight, upon closer analysis, these symbols immediately appeared in his mind. It was as if he didn’t need to remember them at all.

The symbols flashed chaotically, giving him a headache.

The city gates were tightly shut, and they were also decorated with a messy scrawl of symbols. It was evident that if one wanted to open the gates and enter the city, they would need to rearrange these symbols into some kind of specific character first.

This was the next test. However, Ling Han wanted to try another method.

He took a deep breath and bent his knees slightly. He then suddenly unleashed his power.

Peng!

He immediately soared up, aiming to directly jump over the city.

Crack!

Devastating arcs of lightning flashed chaotically, directly striking Ling Han from the sky and smashing him into the ground.

‘Ow, that hurt!’

Ling Han bared his teeth in pain. Even with his astonishing physique, he still felt bone-crunching pain after being struck by the lightning.

Sure enough, this city couldn’t be bypassed with such ease.

Then what about the city gates?

He immediately threw a punch.

Peng!

The city gates remained unmoving. However, the shock of the punch caused his entire arm to ache.

At this moment, Ling Han had no option but to solve the problem as required.

He retreated several steps before looking up at the city gates. Even though the symbols had all appeared in his mind just then, they wouldn’t remain there for too long. Thus, he had already forgotten all of them. This was extremely strange.

Shaaa…

There was the soft sound of footsteps, causing Ling Han to turn around. He saw the Celestial King in green dashing out from the fog. He had initially been composed and graceful, yet right now, his clothes were ripped and his body was riddled with wounds. He appeared extremely disheveled.

However, when he saw Ling Han, his expression was as if he had seen a ghost.

He had truly seen a ghost! Otherwise, how could this brat appear here? Moreover, he was even quicker than him?!

The Celestial King in green was absolutely stupefied, with his mouth slightly agape. Even though Celestial Kings were calm and composed, unblinking even if the heavens collapsed before them, he couldn’t help but lose all of his composure at this moment. In fact, he was on the verge of spitting his tongue out in shock.

This was far too strange! This was absolutely inconceivable!

“Hah, so Brother Green was still first,” someone said with a strange laugh. Ling Han looked over, only to see the Celestial King with the large head and small body making his way out of the fog. He fared no better, with his body drenched in blood. However, he was still burning with fighting spirit.

“Pu!” However, he instantly spluttered in shock upon seeing Ling Han. He wore a dumbfounded expression.

“Ah, so as it turns out, I’m third,” the Plum Blossom Celestial King said as she appeared. Her clothes were also slightly tattered, revealing some of her alluring and snow-white skin.

A thought suddenly occurred to Ling Han. These Celestial Kings always challenged this formation together, but this wasn’t to see the Plum Blossom Celestial King in her current state, was it?

Pu!

The Plum Blossom Celestial King also spluttered in shock as she stared at Ling Han with a dazed expression.

Afterward, the remaining two Celestial Kings also walked out from the fog one after the other. They also wore stupefied expressions when they saw Ling Han.

In fact, the five Celestial Kings were all sharing the same thought at this moment—they had seen a ghost!

Ling Han waved, and said, “We meet again!”

The five Celestial Kings felt as if they were in a dream. Even though Ling Han was standing right before them, they were still unable to accept and believe this.

“Friend, so you’ve actually concealed your power this well,” the Celestial King in green finally said. His voice was filled with emotion and realization.

He was the first to be shocked, so he was naturally also the first to come to his senses.

There was no other possibility. Ling Han had definitely been hiding his strength. His true cultivation was definitely at the Celestial King Tier.

“Heh, so we were all fooled!” the Celestial King with the large head said. There was slight displeasure in his voice.

This person was clearly a Celestial King, yet he purposefully acted like an amateur. Was he trying to toy with them?

“Huh? Where’s Friend Ran?” the Plum Blossom Celestial King asked as she looked around. Quite a while had passed, so why hadn’t he appeared yet?

The six of them had already challenged this formation together many times. The gap between them in strength was small, and it was usually the Celestial King in green who would reach this area first. Meanwhile, the Celestial King in black would be the fourth to reach this area.

Now, however, to say nothing of arriving fourth, he still hadn’t arrived even though the fifth person had already arrived long ago. Where was he?

Could it be?

The five Celestial Kings looked toward Ling Han in unison.
