3108 Ambush

Ling Han found a river, washed himself clean from head to toe, and then returned to the valley.

Monkey called him over, and said, “Old Sun will teach you another set of fist techniques so that your battle prowess won’t be too weak and damage Old Sun’s reputation!

“This is called the Demonic Monkey Fists. It’s a branch of the Nine Beasts Immortal Fists. It’s a secret technique inherited through Old Sun’s bloodline. It’s said that if one can fuse the complete Nine Beasts Immortal Fists, its power would be boundless!”

Being “disdained” by this Brother Monkey, Ling Han was speechless. Moreover, learning Monkey Fists from a monkey… Hmm, he felt that it was a little funny.

“Focus and calm your mind!” the monkey said solemnly. Light shone in its eyes, and it struck out many more symbols that surged into Ling Han’s mind.

These symbols turned into the form of a monkey, practicing fist techniques in Ling Han’s mind with incomparable agility.

Unknowingly, Ling Han began to learn as well, and then immersed himself in it. When enlightenment dawned on him, he fell in a trance. He was then told that four days had passed.

Four days!

So much time had actually passed?

He immediately felt an intense hunger in his stomach, and he hurriedly picked some fruits and ate them. Only after eating more than 10 fruits did he feel less hungry.

Ling Han stayed here for another three days, mainly to ask Monkey about the Monkey Fists.

Although he had basically learned this fist technique, he felt that this fist technique was incomparably profound. He could completely spend his entire life immersing himself in it.

If not for the monkey urging him to leave, and Ling Han being worried that Sun Jianfang would think that Ling Han had gone missing and send someone to look for him because he had not seen him for a long time, Ling Han would still want to stay here for much longer.

On the eighth day after entering the valley, Ling Han finally left.

‘Who was the one who suppressed Brother Monkey?’ Ling Han thought to himself as he walked.

In these three days, Monkey only guided Ling Han in cultivation, but did not say anything about himself.

Occasionally, he would say something, but he would then immediately change the topic without revealing anything specific.

Monkey warned Ling Han not to divulge anything about him to anyone, but if he really encountered any trouble, he could run to the valley to look for him. As long as he was within the range of the valley, any problem would no longer be a problem.

‘Brother Monkey is a person with a story… er, a monkey. In the past, he seemed to be all-powerful and extremely impressive. Unfortunately, he has been suppressed by someone now. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

‘How impressive. The change in heaven and earth started more than 100 years ago. If Brother Monkey was suppressed at that time, how old would he be by now?’

Although Heavenly Venerates could easily live for several epochs, that was the time within the Divine Stone. A year here was equivalent to 1,000 epochs within the Divine Stone. Based on this, everyone here was countless times older than Ling Han.

The lifespan of humans here was about 120 years. It was mainly due to the development of technology. It could treat many diseases, and offered many supplements that could extend their lifespan.

However, after the great change of heaven and earth, when one had stepped onto the path of cultivation, they would rarely fall sick. They could maintain a strong body until they were over 100 years old, but there was no breakthrough in the maximum limit of their lifespan.

Some people could live up to 150 years old, but very few of them did. For the majority, their lifespan ended up at around 100 years old.

So, Brother Monkey had really lived very long.

Ling Han crossed mountains and ridges. Although only four days had passed, his speed had become much faster, and the journey was also much easier for him now.

In the past three days, his cultivation had increased by leaps and bounds, reaching the peak of Three Meridians.

Although he hadn’t tested his strength, Ling Han estimated that his strength should have reached around 2000 kg.

It had to be known that even a peak-stage Four Meridians only had around 1750 kg of strength. Ling Han could now be compared to an average middle-stage Five Meridians.

As he walked, he suddenly felt a wave of killing intent.

His invincible power had disappeared, but the sharpness of his divine sense had not.

Shua, a person suddenly jumped out from the bushes in front of him.

Zheng Tongfeng.

He held a sword in his hand, and his face was filled with malevolence. The gaze he used to look at Ling Han was filled with killing intent.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Isn’t this Senior Brother Zheng? What, you want to bring me out to play again?”

Zheng Tongfeng almost died of anger. After returning from the casino, he went to Li Changdan to beg him to save his life. However, Li Changdan didn’t want to take on so many debts for no reason, and refused to help him pay off his debts.

The only solution was to find Ling Han and retrieve those jade seeds. Otherwise, once Zheng Tongfeng left the Ancient Dao Sect, he would definitely be eliminated by the casino.

Thus, after finding out that Ling Han had left the sect and entered deep into the mountains to train, he had laid in ambush on this path that Ling Han would definitely have to pass through.

He had finally spotted Ling Han.

Zheng Tongfeng gritted his teeth, and said, “It’s all thanks to you that I don’t even dare to step out of the sect now!”

“What are you saying?” Ling Han shook his head. “Ask yourself first. What was the purpose of bringing me to the casino back then? Do you have the right to criticize me?”

“Give me the jade seeds, and I can spare your life!” Zheng Tongfeng shouted. He actually didn’t want to kill Ling Han, mainly because he didn’t dare, because Ling Han was deeply favored by Sun Jianfang.

If Ling Han died, then Sun Jianfang would definitely investigate thoroughly. If Zheng Tongfeng was found to be responsible… he would definitely be finished.

Thus, as long as Ling Han was willing to hand over the jade seeds, and he paid some more jade seeds, he should be able to settle things with the casino.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You shot yourself in the foot, yet you act like a victim. Don’t be so disgusting!”

He strode forward, completely disregarding Zheng Tongfeng.

Zheng Tongfeng’s right hand gripped the hilt of his sword tightly. When Ling Han walked past him, he suddenly turned around, and roared, “Ling Han, you forced me to do this!”

Shua, he stabbed out with his sword, aiming straight for Ling Han’s back.

Ding!

With a crisp sound, Ling Han drew his sword just in time to block Zheng Tongfeng’s attack.

Zheng Tongfeng instantly felt his hand go numb, as if he couldn’t keep his grip on the hilt of his sword.

He could not help but be aghast. He was in the middle stage of Four Meridians, and his power was as high as 1500 kg, yet he had actually been struck by Ling Han to the point that the area between his thumb and index finger was aching. How was this possible?

“Y-you… could it be that you have some sort of rare treasure?” Zheng Tongfeng exclaimed. He knew that Sun Jianfang greatly favored Ling Han, so it was not inconceivable for him to bestow some ancient rare treasure upon Ling Han.

Otherwise, he really couldn’t imagine how a mere One Meridian could be so powerful.

“Heh.” Ling Han smiled faintly. He couldn’t be bothered to respond to a “dead person.”

A raging killing intent surged in Zheng Tongfeng’s heart. He had to obtain the jade seeds from Ling Han, or else he would not be able to pass this hurdle in front of him. Moreover, there seemed to be something extraordinary about Ling Han that made his heart race.

He would kill him, rob him, and snatch away his treasure.

His eyes were bloodshot. Although he was practicing martial arts, he was only 20 years old, after all. He hadn’t even killed many ferocious beasts. Now that he had reached the point where he was about to kill someone, it made his blood boil, and he felt a little dizzy.

“Die!” He brandished his sword, but did not attack head-on. Instead, he began to move and circled around Ling Han.

He believed that this “rare treasure” only increased Ling Han’s strength, but it was impossible for his reaction speed and speed to keep up. Thus, once he circled Ling Han a few more times, he would definitely make Ling Han panic, and thus cause him to expose a flaw in his defense.
