Chapter 2604: Interception

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

To the Yin River Celestial King, these words sounded like they were filled with mockery.

Previously, when he had moved to save Tang Yuan in Ghost King City, Ling Han had said similar words as well. In the end, Ling Han had killed Tang Yuan right in front of his eyes.

And now, Ling Han said these words yet again.

The Yin River Celestial King’s fury could not be restrained, yet he could not show the slightest bit of temper. His only wish was to save himself.

He moved out with full power, fighting for his life.

“Within 10 moves, I will take your life,” Ling Han declared coldly, his voice carrying not even the slightest sliver of emotion, yet being filled with absolute certainty.

The eyes of the Yin River Celestial King spat flames. Previously, He Yi had also said that he could defeat him in 10 strikes, and now Ling Han was saying that he would kill him in 10 moves, which filled him with incomparably fury. In the eyes of these two, was he really that weak?

He was not weak! He was not weak! He was not weak!

The Yin River Celestial King roared in rage. He struck madly, wanting to prove that he was not that weak.

One strike, two… Nine strikes, and he was left with the last move.

Pu!

A flash of sword light streaked past. Ling Han withdrew his sword, and the Yin River Celestial King stumbled. He lowered his head, looking down at his chest. A bloody hole had appeared there, and it was located at the precise position of his heart. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Divine Demon Sword had pierced one of his vital points!

The Yin River Celestial King’s expression was filled with confusion. He raised his head to look at Ling Han. He wanted to open his mouth and say something, yet could not say a single word.?Pa

, he collapsed onto the ground, signs of life rapidly leaving his body.

True enough, killed in 10 strikes!

Ling Han turned his head to look back at A’Yuan, eyes menacing. The pressure he was emanating was extremely frightening. An ordinary Fourth Heaven Celestial King would probably experience a breakdown when being the target of such eyes.

Yet A’Yuan was completely unaffected. Neither did he become shaken and lose his determination because of the death of the Yin River Celestial King. With a loud battlecry, he delivered a series of stabs with his sword. His power was still violent, and merely concentrated on attack, and not on defense, as if he was fighting for his life.

Ling Han laughed loudly. He charged out with the Divine Demon Sword, and clashed forcefully with A’Yuan.

Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.?The sound of swords clashing continued endlessly. The two of them exchanged blows, but after only about 100 strikes, the two of them clashed one more time, and the sword in A’Yuan’s hand shattered, turning into thousands of pieces.

For a non-Celestial Tool to clash head-on with the Divine Demon Sword for such a long time was something considerably extraordinary.

Ling Han’s sword stopped, halting at A’Yuan’s neck.

“Why do you not kill me?” A’Yuan asked. As long as the Divine Demon Sword continued just a slight bit further, with the destructive power of a Celestial Tool, his vital signs would be instantly extinguished.

Ling Han withdrew his sword. “I anticipate how you will mature and battle with me.”

Facing a bloodthirsty psychopath like the Yin River Celestial King, Ling Han naturally would kill him without any mercy. A’Yuan, however, could only be considered a battle-thirsty madman, and it would be a pity to kill him.

There would come a day when this kind of person could attempt to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and he deserved a better end. Even if he was to die, he should die on the battlefield against Hysteria, and not in this Celestial King Graveyard.

A’Yuan stared at Ling Han for a while, and then said, “I will definitely surpass you.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “To surpass me is not something that can be done with mere words.”

A’Yuan nodded, and withdrew his sword before striding off. He decided that he would focus wholeheartedly on polishing his sword technique in the future before he considered anything else.

Ling Han walked up the steps, but realized that Yang Xiaoling and the others had long since disappeared without a trace.

True. They had all discovered that he was “Li Long,” so how could they dare to stay behind? No matter how many lives they had, it was not enough for him to take.

Of course, that was with the exception of Zhao Shuang. He was “poisoned,” and thought that his life was still grasped in Ling Han’s hands. Naturally, he did not dare to leave.

Ling Han walked over, and patted Zhao Shuang’s shoulder. “You can go now.”

Zhao Shuang thought that he was being sarcastic, and hurriedly shook his head endlessly. “Brother Long, what are you saying now? How could I possibly betray you!” His expression was filled with loyalty.

Ling Han raised a fist. “If you still aren’t going to scram, I will crush your head into bits!”

With this threat from him, Zhao Shuang’s faced turned pale in terror. He quickly turned around and ran off. Internally, he was naturally in great panic. Without an antidote, wouldn’t that just mean death, only a few days later?

He ran for a while, and naturally did not want to just give up like this. He hurriedly returned to find Ling Han again, but what trace of Ling Han was there left?

He felt apprehensive, but after three days, he discovered no changes had taken place in his body. He was still alive and kicking by the fourth day, and finally realized that he had fallen for Ling Han’s trick.

Ling Han had already said before that he had not had any “eternal antidote.” Zhao Shuang had initially thought that was just a joke; he had not expected that it was actually a fact.

…Ling Han indeed did not have an eternal antidote, because Zhao Shuang was not poisoned at all.

Zhao Shuang was very furious as he had actually been deceived by Ling Han for more than 10,000,000 years, but upon further thought, the person he had been facing was Ling Han, the most notorious bringer of calamity of Ghost King City. To be able to spend so much time with him and still be living, wasn’t this great luck already?

With such thoughts, he immediately felt at ease. He decided that he would return to being a well-behaved second-generation young master when he returned, and never play around again.

Ling Han walked slowly, searching everywhere for caskets.

There were some caskets which already had their restrictions unraveled. There were some that had not, but the weapons inside hadn’t been taken at all. They were neither Celestial Tools nor Divine Metal. Moreover, they were damaged; who would actually want them?

Ling Han was pleased. He toured one burial chamber after another, and his spoils were really heavy.

Several days later, he had finally completed a whole tour of this tomb, and opened all the caskets. Then, he very happily came out.

He had just walked out of the large tomb. When he arrived outside, he saw that a group of people were just standing guard at the entrance. Weren’t they from Prosperous Opening City?

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and saw that one of the second-generation young masters of Ghost King City had fallen into their hands. Ling Han did not know his name. He had not even bothered to remember.

“Li Long?” He Yi walked out, his hand holding the collar of that second-generation young master.

Ling Han stood still, and asked, “How can I help you?”

“Haha!” He Yi tossed that second-generation young master into the air, and then shot out a kick at him.?Peng, that second-generation young master turned into a cannonball, careening towards Ling Han.

Ling Han sidestepped, and that second-generation young master instantly crashed into the wall behind him. The sound of bones breaking rang out in succession. He turned into a mush of flesh and blood, sliding down onto the ground.

The young master had not suffered. When He Yi had kicked him, the latter had already been killed by the terrifying force.

A great Celestial King had died in such a lowly manner.

This was the Celestial King Graveyard, where there was not much difference between Celestial Kings and stray dogs.

“Or should I call you by another name”—He Yi withdrew his foot—”Ling… Han!”

Ling Han was internally shocked. How did this person know his name?

“What do you mean?” he asked calmly.

“No need to deny it. How many people are there in this world that can battle a Seventh Heaven Celestial King while he is only a Fourth Heaven?” He Yi scoffed. “Even in the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, there is probably no other person. There is only you, a man who has such heaven-defying Body Art!”

Ling Han looked at He Yi, and then suddenly broke into a grin. “That’s right. I am indeed Ling Han!” With a thought, his appearance changed, and he regained his real appearance.

He asked calmly, “The three of you should be from the martial academy, right?”

Otherwise, it was impossible that they would know so much about him. Furthermore, the feeling that the three of them gave him was extremely strong. He Yi had even defeated the Yin River Celestial King within 10 moves. The former definitely was a prodigy of the highest tier of the martial academy.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “Looking at the three of you, it is clear that you were waiting here to intercept me. In other words, you have a grudge against me. In the martial academy, there are only a numbered few supreme monarch stars in Sixth Heaven. You… probably are Gu Heyi, right?”

“He” and “He” had a similar pronunciation, so He Yi should be Gu?Heyi1.
