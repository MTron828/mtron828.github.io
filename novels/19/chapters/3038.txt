3039 Taking down the signboards

Everyone was stunned.

A Seventh Tier ultimate elite had already made his move, but he was still unable to stop Ling Han.

Hiss, how strong was this guy?

Those who had mocked Ling Han earlier wished even more so that they could dig a hole and bury themselves. They hoped that Ling Han would never see them again. Otherwise, he would only need to casually wave his hand to blast them into smithereens.

Ling Han, on the other hand, had no intention of starting a massacre. His tolerance was not that low.

Chong Yan should be out soon.

Peng!

As expected, the Void split open, and a figure rushed out, emitting boundless fury.

It was Chong Yan.

His gaze swept over, and he had already discovered that Yan Wuyue had been killed by Ling Han. He could not help but become even more infuriated, and flames burst forth from his eyes, as if he wanted to incinerate this world.

“It’s so hot!”

“I’m burning!”

In the surroundings, all the Celestial Kings were terrified. A Seventh Tier was too powerful, and a single thought could cause the highest level of Regulations to boil. This was equivalent to the bombardment of countless Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so which Celestial King could withstand it?

Immediately, a few low-level Celestial Kings were burned to ashes, and even more Celestial Kings were doing their best to resist. However, how long could they resist?

Ling Han let out a long howl, and charged towards Chong Yan. Peng, a punch once again blasted Chong Yan into the Void.

As soon as Chong Yan disappeared from this dimension, the scorching flames instantly disappeared. This also allowed the remaining Celestial Kings to heave a long sigh of relief, and they felt a sense of relief as if they had just survived a calamity.

They all thought of how Chong Yan had completely disregarded their lives and brazenly declared war on them. On the other hand, although Ling Han was the provoker, he had saved them at the most critical moment and sent Chong Yan into the Void, sparing them the misfortune of being turned into ashes by the flames of Regulations.

Should they be grateful to Ling Han?

This made them feel very conflicted. For a moment, they didn’t know what to think.

In the air, Ling Han and Chong Yan had already begun an intense battle.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han did not unleash his full strength. After a few exchanges, he broke free from the Void, and arrived above Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment with a big stride. He reached out and grabbed, and the signboard of Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment landed in his hand.

At this moment, Chong Yan had already chased after him. He slashed out with his hand, intending to cleave Ling Han down.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Old thief, I’ll keep this lousy signboard for you. If you want it, come and chase me!”

“Impudent!” Chong Yan flew into a rage. Naturally, he didn’t hesitate, and chased after Ling Han.

Although a signboard was not valuable at all, it represented the dignity of Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan. If Ling Han were to take it, such as hanging it at the entrance of a specific latrine, wouldn’t he, Chong Yan, be infamous for 10,000 years?

Chong Yan was fearless, and his physique as a Seventh Tier ultimate elite was invincible. He did not have to worry about Ling Han digging some kind of trap for him at all.

“Brat, I’m going to cut you into pieces!” he roared. His body moved like lightning. Pa, pa, pa, pa. Space shattered wherever he passed.

Fortunately, Ling Han was flying very high, and it was unlikely that they would be able to injure anyone if space was shattered. Moreover, the dimension itself had a powerful healing ability, so it would soon be peaceful again. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ling Han flew all the way, not exchanging blows with Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan at all. One of them was in front, and the other was behind. After flying for more than 10 days, Chong Yan instantly realized that something was wrong.

Because this was where Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper was.

‘Why did this little thief come here?’

Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan’s face was filled with astonishment. Could it be that this brat wanted to provoke Big Dipper as well?

He wanted to warn Big Dipper to immediately come out so they could pincer Ling Han, but they were already at the Seventh Tier, and were currently rushing with all their might. What could be faster than them?

Even if Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan let out a long howl right now, his voice could not possibly catch up to Ling Han’s, and neither could his divine sense.

Xiu, xiu, the two of them sped off.

***

Big Dipper place of enlightenment.

At least a few hundred Celestial Kings were sitting cross-legged in the place of enlightenment. There was a ball of light moving in the sky, and it would surge from time to time, emitting a mysterious aura.

These Celestial Kings were all in the process of comprehension because this was a technique set up by Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper. As long as they comprehended even the slightest bit of it, they would be able to benefit endlessly.

“Haha, I’ve broken through!” Someone laughed loudly. Hong, thunderclouds surged, and heavenly tribulation suddenly struck.

None of the Celestial Kings dared to be careless. Even though the heavenly tribulation wouldn’t harm any innocents as long as they didn’t take the initiative to attack, none of them dared to let their guard down as they were standing at the center of this storm.

“Hmm?” Everyone felt an incomparably powerful, suffocating sensation assaulting them, making them all want to lie on the ground.

Hey, hey, hey, when did the heavenly tribulation become so powerful?

The Celestial King who was enduring the tribulation was dumbfounded. He actually had to endure such a terrifying heavenly tribulation? He couldn’t even stand steadily, so how could he endure the tribulation?

Right at this moment, a figure landed. He was dressed in a green robe, and looked elegant and unrestrained.

Ling Han made his move, and with a single move, the signboard of the Big Dipper place of enlightenment fell into his hands.

“Old thief Big Dipper, your signboard has been torn down by me. If you want to take it back, come and chase me!” He laughed loudly, and just at this moment, the first bolt of lightning from the heavenly tribulation descended.

“Scram!” Ling Han threw a punch. Peng, this bolt of lightning was immediately shattered, and the boundless power of his fist shot up heaven-defyingly, shattering even the thunderclouds.

The heavenly tribulation instantly dissipated.

“…” Everyone else.

Weng, another terrifying aura pressed down.

Chong Yan had caught up.

“Haha, come quickly, come quickly!” Ling Han let out a long cry, and his figure turned. With a single step, he instantly disappeared into the distance.

Xiu, a figure streaked past, and also flew into the sky without even a pause.

In just an instant, the mountain exploded, and a figure rushed out, emitting raging flames that seemed to want to burn the sky and boil the ground.

“Ling Han, you bastard!” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper roared furiously. He immediately leaped up and chased after Ling Han.

Chong Yan slowed down slightly and waited for Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper to catch up.

“Chong Yan, why are you also chasing this little thief?” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper asked.

Chong Yan’s face was slightly red. Could he say that he had chased after Ling Han for more than 10 days, and not only had the signboard of his place of enlightenment been torn down by Ling Han, but he had also not stopped Ling Han from continuing to tear down the signboard Big Dipper?

He changed the topic, and said, “I reckon that this little thief is going to Half Moon or Mysterious Feather.”

Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper frowned. This brat was really audacious. They hadn’t even run to settle scores with him, and he already ran over to draw new hatred?

“Humph, nothing but a mere Fifth Tier!” he said coldly.

Hong, the two ultimate elites unleashed their full strength, wanting to catch up to Ling Han. Even if they couldn’t kill this brat, they would still use him as a punching bag.

It was not impossible for two ultimate elites to join forces.

They gritted their teeth and gave chase. There was no way they would give up this time.

If even their place of enlightenment fell into the hands of others, how could they survive?

Xiu, xiu, xiu. The three great elites shuttled through the sky, causing the sky to change. Mortals only had to raise their heads to see a tear in the sky, revealing a pitch-black space.

Another 10 days or so later, Ling Han appeared in a land of frost.

This was the place of enlightenment of Heavenly Venerate Half Moon.
