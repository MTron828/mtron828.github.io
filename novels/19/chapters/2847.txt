Chapter 2848 - 2848 Raw stone lane

2848 Raw stone lane

“Anywhere is fine,” Ling Han said.

They searched for a while, and went into the largest raw stone lane nearby.

The most valuable thing here was veins of ore, and the least valuable was naturally land. Without veins of ore, it was completely worthless. Hence, every raw stone lane inside Culmination City occupied an excessively large area of land.

Once they stepped in, they saw various stones of different shapes and sizes all laid out.

!!

There were a great many people that were picking through the raw stones. There were Heavenly Venerates, and there were also Celestial Kings. After making their choice, some would pay and leave with the raw stone, while some would cut open the stone on the spot right after their purchase.

Undoubtedly, cutting open stones was an extremely exciting process. Everyone would be incredibly curious to see if there was any treasure that was hidden inside.

If a treasure was revealed, someone would immediately be bidding on the spot, especially when the treasure was a supremely valuable medicine or Heavenly Venerable Seal. That would definitely cause fierce competition, pushing the price to a frightful height.

Of course, the grade of the Great Herb and seal would determine the final price.

The group roamed as they liked, while Ling Han touched this and that stone. He would examine every raw stone he picked up for around 30 minutes, slow to the point of being annoying.

All the raw stone lanes allowed their customers to study and touch the raw stones, as long as they did not damage the raw stones. Otherwise, the customer would have to pay compensation.

At present, this belonged to the outer circle of the raw stone lane. The raw stones here did not look all that high in quality. Hence, the price would also be considerably cheaper. Every stone had the same price, but it was still as high as a piece of Divine Metal.

This was already the cheapest. If they had entered the mid-grade or high-grade area, the raw stones there would be even more expensive, and every single raw stone would be priced individually, especially in the high-grade area. The raw stones there could not be purchased with mere Divine Metal, and could only be traded for supremely valuable medicines or even Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Because of Ling Han, who was “burdening” them, their speed was naturally extraordinarily slow. The Empress naturally could not be bothered with this, and directly sat down at the sidelines, while Hu Niu had long since raced ahead of them.

Only Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing were still following Ling Han. In Ling Xi’s case, she was patient by nature, and in Fu Tianxing’s case, rather than saying that he was accompanying Ling Han, it would be more accurate to say that he was accompanying Ling Xi.

Thankfully, Ling Han was focused on exploring those raw stones for the moment. Otherwise, he would definitely be overwhelmed by great jealousy.

Scrap, scrap, scrap… This was still scrap.

Ling Han was not disappointed. This was the low-grade area. In the first place, the chances of treasure being produced would be low. If he could profit with just these few stones, his luck was really too good to be believed.

“Hehe, what is this guy doing? Does he think that he is a grandmaster of raw stone?”

“It can’t be helped. The industry of stone gambling is flourishing now, and grandmasters of raw stone are too popular. There will always be people who want to stick this label onto themselves.”

“That’s right. At present, any grandmaster or alchemy or weaponsmithing is not as popular as a grandmaster of raw stone. It is inevitable that there would be crooks mixed in with the real grandmasters, too many of them impostors.”

Behind Ling Han, there were a few young people that were conversing spiritedly, but their voices were very loud, loud enough for Ling Han to hear them clearly.

Ling Han did not have the time to be distracted; he did not care about them at all. However, Fu Tianxing turned around, and glared angrily at these young people.

…Ling Han was his master, his future father-in-law. These people were slandering Ling Han, so he naturally could not possibly just pretend he had not seen or heard it.

“What are you glaring at?” That was a group of five young people, and they all had ribbons of iridescent light surrounding them. Clearly, they were all Celestial Kings.

They were really very arrogant. It was clear that they had seen nine ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around Fu Tianxing, yet did not show the slightest bit of respect at all.

…Within this primitive dimension, Celestial Kings were really very common. First Heaven Celestial Kings were common, and so were Ninth Heavens. Added with the strict rules of Culmination City, Celestial Kings naturally needed not fear other Celestial Kings.

“No need to descend to their level,” Ling Xi said calmly. She had a quiet nature, and did not like conflict.

Fu Tianxing nodded, and proceeded to ignore these people.

“Hey, there is a great beauty.”

“That’s true, she is remarkably beautiful.”

“Pretty girl, why don’t we have a chat?”

Unexpectedly, when the five of them saw how exquisitely beautiful Ling Xi was, they actually dared to tease her.

Fu Tianxing was outraged, and was just about to make his move.

“Don’t be rash!” Ling Xi pulled him back. Culmination City strictly forbade fights—these raw stones were too weak and fragile, so if a fight really broke out, without even involving Heavenly Venerable Tier, merely a battle between Celestial Kings would be enough to cause an excessive amount of destruction.

Hence, fights were absolutely not allowed to happen in Culmination City—if a fight really broke out, then no matter how many raw stones were destroyed, one would have to pay compensation for them.

Fu Tianxing glared harshly at the five people, and made his decision. Once these five people left Culmination City, he would definitely teach them a good lesson so that they would never be so proud as to forget themselves.

“What is it? You still dare to glare at us?” These five people were truly arrogant. Seeing Fu Tianxing’s displeasure, not only did they not behave themselves in the slightest, they instead acted even more arrogant. “Do you know who we are?”

“Hehe, nothing but trash,” Fu Tianxing said calmly. He was Ling Han’s disciple, so how could his tongue not be sharp?

Moreover, with the large black dog teaching him from the sidelines, it would be stranger if he was not devious.

…Yet this was what Ling Han had personally instructed, to have Fu Tianxing study under the large black dog.

Though he very much did not want to hand over his daughter to another, there was no way he could convince his daughter otherwise. Thus, he decided to educate Fu Tianxing as much as possible, making him learn various ways of being black-hearted and shameless from the large black dog so that he would become slicker, which was more suited for survival.

Those five people were all infuriated. He actually dared to call them trash?

“Humph, just you wait. As long as you dare to come out from Culmination City, let’s see if we won’t beat you to death!” they threatened.

Fu Tianxing sneered. The person with the highest cultivation level among them was only a Fourth Heaven; they really did not know what was good for themselves. Clearly, they had some other basis for their arrogance. They had to have a powerful Heavenly Venerable Tier backing them. Otherwise, there was no way for a Celestial King to come here on their own power at all.

“Sure. I will wait for you trash.” Fu Tianxing made a sweeping gesture, meaning that he was going to sweep these trash into the garbage heap.

The five people all instantly bared their teeth. Why did this guy have such a venomous tongue?

One of them wanted to retort, yet one of the others with sharper eyes elbowed him, looking towards the entrance. “Young Master Leng is here!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Instantly, the other four people looked towards the entrance, and saw that there were two people presently walking over, an elder and a young man.

The elder had gray brows and a gray beard, quite sage-like in demeanor. He crossed his arms behind himself, an expression of pride on his face.

The young man was dressed completely in black, similarly looking very proud as well.

“Young Master Leng!” Those five young people all approached.

The young man in black robes nodded. “Come and pay your respects to Grandmaster Niu!”

The five of them exchanged looks, slightly confused, but they then immediately bowed respectfully towards the gray-haired elder. “Greetings, Grandmaster Niu.”

The gray-haired elder nodded. “Rise.” His demeanor was proud, putting on airs with his attitude.

“Grandmaster Niu?”

“Could it be that he is that slightly acclaimed stone gambling grandmaster, Niu Buqun?”

The five of them whispered among themselves.

“What do you mean by ‘slightly acclaimed’? Grandmaster Niu is a well-known stone gambling grandmaster!” that Young Master Leng hurriedly corrected them.

“Yes, yes, yes.” Those five lackeys all nodded, bowing repeatedly, completely different from how arrogantly they had previously acted.

“Young Master Leng has invited Grandmaster Niu. Could it be that he will be helping us cut open stones?” one of the lackeys asked.

“Of course!” another answered.

“Our Young Master Leng truly has a reputation, he even managed to invite Grandmaster Niu.”

“With the help of Grandmaster Niu, our gains today will definitely be amazing.”

They were all spouting words of flattery, and both Young Master Leng and Grandmaster Niu smiled at this.

“Please help, Grandmaster Niu.” Young Master Leng clasped his hands respectfully towards Niu Buqun.

Niu Buqun nodded proudly. He roamed around, assessing each and every raw stone closely. After a while, he set his eyes on a raw stone, and immediately walked over. Without caring that there was another hand that was laid on it, he stretched out his hand to take it.
