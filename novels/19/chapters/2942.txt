2943 Debate

After entering the meeting hall, Ling Han walked toward the main seats on the platform.

Thank you readers!

He was one of the five commanders, so one of these seats naturally belonged to him.

“Hold it there!” Feng Wuding suddenly said. He raised a hand, and continued, “Ling Han, your position is in question now, so you don’t have the right to sit here.”

“Oh? I don’t have the right just because you said so?” Ling Han said as he looked at Feng Wuding. “You’re nothing but a defeated opponent, so quit jabbering in front of me. Do you want to lose everything again?”

‘F*ck!’

Feng Wuding’s expression instantly became extremely colorful, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

Being defeated by Ling Han was the only stain on his reputation. Moreover, he had been stripped of his wealth by Ling Han several times, and this had hurt him to the core. Now, Ling Han was exposing these old wounds before everyone, so he was naturally both humiliated and infuriated.

“Ling Han, let’s battle! I refuse to believe that I’ll lose to you again!” he roared.

His cultivation speed was faster than Ling Han’s, so he now possessed a slight advantage over him in terms of cultivation level. As a result, he rediscovered some of his confidence.

“Come on then,” Ling Han said as he crooked a finger at him. “Whoever doesn’t dare to fight is a bastard.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Everyone was rendered speechless. They were all Heavenly Venerates, so could they try to speak in a more elegant manner? Why did they sound like hooligans?

Feng Wuding angrily stood up, and he was just about to launch an attack.

“Stop!” Xin Qihu said as he reached over to block him. “Don’t forget what our purpose is today.”

Feng Wuding’s heart jolted upon hearing this. Indeed, he had almost been led off track by Ling Han! They were trying Ling Han for colluding with the enemy today, so how had the conversation ended up so far astray?

The others also slapped their heads in realization. Ling Han’s ability to control the conversation was far too powerful, so much so that they had also been unknowingly dragged down the wrong track.

“Ling Han, what do you have to say about the current rumors?” Feng Wuding asked.

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “Don’t try to change the topic. Why don’t I have the right to sit here? Did you decide? Or was it someone else?”

“Before the investigation is complete, Ling Han is still one of the five commanders. Thus, one of these seats belongs to him!” Lin Youlian finally said. She naturally supported Ling Han.

Wu Haoyang nodded, and said, “I agree.”

“I disagree,” Feng Wuding immediately said.

“I also disagree,” Xin Qihu said.

It was two votes to two, so whom should they listen to?

Ling Han strode forward, and directly sat down on the empty seat, saying, “Since I haven’t been dismissed, I’m naturally still one of the commanders. That gives me the right to cast a vote.”

Everyone nodded in acknowledgment. Ling Han had won the first round of the power struggle.

Feng Wuding glanced at Xin Qihu, and he saw that his expression was calm and composed. It was as if he hadn’t been affected at all. Upon seeing this, he also gradually calmed down. Losing the first round didn’t matter much in the scheme of things. As long as they could prove that Ling Han was a traitor, he would ultimately become nothing more than a rat whom everyone viewed with scorn.

Commander?

He would be criticized by all, and his name would be mentioned with disdain for eternity!

“Fine. Before the trial is complete, we’ll tentatively concede that you’re still one of the five commanders,” Feng Wuding said.

However, he was feeling slightly puzzled at this moment. He was clearly more talented than Xin Qihu, and his future was also brighter, so why had he become Xin Qihu’s pawn instead? Why was he the one doing all the hard work?

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Do I need you, a defeated opponent, to concede this? Regardless of whether you concede it or not, I am me, and this won’t change a single bit.”

‘Detestable! Utterly detestable!’

Feng Wuding felt a strong urge to kill someone. He was clearly someone with powerful self-control, so why was he always enraged by Ling Han?

He took a deep breath, and said, “Ling Han, there are rumors saying that you’re a subordinate of Hysteria. Is that true?”

“These allegations are absolutely untrue,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. He completely denied the accusation.

This was nothing but a rumor, so who could prove it?

Feng Wuding faltered upon hearing this. This reply was far too casual, no? Did he want to end the trial just like that?

His voice became baleful as he said, “Then do you have any proof that you’re not Hysteria’s subordinate?”

“Then do you have any proof that I am Hysteria’s subordinate?” Ling Han retorted.

‘F*ck!’

Feng Wuding couldn’t help but falter upon hearing this. Was he the one doing the interrogation, or was he the one being interrogated?

“Ling Han, stop trying to prevaricate!” he roared.

“Prevaricate your mom!” Ling Han sneered. “Did you call me here just to mess around with me? Are you retarded? Even if I was genuinely working with Hysteria, do you think I would admit it?

“Also, I have suspicions that it’s actually you who is working with Hysteria. Do you have any proof to say otherwise?” Ling Han asked in a firm voice.

Feng Wuding immediately jumped up, and roared, “Are you trying to smear me?”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I haven’t even accused you of smearing me yet! Why are you getting all worked up?!”

“Ling! Han!” Feng Wuding spat through gritted teeth. He truly wanted to charge forward to attack him.

Looking at his seething expression, and then looking at Ling Han’s calm and composed manner, the others couldn’t help but shake their heads. Even though Feng Wuding was the Son of Destiny from the Genesis World of the last era, his mental cultivation was truly very lacking.

Ling Han laughed heartily, and said, “What, you want to fight?”

“Ling Han!” Xin Qihu finally said. “There’s no smoke without fire. Simply denying the accusation won’t resolve the issue. Moreover, if this issue isn’t resolved comprehensively, who will still dare to trust you in the future? Who will dare to battle alongside you?”

These words were far more refined, and they were standing on the side of righteousness. Thus, Ling Han definitely couldn’t brush them aside with a simple denial.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Oh? How do you want me to prove my innocence? Perhaps I’ll revert to my true form if you people refine me for a while?”

“According to the experiences of the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates who have battled against Hysteria for countless years, Hysteria possesses the ability to engulf one’s life essence. This is also why it was able to overtake everyone else and become the most powerful Seventh Tier.”

Xin Qihu looked at Ling Han, and continued, “If you also possess such an ability, then it’s clear that there’s a relationship between you and Hysteria.”

He didn’t directly accuse Ling Han of being Hysteria’s subordinate. Instead, he was trying to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was a relationship between Ling Han and Hysteria. After that, it would only be a matter of time before Ling Han was nailed onto a pillar of shame.

Comparing Xin Qihu to Feng Wuding, it was abundantly clear just how much more scheming and experienced the former was. Meanwhile, Feng Wuding appeared like nothing more than a mere child.

“Bring him over!” Xin Qihu said with a wave of his hand.

A person was immediately dragged over. Their cultivation was sealed, and they were only a measly Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

Pa!

Xin Qihu’s movements were lightning quick as he smashed the Celestial King into smithereens.

Everyone was astonished. Even though this person was only an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, which was akin to trash in their eyes, seeing them being suddenly killed in such a bloody manner was still enough to make their minds shudder.

“This Celestial King committed a great crime, so there’s no need to pity his death,” Xin Qihu said in explanation. “Everyone, carefully observe his life essence.”

They all nodded before observing the Celestial King’s life essence with their divine sense. In the next instant, expressions of shock spread across their faces.

Like in front of a thirsty horse lapping water, all the life essence was surging toward Ling Han!

Gasp!

Ling Han had the same ability as Hysteria!

Was he truly a subordinate of Hysteria?
