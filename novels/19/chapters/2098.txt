Chapter 2099: Nine-colored Yin Soul Jade

Weng, weng.

When the Yin Soul Jade crashed into the foreheads of the two women, their speed slowed down slightly. Then, the Jades sank in directly, astonishingly quick. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Both the Empress’ and Hu Niu’s body trembled, their bodies beginning to flow like glazed glass bodies of bright light as multiple seals of great dao leaped out, dazzling in their brilliance, and added with their exquisite beauty, this scene was really hair-raisingly beautiful.

Everyone naturally watched with carefree and relaxed spirits, and were even more curious exactly what grade of Yin Soul Jade these two women had stimulated.

…According to the difference of depth of the Yin Soul Jade, there were a total of 10 different grades. Ordinarily, Yin Soul Jade of five stars and above belonged to the range that only king tiers could obtain.

“They are both top-grade monarch tiers, and even if they had not succeeded the previous few times, if they compromised a bit, they would still be able to obtain a very precious Yin Soul Jade.”

“If you ask me, it’s probably nine stars.”

“En, 10 stars is not possible, so it’s probably eight or nine stars.”

“Eight stars. After all, it’s already been 5,000 years, so they must have compromised quite a few times, so there is no way that it would still be nine stars grade.”

Everyone was curious, but they were not very optimistic about the two women.

But what they did not know was that the two women were perfectionists, just like Ling Han. They naturally wanted to find the absolute best Yin Soul Jade within the range of their limits.

Right. They had been stimulating the same Yin Soul Jade throughout these five millennia, and their hard work paid off. They had succeeded.

Neither woman moved. Instead, they began to split out a portion of their spirit which they inserted into the Yin Soul Jade, which would be refined into their second divided soul.

Now this was fast. In a mere three days’ time, they had already condensed their second doppelganger, and the heavenly tribulation immediately came as promised, beginning to wreak havoc above their heads.

At first, the heavenly tribulation could see, and would absolutely not strike those that should not have been struck, but the heavenly tribulation experienced by the two women was more frightening. Lightning swept over the mountain rock and ricocheted, still carrying a very frightening might of lightning. Even the slightest contact with it would cause serious injuries, or even death.

Thus, everyone fled in panic, staying as far away from the two women as possible.

Thankfully, the two women did not want to disturb Ling Han, either. They both exited the valley before experiencing their heavenly tribulation. Otherwise, a great many people would actually not have been able to flee in time.

Half a day later, the heavenly tribulation dispersed, and the two women had successfully advanced to Yin Soul Tier.

In the first place, their aura was captivating, and now that their strength had advanced further, their might was naturally even more shocking, such that others did not even dare to look at them directly.

“Haha, Niu’s going to fight 10!” Hu Niu howled in excitement.

Meanwhile, the Empress’s eyes were set on the skies. She also had an enemy, and that was Ji Wuming!

She had always been prideful, but Ji Wuming had repeatedly beaten down on her and Ling Han, so the Empress naturally had a lot of anger built up, determined to get her own back.

As for Ling Han?

Ling Han was still sitting unmoving. He was still contesting with that king of Yin Soul Jades, but 5,000 years had already passed, and he had not had the slightest bit of progress. To a gigantic embankment, to say nothing of a small fish crashing against it 5,000 years, even 500,000,000 years could possibly have no effect at all.

Yet Ling Han still did not give up.

He knew that there was still a gap between himself and Ji Wuming. In a situation in which the latter did not have his divided soul, they still could battle to a tie. If both of them were in their strongest state, Ling Han probably wouldn’t be able to match Ji Wuming.

Then, Ling Han would have to do his utter best at every stage.

First, the divided soul that he condensed would definitely have to be the strongest. Second, he had to gain the Source Power of Earth so that the might of the Great Clash of Source Powers would be improved further.

If he couldn’t do it in 5,000 years, then he would just have to give it another 5,000 years, or 10,000 years. He definitely could not do something that he would regret for his whole life because he desired victory.

6,000 years, 7,000 years, 8,000 years… Time passed quickly, and batch after batch of new people entered into the Yin Soul Valley, but Ling Han’s legend was still continuously being spread. After all, he was just sitting there right next to the pool, so who could overlook him?

9,000 years!

Ling Han did the same thing day after day, and that was using his divine sense to crash into the Yin Soul Jade. When he himself was incredibly numb, he actually crashed head-first into it with a?weng.

Inside the Yin Soul Jade!

At first, he hadn’t even realized it, but when he thought of retreating and making another attempt, realization suddenly dawned on him.

Success!

He had f****** succeeded!

‘F*ck!’

With a move of Ling Han’s divine sense,?xiu, this Yin Soul Jade floated towards the surface of the water at a shocking speed. Merely in the blink of an eye,?splash

, it had shot out of the pool in the form of a streak of light, flying towards Ling Han’s forehead.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t dodge. There was a sliver of his divine sense inside the Jade, and that was a part of him—he naturally would not hurt himself.

“Heavens, this Yin Soul Jade, this Yin Soul Jade!”

“It’s too huge, isn’t it!”

“It’s at least 10 times the size of mine!”

“What do you mean by 10 times? It’s even more than 20 times, all right?”

“Nine-colored light flows from it, how could this be possible!”

“That’s right. Shouldn’t Yin Soul Jade only have one color?”

Those in the valley were exclaiming in shock as they grabbed their heads. This Yin Soul Jade that Ling Han had stimulated had broken through all their perceptions.

The Yin Soul Jade sank into his mind, and Ling Han did not hesitate in the slightest. He immediately began to channel the Xuanyin Source Water, which entered into this precious jade.

The Soul Fetus was formed, and was rapidly being incubated.

A short three days later, Ling Han’s body trembled, and a figure suddenly leaped out of it.

It was his Yin Soul, the second divided soul, which could also be called the Xuanyin Source Water Divided Soul.

Kuang, thunderclouds gathered densely in the skies. The heavenly tribulation had arrived, keeping up with the times.

Ling Han released a battle cry, and sped out of the valley. His heavenly tribulation.. would definitely be extremely terrifying.

As expected, a bolt of lightning struck down on him the moment he stepped out of the valley. It was like an incredibly wide divine dragon, planning to blast him to death.

Ling Han strolled idly. His strength and physique had far exceeded the level of Yin Soul, and while his heavenly tribulation was more frightening than for other Yin Souls, there was still an upper limit to its strength. After all, the heaven and earth were merciless, and considered all beings equal, so how could they deliberately make things difficult for Ling Han?

This time, he did not destroy his own Godly bones. As his cultivation level became higher and higher, it was also harder and harder to destroy his own Godly bones, and if it was merely being tempered by lightning, it would be very hard to achieve the effect of strengthening it further.

“You can use the Source Power to strengthen them.” Small Tower suddenly piped up.

Ling Han had long since gotten used to its habit of either staying mute, or giving a scare when it suddenly spoke up, so he was not surprised. He asked, “I only have four Source Powers of heaven and earth. Can I still do it?”

“The Regulations of Earth are more inclined towards defense in the first place, so if you want to boost your physique to the maximum, the Source Power of Earth must be gained,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han nodded. His Great Clash of Source Powers needed the Source Power of Earth, and now he also needed it to improve the strength of his physique, which increased the urgency of this idea.

Because he was thinking, he became absent-minded as he was dealing with the heavenly tribulation. Carelessly brandishing his fists, the bolts of lightning were sent randomly in all directions.

“Ah!” someone screamed. That was a person that had been accidentally hit by the lightning that Ling Han had blasted flying, and shouted in pain.

“Stupid brat, don’t you have eyes? Where are you hitting them?” That was actually a bright-looking and beautiful girl, who was presently frowning and glaring furiously at Ling Han. She had been slightly scraped by the aftermath left behind by the lightning. Thankfully, it was really just a slight scrape, or with her cultivation level of third severance, she would definitely have been blasted into dust.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Sorry, when I finish my heavenly tribulation, I will make amends for it.”
