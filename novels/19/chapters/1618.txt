Chapter 1619: Leaving

Swoosh!

A streak of brilliant sword light slashed through the air, illuminating the entire galaxy.

Pu!

The sword slashed down, and Zhong Badu was instantly sliced in two. Saintly blood sprayed into the surroundings and blotted out the stars.

“No!!!” Zhong Badu roared in terror. Who wasn’t afraid of death? Moreover, he was a supreme prodigy who had a limitless future before him. Thus, he had never imagined that death would befall him so soon.

His left and right hand both grabbed onto a half of his body, and tried to mend them back together.

Weng, weng, weng!

The power of time pulsated inside his body, attempting to reverse the passage of time and return him to some point in the past, thereby allowing him to avert death.

However, he had been struck by the Divine Demon Sword, and thus it was impossible for him to reverse the passage of time!

After all, he was no Celestial!

Pa!

Zhong Badu’s body exploded into pieces, causing flesh and blood to rain down on the surroundings. His divine sense had already been destroyed by the Divine Demon Sword, so it was impossible for him to revive.

Heaven and earth grieved, expressing their sorrow at the passing of a Saint.

“Aaah!!” There was a furious roar as an elite strode over from Gathered Seas Planet in a single step. He was tall and solidly built, yet his hair was already white and his appearance was already extremely old. However, the aura that radiated from him was like that of a wild demon, so formidable and imposing that no one dared to look at him directly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He was none other than the Medium Saint ancestor of the Long Tribe.

“Brat, you’re seeking death!!” the Long Tribe ancestor roared as he unleashed an explosive punch at Ling Han.

‘Hmm?’

A strange expression involuntarily spread across Ling Han’s face. Although this punch appeared extremely domineering, its destructive ability was in fact severely limited. If he faced this punch head-on, he would at most be sent flying an incredibly great distance. However, he wouldn’t suffer any severe wounds.

This old man... had intentions of covering for him!

‘Interesting! Very interesting!’

By the looks of it, it wasn’t only Long Yushan who had been against the marriage. Even the ancestor of the Long Tribe had actually been against this marriage. It was just that the Open Clouds Forbidden Land was far too powerful, meaning that the Long Tribe had no ability to reject their proposal. However, now that Ling Han had killed Zhong Badu, there was no more groom for the bride to be wed to. That being the case, how could the wedding proceed?

However, the ancestor of the Long Tribe naturally couldn’t pat Ling Han on the shoulders and congratulate him on a job well done, could he?

Thus, it was imperative that he lashed out and acted as if he were boiling with rage. He would send Ling Han flying with this punch, and then chase him for a while before giving up. He would then naturally return back to the Long tribe.

The fact that Ling Han could kill Zhong Badu signified that he already possessed the battle prowess of a Saint. Thus, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for him, a Medium Saint, to fail to catch up to him. To say nothing of Medium Saints, even Saint Kings couldn’t necessarily catch up to Small Saints.

The punch landed, and Ling Han violently spat a mouthful of blood before letting the momentum carry him, and instantly vanishing into a small black dot in the distance. This blood wasn’t his, but rather blood that he had retrieved from the Black Tower from some black dog.

“Don’t run, you wicked brat!” the ancestor of the Long Tribe roared. He unfurled a golden path as he chased after Ling Han. At the same time, he couldn’t help but praise him in his mind. This brat was truly clever, and he had instantly understood his true intentions. Not only that, but he had even cooperated with him perfectly.

If he hadn’t been so sure of the power of his own strike, he would have truly questioned whether or not his strike had actually crippled Ling Han.

He hurriedly flew after Ling Han, yet he realized that he couldn’t find him anymore.

‘Hmm?’

He was genuinely stunned this time. Was Ling Han’s truly this quick? He was so quick that even he couldn’t catch up to him?

He stopped in mid-air and pretended to scan his surroundings. This action would be recorded in his memory, and he could use it to convince the Open Clouds Forbidden Land of his actions in the future.

Anyhow, it was a pleasant surprise that Ling Han possessed such techniques. It also saved him quite a bit of acting and effort.

After scanning the surroundings, he proceeded to return to Gathered Seas Planet. A Saint had died here, and they were more so an individual who had a Saint King in their clan. Thus, this was naturally a critical event that he had to treat with utmost care.

***

Ling Han exited the Black Tower and calmly retrieved the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. He then casually flew into the distance.

This time, he wouldn’t return to Wood Figure Planet. Instead, his destination was Joint Peace Planet.

Since he had already gathered all four materials, he naturally had to return to visit the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire.

This return journey took quite a long time, requiring an entire two and a half years to complete. However, Ling Han, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and the others didn’t waste this time. With an abundant supply of alchemical pills and the Reincarnation Tree, they all used this time to raise their cultivation level.

Upon arriving on Joint Peace Planet, the Empress suddenly awoke from her deep-level cultivation.

She had succeeded!

She had cultivated 10,000,000 heavenly bodies, the pinnacle amount for Heavenly Body Tier cultivators.

Ling Han was overjoyed at this, and he couldn’t help but pick the Empress up and spin her around a few times.

He was extremely happy for the Empress. Although 10,000,000 heavenly bodies was the theoretical maximum for the Eternal River Tier, no one had ever actually reached this pinnacle before. In other words, the Empress had created history. This also signified that her future was indescribably bright and limitless.

Regarding the fact that the Empress could now strive to reach the Saint Tier, and then make love with him... this hadn’t actually crossed his mind at this moment.

Of course, he would naturally think of this after calming down from his wild excitement. Now, however, he was purely feeling happiness for the Empress.

The Empress was naturally ecstatic as well. She wrapped her arms around Ling Han’s shoulders and pressed his face into her large and soft breasts. When Ling Han finally put her down, she leaned forward slightly and pecked him on the lips.

“I’ll be able to advance to the Saint Tier soon,” she whispered into Ling Han’s ears.

A sweet fragrance wafted into Ling Han’s nose.

Ling Han was intoxicated, and he involuntarily hugged the Empress even tighter. One of his hands started to naughtily creep towards the Empress’ voluptuous breasts.

“Are you trying to seduce me?” he asked.

“Of course!” the Empress admitted without hesitation.

“You seductress!” Ling Han passionately kissed her a few times, yet didn’t dare to go any further. He was already feeling the urge to push the Empress over and make love with her with no regard for anything else. However, since he had already waited for this long, he naturally couldn’t cave in now.

A charming smile spread across the Empress’ face.

The two of them exited the Black Tower, while the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden continued to cultivate inside. She was also a step away from advancing to the Saint Tier. The inheritance from the three True Phoenixes was truly astounding.

One day passed, and they finally arrived at the Great Ling Empire.

“Your Majesty!”

“Your Majesty!”

“Your Majesty!”

The ministers of the Imperial Empire all came out to greet Ling Han and the others. Among them were his two brothers, Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing. Meanwhile, the rock golem started to run around Ling Han like a dog, an obsequious expression on its face.

Ling Han laughed loudly as he wrapped his arms around his brothers’ shoulders and walked to the palace with them.

He spent some time reminiscing with his brothers before raising the level of the rock golem. Only then did he set off for the Agriculture Enclosed Mountains, where the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire rested. He didn’t know if the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was severely wounded, or if he had been suppressed there.

In any case, the Lower Realm held a huge number of secrets that could attract the attention of even Celestial Kings—for example, the Black Tower.

Celestial Kings—these were beings who stood at the pinnacle of the Celestial Realm. Moreover, each of them had created their own cultivation techniques after studying and analyzing the cultivation techniques of the other Celestial Kings. For example, the creator of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had also absorbed the knowledge and ideas of many other Celestial Kings in the process of creating this cultivation technique.

Ling Han and the Empress arrived in the depths of the Agriculture Enclosed Mountains, and stood before the cave that radiated with an air of boundless darkness. Both of them had already reached the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, yet they were still unable to see through this profound darkness.

“I’ll tie this rope to my waist, and if I don’t return after a day, then use it to drag me out,” Ling Han said to the Empress.

The Empress nodded in reply.

They were naturally well-prepared this time. Ling Han tied the rope to his waist, and this was a rope that had been made from the silk of an Azure Cloud Spider. In other words, it was extremely strong and tough, resistant to even sharp blades.

Ling Han then strode into the darkness of the cave.
