Chapter 2315 - Suppressed instead

“You Yuan!”

“Lord You Yuan!”

“Senior Brother You Yuan!”

When they heard this Senior Brother, the members of the Angel Race all looked excited. He was a young great monarch. In the future, he would be able to sit loftily above the Nine Heavens, and look down on all life. In fact, it was even possible that he could surpass the Regulations, and become a Heavenly Venerate that looked down on the rest of the world.

In everyone’s eyes, there was no opponent that You Yuan could not deal with.

You Yuan appeared. He was an indescribably handsome man, his feathered wings snow-white with gold at the edges, and looked incredibly handsome. His hair was golden, each strand looking like it had been woven from gold, and the halo above his head was also golden in color, glowing with divine light such that he looked like a god of war in golden armor.

However, his expression was very cool, as if everyone else in the world was only an ant in his eyes. He was completely emotionless.

He looked at Ling Han, and did not repeat the mistakes that others had made. He asked, “Have you come to beg for mercy?” Ling Han couldn’t help but lament ‘too bad’ secretly. This guy actually had not called him “Father.” He smiled faintly, and said, “Hehe, I saw that today was sunny and had fair weather, so I decided to have a barbeque feast here. You don’t mind, right?”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

‘To have a barbeque here? You haven’t eaten meat for three lifetimes, right?’ A mere member of the Demon Race actually dared to come into the Angel Quarters for a picnic; just how uncaring could you be?

However, everyone knew that Ling Han was only purposely saying this. In truth, he had come to crash in on them, and cause trouble for them.

In truth, Ling Han had done so. In any case, everyone was feeling very displeased. Two great beauties of their race actually betrayed them to help Ling Han, and they were extremely rare Monarch Stars at that. Anyone would be throwing up blood at that thought.

How had their delicate flowers fallen prey to a

pig?

“Then you are seeking death.” You Yuan sneered. His expression did not change in the slightest; it was like he did not know how to smile or feel anger.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. “Your expression is quite similar to that of someone else I know. You have no idea what smiling is; it can’t be that the two of you are brothers, right?”

The person he was talking about was naturally Wally, and if that guy was here, he would definitely list out proof to show just how many differences there were between him and You Yuan, and assert that the chances that the two of them were brothers was endlessly close to zero.

Meanwhile, the residents of the Angel Quarters were furious. Ling Han actually dared to tease their Monarch Star, which filled them with indignant fury. You Yuan, on the other hand, had no change in expression. He glanced at the Empress, and turned his eyes back on Ling Han. “Kneel and beg for mercy, and I can spare you.”

He had never been a merciful man. When he found out that there was an unknown relationship between Ling Han and the Empress, he had already passed the penalty of death on Ling Han. However, before Ling Han died, he wanted to cut off all thoughts that the Empress had for Ling Han.

The simplest method was to have the Empress see Ling Han’s ugliness as he knelt and begged humbly.

Ling Han naturally knew You Yuan’s thoughts well. He chuckled. “What meaning is there to waste your breath on such nonsense? Just come on, and let me see the strength of the top elite of the academy.”

You Yuan was disdainful. “A mere Eighth Lotus Second Leaf, so what if you are a Monarch Star? In front of me, you will not even withstand a single strike!”

He took a step forwards. Immediately, a frightening aura roared out like the great ocean, causing everyone to feel the urge to kneel and worship this young great monarch. Furthermore, a white lotus flower appeared on his forehead, and it had eight petals and 10 leaves!

Hiss, You Yuan was actually an Eighth Lotus Tenth Leaf already. He was really just a small step away from the true pinnacle of Eighth Lotus, and with his freakish genius, he would definitely be able to take that last step successfully. “You Yuan!” All the members of the Angel Race cheered, shaking the entire academy.

They only knew that You Yuan was very strong, but no one knew that he had actually attained this kind of height.

He was like a great mountain that they could only look up to.

The other three quarters heard the commotion, and came over to watch the excitement as well.

“What, Ba actually wants to spar with You Yuan?”

“Though he is also a Monarch Star, their cultivation levels are too far apart. There is no way that he could be his match.”

“Being able to parry two to three strikes should be his limit, right?” “Two to three strikes? Think about it, there is a total of eight minor levels separating the two of them. It will be an insta-kill. I can bet anything with you on this gamble. It will definitely be an insta-kill.”

“En, this is an undoubtable matter. One strike, and there definitely cannot be any more than that.”

“If it was Xing or Niu, they may be able to parry a few more strikes. They are Fifth Leaf Monarch Stars, after all.”

“Gods, our academy actually has four Monarch Stars! It should be known that even the top Tiger Roar Academy has just two.”

“We will definitely become the strongest academy in the future!”

Everyone chattered excitedly. They naturally did not have much optimism about Ling Han, and instead thought that the Empress and Hu Niu were stronger. And it was amidst the sounds of this discussion that Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword.

He was no idiot. With a gap of eight minor levels, he would actually challenge another Monarch Star?

He naturally had something to depend on, and it was the Divine Demon Sword.

“Come on.” Ling Han’s right hand held the sword while he beckoned You Yuan over with his left hand, his expression extremely disdainful.

You Yuan’s eyes blinked slightly. This was an omen that he was feeling killing intent.

“If you won’t make your move, fine, I’ll do it!” Ling Han released a battle cry, and charged out first. With him waving the Divine Demon Sword in a slash, a flash of Sword Qi swept out in four strikes. There was no need to even make contact. Merely the sight of them would cause a stabbing pain in your eyes.

This was Divine Metal, the toughest metal in the entire world, and could also be forged into the sharpest weapon. Even if it had not been upgraded to the height of Celestial Tool, it still possessed extremely great might.

You Yuan frowned, and he actually did not dare to face it head-on as he bounced away.

It could not be helped. The Divine Demon Sword was too sharp, and he was still at the level of the Immortal Palace Tier. There was no way he could use superior power to deliver a strike from a distance that would cause the Divine Demon Sword to slip from Ling Han’s hand.

Gasp!

Everyone exclaimed in shock. At first, they had thought that Ling Han would be insta-killed by You Yuan, but now? Not only had he not been insta-killed, he had even forced You Yuan into evasion. This was completely beyond expectations.

“Just relying on the might of your treasured Tool, humph, nothing out of the ordinary.” You Yuan was not just evading. As his hands flipped and danced, multiple harsh flashes of sword light were also sweeping towards Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed, and disdainfully retorted, “It is just that your cultivation level is slightly higher than mine. If it was a battle of equal cultivation levels, without using any strong weapon, I would definitely defeat you in 100 moves!”

“Arrogance!” You Yuan humped coldly, not even deigning to refute.

He had long since become an invincible Monarch Star. There was no need for him to defeat Ling Han in a battle of equals to prove his own strength.

“Then you can just continue running like this!” Ling Han brandished the Divine Demon Sword. Any attack that rushed towards him would be sliced in half. Furthermore, his stamina had long since reached the level of the Ascending Origin Tier, so the speed of his attacks was astonishingly fast. There was absolutely no need for him to worry that You Yuan’s attacks would be too close together, and he would miss out on one or two of them.

In this exchange, over 100 blows were traded. Indeed, You Yuan could only sustain blows from Ling Han. It was not that his strength was inferior to Ling Han’s, but rather that the sword in Ling Han’s hands was too powerful.

For an Immortal Palace Tier to possess a Celestial Tool, what kind of concept was that?

Everyone was rendered mute. Even if everyone knew that this was not because You Yuan’s strength was outmatched, they still felt their scalps go numb. When had they seen You Yuan fall into a disadvantage in a battle of equals, what more when Ling Han’s cultivation level was far inferior to his?

“Fine, I will suppress my cultivation level to battle with you!” You Yuan roared in fury. He was about to die of sullenness.
