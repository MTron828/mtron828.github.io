Chapter 2553: Falling Short

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

He Runhai was extremely pissed off.

He viewed himself as peerlessly intelligent, with even the schemes of his ancient ancestor being uncovered by him. He had more so taken advantage of this, using it to aid his own cultivation. This caused him to become extremely smug.

Now, however, he had actually been tricked by someone else. This angered him to no end.

Someone had actually outsmarted him! This was far too humiliating!

However, the large black dog had already charged over, and He Runhai had no time to mull over this anymore. He had to face his opponent with his full strength.

At the same cultivation level, supreme monarch stars could easily crush ordinary monarch tiers.

Metal chains danced in the sky, yet they were completely unable to reach this region. They couldn’t help He Runhai at all.

“I’ll smash you to bits, old geezer!” The large black dog stood upright like a human as he unleashed his full strength. He swung his paws, unleashing bursts of mighty black light that sliced through space and shook the heavens.

He Runhai had no intention of facing the large black dog head-on. Instead, he simply wanted to break free from this region. As long as he could return to the region covered by the metal chains, he would become invincible—unless a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate came over.

He tried his best to break free. However, the gulf between them in talent meant that there was also a huge difference in their battle prowess. As such, he was unable to break free.

“You actually dared to trick Grandpa Dog?” the large black dog roared in explosive rage. It had only ever been him screwing others over. Now, however, he had actually been screwed over by this person? This made him indescribably angry.

He Runhai didn’t reply. He swung his celestial broadsword, intent on breaking free.

However, Ling Han had also given the Divine Demon Sword to the large black dog beforehand. This was a clash between Celestial Tools, though the Divine Demon Sword had been fused with a great amount of Divine Metal. Thus, it was much sturdier and sharper than ordinary Celestial Tools.

In this head-on clash, He Runhai’s celestial broadsword was naturally suppressed by the Divine Demon Sword. His battle prowess was more so inferior to the large black dog’s to begin with, so his situation became increasingly precarious.

“Detestable! Utterly detestable!” He Runhai roared. He had clearly been in control of everything, yet with a sudden twist, he had now taken a grand fall.

“Unworthy descendant, if you abandon your control of the Black Gold Tree, I can save you,” the voice from the metal tree said.

This was Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate He Feng

He Runhai didn’t reply. It was because he was in control of the Black Gold Tree that he had been able to near victory. The key to this control was none other than the white stone in his palm. This was the main control mechanism.

In any case, he had never trusted anyone else. He only trusted himself.

Just then, he had also revealed his intentions to dishonor and destroy his ancestor. Once he forfeited his control of the Black Gold Tree, he would be unable to threaten He Feng any longer. At that time, this Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would be reborn, and he might even become a genuine Heavenly Venerate. When that transpired, wouldn’t killing He Runhai be as easy as the flick of a wrist?

Might He Feng forgive his descendant because of his bloodline? He Runhai completely refused to believe this.

If it were him, he would definitely kill anyone who had dared to oppose him. In fact, he would even subject them to endless torture before their death. He would do the same even if it were his son.

Not only did he have no thoughts of forfeiting his control, but he even tucked the white stone away. He was fully focused on trying to break free.

“You truly think that I’m helpless?” he said with a sneer.

As a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, how could he be a pushover? Would he not have a trump card?

With a roar, he unleashed a burst of peculiar undulations. At the same time, his battle prowess rose by a significant amount.

As was always said, as long as the gap between Celestial Kings was small, it would be impossible for one to stop another if the latter wanted to flee.

Due to his talent, the large black dog was indeed more powerful than He Runhai. However, when this was translated into cultivation levels, he was only just a minor tier above He Runhai.

With He Runhai’s sudden rise in battle prowess, the large black dog struggled to hold him back.

“Motherf*cker! You think Grandpa Dog can’t be enraged?” the large black dog roared in fury. He also activated a secret technique, causing numerous symbols to appear on his body. His battle prowess also soared.

They continued their intense battle, with the large black dog just barely managing to hold He Runhai back.

Ling Han and the Empress also stepped forward to help. Even though they were far weaker than the Ninth Heaven, their attacks were still too powerful to be ignored. After all, which Celestial King dared to face their attacks with no defenses?

They were simply responsible for drawing He Runhai’s attention, and preventing him from returning to the region covered by the metal chains.

“You people can’t stop me!” He Runhai bellowed. He charged forward with no care for anything else.

Peng! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He was struck by the large black dog’s paw, with one of his arms instantly sliced off. At the same time, Ling Han’s and the Empress’ attacks also left deep gashes on his body.

However, he successfully broke free from the large black dog’s control, dashing into the distance.

“Stop right there!” The large black dog immediately teleported over, aiming to block He Runhai.

However, He Runhai became one with his broadsword, causing his speed to increase immensely.

Wah!

He coughed up a large mouthful of Celestial King blood, successfully dashing away before the large black dog could block him.

Like a beam of light, he shot into the region covered by the metal chains.

The large black dog instantly ground to a halt. He couldn’t advance any further. Otherwise, if he entered the region of the metal chains, it would be his turn to be brutally pummeled.

He Runhai was extremely disheveled as he came to a stop. He had lost an arm, and there were also two deep wounds on his abdomen. Celestial King blood flowed without pause. However, as long as he didn’t die, these were but minor wounds that could be healed.

His expression was baleful as he glared at the large black dog, Ling Han, and the Empress. “After I ingest the United Origin Manifestation Fruit and take that critical step, it’ll be time for your deaths!”

“Pei! Grandpa Dog has finished playing with you. Goodbye!” The large black dog purposefully turned around and shook his bottom, with his iron underwear reflecting a blinding light.

He Runhai almost spat another mouthful of blood in rage. He regrew his arm and healed the wounds on his abdomen, and it was as if he had never been wounded at all. However, only he was aware of how serious his internal injuries truly were.

However, this didn’t matter. In this region, he was the invincible king.

“You people can’t escape,” he said coldly. “The path has been sealed, so without a sufficient amount of supreme monarch star blood, how can you open the gates?

“You’re all… sheep for slaughter!”

He didn’t care anymore. Once he suppressed the Imperial Void Celestial King and extracted his blood essence, the United Origin Manifestation Fruit would mature. He would then ingest this fruit and ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

At that time, he would become invincible.

The Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t resist for long. He was indeed powerful, yet he still wasn’t powerful enough to advance while being attacked by tens of thousands of metal chains at the same cultivation level. In the end, he was still suppressed, with his body wrapped in metal chains. One of the chains had more so pierced into his chest, and started to extract his blood essence.

The Imperial Void Celestial King bellowed in fury. In the Celestial Realm, he had almost been an invincible being. After arriving at the Flaming Frost Realm, however, not only did he have to bow his head and act with caution all the time, but he was even having his blood essence extracted now! Death seemed to be nigh. How could he accept this fate?

Meanwhile, Xiao Yingxiong, Ji Wuming, and the others were also moaning in pain. Their blood essence was also being drained, which caused them to become extremely feeble.

He Runhai roared with wanton laughter. Even though he had experienced a small hiccup, everything was still going to work out in the end. Everything was in his grasp.

Ling Han furrowed his brows. Perhaps he needed to retrieve his Dimension Scroll and summon heavenly tribulation?

However, if he did that, he would also be caught up.

He involuntarily recalled his question to Wally. At that time, Wally had replied with a question of his own. If the enemy had captured his lover and used her to threaten him, how would he react? Even though the Empress hadn’t been captured by He Runhai at this moment, the situation was not so different.

Ling Han immediately strengthened his resolve. For his lover, he was willing to sacrifice himself!

“Sigh!” At this moment, a long sigh suddenly traveled through the air.

This was He Feng.

Did he still want to speak? Would He Runhai listen to him?

“Unworthy descendant, do you really think everything is under your control?”
