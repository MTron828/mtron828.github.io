Chapter 3498: Foreign Affairs Department

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Yi, he had become the Department Chief?

Ling Han was surprised. This position was very lucrative.

With Chen Fengyan’s prestigious reputation, how many people would dare to oppose Ling Han when he went to various forces to demand allegiance under the banner of the Foreign Affairs Department?

Not only would they not dare to refuse, they would even use all kinds of

niceties, and offer up a great amount of treasures. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Hence, this was a lucrative job, with an astonishing amount of profit.

However, such a good task had actually fallen onto him, so just how much animosity would he attract?

Ling Han thought for a moment, then smiled.

Would he still be afraid of this?

“As you command,” Ling Han said respectfully.

The formation spirit continued, “Princess Bixiao, hear this bestowal of title.

Princess Bixiao was also taken aback. However, she hurriedly stepped out, and

said respectfully, “Bixiao is here.”

“Princess Bixiao is appointed as Deputy Department Chief to assist Ling Han,”

the Formation Spirit said.

“Bixiao obeys,” Princess Bixiao hurriedly bowed and said.

The Formation Spirit looked towards the Eldest Imperial Prince again, and

nodded, “Eldest, you have done very well.”

His tone was completely like Chen Fengyan’s.

The Eldest Imperial Prince couldn’t help but feel excited. He knelt down and said, “Thankyou for your praise, Imperial Father!”

“Work hard,” the Formation Spirit encouraged.

“Yes, Imperial Father.” The Eldest Imperial Prince kowtowed.

Even though his reward was only a word of praise from Chen Fengyan, this was the greatest affirmation. It meant that the Eldest Imperial Prince was one step closer to ascending to the throne. This was something that the Eldest Imperial

Prince valued the most.

When it came to cultivation resources and treasures, would the Imperial

Family lack them?

There were several Imperial Princes nearby, but they had hidden themselves,

so they were naturally all envious, jealous, and hateful.

Those whose strength could not reach him could only feel hatred, because even if they stepped out, they would not be a match for Wang Yu either. However, there were some people, such as the Seventh Imperial Prince, that were green with regret.

Previously, he had already lost a lot of face when he had surrendered to save his own life. Thankfully, he was not the only one who had done so. The law does not punish the masses, so he had not lost all hope. But today, the Eldest imperial Prince had been praised in public by Chen Fengyan, so there was practically no chance for him to win.

The Formation Spirit looked around again, and said calmly, “The Foreign Affairs Department only heeds the commands of His Majesty, the Holy Emperor. No one is allowed to interfere.”

Everyone was solemn. In this way, the status of the Foreign Affairs Department would be transcendent, and no one would be able to control them.

“Ling Han, the Holy Emperor has bestowed on the Foreign Affairs Department a war colossus, and three Dao Stones.” The Formation Spirit looked towards

Ling Han again.

“Thank you, Your Majesty.” Ling Han didn’t know what this war colossus was,

so he simply offered his thanks first.

The formation spirit nodded, and its body suddenly exploded, turning into countless streaks of starlight, disappearing without a trace.

Wang Yu and the others all trembled in fear. Although the formation spirit didn’t mention them at all because their level was too low, and the formation spirit didn’t even bother to pay attention to them, this didn’t mean that they were safe and sound.

Without the protection of elites of the Celestial Path, what were they worth?

Moreover, couldn’t it be seen that Celestial Path elites were all kneeling and begging for their lives?

They all knelt on the ground, begging for their lives.

Ling Han looked towards Princess Bixiao, and said with a smile, “Should we discuss the preparations for the Foreign Affairs Department, Lady Deputy Department Chief?”

Princess Bixiao was instantly angered. ‘You called me Deputy Department

Chief, so aren’t you reminding me that you are the Department Chief?1

This man was really petty!

She humphed, and said, “I don’t have time today. We’ll talk about it another

day.”

With that said, she leaped up and disappeared.

“Ling Han, work hard.” The Eldest Imperial Prince had long since stood up, and nodded at Ling Han, his expression serious.

In his eyes, everyone was just a servant of the Chen Clan.

This point was more or less the consensus of every Imperial Prince. No matter how they recruited talented people with generosity, they could not change this deeply ingrained thought in their minds.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “All right.”

The commotion ended here, and everyone dispersed. Ling Han also returned to

his room.

It wasn’t long before the chief eunuch, Zhu Qi, paid him a visit.

“Lord Zhu,” Ling Han clasped his hands and said.

Zhu Qi chuckled, “Lord Ling, there is no need to be reserved. You are presently the Department Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department. Your status is only inferior to one person, and superior to the rest.”

Ling Han was also polite, and asked, “What has Lord Zhu come for?

“Aren’t I just running around for your Foreign Affairs Department?” Zhu Qi said with a smile. “Do you think that the establishment of a department is just mere words? And that there isn’t even a workplace?”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble Lord Zhu.”

“Come, this old servant will bring you to see the Foreign Affairs Department. I don’t know if you’ll be satisfied with the place I chose,” Zhu Qi said with a smile.

The two of them went out. Zhu Qi led Ling Han to an extremely large manor, but there was no plaque hanging on the door.

“Lord Ling, if you’re satisfied, this old servant will have someone put up the plaque,” Zhu Qi said.

Ling Han was unconcerned, and nodded, “All right.’

“That’s good,” Zhu Qi said with a smile. “As for the colossus that His Majesty bestowed on you, this old servant will deliver it over tomorrow.”

Ling Han hurriedly asked, “Dare I ask, Lord Zhu, what is the use of this colossus?”

“The colossus is a puppet that is powered by formations, and uses Dao Stones as its energy source,” Zhu Qi explained, as he continued to explain to Ling Han, “Dao Stones are the condensation of the power of heaven and earth, and the solidification through great dao. They are the driving force of high-level formations.”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, even if he did not completely understand.

Zhu Qi was a busy man, and very soon, he tookhis leave. Meanwhile, Ling Han was considering whether he should move his family to this Foreign Affairs Department.

On the second day, when Ling Han arrived at the Foreign Affairs Department, he saw that Princess Bixiao had arrived even earlier than him.

It was probably Zhu Qi who had brought her here.

This manor was very big, and in the plaza of the manor, there was a massive metal statue that was forged into the shape of a golden bull. It was 27 meters long, and about 18 meters tall. It was obviously forged from metal, but every muscle seemed to be protruding, filled with a feeling of power.

This was the war colossus?

It was quite massive, but its might was unknown.

-The two Department Chiefs are here.” Zhu Qi walked out from within, and said with a smile, “Let me introduce this. This is the war colossus. When the two Department Chiefs undergo the blood recognition ceremony, you will be able to activate this thing.”

“This colossus is one star-level, and its battle prowess is equivalent to that of a Foundation Building cultivator. Its advantage is that it has high defenses and has no vital points.”

“However, the activation of the colossus requires the expenditure of Dao Stones, and His Majesty has only bestowed on you three Dao Stones. After using them, the two Department Chiefs would have to think of a way to deal with it yourselves.”

“Generally speaking, a single Dao Stone is enough for the colossus to battle continuously for three days. Thus, if you use it sparingly, you can still last for a very long time.”

“Though His Majesty has not set a specific target for the two Department Chiefs, he still hopes that the two of you can settle the trouble in our territory as soon as possible, and return a safe living environment to the people of our

Empire.”

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao both nodded, and answered solemnly. Then, they looked at this massive golden bull. This actually had battle prowess on the level of Foundation Building Tier?

Chen Fengyan was truly generous.

Zhu Qi tookhis leave. Meanwhile, Ling Han and Princess Bixiao began to discuss whether they should first proceed with the recruitment mission, or expand their numbers.

There was definitely going to be a large-scale recruitment. It could not just be the two of them with no army, but how many people they would recruit, and who they would recruit, would have to be carefully considered.

They had no need for idle people!
