Chapter 1547 Drawing jealousy

This Red Clear Fish Fruit was really not very helpful.

Those that were in true need of it did not dare eat it, and when their cultivation level reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, there was actually no further barrier ahead of them. If they cultivated a few tens of thousands to a few million years, they would definitely be capable of reaching the peak stage.

Furthermore, when one reached that step, they would have to experience the Regulations of heaven and earth. Otherwise, the number of stars could slowly be increased, but it was forever impossible for one to take the final, most crucial step and advance into the Genesis Tier.

Of course, if they had a Demon Master to support them, then that was really a true natural treasure.

“Those who need it, please take out a treasure to trade for it.” After Guang Feichen said this, he closed his mouth, his eyes sweeping over the gathered masses.

“I have a Purple Frost Pill here, which can allow a person who cultivates an Ice Element cultivation technique to increase his battle prowess by a single star for a short period,” someone spoke up.

Guang Feichen shook his head. Firstly, he was not cultivating an Ice Element cultivation technique, and secondly, a natural treasure that directly increased one’s cultivation level was far more valuable than a temporary burst of battle prowess. At least, only one pill was far from being enough.

“I have an incomplete scroll of the Life Crossing Art here. Is Brother Guang satisfied with this?” another person spoke up.

A hint of shock appeared in Guang Feichen’s expression, and he asked, “Which chapter is it?”

“The middle chapter,” the person answered.

Guang Feichen shook his head again. “Unfortunately, I do not need the middle chapter.”

But this caused everyone else to whisper among themselves. The Life Crossing Art was very famous in the Netherworld, and was said to have been left behind by a Demon Master. However, it had been lost long ago, and the presently remaining incomplete chapters were also very hard to obtain.

They could not possibly obtain a complete Demon Master technique now, but gathering all three incomplete chapters would still serve the purpose of study. This was very beneficial.

“Brother Guang, I have a piece of Level 13 Godly metal here, would you mind trading?” another person spoke up.

Guang Feichen still shook his head. He was already in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. What need did he have for Level 13 Godly metal?

Yet Ling Han took note of this person. Later, if the latter took out the Level 13 Godly metal to trade, he was determined to obtain it. He coughed, and said, “Brother Guang, I have a cup of tea here. You can take a sip first.”

He drew out a teapot, and directly extracted the water vapour from the air itself, turning it directly into a pot of water. Then, he drew out a Reincarnation Tree leaf and placed it inside. Channelling the Nine Heavens Flame, the pot of water immediately boiled, causing the medicinal effects of the Reincarnation Tree to be brought out fully.

The aroma of the tea filled the air, and just the aroma would make one feel as if they were fitting in with the great dao.

This was a leaf of the Reincarnation Tree. Even in the Celestial Realm, it was an impressive treasure. However, because its growth was stimulated by the Black Tower, the effects naturally could not possibly compare to the ancient tree that had truly grown for 12 trillion years.

Ling Han could not bear to hand over this whole pot of tea to Guang Feichen. Instead, he drew out a cup, and poured a little. Then, he filled the cup to the brim with clear water, and only then did he push it towards Guang Feichen.

The cup streaked between the two of them, passing a great many people on its course. All their eyes were bright, and they felt an urge to make a move to snatch the tea, but being wary of Guang Feichen’s well-known reputation, they suppressed this urge forcefully.

Guang Feichen accepted it. First, he took a sniff of the tea aroma, and then carefully did a sweep with his divine sense. Only after confirming that Ling Han had not tampered with it did he take a sip. Immediately, divine red clouds surged around his whole body, and it seemed as if his whole person had become abstract.

“This, this is compatibility with Dao!” The other eight big shots were all stunned, their eyes filled with envy.

Compatibility with the Dao of Heaven and Earth was something that could only be accomplished by Saints and Demon Masters, and if they could enter into that state, that meant that they had touched the doorstep that led to entering into the Demon Master Tier—though they would still be very, very far away, they at least would have a sliver of hope, and would no longer be groping around blindly.

This tea was too awesome. It was only a single leaf, and had been diffused innumerable times. If they could ***** taste it, would Genesis Tier be far off from them?

But they did not know that only drinking the Reincarnation Tea for the first time would have the best effects. In future, though it would still be helpful in comprehending Dao, it was definitely not as exaggerated as the first sip. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After a very long time, Guang Feichen finally opened his eyes, and asked, “How many tea leaves are you trading?”

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Just this one pot.”

In other words, one tea leaf in exchange for a Red Clear Fish Fruit.

If a great elite of the Celestial Realm was here, he would definitely slap Ling Han, and kill this spendthrift fool. This was practically extravagance to a terrifying extent. He was actually using a precious treasure among the Celestial Herbs to trade for a Divine Fruit.

But Ling Han did not care the slightest bit. He had many Reincarnation Tree leaves. Furthemore, what was the use of guarding a mountain of treasure? The true path to power was using this mountain of treasure to strengthen his own abilities.

Guang Feichen did not know that this was a leaf of the Reincarnation Tree. He paused for a while, and then answered, “All right, I accept the trade.”

The two of them waved their hands. One sent out the teapot, while the other sent the Red Clear Fish Fruit over, and completed the first trade of the treasure exchange this time round.

“Next, we shall go by turns.” Guang Feichen pointed randomly at one person. “We’ll start from you.”

Various types of treasures were taken out one after another, but Ling Han was only interested in increasing his cultivation level and Level 13 Godly metal, or Saintly Material from Level 17 and upwards, but it was obvious that no one could possibly take something like that out.

That was Saintly Material; it was something that not even every Saint might possess, so how could it possibly fall into their possession?

An Eternal River Tier possessing Saintly Material might not be fortunate, but would instead draw a calamity onto himself.

There were very few treasures that could increase cultivation level. It was possible that only big shots like Guang Feichen could possess one because it was useless even if he ingested it, so he could only use it in a trade. Others would definitely have used such treasures themselves.

Ling Han completely did not fear becoming the target of others. As long as he thought it might be of some use, he would trade, and there were some cultivation techniques of the Netherworld and pill recipes among those items he traded for. He would use Reincarnation Tree leaves to complete the trade. This was a treasure that no one could refuse.

Thus, Ling Han also became the biggest winner in this treasure exchange, and it was unknown how many people were already targeting him.

You were not a big shot, yet showed off such astonishing wealth. Wasn’t that equivalent to announcing publicly that you wanted to be robbed?

“Hey, hey, hey, if you go on like this, even I, this Brother Li, will not be able to restrain myself from robbing you.” Gou Li swallowed, the eyes he looked at Ling Han were the eyes of a glutton looking at a delicious feast.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “You can try, and we’ll see who will be robbing whom.”

See, he was a man of such firm principles. He never took the initiative to trifle with others, but if others trifled with him, then that was really too bad.

“Why do I feel that you are even trickier than I am?” Gou Li scratched his head.

Ling Han only smiled in response. The treasure exchange had not ended. He was also lacking only three pieces of Level 13 Godly metal before he could improve the Divine Demon Sword further.

He was not disappointed. Level 13 Godly metal was not an incredibly valuable material here. When it was his turn to participate in the exchange, he directly took out three Reincarnation Tree leaves, and said that he wanted three pieces of Level 13 Godly metal, which almost caused the others to come to blows.

He only wanted three pieces, and there were not just three people that had that kind of Godly metal here. All of them wanted to trade with Ling Han, so naturally they were glaring at each other.

Ling Han managed to successfully trade for three large pieces of Godly metal, and was overjoyed. He immediately wanted to enter into the Black Tower so that the Divine Demon Sword could complete its upgrade, but he still suppressed the urge. In any case, he had already waited so long, so what did a few more days matter?

“Damn thieves, so the two of you are here!” A delicate rebuke, and a young girl descended from the skies. Her right hand wielded a sword, the killing intent blazing in her expression as she glared at Ling Han and Gou Li.
