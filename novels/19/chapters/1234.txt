Chapter 1235: Guest Elder

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What can I do for you, Madam?” Ling Han asked in a deep voice. He did not even know who she was at this point.

Lin Yuqi smiled beautifully, and answered, “I am the shopkeeper of the Treasure Forest Pavilion.”

Ling Han was a little curious. Such a bewitching vixen whose abilities were unfathomable was actually the shopkeeper of a pharmacy? He mocked her internally, yet showed nothing in his expression, and said, “So it is Shopkeeper Lin.”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, I do not like this form of address!” Lin Yuqi shook her head, and sat down in an incredibly graceful position. Then, she crossed her legs, and rose up a long leg from the high slit in her skirt. It was slender, delicate, and as fair as ivory.

Because the inside of this carriage was furnished very lavishly, and a thick fur carpet was laid out on the floor, she did not even wear any shoes, and showed off one of her beautiful feet. Her five delicate toenails were painted bright red, contrasting sharply with the fairness of her beautiful foot. If it was someone with some unique fetish, they would definitely want to kneel down and lick that foot.

What was more fatal was that she was even lightly waving her leg, and the waves of fragrance spreading out from her caused one’s eyes to involuntarily sneak into her skirt, wanting to see even more of the beautiful scenery.

Unfortunately, they would only be able to see a little bit of a fair thigh.

“Why don’t... you call me big sister!” Lin Yuqi pursed her lips over a finger, her teeth as white as snow and her eyes hazy, causing one to be drunk on her charm.

“Madam Lin!” Ling Han was unmoved.

“Big sister Lin would work too.” Lin Yuqi possessed an indomitable tenacity. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Madam Lin!” Ling Han insisted.

Lin Yuqi couldn’t help but sigh. She had really never seen a man like this, being so cold and apathetic, which filled her with some curiosity. She knew that when a woman began to be curious about a man, it was a dangerous signal, and it was very possible that she would be lost because of that.

However, she was confident that she would definitely be able to control herself, causing him to be lost in her charms instead.

“Fine then!” Lin Yuqi finally made no further insistence on the address. “Does Little Brother Han know how much trouble you would attract after successfully concocting the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill?”

A muscle twitched in Ling Han’s cheek. This woman had not compromised in the least. What did she mean by “fine”? She no longer requested him to call her big sister, yet addressed him as “Little Brother Han”—wasn’t it the same?

He couldn’t bother to argue the point with her, as that would only get them further and further off-topic. Furthermore, this woman was obviously an expert at bringing the conversation off-topic, so he could not allow her to mislead him.

“What kind of trouble?” he asked.

“The Berserk Blood Spirit Pill can boost up a Sun Moon Tier by a sub-minor level, and has been called the Holy Pill of the Sun Moon Tier. As long as they have not reached the peak stage of the consummate level of Sun Moon Tier, they would definitely target Little Brother Han,” Lin Yuqi said sweetly, displaying her enchantment and seductiveness in front of Ling Han without the slightest care.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Since that is the case, then wouldn’t those Sun Moon Tiers be polite to me, and treat me as a respected guest?”

Lin Yuqi laughed loudly with abandon, once more allowing Ling Han’s eyes to fully enjoy the beautiful sight of her heaving curves. She shook her head, and asked, “Little Brother Han does not have any background, and the Han Lin Pavilion is only a small place, so how could it possibly intimidate them enough?”

“Once the news spreads out, it won’t take too long, and Little Brother Han should soon be captured and forced to concoct alchemical pills all day.

“Hehe, Little Brother Han doesn’t think that just because alchemists have outstanding status, they would be able to go anywhere in this world, right?”

Of course not.

The reason why alchemists had outstanding status was because the cultivators had need of them. Since this status had been given to them by cultivators, whether they recognized this kind of lofty status would also have to depend on the mood of the cultivators.

An alchemist without any background to support him was really only a “tool” that could be used to concoct alchemical pills.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Then what does Madam suggest?”

“Join the Treasure Forest Pavilion!” Lin Yuqi said, her face suddenly serious.

Previously, she had looked so seductive, looking like she wanted to entrance him to death, but then she suddenly became so formal, and was incredibly serious. This kind of difference was too big, and Ling Han was slightly unable to accept it.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Though the Treasure Forest Pavilion is a powerful force, and can reach the higher-ups, I cannot possibly leave the Han Lin Pavilion.”

Lin Yuqi broke into an entrancing smile again, and said, “I did not request that Little Brother Han leaves the Han Lin Pavilion. Since Little Brother Han can become the senior elder of the Han Lin Pavilion, why can you not multitask and be a guest elder of the Treasure Forest Pavilion as well?”

Ling Han was surprised. This was indeed a big gift.

The Treasure Forest Pavilion was indeed a massive entity, its branches spread all over the Cloud Apex Planet. Even the Crimson Flames Emperor had to give them some face. Then, with this seal of protection, what other Sun Moon Tier would dare touch a single hair on Ling Han’s head?

However, it was not that Ling Han was worried that a powerful force would truly capture him and force him to keep concocting alchemical pills, but rather thought of the Five Sects.

The Five Sects managed to survive for so many years in the Immortal Realm, and had refined the Lower Realm into the Realm Pill so many times. How could it be that there was really no one who knew about in the whole Immortal Realm? Behind them... there might be an even stronger force that was covering for them!

If Ling Han was all by himself, then after he clashed against the Five Sects, and the latter was no match for him, they would definitely seek help from the force supporting them. However, if Ling Han also drew out the seal of protection from the Treasure Forest Pavilion, then would the force behind the Five Sects still dare move?

Even if the Five Sects did not have such a force to support them, they would also have some kind of allies, wouldn’t they? The Treasure Forest Pavilion was sufficient to intimidate these people, and force them to stay out of this matter.

Not bad, not bad. This identity was very useful!

Thinking so, Ling Han nodded, and answered, “Then, I shall gladly accept. Thank you, Madam.”

Lin Yuqi smiled sweetly, then raised a single finger, and said, “However, I have one condition.”

Ling Han nodded. She naturally would not do him a big favor like this for no reason, so it was very natural that she would have conditions. He asked, “What condition?” If it was nothing too demanding, he would agree.

However, if she wanted him to “surrender himself”, that was absolutely impossible.

This condition of Lin Yuqi’s was not the slightest bit XXX. “Choose either condition. One, concoct a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill for me every 10 years, or two, teach the method of concoction to that girl, Xinyan.”

These two conditions could really not be considered simple.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then asked, “Madam can get hold of the fruits of the Red Rain Divine King Tree?” This was the crucial ingredient for concocting the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. Without this main ingredient, all other ingredients would be wasted.

“If I couldn’t, how would I possibly dare to offer such a condition?” Lin Yuqi asked, filled with confidence.

Ling Han nodded slightly, and then said, “Fine. I shall teach the method of concoction to Miss Han.”

In the case of the first condition, he would have to be tied to the Treasure Forest Pavilion for his whole life, so it would be best that he chose the second. Though teaching another to concoct an alchemical pill would require a very long period of time, it would get things done once and for all.

Moreover, he only had to copy down the pill recipe and pass it to Han Xinyan, and when she had more or less grasped it, he would take out a bit of time to guide her along. To him, the time spent would not be very long.

Yet Lin Yuqi was slightly disappointed. Ling Han’s answer had once again proved that her charms were ineffective, or he should have chosen the first condition. Then, wouldn’t he be able to see her a few more times?

‘This damn brat, I don’t believe that you won’t fall for me!’
