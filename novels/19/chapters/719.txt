Chapter 720: To Couple Hardness With Softness

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

It was easier said than done!

When Ling Han was too close, the sword would unleash even stronger might, sweeping down a sky full of sword lights. It could be seen clearly that the sword light formed a formation, which increased the destructive power.

It was difficult, very difficult to deal with.

Ling Han seemed to be facing a hedgehog, and didn’t know where to start; he would be terribly hurt no matter what.

How could it be suppressed?

Ling Han frowned. His physique sufficed, his recovery power sufficed, and he didn’t fear being hurt by the sword light. But, the problem was that he was inferior in power, and once he was too close, the formation sword shot out endless sword lights, which couldn’t be dodged at all, forcibly pushing him backwards.

It was just absolutely cheating. How could it be obtained?

Ling Han used the Eye of Truth, which was useless. The sword light was interwoven so closely that there wasn’t a shred of a crack, and even if he turned into a fly, he wouldn’t be able to fly through.

There was no solution! Completely unsolvable! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

How could it be done?

Ling Han thought of countermeasures. First, he could unleash the Heaven Transformation Bowl to absorb it directly.

However, this was inappropriate.

Not to mention whether it was absorbable or not, even if it was, Heaven Transformation Bowl’s function was to refine all things and extract their essence. After this formation sword was absorbed, Ling Han didn’t know whether it could become a divine material, but the formation patterns on it would definitely be gone.

The formation patterns were what he wanted!

Then... how about trying the demonic pattern on his left hand?

It came from the refinement of Asura Demon Emperor’s Demonic Qi, which Small Tower said contained the power of laws, and its destructive power was extremely amazing. Up till now, Ling Han still hadn’t tested out its limits. Perhaps it could eliminate the sword light.

Let’s test it out.

He charged towards the formation sword again and extended his left hand. The black demonic pattern appeared and pressed towards the sword light.

Pa , the sword light immediately shattered.

It works!

Ling Han exulted, marching straight in to collect this treasured sword, but the next moment, the sword emitted a terrifying killing intent and vein-like patterns lit up as it completely activated.

Sh*t, a fully resuscitated murderous sword is comparable to a Shattering Void Tier elite.

Now that was big trouble!

Xiu , sword light was ablaze, charging towards Ling Han. It was a murderous sword of the Shattering Void Tier!

Ling Han immediately hid in the Black Tower. He was currently completely unqualified to challenge a Shattering Void Tier elite, and the best strategy was to escape.

The formation sword lost its target and soon dimmed down.

Ling Han was extremely gloomy. The demonic patterns were also a part of him, so after he used the demonic patterns, why did the formation sword fully activate to the point of being so hostile? Unreasonable, so unreasonable; how could it be taken?

“Small Tower, what can you do?” Ling Han said.

Small Tower swayed, appearing before him, and said, “With your current abilities, it’s impossible to take that sword. The formation patterns on it are formed by this realm’s laws, and though not very complete, it’s already reached a very high level.”

“I simply used the demonic pattern, so why did this sword fully activate?” Ling Han said, puzzled.

“Because both are powers of law, so they’ll activate each other,” Small Tower answered, and then said disdainfully, “They’re all just the weakest powers of law that I can annihilate with a slight shake.”

This guy was being arrogant again.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “What use is your saying it, it can’t help me retrieve this sword!”

Small Tower paused, as if hesitating, and after a while it said, “It’s not impossible.”

“What’s the method?” Ling Han was pleasantly surprised.

Taking its time, Small Tower said, “You cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, reaching the Diamond Tier, but you’ve now only grasped the power of extreme hardness. However, the real Diamond Body is not just stubbornly hard, but it couples hardness with softness.”

“Couples hardness with softness... what do you mean?” Ling Han asked.

“Hardness can’t last long as it’s easy to break. Simply seeking the extreme of hardness isn’t the extreme of defense,” Small Tower explained. “You’ve now reached the peak of humanity in the hardness aspect, and it’s about time to walk the soft side.”

“How?” Ling Han became interested in this topic, but he was in no hurry to ask how to resolve the formation sword’s attacks.

“Didn’t you absorb Blood Sucking Origin Gold?” Small Tower suddenly said. “Blood Sucking Origin Gold is a typical example of coupling hardness with softness. It can be hard like metal and soft like fingers, and when bearing great force, it can even stretch out to offset great force and not break.”

Ling Han suddenly remembered, and said, “I once punched Jia Ming, but his neck stretched shockingly for 30 meters, dampening the power of the punch.”

“Yes, that’s coupling hardness with softness. You cultivate one side of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, reaching the Diamond Body. It’s impossible for anyone to be harder than you in the same tier. However, you still haven’t started on the soft side, so in terms of physique, you’re not invincible at the same tier,” Small Tower said.

“Then how can it be done?” Ling Han asked.

Small Tower said, “People and all living beings are made up of countless particles, and the effect of any physical art is to increase the toughness of these particles. However, if you think from another angle, the combination of the particles isn’t fixed, so why can’t it be broken?

“Countless rocks form a great wall, but they can also form a tall tower. On the assumption of having the same number of rocks and that they don’t shatter, there can be infinite transformations.

“How many particles are in a person’s body?

“Countless!

“So, your transformation is also endless. That’s the beauty of living beings, having countless possibilities, unlike treasured tools and puppets, which are fixed.”

Ling Han was instantly enlightened. Small Tower didn’t impart him any mystic arts, yet pushed open a new door for him, allowing him to look in a completely new direction.

So, the path can also go this way!

Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll’s hardness... according to what Small Tower said, it should be the strongest in the world, reflected in the particles that made up the body; this was the strongest in the same tier. However, precisely because the body was made up of countless particles, the particles themselves can’t be destroyed, but the make-up could be destroyed.

What he needed to do now was to let the particles slide continuously when he received an attack. Similar to Jia Ming, taking his punch and stretching his neck for 30 meters to neutralize the power.

Jia Ming could already control the particles in the body; this was the sign of softness.

Neither hardness nor softness could be lacking.

Without hardness, you would be flour paste no matter how soft you were and still break under slightly greater application of force. Without softness, no matter how hard the rare metal, it could still be refined, or else how were Spirit Tools made?

Coupling hardness and softness would be like Blood Sucking Origin Gold, killing people when hard, and wrapping around fingers when soft.

He fell into deep thought and looked within himself with the Eye of Truth, exploring how to control the movement of the particles in his body.

The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had related records, but it was unclear. Before, he’d never understood them, but having been instructed and guided by Small Tower, this section of the scroll finally became logical, constantly enlightening him.

He lost track of time and immersed himself in the new realization.
