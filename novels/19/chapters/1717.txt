Chapter 1718: Competing to Enrage Each Other?

“Ling Han!” a noble and dignified voice suddenly said. Ling Han looked over, only to see Mao Dai striding toward him.

Ling Han hurriedly bowed, and said, “Greetings, Lord Mao!” He was genuinely extremely thankful toward Mao Dai, as it was him who had taught him another method of severing the mundane. In Ling Han’s eyes, this was a huge favor.

However, Mao Dai was slightly displeased as he asked, “Are you truly going to join the Ding Clan?”

Mao Dai couldn’t help but feel that this was a shame. After all, he felt like even he didn’t have the right to become Ling Han’s master. However, like a bright pearl entering darkness, Ling Han was actually going to join the Ding Clan? Wasn’t this an act of self-humiliation?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I want to join the Ding Clan, yet I still have to see whether the Ding Clan is willing to accept me.”

‘What does this mean?’

Mao Dai found this reply to be extremely strange. The Ding Clan had already opened their ancestral shrine, and they were already about to carve Ling Han’s name into their family tree. As such, how could this be fake? Moreover, once Ling Han was bestowed with the surname of Ding, he would officially become a member of the Ding Clan. At that time, no one would have the ability to interfere, regardless of what the Ding Clan did to Ling Han.

They wouldn’t be in a position to interfere!

“Rest assured, Lord Mao, I’m extremely clear about what I’m doing,” Ling Han said in reassurance.

Mao Dai looked at Ling Han deeply before eventually nodding in reply. He decided that he would be an obedient spectator today.

Severing Mundane Tier grand elders from the Duan Clan and the Long Clan also walked over and tried to persuade Ling Han for one final time. Otherwise, once the ceremony began, there would be no turning back.

A junior from the Ding Clan walked over with an expression of respect, and said, “Young Master Han!”

Right now, Ling Han still had yet to officially join the Ding Clan. Thus, even if they were unwilling to, they still had to act welcoming and respectful. Regarding how they would treat him later, that was unknown. Perhaps the Ding Clan would forget about their old hostilities, or perhaps the Ding Clan would immediately kill him.

Anyhow, this would be a private matter for the Ding Clan, and it would have nothing to do with anyone else.

Ling Han remained silent as he nodded in acknowledgment. He had absolutely no good feelings toward the Ding Clan, so he couldn’t be bothered speaking any nonsense at all.

The person who had greeted him was unfazed as he said, “It’s almost time. Please follow me, Young Master Han.”

He led Ling Han into the Ding Clan. In just a short while, he would enter the ancestral shrine. This was an extremely serious ceremony, so Ling Han would naturally need to make some preparations. There was already no time for abstaining from meat or alcohol, but he could at the very least still bathe and burn some incense.

As for the other spectators and guests, the Ding Clan naturally sent members of their clan to welcome and lead them into the ancestral shrine.

Generally speaking, the addition of a measly Genesis Tier cultivator into the Ding Clan couldn’t have caught the attention of Severing Mundane Tier grand elders. However, Ling Han was far too outstanding. His battle against the Holy Son of the Black Moon Sect had ended in a draw, and his battle afterward had more so astounded everyone!

Thus, not only did grand elders from the Ding Clan attend this ceremony, but even mighty figures from the Duan Clan and the Long Clan had come. Would you look, even Mao Dai had come, hadn’t he? His status was extremely high, and he could be regarded as the number one elite among those below the fourth severance.

Ling Han followed the junior of the Ding Clan into a courtyard. Here, he took a bath before entering the main room to offer some incense and cleanse his mind.

An hour later, Ling Han changed into new clothes before opening the door and leaving.

Unexpectedly, however, it was Ding Xiaochen who was waiting for him outside.

“Ling Han!” Ding Xiaochen said through gritted teeth. He looked like he wanted to swallow Ling Han alive, and he continued, “You might have tricked the others, but you can’t trick me! You’re definitely up to no good!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I initially thought you were pig head, but who knew that you also have some imagination?”

“You’ve calculated wrong this time!” Ding Xiaochen said coldly. “Once you enter the Ding Clan, you’ll become a member of our clan when you’re alive, and a ghost of our clan when you’re dead. If the clan wants you alive, then you’ll live. If the clan wants you dead... then you can only die!”

“Are you trying to frighten me?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Your fate was already sealed the moment that you stepped into the Ding Clan!” Ding Xiaochen said with a humph. “Right now, there’s already no turning back!”

However, Ling Han remained calm as he said, “No, no, no, please don’t misunderstand. I still haven’t joined the Ding Clan yet. Moreover, in a while... Heh, I’m afraid that the Ding Clan might not agree to accept me!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You’re nothing but a measly Genesis Tier cultivator, so what trouble can you cause?” Ding Xiaochen said dismissively.

Ling Han shook his head with a sigh, and said, “Seems like I was wrong to praise you for having an imagination. Your brain capacity is far too small, and it’s probably comparable to that of cockroaches.”

“You...!!” Ding Xiaochen glowered at Ling Han in anger.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “What? You want to fight?”

Ding Xiaochen forcefully suppressed his anger. He genuinely couldn’t challenge Ling Han. Fighting against him? More like being pummeled by him!

“Follow me! It’s time to worship the ancestors!” Ding Xiaochen flicked his sleeves as he turned around to lead the way. However, he suddenly stopped after walking a few steps. This was because Ling Han wasn’t following him. He couldn’t help but snap in impatience. “Hurry up and follow me!”

“If I obeyed your orders just like that, how humiliating would that be?” Not only did Ling Han not follow Ding Xiaochen, but he even sat down instead. “Keep shouting. Anyhow, I’m in no hurry at all!”

‘Perhaps you’re in no hurry, but I’m in a great hurry!’

Ding Xiaochen was red-faced with anger. It was because he greatly detested Ling Han that he had volunteered for this task. He wanted to seize this opportunity to abuse Ling Han. However, instead of angering Ling Han, he had angered himself instead.

Moreover, if they were late, Ling Han would naturally suffer some punishment. However, would he get off any better?

If he failed to complete such a simple task, what kind of horrible impression would he leave in the elder’s minds?

“Ling Han, don’t sabotage yourself!” Ding Xiaochen was unwilling to beg Ling Han, so he could only choose to threaten him.

However, there was a hint of ridicule on Ling Han’s face as he glanced over.

It was this kind of disdain that almost drove Ding Xiaochen insane. This was far too contemptuous! It was as if he weren’t a human in Ling Han’s eyes, but rather a pile of sh*t that wasn’t deserving of a second glance!

“Ling Han!” he shouted.

Ling Han crossed his legs before picking at his ears, and saying, “If you keep barking, I’ll start to pummel you. ”

Was there anything more threatening than this?

“Ling Han, what do you want?” Ding Xiaochen asked solemnly.

Ling Han grinned, and replied, “Your words were too hurtful just then, so there’s trauma in my mind now. I suddenly don’t feel like moving.”

‘Holy sh*t! Who was angering whom just then?’

However, Ding Xiaochen didn’t dare to shout again, so he could only say, “Fine, I’ll apologize!”

“There’s no sincerity!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head.

How could he show sincerity?

Ding Xiaochen gritted his teeth, and said, “Sorry for the nonsense I uttered just then. I know you’re broad-minded, so please forgive me.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m extremely petty.”

‘F*ck!’

Ding Xiaochen rarely lost his composure. However, before Ling Han, he was always facing the risk of becoming a rabid dog who wanted to randomly bite people. He stared at Ling Han in resentment before suddenly bowing, and saying, “I’m sorry.”

“What are you sorry for?” Ling Han said with a chuckle. “Although your words were hurtful, I felt like they were fairly accurate. Sigh, people have to be upright and not submissive. Why did you submit so quickly? Where’s your backbone and courage?”

Ding Xiaochen was red-faced with anger, and flames were about to burst from his nostrils. He wanted to kill someone.

However, Ling Han suddenly stood up, and said, “What are you standing there in a daze for? Hurry up and walk! If we miss the blessed time, can you shoulder the responsibility?”

These words easily defeated Ding Xiaochen’s anger, and he could only obediently lead the way. Before Ling Han joined the Ding Clan, he had to play along with him no matter what.

At this moment, he truly wanted to slap himself in the face. Even if he wanted to exact revenge on Ling Han, it didn’t have to be today!

He had truly shot himself in the foot.
