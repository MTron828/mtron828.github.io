Chapter 412: Rain Emperor Reappears

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“Fist Emperor!”

Below, everyone cried out. That was the new housemaster of the Blood Light House, the mysterious Flower Blossom Tier elite that called himself Fist Emperor. No one knew where he came from, and yet he defeated the original Blood Light House master with his extremely domineering fist techniques, becoming a leader of one of the four large forces.

“Stand with me and kill this slaughterer!” Fist Emperor made his move, brazenly unleashing attacks towards the demonic ape.

“Hmph, overestimating your own abilities!” A Flower Blossom Tier warrior instantly snorted.

Although this Fist Emperor was certainly kickass, he was actually only at the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier.

How great of a difference was between the first layer and the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier? Moreover, the demonic ape was a king amongst beasts, and the higher the tier, the stronger a king. The demonic ape’s battle prowess was at least seven stars higher than a normal Flower Blossom Tier warrior’s—for what other reason could three warriors at the ninth layer and five at the eighth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier fail to give it a run for its money?

Besides, this demonic ape’s defensive power was astounding; with so many people joining hands, not even a single hair was sliced off it. It seemed completely hopeless.

So be it if he were at the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, but acting so loftily at the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier... wasn’t that just a joke? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The demonic ape was obviously unafraid, waving its claws towards Fist Emperor.

Hong!

The fist and the claw clashed, and the martial intent collided fiercely. Two balls of light burst forth and formed a great explosion, shooting in all directions. Peng, peng, peng, peng, countless people in the surroundings were thrown off their feet; those with weaker strength even hacked blood repeatedly, while the others were with disheveled hair, appearing very disorderly.

Those Flower Blossom Tier elites revealed expressions of disbelief, each of them was shocked to the extreme.

“Fist Ray!”

“How’s it possible!?”

In the sky, the demonic ape and Fist Emperor stood in the air, separated by a thousand feet. Blood was at the corner of Fist Emperor’s mouth and traces of blood were all over his body, but the demonic ape’s claws also dripped with fresh blood. It finally sustained an injury in this battle.

Of course, Fist Emperor’s was injured more in comparison, but being able to injure the demonic ape greatly increased the morale of the masses.

It turned out that the demonic ape wasn’t invincible.

“Rain Emperor!” Ling Han muttered—this awe-inspiring Fist Emperor was Rain Emperor!

As expected of the strongest ruler since the establishment of the Rain Country, he certainly was extremely domineering. Moreover, circles of light rippled around his fist as if tangible; that was precisely fist ray condensed by Fist Qi, but its destructive power was countless times greater.

This wasn’t simply an accumulation, but a refinement on the way of the fist.

Rain Emperor was past sixty, and he originally looked around fifty. Now, advancing into the Flower Blossom Tier, he immediately gained two hundred more years of life. In theory, he was equivalent to a normal twenty-year-old, and all the functions of the body were greatly revitalized, such that even his complexion became younger.

In a few more years, would Rain Emperor become a handsome man in the twenties?

It was very much possible.

As these thoughts flashed across Ling Han’s mind, Rain Emperor already executed the Son of Heaven Fist Technique, battling fiercely with the demonic ape.

Rain Emperor had abdicated as a ruler and was not inside the Rain Country, so he couldn’t possibly use the power of the nation. However, he advanced into the Flower Blossom Tier and broke away from the confinements of mortals, connecting his body with heaven and earth. Each fist that shot out had the blessing of heaven and earth, while Son of Heaven Fist Technique was as fierce and domineering as ever.

Genius, a true genius!

Ling Han nodded. The Son of Heaven Fist Technique was only a Black Grade or Earth Grade technique in the hands of Qi Yong Ye and the others, but in the hands of Rain Emperor, it was a Heaven Grade technique, even a god tier technique; this was a fist technique he created, and as long as he forged ahead vigorously on the path of the fist, his Son of Heaven Fist Technique would continue to improve and keep up with his tier.

Given the time, Rain Emperor really could be crowned the two words “Fist Emperor,” living up to the name.

With Rain Emperor taking the front, the courage of the other Flower Blossom Tiers naturally increased greatly as they stepped forward to attack. The certainly didn’t dare to fight the demonic ape head-on, but to restrain it from the sides was more than enough.

Flower Blossom Tier elites were Flower Blossom Tier elites after all, their strength couldn’t be fabricated.

Things took a turn on the field. Before, the demonic ape had the absolute advantage, but now, both parties were tied. Rain Emperor’s dominance had to be acknowledged as he turned the battle around singlehandedly.

Even though this was all because of Rain Emperor, Rain Emperor was only at the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier. Fist Ray certainly was all-conquering, and Son of Heaven Fist Technique increased explosively in power as his tier increased, but his tier being low was ultimately a great weakness.

Rain Emperor continued to be injured by the demonic ape, and although he still fought hard, anyone could see that Rain Emperor couldn’t endure for much longer. Once Rain Emperor was a defeated, the situation would return to as it was before.

In that moment, everyone’s battle intent dropped drastically, beginning to consider retreat.

“Hahahaha, did I come late?” With a long laughter, another extremely domineering figure appeared, covered with intertwining sword lights and emitting a overbearing presence.

The World’s Second Sword, Yao Hui Yue!

He was also at the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, and at the same time a king amongst martial artists who formed at least nine flashes of Sword Qi. Moreover, he was a bright disciple of Heaven’s Sword Sect—who knew what surprising trump cards he had.

“Come fight!”

Qiang , Yao Hui Yue’s unsheathed his sword and charged unhesitatingly at the demonic ape. With a sword strike, he yelled, “Get out of my way, this is my opponent!”

This one was more arrogant than the one before; he actually wanted to fight the demonic ape alone!

If he were at the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, then there was naturally hope... If Rain Emperor reached the ninth layer, he would also have the right to fight the demonic ape, but the problem was that the difference was too great for both their tiers—neither one was the demonic ape’s opponent as the demonic ape was infinitely close to the Spiritual Infant Tier.

The demonic ape was infuriated. In its eyes, these humans were simply sheep, with at most a few wolves that could cause it some trouble. But wanting to defeat it?

Not in a million years.

It let out a great roar as its body actually cracked!

What, did it kill itself from losing its mind to anger?

Everyone very much hoped that this vicious creature would die this way, but that was obviously not realistic. Under their astounded gazes, the demonic ape started to crack open from the nape and all the way to the waist; however, no blood oozed out, and instead two demonic apes popped out!

No, no, no, not two entire demonic apes, only the upper half of the body.

Three heads and six arms!

The three demonic apes roared angrily at the same time. The sound waves were like the tide, turning into massive waves that charged at everyone.

The Flower Blossom Tier elites hurriedly went up to neutralize it; otherwise, if this tidal sound wave struck, all the Spiritual Pedestal Tier warriors would explode from the shock.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, the sound waves were dissolved by the Flower Blossom Tier elites jointly while Yao Hui Yue raised his sword and charged at the demonic ape with an imposing manner.

The demonic ape waved its arms, and with a peng , Yao Hui Yue was sent flying. The demonic ape with three heads and six arms was truly like a Spiritual Infant Tier elite, displaying its unparalleled position.
