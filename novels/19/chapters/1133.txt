Chapter 1134: Ling Han’s Reaction

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Miss, everyone’s only sparring. There’s no need to make such a fuss,” Zhang Tong said with a smile. He pressed his hand outward, and the beauty in green trembled uncontrollably as if she had been struck by a heavy pressure. She was barely able to maintain her balance.

Zhang Tong was at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, while the beauty in green was only at the early stage of the low extreme. The difference in their cultivation level was like an insurmountable gulf.

“Junior Sister!” the sturdy man cried in alarm. However, the four lackeys had already found a way to counter his battle technique and thus suppress him. That being the case, how could he help the beauty in green?

“Is this really the Majestic Heaven Sect?” someone murmured softly. “How can their disciples be so arrogant?”

“There’s nothing we can do about this. Whose fault is it that we’re not disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect? Even if the Majestic Heaven Sect wants to manage things, they’ll only manage affairs internal to the sect.”

“Sigh, I can’t bear to watch on!”

“Say, the most detestable person is actually that brat. It was clearly him who caused this matter, yet he’s standing there and watching on as if this has nothing to do with him.”

“That’s right, that brat is abominable!”

Many people directed their anger at Ling Han; they felt that he was an ungrateful wretch. Those two had clearly stepped out to help him, yet how did he react? He casually walked aside and acted as if the fight had nothing to do with him.

Ling Han naturally heard their comments. However, he simply ignored them and acted as if he hadn’t heard anything.

He wanted to gauge the potential of the sturdy man. He wanted to see whether he could find an opportunity to turn the tables on the lackeys. If he couldn’t, he would be nothing more than just a reckless brute.

“Junior Sister!” The sturdy man continued to shout. His concern for her couldn’t be more obvious.

“Senior Brother, don’t mind me!” the beauty in green said with much difficulty. She was under immense pressure, and just saying this sentence caused her breathing to become labored.

The sturdy man was enraged, and his black hair instantly stood on ends. A golden halo rose from beneath his feet before surging above his head and vanishing into the air. However, an additional 10 divine patterns materialized on his fists.

His power climbed to an incredible level.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

The four lackeys wailed in agony as they were instantly sent flying.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. He was rendered a bit speechless by the sturdy man’s actions.

He had wanted to see how the sturdy man would deal with the desperate situation. In Ling Han’s opinion, battles couldn’t be won purely through “brute strength”. However, the sturdy man had proven otherwise in this case, unleashing his brute strength to the extreme. If increasing his divine patterns by one at a time wasn’t enough, he would increase them by 10 at a time!

Doing this would definitely place a huge burden on the sturdy man. However, he appeared especially mighty at this moment, and there was almost an aura of invincibility about him.

“Release my junior sister!” the sturdy man roared. He charged toward Zhang Tong.

“Humph, what a fool!” Zhang Tong raised his arm and made a pressing action toward the sturdy man.

Weng!

His Origin Power formed into countless lengths of chains that intertwined into a net and enveloped the sturdy man.

The difference in their cultivation level was far too large. In fact, even Ling Han would be no match for a consummate level cultivator if he were suppressed back to the low extreme. Only 10-star geniuses would be able to achieve such a feat. They were freaks, and their battle prowess would be on par with the late stage of the consummate level once they advanced to the low extreme.

“Senior Brother! Senior Brother!” the beauty in green cried in alarm.

“Don’t worry, I won’t hurt him too much.” Zhang Tong chuckled, and said, “Miss, can you tell me your name now?”

The beauty in green glowered at Zhang Tong, an unyielding look on her face.

Zhang Tong wasn’t angered by her answer, or rather the lack thereof. He turned to the four lackeys who had just crawled up, and said, “Beat that person however he just beat you four.”

A sinister smile appeared on their faces, and they answered, “Understood, Young Master Tong!”

“Don’t!” The beauty in green’s expression changed drastically.

‘How can this person be so despicable?’

Zhang Tong laughed loudly, and said, “Miss, your name!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This beauty in green was clearly a young lady who had barely any life experience. Thus, he naturally had a stranglehold on her.

“I-I’m called...” The beauty in green kept her eyes wide open in an attempt to stop her tears from falling. She felt extremely vexed and angry.

“Heh!” Ling Han finally stepped forward, and said, “How can this lady’s name be revealed to such a low-life? Won’t that be an insult to this lady’s name?” He stopped the beauty in green from speaking.

Zhang Tong’s expression darkened. He had already gained full control of the situation, yet his rhythm was actually ruined by this brat. He humphed coldly, and said, “What are you four waiting for? Hurry up and kill him!”

He squinted his eyes as a malicious killing intent rose from his body.

Did they really think that he didn’t dare to kill them?

How naive! The Majestic Heaven Sect wasn’t a charity, and these people were more so not disciples of the sect. As such, their deaths would be completely meaningless!

The four lackeys had just suffered a beating at the hands of the sturdy man, and this had left them feeling ashamed and humiliated. However, the appearance of Ling Han gave them a chance to win their face back. They didn’t think that Ling Han was strong, and the four of them slowly encircled him.

“This brat is finally showing some backbone.”

“It’s useless, though. So what if he can defeat those four people? Zhang Tong’s already at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. How many people in the younger generation can defeat him?”

“Indeed. The genuine prodigies have already been accepted into the Majestic Heaven Sect. Moreover, Zhang Tong had been a key disciple back in the day, and he was also a prodigy among prodigies. When battling against those at the same cultivation level, only the seeds were able to defeat him.”

Everyone shook their heads in disappointment. The result of this battle was already decided. However, who told this brat to be so blind that he challenged Zhang Tong?

Everything would’ve been fine if he had just moved aside for Zhang Tong. It wasn’t as if he would lose a chunk of his flesh or anything.

The four lackeys each lunged over from a different direction. Their expressions were sinister, and it was clear that they all had a large amount of blood on their hands.

Ling Han shook his head. He then raised a hand and snapped his fingers.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu!

Four bursts of Sword Qi surged outward. Although he had simply formed these using his fingers, these four bursts of Sword Qi possessed a supreme might that made it feel as if heaven and earth were collapsing.

Ling Han had used the power of Regulations!

While he had been in the large tomb, he had received inspiration from the sword strike that he had needed to decipher. He had pondered over it under the Reincarnation Tree, and now that so much time had passed, he had naturally developed a deeper understanding of it gradually. Now, he only needed to snap his fingers, and his attacks would be filled with overwhelming sword intent. Not only that, but it would also contain the power of Regulations.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

There were four crisp cracks, and the heads of the four lackeys exploded at almost exactly the same moment. Their divine sense was instantly ripped to shreds.

A deathly silence fell over the surroundings.

This youth looked to be fairly gentle and easy-going, yet his attack had been incredibly resolute and deadly. In fact, he hadn’t even given the lackeys a chance to beg for their lives.

Perhaps these four lackeys were completely insignificant. However, who was Zhang Tong?

He was Yang Hao’s follower and someone who had once been a key disciple!

He could stay by Yang Hao’s side, and as a result, he could occasionally listen to lectures on the great dao given by elites. Could his battle prowess not be terrifying? Although he hadn’t reached the Sun Moon Tier yet, he was definitely one of the strongest cultivators in the Mountain River Tier.

Sigh!

Everyone shook their heads in pity. This youth was far too rash, and he had clearly not considered the consequences. Initially, he had every opportunity to protect himself. If he hadn’t gone too far, Zhang Tong wouldn’t necessarily go after him himself.

But now?

If Zhang Tong didn’t kill Ling Han, what face would he have?

“Humph! I underestimated you!” Zhang Tong said coldly. There was a piercing look in his eyes.

He had sensed Ling Han’s powerful strength the moment that he attacked. He definitely wasn’t as ordinary as he looked. However, Zhang Tong was unafraid.

He had been accepted as a key disciple before, and he had possessed a power of five—almost six—stars then. He was more so a follower of Yang Hao now, and he was thus able to listen to the explanations of dao provided by great elites. As such, his battle prowess had naturally grown even stronger.

He now possessed a battle prowess of seven stars! Who could challenge him?
