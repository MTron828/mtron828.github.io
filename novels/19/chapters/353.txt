Chapter 354: Who’s Better at Picking Up Girls

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han soon found the inn that Liu Yu Tong and the others were staying at. Coincidentally, Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan were coming down from upstairs together right at that moment. They looked like they were planning to have something to eat. It was almost noon, so the time was just right for lunch.

“Wa, two great beauties!” Yue Kai Yu instantly blew a whistle.

Ling Han rolled his eyes and said, “They have a silk veil over their faces, and you can still see that they are beauties?”

“Hehe, you should trust my eyes. Since I’ve said that they’re beauties, then they’re definitely beauties!” Yue Kai Yu patted Ling Han’s shoulder with a grin and said, “You just wait here, and let Big Brother Yu show you a few tricks to pick up a girl.”

Ling Han’s expression became a little strange, and he asked, “You want to pick the two of them up?”

“One would not be too few, and two would not be too many. Learn a bit... ai, you’re so tanned, and though you don’t look ugly, you’re still too far away from being handsome. Looks like you won’t be able to learn Big Brother Yu’s wisdom,” Yue Kai Yu said, shaking his head.

Ling Han laughed, and asked, “Aren’t you worried that you would pierce my fragile heart by saying that?”

“As a human being, the most important thing is to face up to reality. You indeed don’t look very appealing, and there is too much of a gap between the handsome, dashing looks that your Big Brother Yu has. Forget it, let’s not talk about this, you first observe the skill your Big Brother Yu has in picking up girls.” Then Yue Kai Yu took big strides towards Liu Yu Tong and the girls.

However, in a short while, he returned gloomily, looking downhearted.

“How was it? Were you rebuffed?” Ling Han glanced over and saw that Hu Niu was still waving her claws and baring her teeth at Yue Kai Yu, but when Ling Han caught her eye, the little girl couldn’t help but tilt her head and look him over.

This little girl really had terrifying instincts. After he had changed his appearance, even Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan had not noticed the slightest oddness about him, but Hu Niu seemed to have discovered something was strange about him but had yet to confirm her suspicions.

“Don’t remind me. Let’s drink, no one is going home without getting drunk!” Yue Kai Yu looked as if he had had his heart broken.

Ling Han smiled faintly and said, “Why don’t I show off a few of my tricks as well and let you see what is really the best trick to pick up a girl?”

“Ha, ha!” Yue Kai Yu naturally did not believe his words, and laughed sarcastically at him. “If you’re able to sit with them, then I’ll be convinced!”

“What’s so difficult about that?” Ling Han clapped a hand on his shoulder and said, “You go find us a table first, and wait while I go and bring them over.”

Pu!

Yue Kai Yu choked in laughter and said, “Junior Brother Han, ah, Junior Brother Han. I am very impressed with your battle prowess, but your ability at making boasts seems to be even more awesome! All right, if you can bring them over, I’ll call you Big Brother from now on!”

“That’s what you’ve said, so you better not regret it,” Ling Han said, shaking his head.

“Yes, that’s what I said. Go on then!” Yue Kai Yu looked like he was waving him off in a farewell.

Without another word, Ling Han walked towards the table that Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan were seated at, whereas Yue Kai Yu was watching from one side while looking for an empty table to sit at. Naturally, a waiter soon approached and asked for his order.

How big could the dining hall in an inn be? With a few steps, Ling Han had arrived in front of the table that Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan were sitting at.

“My two Misses, may I sit down?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan simultaneously looked displeased at this. Even if they had veiled their faces, he could still see their slender brows were wrinkled in a frown. It was not that they had never seen skirt-chasers before, but it was the first time they had seen one that was brave enough to directly sit at their table with them.

“No,” Li Si Chan said coldly.

Meanwhile, Liu Yu Tong directly stretched out a slender, jade finger and pointed in the direction of the main door. Her meaning was obvious, and that was for him to “get lost”.

Yue Kai Yu laughed loudly. He was rebuffed previously, and so naturally did not believe that Ling Han, a guy who did not look in any way outstanding and additionally was so tanned, could succeed. Otherwise, wouldn’t that imply that his charms were too inferior and that he could not measure up to even Ling Han?

Ling Han was not discouraged, he turned to Hu Niu and asked, “Little beauty, may I sit beside you?”

Hu Niu did not say another word and directly moved her behind, eking out space on what had originally been a long bench that could only accommodate one person.

Pu!

This time, it was Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan’s turn to choke. They had originally thought that even if Hu Niu did not explode, she would still ignore this stranger. They had even prepared themselves to restrain Hu Niu together so as to ensure that the little girl did not hurt anyone.

Yet they had never imagined that the little girl would have this kind of reaction.

This, this, this... had Hu Niu been bewitched?

As the two girls looked dumbstruck, Ling Han had already sat down. He knew that Hu Niu had already recognized him. He laughed and teased Hu Niu. The little girl was very cooperative, and very soon, she squeezed into his arms and acted spoiled.

Pa , Yue Kai Yu could not help but drop the chopsticks he was holding and his face twitched uncontrollably.

Damn, he had taken everything into account, yet left out a little girl from his calculations.

Young beauties indeed would not like Ling Han’s type, tanned and with rather ordinary looks, but what would a little girl know about what a handsome man looked like! He never imagined that his Junior Brother Han was so good with kids.

Thankfully, he had only sat at the same table with the two young beauties, but it was practically impossible for him to bring them over.

There was no need for him to address Ling Han as Big Brother.

Phew, he almost met with an unexpected failure.

Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan were both very baffled. Hu Niu extremely rejected the approach of any strangers, and if it was not because for Ling Han, even they would not be able to get close to this little girl. Yet why was it that an unfamiliar man was able to make Hu Niu act so defenseless, and act so spoiled and warm as if the man was Ling Han?

Yi, could it be?

The eyes of the two girls lit up at the same time. They both knew that Ling Han had changed his appearance and went to the Winter Moon Sect, so did that mean that this young man in front of them was...

“Ling Han mean, left for so long, and not play with Niu!” It was at this moment that they heard Hu Niu say with much displeasure as she bit Ling Han’s hand to express her dissatisfaction.

Indeed!

The two girls finally understood, and secretly felt ashamed as well. They were both very deeply in love with Ling Han, yet they had not recognized their beloved when he was standing in front of them. On the other hand, Hu Niu was able to recognize him with a single look. How could they bear with that?

Ling Han smiled faintly, tousled Hu Niu’s hair, and said, “All right, I’ll play more often with Niu Niu in future.”

Hu Niu knew how to act spoiled, but would never throw an unreasonable tantrum. She immediately stopped frowning and gave Ling Han a very sweet smile.

F***, was this little girl transformed from some kind of vixen? That was really too cunning of her. Like that, Ling Han would definitely feel apologetic and dote even more on this little girl.

The two girls exchanged a look and could not help but feel alert in their minds. They definitely could not overlook Hu Niu just because she was little, because a little girl would very soon grow up to become a young girl. With Hu Niu’s possessiveness, by that time, the two of them might not even be able to get within ten metres of Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded at the two girls, and said, “My name now is Han Lin, and that guy over there is my cousin, but he does not know who I am. Come with me.”

Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan instantly looked shy, but they still stood up and followed Ling Han back to where Yue Kai Yu was sitting.

Pa , the chopsticks that Yue Kai Yu had just picked up not too long ago fell back onto the table. His face twitched, and it looked like his eyes were practically popping out of his head.

This, how, how was this possible!?

They were really conned over by this guy? Hiss, no matter how he looked at this Junior Brother Han, there wasn’t any particularly outstanding part to him, was there? Or did the women nowadays prefer the ordinary, tanned type?Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
