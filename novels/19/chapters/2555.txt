Chapter 2556: Black Donkey

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Thank you, Senior!” Everyone bowed in respect to the black donkey. If it weren’t for this senior, He Feng could have easily killed them all before leaving. After all, he was a Heavenly Venerate, a supremely powerful being.

“Senior, are we going to let He Feng go just like that? What if he causes trouble elsewhere?” Xiao Yingxiong asked.

The black donkey chuckled, and said, “The old geezer has already reached his limit by ascending to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. It’s impossible for him to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. With such strength, how can he possibly engulf a dimension? What an absolute joke!”

It paused for a moment before continuing, “Compared to Hysteria, he’s nothing but trash.”

They all ground their teeth in their minds. This black donkey was also a Heavenly Venerate, right? He was speaking with such haughtiness, and it was truly rendering them speechless.

“However, this United Origin Manifestation Fruit is genuine. If you ingest it, you can indeed raise your strength,” the black donkey added.

Everyone grimaced as they looked down at the fruit in their hands.

This had been produced by a metal tree, so was it truly edible?

“Won’t you hurry up? The celestial fruit has already been cut apart, so each moment that passes is a portion of its essence lost,” the black donkey shouted.

They hurriedly ingested their slice of celestial fruit. Even Wally was no exception. He wasn’t a human, yet this didn’t mean that he couldn’t enjoy the benefits of celestial fruits.

They sat down cross-legged, and only the large black dog and the Imperial Void Celestial King remained standing in boredom.

The large black dog’s eyes darted around, and at some point, he suddenly ran beside the black donkey, starting to act all friendly with it.

Even though one was a dog and one was a donkey, they got along surprisingly well, and it wasn’t long before they started to chat and laugh. In fact, they even wrapped their “arms” around each other’s shoulders as if they were extremely good friends.

Ling Han’s intuition had been correct. People would often be attracted to those who were similar to them. The two animals were attracted to each other like glue, and it was clear that they shared a lot in common.

However, Ling Han didn’t have the time or effort to think about this now. He needed to refine the United Origin Manifestation Fruit.

To say nothing of the fact that this fruit needed to extract the blood essence of monarch stars to grow, just the fact that it needed to grow for several epochs was already a sign of its extraordinary nature. According to He Feng, if this fruit fully matured, it could even help a Ninth Heaven Celestial King directly ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Even though its effects were slightly inferior now, and even though it had been divided into many pieces, it was still a great treasure for low-level Celestial Kings.

In fact, this wasn’t a pure celestial fruit in the ordinary sense. Instead, it was more like an alchemical pill. Of course, this kind of refinement technique was also extremely difficult to emulate.

After channeling the essence of the fruit, Ling Han quickly discovered that not only could it advance his cultivation, but it could even push the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to a higher level.

However, he only had a single piece of this fruit, so if he concentrated its benefits on cultivation, his physique couldn’t be improved.

Which should he choose?

Ling Han only hesitated for a brief moment before deciding to choose the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

The physique and recovery ability of Heavenborn and Wally provoked him greatly. In the past, this had been his unique advantage. Now, however, he could only watch on as others also displayed this ability. This worried him greatly.

He channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll as he ravenously absorbed the essence of the United Origin Manifestation Fruit. Symbols pulsated on his body, and it was as if he were comprehending the secrets of the heavens past and present.

This celestial fruit had required several epochs to grow, so it naturally contained a grand amount of energy. Ling Han spent 39 entire days to completely refine its essence.

He felt slight pity, but he also felt quite delighted.

After reaching the Celestial King Tier, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was divided into nine levels. These were referred to as the Indestructible Celestial King Physique, and each level would correspond to one of the Nine Heavens of the Celestial King Tier. For example, the first level of the Indestructible Celestial King Physique would correspond to the defenses of a First Heaven Celestial King.

However, the advantage of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was that it trained the physique, something that would always exist and be effective.

Right now, Ling Han had already raised his Indestructible Celestial King Physique to the sixth level. This was already quite extraordinary. However, it was still some way off the peak stage of the ninth level.

Moreover, the advance of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll wouldn’t be affected by one’s cultivation. In other words, as long as Ling Han’s comprehension ability was powerful enough, and as long as he had sufficient resources, he could completely raise his Indestructible Celestial King Physique by another level, reaching the Eternal Divine Metal level. At that point, his physical body would be as strong as Divine Metal.

Above that level, and the final level, would be the Indestructible Heavenly Venerate Physique. However, even the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had only managed to comprehend half of this level. Even though one’s physique would be more powerful than Divine Metal, it still wouldn’t reach the defensive level of First Tier Heavenly Venerates.

However, this couldn’t be helped. The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had died early. Otherwise, he might have perfected this level long ago.

‘My recovery ability has also improved markedly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

‘The Indestructible True Fluid has also transformed into mist, flowing into every part of my body. It can automatically heal me even if I suffer severe wounds.

‘However, I’m temporarily unable to use Rising From The Ashes.”

This pertained to the Regulations. He was in the Flaming Frost Realm now, so he needed to tweak the cultivation technique to align with the great dao of this dimension.

‘Moreover, Regulations are only useful up to the Celestial King Tier. If I become a Heavenly Venerate, Rising From The Ashes will become ineffective.’

Celestial Kings were blessed by heaven and earth, and it was because of this that they would have a sliver of a chance to revive. However, Heavenly Venerates definitely didn’t enjoy such treatment.

If they died, they would have truly died.

‘Moreover, it seems like my Evolution Index has gone up a little as well,’ Ling Han mused. Before, it had already been infinitesimally close to 12. Now, however, he felt as if he had already reached this level.

This was because his cultivation hadn’t risen at all, yet his battle prowess had gone up by a significant amount. Thus, this could only be reflected in his Evolution Index.

Ling Han was the first to finish digesting the fruit. Afterward, Huo Furong, Ji Wuming, and the others also finished one after another. Wally was the slowest, yet he also cared the least. After all, his body would automatically digest the essence.

“Since you’re all done, it’s time to p*ss off,” the black donkey said. After tearing open space, he kicked each of them inside. He then stepped in himself.

Whoosh!

Space knitted back together, and everything immediately returned to normal.

They traveled through the void, and it wasn’t long before they all tumbled out again. Sure enough, they had already returned to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

“P*ss off, p*ss off,” the black donkey said with impatience as it waved its hoof. “You actually made me wait for so many days! What a bunch of high-maintenance brats! Girl over there, you’re also a member of the martial academy now.”

The last sentence was targeted at Liu Yufei.

Liu Yufei was instantly delighted. In fact, she had also screwed Ling Han and the others over, so she had been worried about them seeking revenge. Now that she had become a disciple of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, however, her life would at least be safe.

“Hmph!” The Imperial Void Celestial King flicked his sleeve before leaving.

He was feeling extremely ticked off. The others had also been wounded and gone through hardships, but they had at least received some benefits. As for him?

To say nothing of losing a great portion of his vitality, even his Ancient Bell of Qian had lost a countless amount of its essence. This trip had truly screwed him over.

As he glanced at Ling Han, killing intent pulsated in his eyes. This youth… He would definitely kill him! But now was not the time.

The Imperial Void Celestial King gave a long roar as he quickly took his leave.

Xiao Yingxiong and the others also left one after another. Even though they had gone through significant hardships, they had ultimately reaped huge rewards as well. They had all enjoyed a huge rise in cultivation. Thus, with some cultivation and accumulation, they could advance to the next level. Moreover, they could maintain a high cultivation speed for some time even after advancing.

All in all, they had still gained more than they had lost.

It was just that… they had failed to kill Ling Han.

“Little Black, let’s go,” Ling Han said to the large black dog.

Peng!

Ling Han was instantly kicked down by a hoof. He looked up, only to see the two front hooves of the black donkey standing on his chest. Flames were blowing from the black donkey’s nose as it said, “Brat, whom are you calling Little Black?”

‘Great, I forgot that he was also black.’
