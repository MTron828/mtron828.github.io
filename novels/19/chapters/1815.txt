Chapter 1816: My hand shook

The Empress flew into a sudden fury.

One of the things she could least tolerate was criticism of her appearance.

“Humph!” She humphed, her domineering aura on at full blast.

“Yi, have I gotten food poisoning? Why do I suddenly feel that this woman is good-looking!” one of the dwarves suddenly exclaimed, and even blinked his eyes in disbelief.

“I seem to think that she is quite good-looking too.”

“Gods, I must be cursed!”

The seven dwarves all paled in shock. This woman was poisonous; she could actually make them think that she was good-looking.

They had to be seeing things!

Ling Han laughed involuntarily. The Empress’s beauty was indeed irresistible. Even if these people had oddly bent aesthetic senses, she could forcefully bend them back the right way. He thought for a moment, and then asked, “Who are you people? Can we go and pay your home a visit?”

The seven dwarves were still discussing the Empress spiritedly, casting looks at her repeatedly. The more they looked, the more they thought that the Empress was astonishingly beautiful. Then, when they turned back to look at their companions, they all gritted their teeth, wondering how their companions could look so hideous.

“We are the warriors of the Gururu Tribe!” one of the dwarves declared, an indescribable pride clear in his expression.

The Heavenly Dao Jade was here, though its exact location was unknown, and there was a group of natives living here, so perhaps they had some clues leading to its location.

Ling Han’s divine sense swept over the group. Though these dwarves had some cultivation level, they were all only in the Shattering Void Tier. Their strength couldn’t be any lower. It could be that the cultivation system here had not taken form yet. Merely in terms of Spiritual Qi, it was actually not too weak.

“If you want to be guests, that’s fine, but don’t even think of stealing our treasure!” one of the dwarves said.

“That’s right, you Giants are too bad. According to the records of our ancestors, you people have done many bad deeds!”

These dwarves all talked at once, talking about how greedy outsiders were, and how that never led to a good ending.

The Empress was proud, and impatiently demanded, “Lead the way quickly!”

With this rebuke, the seven dwarves didn’t have any temper, and docilely led the way.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh internally, and followed behind them with the Empress. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others were following even further behind. One group followed the other, and after walking for around an hour, a large plain appeared ahead of them. There was a village there, and light smoke could be seen gradually drifting upwards.

This was the Gururu Tribe?

When they saw that the seven dwarves had brought two “Giants” back with them, a large number of dwarves suddenly surged out of the village, and all gathered around Ling Han and the Empress, bearing expressions of disgust.

“So ugly!”

“So these are the legendary Giants!”

“Aiya, my eyes are about to go blind. I will definitely have no appetite for food today.”

“Gods, how could there be such a hideous person!”

These dwarves exclaimed in shock, completely unafraid of the powerful Severing Mundane Tier-level strength of Ling Han and the Empress. They were a little silly.

However, the Empress’s beauty was irresistible to one and all. Not long after, they were all staring in a daze, and began to admire the Empress’s exquisite beauty.

Ling Han coughed, and asked, “Can we walk around in this place?”

“You can’t, but she can!” These dwarves all pointed at the Empress, completely prejudiced.

The Empress was proud, and walked around the village with Ling Han in tow. Then, Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others also appeared. They also had the same idea as Ling Han had. These natives possibly knew some clue about the great opportunity.

They wanted to enter the village, but the Empress was the Empress, and these people... were only these people.

“Giants, you people are forbidden from entering our sacred village!” Immediately, over a dozen dwarves moved to block the way of Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others, all raising their staffs to point at them.

This seemed to be a kind of weapon. Previously, they had seen the dwarves aiming them at Ling Han and the Empress, but it was unknown what its exact might was.

Qianzhao Tian showed an expression of disdain. These natives were only in the Shattering Void Tier, so their overall level of cultivation was naturally pitifully low. Did he even have to take their opinion into consideration? He was the heir of a three-star force; what place did not receive him with accolades and utmost courtesy?

‘You dare to stand in my way?’

He strode forwards boldly, and scoffed, “So what if I enter?”

Zi!

One of the dwarves was too nervous, and gripped the staff in his hand tightly. Suddenly, a ray of light shot out of the staff, heading towards Qianzhao Tian.

Qianzhao Tian was stunned—this attack was too fast, so fast that he could not avoid it. But after a moment of surprise, he was completely calm again. That was because this was the attack that had been delivered by a Shattering Void Tier, so even if it had been faster, so what? What could it do to him?

What a joke. After advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, who did not have enough Origin Power to temper their physique? Even if they could not possibly temper their physique to the extent of Pseudo-Divine Metal’s hardness, it naturally was not a big deal for their physique to reach the level of Level 20 Godly metal.

Then, even if he just sat there and allowed these dwarves to attack him, so what?

Peng, this light landed on Qianzhao Tian’s chest, and then shot through. Because of the dwarf’s height, this attack was slanted upwards. After the light penetrated Qianzhao Tian’s body, it shot skywards, and did not shoot towards the others.

Qianzhao Tian turned around slowly, and they could see that his whole chest was gone, and slivers of black smoke were still emanating from it.

His face was filled with complete confusion and disbelief. He stretched out a hand towards the others, but he had just raised his hand, and it was continuously turning into dust that fell from his arm. That was not the only thing. His whole body was being corroded, and the last was his face that turned into dust which was scattered by the winds.

Pa, his whole person had turned into a pile of mud that suddenly shattered.

He died!

The heir of a three-star force, a third severance peak stage elite, and he had actually been killed so casually by a Shattering Void Tier who was wielding a staff.

Both his form and spirit had been obliterated; even if a Celestial King was here, he could not possibly be revived!

That was too inconceivable!

Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others involuntarily took a step back, and their expressions changed. Next, they retreated further, feeling a numbing shiver come over their whole bodies.

It should be known that the staffs of these dwarves were still aimed at them!

Though Ling Han did not turn around, with how his divine sense enshrouded the area, he had naturally “seen” clearly what had happened, and his expression similarly changed.

If this kind of light landed on him, would he be able to survive?

Ling Han had zero confidence. This light was definitely not a power-based attack, but had rather reached inconceivable heights in terms of Regulations. Thus, when the blow rushed through him, Qianzhao Tian died without any resistance.

“This is a portion of the power from the Wood Source Power.” Small Tower’s voice rang out. “You don’t have to worry. You yourself possess two Source Powers, so this kind of attack cannot possibly kill you.”

“The Heavenly Dao Jade is definitely in the vicinity. These weapons have gained destructive power through the Heavenly Dao Jade.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat, and asked, “Didn’t you say that you would be able to accurately confirm its location once we’re close to the Heavenly Dao Jade?”

“Did I specify exactly how close we had to get?” Small Tower said very irresponsibly.

‘F***, could it be that you can only locate the Heavenly Dao Jade once you see it? Then I would be able to do that too!’

Ling Han was speechless. At first, Small Tower was only a tsundere, but why did it seem like it was developing a tendency of screwing others over?

“Ru Seventeen, you killed someone!” the dwarves all exclaimed.

“I killed someone!” The dwarf who had unleashed the attack also looked like he was about to cry. “I didn’t do it on purpose. I was just so nervous that my hand shook!”

When everyone saw this, they grimaced, and felt that Qianzhao Tian had really died too tragically.

A king tier, and he had actually died because an extreme weakling’s hand had shaken? This was practically the biggest joke ever.
