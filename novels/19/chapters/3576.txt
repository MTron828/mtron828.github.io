Chapter 3577’. Massacre Tournament

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xiao Zhixuan’s expression was indifferent. In her eyes, the battle between Niu Jianhua and Sun Xun was completely the display of boys. It was too immature. She was slightly interested in Ling Han. How exactly had he managed to trick Niu Jianhua? Though this guy was arrogant and haughty, with the soaring arrogance of a second-generation young master, he did not look like an idiot no matter how she looked at him.

The four of them walked out of the courtyard, and there were already a great many people outside. They were all here to participate in the martial arts competition this time round. It was a dense mass of heads, and no matter what, there had to be ten thousand of them.

At present, on the Celestial Sea Planet, there were already at least ten thousand Mystery Realm Tiers?

Though the environment of heaven and earth had changed drastically, and there were Treasured Fruits that could allow one to advance into the Mystery Realm Tier in a single night, that should only be a minority, but now that he had seen tens of thousands of Mystery Realm Tiers, Ling Han felt that he had underestimated the scale of the prison.

Of course, there were still a great many members of the Sea Race here, but even if the sea area was large, and three-dimensional at that, and could nurture even more life, there shouldn’t be too many Mystery Realm Tiers, right?

Thus, the majority of people should still have come out of the prison.

Some people were truly impressive. Ling Han activated his ocular technique and saw a considerable number of powerful people with extremely vigorous vitality. They were as eye-catching as the sun as they walked in the crowd.

Perhaps, like him, these people had not come for the sake of becoming a disciple of Primordial True Lord. Instead, they had come for the Celestial medicine.

He didn’t see Hong Tianbu.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled in a frown. Could it be that Hong Tianbu had broken through to Celestial Path? Otherwise, there was absolutely no way he would have missed this opportunity.

There were also other possibilities. Hong Tianbu had already been taken as a disciple by the Nine Spirit True Lord, so he had to avoid the issue of bias for a while.

Ling Han was more inclined towards the former. Hong Tianbu had extremely high natural talent in martial arts, and also had great fortune. It was nothing strange for him to have long since rushed up to the peak stage of Mystery Realm Tier. Then, after gaining a Divine Stone that was used to build his Celestial Foundation, why should he wait any longer to break through?

Without leaping over the Celestial Gate, he would only be an ant in the end.

All of them arrived at the foot of a mountain. A Foundation Building elite jumped onto the top of a tree, and said loudly, “The competition will be held here. If you leave this mountain, you will automatically forfeit. In this one day, you can use any means to decrease the number of competitors. If there are more than thirty-two people standing at this time tomorrow, I will inform you where you will leave from, and the thirty-two people who leave first can enter into the second round.”

“Now… let the slaughter begin!”

This Foundation Building elite said balefully, his face filled with bloodlust.

In the prison, the living conditions were extremely harsh, and it was very common for people to come to blows and kill people at the drop of a hat. Being able to advance from a young child to a Foundation Building cultivator in such conditions, this person’s heart was naturally as cold as iron.

When his words fell, a great many people broke into a run and fled.

As long as they could hide into the mountains, then even if their abilities were weak there was a very high possibility that they would last until the end, and make it into the top 32. At least, they would be able to join the Primordial Sect, and from then onwards, they would have an incredibly powerful backer.

This was a Spirit Transformation True Lord. In the entire Celestial Sea Planet, there were only five such beings.

“Where are you running to!”

“Die!”

“Die!”

Some fierce people immediately drew their weapons, raised their fists, and began a massacre. The whole mountain peak instantly erupted in a bloody battle, and in an instant, quite a number of people were killed.

It should be known that there was no shortage of people who had come out of the prison here, so they were naturally all used to this kind of scene. In truth, they were the ones who had killed the most viciously, but whether it was the members of the Sea Race, the members of the Dark North Nation, or even outsiders from another planet, they had never seen such a scene before. All of them were at a loss and in dire straits. Some of them could only throw up, and were easily killed.

Yet Ling Han’s expression was unperturbed. In the Genesis World, he had crawled out of a mountain of corpses and over a sea of corpses. The Realm War that had happened at that time was more than a hundred times more intense than what was happening now, wasn’t it?

Niu Jianhua’s expression was also ugly. Though he was a noble son from the Hundred Victory Planet, he had never seen such a bloody scene, causing his throat to vibrate, and he had to forcefully stop himself from throwing up.

“Surrender your life!” A sturdy man charged over. He looked to be in his thirties, and held a massive cleaver in his hand. As he swept over, he brandished the cleaver in a slash, drawing out a white saber light that swept towards Ling Han and his group.

“Scram!” Niu Jianhua exploded, and shot out a palm strike. Instantly, fiery flames surged, as if a god of fire had walked out from within.

“What’l” The brawny man paled in shock, knowing that he had kicked an iron plate. However, it was already impossible for him to withdraw his saber at this moment, so he could only bite the bullet and slash down, thinking that he would immediately retreat after this strike.

Peng!

The fiery palm landed on the blade of the saber, and immediately, sent the saber flying. Furthermore, the fiery flames surged out, showing no mercy, as they surged past that sturdy man.

-Ah-” The brawny man screamed tragically. The fiery flames burned his body, and even penetrated directly into his soul, causing him indescribable suffering. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He screamed for a while, and only then did he suddenly collapse, turning into a charred corpse.

Initially, there were a few people in the surroundings that wanted to rush over, but when they saw the miserable state of the sturdy man, they couldn’t help but shiver in fear. Hurriedly, they turned around and fled.

Even Ling Han was slightly surprised. He had not thought that this second-generation young master would actually have some abilities. Previously, he had knocked Niu Jianhua unconscious with a single strike, and subconsciously thought that Niu Jianhua’s strength was not all that impressive, but in truth, he did indeed have some skill. No wonder his clan had sent him here to obtain a fated opportunity.

Sun Xun retreated continuously, maintaining a distance from Niu Jianhua. These flames were too terrifying, causing him to feel extreme wariness. Ling Han deduced that Niu Jianhua should have mastered a High Level Spirit Diagram, which was at least more powerful than the Fire Spirit Diagram that he had mastered. Only then could the might of his palm strike be so overwhelming.

Visitors from other planets couldn’t be underestimated.

Meanwhile, Niu Jianhua looked towards Sun Xun, a hint of disdain appearing at the corners of his lips. After killing a person with his own hands, he seemed to have adapted to this kind of slaughter, and no longer looked as sickly as before.

“Sun Xun, you have actually made enemies of this young master time and time again. You are truly seeking death!” he declared balefully.

Though he could not do as he liked on the Hundred Victory Planet, he was not that far off either. Now that he had come to this fallen star, there was actually someone who dared to compete with him over a woman?

How laughable, how infuriating, and how despicable!

Sun Xun broke into a run. He no longer had any desire to win, and only wished to stay alive.

Niu Jianhua laughed loudly, then looked towards Ling Han, “Now do you believe that I can take you to the top?”

Ling Han chuckled in his mind. If he told him that he was the one who had knocked him unconscious, and that he was the one who had caused him to be plagued by bad luck, would he be so furious that he would directly vomit blood and die?

“Lady Xiao, I am also willing to kill all enemies in the world for you!” Niu Jianhua hurriedly tried to curry Xiao Zhixuan’s favour again.

Xiao Zhixuan pursed her lips into a smile, but made no comment.

But this filled Niu Jianhua with confidence. He was filled with lofty aspirations, and said, “Follow me! I will directly chase away all the people here, and the spots for the top three would be ours.”

He was boasting so much, his self-confidence soaring to the skies.

Ling Han didn’t mind. Since this idiot liked to charge ahead, he would just let him take the vanguard..
