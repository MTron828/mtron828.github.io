2657 Arrival

Ling Han ran, and Desolate Moon gave chase.

Both used their respective methods. Desolate Moon continued striking aggressively against Ling Han with spiritual attacks and various weapons formed with black Qi. Ling Han wasn’t afraid. He used Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to absorb oncoming attacks, and counterattacked with the Five Elements Lightning Technique.

Suddenly being struck by the Five Elements Lightning Technique, Desolate Moon nearly suffered a big loss. However, he was after all a supreme monarch star at the peak of the Ninth Heaven, and his battle prowess surpassed Ling Han’s by a huge extent. Moreover, he had also mastered the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, this kind of Heavenly Venerate Technique, and so defused the attacks at the cost of a small loss.

After this blow, Desolate Moon naturally became a lot more cautious, and no longer regarded Ling Han as a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, but rather as a being with the same cultivation level as him.

However, with Desolate Moon being so cautious, though Ling Han was also unable to injure the former again, it imperceptibly made the former a much smaller threat to Ling Han.

Xiu, xiu, the two Celestial Kings constantly traversed through space at ridiculously high speed.

Along the way, of course many people had sighted them, but who would dare to intervene and ask them what was going on?

The fact that Desolate Moon was capable enough to be dispatched by Hysteria to oversee the entire situation of course meant that he wasn’t as simple as just a supreme monarch star at the peak of the Ninth Heaven. When he saw that he couldn’t catch up to Ling Han for a long time, his eyes flashed, and he drew out three fine needles.

These needles were given to him by Hysteria. Of course, they weren’t precious tools refined by Hysteria himself, but were obtained from the hands of the Heavenly Venerates who had died in the midst of the long period of war.

This was a… Heavenly Venerate Tool!

Of course, these three fine needles were severely damaged, far from having the power of the Heavenly Venerate, but they were still beyond the level of the Ninth Heaven, and were infinitely close in power to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Most importantly, the power of these three fine needles could be fully unleashed in Desolate Moon’s hands.

“Go!”

Desolate Moon grunted softly, and with the complete channeling of his power, the three fine needles were completely awakened. However, there was no flicker of seals, only the surging of endless power.

Heavenly Venerates did not cultivate Regulations.

Xiuuu, the three fine needles were fired simultaneously, and pursued Ling Han at an indescribable speed.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel a powerful sense of alarm. With a sweep of his divine sense, he discovered the three fine needles. However, upon discovering them, they were already less than 300 meters away from him, and were still rapidly approaching him.

270 meters, 240 meters, 210 meters, this speed far exceeded Ling Han’s.

He activated the Regulations of Space to teleport himself to another location, but those fine needles automatically changed direction as if they had self-awareness.

If the Heavenly Venerate Tool could be dodged so easily, then it would be too shabby, wouldn’t it?

Ling Han used the Regulations of Time again in an attempt to delay the course of the three fine needles, but it was ineffective, as if nothing would work.

‘Heavenly Venerate Tool!’ Ling Han thought to himself. Only the Heavenly Venerate Tool would have such power!

His only option was to take it head-on!

Ling Han made a sharp turn, brandished the Divine Demon Sword, and slashed at the three fine needles.

Ding! Ding!

With two crisp sounds, the Divine Demon Sword slashed onto two fine needles one after another, slicing them in half with an invincible force, but the third thin needle broke through the Divine Demon Sword’s resistance, and directly struck Ling Han’s body.

Ling Han was already channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, but this time, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had no effect. The fine needle ripped open his skin and entered his blood vessels.

Desolate Moon couldn’t help but sigh. With the passage of time, even the precious tool refined by the Heavenly Venerate was laid to waste. Otherwise, though the fine needles were made of neither Divine Metal nor Devouring Metal, they shouldn’t be cut in just one slash.

Still, one fine needle had entered Ling Han’s body, and that was enough to allow the power of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier to be unleashed—even someone at the peak of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King would meet his end!

Ling Han retracted his sword, turned around, and continued to run. He knew something was wrong, but could only keep running while thinking of a solution.

It was hurting!

He felt as if the blood in his body was burning; the pain was unbearable.

This wasn’t an illusion—he could clearly see the heat rising from his skin, and moisture was depleting rapidly.

This was a great deadly weapon, it was burning him alive, and turning him into a dried corpse.

Ling Han humphed, and extracted a large volume of water element from heaven and earth using his left hand before inserting it into his body to ease the crisis within. He channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll again, trying to force the fine needle out of his body.

But the fine needle moved in his body according to his blood flow, astonishingly as fast as before. It was impossible to capture it at all.

“It’s futile, that’s a weapon that the Thousand Transformation Heavenly Venerate had personally refined in the past. Although he had just forged it casually, and had not used any precious materials, it is still not something that you, a puny Seventh Heaven Celestial King, can fight against,” Desolate Moon said from behind.

Naturally, Ling Han ignored him. He had experienced countless dangers in his life, so how could he give up just because of a few words from his opponent?

However, Desolate Moon was right about one thing: Ling Han really had no way to force the fine needle out of his body.

Then… Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han’s expression suddenly hardened, and slashed at his finger with his sword.

Pa, blood splashed as a finger was immediately chopped off, but the deadly boiling within his body also disappeared.

As the thin needle just happened to circulate up to his finger, it was cut off along with his finger.

It was a prompt and resolute decision, not because Ling Han didn’t care about this hand, but because he cherished his life more.

Ling Han didn’t even bat an eyelid. Previously, his body had undergone repeated explosions, so what was the big deal with just one finger being cut off now?

Desolate Moon was shocked. He didn’t expect that Ling Han was not only ruthless to himself, but also had such amazing insight that he could eradicate a great danger at minimal cost.

His eyes flashed with killing intent. If Ling Han was allowed to escape, he would surely become a peerless elite in the future, and be one of the main forces of resistance against Hysteria.

Ling Han could not be left alive.

Desolate Moon went all out to give chase, wanting to get rid of this hidden danger,

Ling Han was neither angry nor alarmed, his objective being extremely clear. Even if he had an opportunity to kill Desolate Moon, he would not do so, because the most important thing right now was to prevent those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in the Ancient Tomb from becoming Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Chasing, fleeing, chasing, fleeing. 10, 20, 30 years… Time flew past. Almost 50 years later, the great mountain where the World’s Paramount Martial Academy was located came into Ling Han’s sight.

As a former disciple of the martial academy, how could Desolate Moon not know that this was the World’s Paramount Martial Academy?

He humphed angrily, but had to stop his pursuit, turned around, and left.

If the Heavenly Venerates of the martial academy were drawn out, then Desolate Moon would definitely be killed instantly. Having sold himself to serve Hysteria, he would be killed on the spot even if he was the son of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“Damn! Damn!” Desolate Moon humphed. “I can only activate the backup plan now. I absolutely must not let a mere pawn ruin the plans of Lord Hysteria.”

Ling Han quickened his pace, and then entered into the area under the jurisdiction of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. There weren’t any guards here. The Nine Deaths Formation would keep all unqualified people out, so why bother guarding?

He quickly passed through the great formation, and shouted towards the sky, his loud voice like rolling thunder.

“What the heck’s with all that shouting?” Many Celestial Kings rushed out immediately, and roared at Ling Han. They were all prodigies from countless realms, each of them with invincible aptitude.

Ling Han pressed on without hesitation, and said loudly, “Is the black donkey senior here?”

“Yi!” A black shadow flashed, and then a black donkey suddenly appeared, with shock written all over its face. “How did you get out here? Who let you out?”

“Senior, something big has happened!” Ling Han said with utmost seriousness.
