2823 Combining the seals

There were only the two of them in the hall. Ling Han wasn’t surprised; even if someone came in halfway, they couldn’t resist the impact of the meteor rain, so they were disqualified earlier.

Weng, a leg bone appeared, entirely pale-golden in color, with a vague flickering seal on it.

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and pressed it on the leg bone.

At the same time, Lin Youlian also stretched out her slender hand and touched the leg bone.

A ray of light burst out, and the leg bone emitted an overwhelming brilliance, but this was not all. Ling Han’s and Lin Youlian’s mind shone brightly as well. Weng, weng, weng, three seals rose from the crown of their respective heads.

One turned into a White Tiger, one turned into a Vermilion Bird, and one turned into an Azure Dragon, while the light rising from the leg bone also turned into a Black Tortoise.

Ling Han couldn’t help being stunned. Wasn’t it that a Heavenly Venerable Seal could only be transmitted, and not passed on as an inheritance? But he could clearly sense the Azure Dragon seal, and was able to completely grasp it.

“This is a combination seal.” Lin Youlian started speaking. “When there is resonance between the four seals, then it would materialize, but it is only limited to a duration when the seal of the Black Tortoise hasn’t dissipated.”

She paused for a moment, and then added, “Hurry up and comprehend it, there’s not much time!”

Ling Han quickly regained his composure. Who cared what the reason was, his priority now was to master the two seals of the Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise.

Both of them sat down cross-legged, imprinting the Heavenly Venerable Seals firmly in their minds.

Three days later, the golden leg bone disintegrated into specks of light before vanishing without a trace.

However, Ling Han revealed a look of satisfaction as he had imprinted the two seals of Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise in his mind. He didn’t dare to be careless, and began studying them again.

The same was true for Lin Youlian. She had a bigger task at hand as she needed to comprehend three seals.

Time passed quietly, and soon it was already 20,000 years later.

Ling Han opened his eyes. He had already mastered all Four Direction Seals.

A single seal could increase his cultivation speed by 17 times, and it was the same for the increase in battle prowess. Moreover, the four seals could actually be channeled simultaneously in battle, which would be terrifying indeed as it would cause his power to soar by 39 times.

What was going on here?

If the four seals could be superimposed, shouldn’t it be 68 times? What was the meaning of this 39 times?

Moreover, the effects of Heavenly Venerable Seals couldn’t be superimposed. No matter how many seals were being channeled, the one which could truly exert its power would be the strongest one.

This ought to be related to “combination seals,” right?

Ling Han thought of what Lin Youlian had said before, and was absolutely confident in his theory, but the other party was still in the midst of meditation with her eyes closed. It would be impossible for him to wake up the other party to pose his query, thereby interrupting the other party’s comprehension. This would be creating a deadly feud.

Moreover, it seemed that Lin Youlian had long expected that they would jointly unlock the fourth Heavenly Venerable Seal, which would allow both of them to master the Four Directions Seals.

So that was the reason why the other party had especially invited Ling Han to enter the doorway of light together, and to take on the test at the same time, completely in synchrony.

Ling Han thought about it, and decided to continue meditating while waiting for Lin Youlian as he wanted clarification. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Of course, he wouldn’t waste time, because the Heavenly Venerate Four Directions had said that if he could master all the four seals, he would be able to comprehend a unique skill contained within them.

Ling Han started to make deductions. Soon, he had some clues, and was slowly making progress.

After 9,000 years had passed, Ling Han stood up abruptly, and then punched out. Boom, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and Black Tortoise all appeared and charged forward.

As the Four Forms materialized, power soared exponentially!

Ling Han channeled the Four Directions Seals, and simultaneously punched out for the second time. This time, the extraordinary sight was even more astonishing—it was as though all four Divine Beasts had solidified, bearing a massive destructive aura.

‘When this secret technique and the Four Directions Seals are being channeled at the same time, the power released is truly amazing.’ Ling Han was filled with admiration. This was the ultimate technique created by a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, so it could be used at least up to the battle prowess of a Fifth Tier.

‘However, my true support would be the Fists of Fury, which must not be discarded.’

While waiting, Ling Han practiced the fist technique. After another millennium had passed, Lin Youlian finally woke up from her state of meditation.

“If you have any questions, just ask. Where I’m capable of answering, I will do my best to answer.” This was the first sentence that the woman said, as if she had read Ling Han’s mind.

It really wasn’t good for a woman to be so smart; it would cause a man not to have any sense of accomplishment.

Ling Han chuckled. “Miss, if I may ask, what is a combination seal?”

“According to my father’s statistics, there are a total of 999 Heavenly Venerable Seals. If they can be fully mastered and formed into sequences, then each seal can resonate with one another and exert unimaginable power,” Lin Youlian said.

She paused slightly, and then said, “However, even if you don’t master all these seals, but have obtained the adjacent seals, they can still resonate and give rise to amplification of power. It’s just that the effect will be slightly inferior.”

Ling Han gave an oh and nodded; no wonder his strength wasn’t increased by 68 times when he had channeled the Four Directions Seals simultaneously, but rather 39 times over.

He was stumped for words. If he could further obtain adjacent seals, then wouldn’t his battle prowess be increased 50 times, 100 times, or 1,000 times?

“You guessed it right,” Lin Youlian said. “So, even if you have the same number of Heavenly Venerable Seals, and they are of the same level, but one party’s seals are a series, while the other’s are not, there will be a huge difference in battle prowess between the two.”

She glanced at Ling Han, and added, “Since I started this, I will simply explain some more.

“The 999 Heavenly Venerable Seals are divided into nine levels, and each level has one 111 seals. My father proceeded to sort them. The first level of Heavenly Venerable Seals can increase battle prowess by about four to 10 times.

“The second level, between 11 and 20 times.

“Going by the same logic, the ninth level will reach between 81 and 90 times.

“However, don’t think that low-level seals are useless.” Lin Youlian looked solemn. “Due to the continuity and ability of combination of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, we absolutely mustn’t ignore any of the Heavenly Venerable Seals. Moreover, even if it is a low-level seal, as long as it can be combined, the power upon being channeled together cannot be underestimated. ”

Ling Han nodded. His eyes were really opened today. In his thoughts, he was becoming more and more curious about the identity of this stunning beauty. What was her background, and how did she come to know so many secrets?

He couldn’t help asking, “Miss, if I may ask, have we met before?”

Being a dignified Fourth Tier, much less someone who could suppress a super genius like Zhuang Feirui, why would she behave so courteously to a First Tier like Ling Han?

Lin Youlian smiled faintly. “My father and brother think very highly of Brother Lin.”

Ling Han was taken aback for a moment, and suddenly a conjecture surged in his heart. He said, “You are Lin Youlian!”

Besides this prodigious woman, who else could suppress Zhuang Feirui with one move? Apart from Lin Luo, how many other people would know that there were 999 Heavenly Venerable Seals in the Genesis World? And would even know about such secrets as the combination seals?

Lin Youlian smiled faintly. “Correct.”

It was indeed as expected. Ling Han nodded and sighed inwardly; he owed the Lin Clan another favor.

...

“Brother Ling, Senior Brother Zhou Heng has already told my father about your conjecture. My father actually has the same idea, but no one is Hysteria, so it is impossible to know how far it can go,” Lin Youlian said with a solemn voice. “My father asked me to send word to Brother Ling—to persist in your efforts and keep climbing to the top. In the future, you will definitely be an important link in quelling the disaster brought about by Hysteria.”
