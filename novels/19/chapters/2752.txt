2753 Father and Son Reunited

First Tier Heavenly Venerates were no match for Second Tier Heavenly Venerates. Not only did they have mastery of one fundamental power less, but they were also limited by the fact that the unique power of a dimension couldn’t possibly surpass the fundamental powers of the Genesis World.

However, after traveling to another dimension, the unique power of the dimensions would only remain in the Heavenly Venerate’s body. Every bit consumed was every bit gone. This was similar to the situation faced by Celestial Kings. Thus, Second Tier Heavenly Venerates would quickly drop down to the First Tier.

Add to that the suppression of a foreign dimension, and it was entirely possible that foreign Second Tier Heavenly Venerates would become even weaker than indigenous First Tier Heavenly Venerates.

If this hadn’t been the case, wouldn’t it have been much easier for higher-level dimensions to conquer lower-level dimensions?

!!

Ling Han smiled faintly as he retracted his hand, and said, “If you’re not afraid of death, then come try me.”

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate hesitated upon hearing this. He refused to believe that someone who could become a Heavenly Venerate was a fool. Thus, daring to come here alone, this person was definitely confident in his own abilities, or had some other source of confidence.

Perhaps… the Martial Crystalline Realm was about to launch a large-scale attack? So they sent a Heavenly Venerate over to clear the path?

He hurriedly sent a signal. No matter what, being careful was his top priority.

“Who are you? Do you dare tell me your name?” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate said solemnly.

This was also the point of everyone else’s curiosity. How could elites, especially Heavenly Venerable Tier elites, appear out of thin air?

Ling Jianxue had been staring at Ling Han the entire time, and at this moment, his eyes suddenly lit up. His expression became as moved as could be.

This was… This was!

“Ling Han.”

“Ling Han?” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate repeated in confusion. He had never heard of such a person before. However, he immediately pushed this out of his mind, and said, “Regardless of who you are, I suggest you stand aside!”

“Father!” Ling Jianxue exclaimed. He finally understood why his son was able to return—it was because Ling Han had helped him.

“Hmm?” The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate immediately realized that he had misspoken. Just then, he had even told this person to stand aside. F*ck! His son was about to be killed, so how could he endure and not step forward?

“So we truly didn’t accuse you wrongly. You’re genuinely spies from the Martial Crystalline Realm!” he said.

If this hadn’t been the case, why would Ling Han and Ling Feifan have returned from the Martial Crystalline Realm?

Ling Han made a pressing motion with his hand, causing an overwhelming power to surge into the surroundings. The pressure crushing down on Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang immediately disappeared, allowing them to stand back up. Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You finally know that I’m your father, huh? Why were you always mucking around outside back then?”

Otherwise, he would’ve wanted to bring his son to the Flaming Frost Realm.

Ling Jianxue awkwardly ran his hand through his hair.

“You guys!!” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate roared. They were taking things much too far. Were they treating him, a Heavenly Venerate, as nothing more than a prop? He lashed out in fury.

Boom!

Howling winds surged at Ling Han.

Ling Han raised his hand and blocked all of these attacks. At the same time, he let Helian Xunxue exit the Celestial Guest Residence so that she could reunite with their son.

This reunion between mother and son was naturally filled with emotion, with tears brimming in Helian Xunxue’s eyes. She had truly missed her son.

Meanwhile, the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate continued to launch a flurry of furious attacks. After a dozen or so seconds, however, he stopped his attacks in astonishment.

Ling Han was merely holding a single hand in the sky, yet he was able to easily block all of his attacks. Just how terrifying was his strength?

Thoughts of retreat crept into his mind. At the very least, he couldn’t face Ling Han by himself.

“What courage! You actually dared to charge over all by yourself!” a voice said coldly. A figure appeared over the horizon, arriving in just a single stride. They stood in mid-air.

This was a young-looking man, though there was a single silver horn on his head. He radiated with an astonishing aura.

Everyone once again kneeled, and said, “Our respects to Lord Mysterious Horn!”

This was naturally another Heavenly Venerate, the Mysterious Horn Heavenly Venerate. He was also at the First Tier.

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate instantly rediscovered his courage. After arriving here, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate from the Martial Crystalline Realm would inevitably decline to the First Tier. Thus, what did it matter even if Ling Han were slightly stronger than him? If the two of the teamed up, they would be more than powerful enough to deal with him.

“Very well, your family has finally reunited, so why don’t you rest here for all eternity?” he roared.

Ling Han’s gaze became cold. “By the looks of it, you truly want to die.”

“Enough with your arrogance. Right now, you’re also nothing but a First Tier Heavenly Venerate!” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate said in disdain.

Ling Han reached over to grab at the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

“Since you’ve come here, you have no option but to lay down even if you’re a dragon!” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate roared as he charged forward without fear.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate’s arrogant expression instantly underwent a drastic change as if he had seen a ghost. With a shudder, a plume of blood instantly exploded from his entire body like a fine mist. He was almost smacked to death.

How was this possible?! He was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate! Even if he were weaker than a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, with the suppression of heaven and earth, this result should have been impossible!

The Mysterious Horn Heavenly Venerate was also deeply stunned as he looked at Ling Han. He hurriedly unleashed a divine sense fluctuation to request more reinforcements.

Ling Han ignored the Mysterious Horn Heavenly Venerate as he unleashed another palm strike at the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate gritted his teeth as he defended with all his might, also responding with an attack of his own.

This was the Promise City Realm; this was his home ground. Thus, as long as he could endure for a while, reinforcements would quickly arrive.

However, Ling Han had already developed killing intent, so how could his opponent withstand these attacks so easily?

Peng!

A single palm strike was like an entire world collapsing, with a profound power bearing down on the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate and forcing him to sprawl over the ground.

Under the watchful gazes of everyone, a paramount Heavenly Venerate was smacked into the ground with a single strike.

What face did he still have?

Ling Han’s expression was cold as he said, “Is my son someone that you can humiliate?”

Upon his arrival, the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate had immediately used his Heavenly Venerable Tier might to smash Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang into the ground. At that time, with training them in mind, Ling Han hadn’t stepped forward to help them. However, this didn’t mean that he would forget and forgive.

One had to realize that his family was his bottom line. Whoever dared to harm them would die!

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate lay sprawled on the ground, unable to move even a single finger. The gulf between them was such that it seemed like a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate was bullying a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

As the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate lay on the ground, he could see the peculiar gazes of everyone in the surroundings resting on him. This made him feel so humiliated that he wanted to die.

He was a Heavenly Venerate! Someone that even the heavens had to venerate! Just how paramount was his status?

Before he could even finish this thought, he saw that Ling Han had already raised his foot, and was about to stomp down on his head.

The color drained from his face in terror. Lying sprawled on the ground was already embarrassing enough, so if he were further stomped with a foot, would he still have the face to see others in the future?

“You dare?!” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate roared.

Pa!

Ling Han’s foot stomped on his face, not missing the opportunity to twist around twice.

Why wouldn’t he dare? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang were filled with emotion and gratitude. Ling Han was venting anger for them! Meanwhile, Ling Jianxue’s blood boiled with excitement1. He also wanted to possess boundless strength like Ling Han! If anyone dared to offend him, he would resolutely sentence them to death! He would deal with everything right there and then!

“Friend, that’s quite enough,” a composed voice said. An elderly man with white hair walked over. He was tall and solidly built, with his face a healthy red and his white hair tied with a rope made from hemp. There was even a gourd hanging by his waist, making him exude an aura of age and antique.

“Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate!” everyone said as they once again kneeled.

In fact, even the Mysterious Horn Heavenly Venerate bowed slightly, saying, “Greetings to Lord Spiritual Gourd.”

This was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!

“Oh? He wanted to kill my son, so why should I release him?” Ling Han asked as he kept his foot on the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate’s face. He didn’t show any signs of wanting to lift his foot.

“Because that’s my command,” the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate replied, a terrifying aura immediately erupting from his body.

Boom!

Like the tumultuous sea, this was a formidable aura that caused even the First Tier Heavenly Venerates to shake.
