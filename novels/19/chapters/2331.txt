Chapter 2332 Encounter

This time, it was as if the Foreign Realm were welcoming an age of rising stars and endless prodigies. The well-renowned prodigies were advancing in leaps and bounds, and new and exciting prodigies also continued to show up one after another. Things appeared to be flourishing.

Qi Shuang and Yuan kept their eyes glued to the stone tablet. Right now, the Hundred Battles Academy was ranked at a lowly 722nd place. To say nothing of breaking into the top 100, even breaking into the top 200 was looking like an impossible task.

They couldn’t help but find this strange. With Ling Han and the others’ strength, breaking into the top 100 would indeed require some good fortune. However, breaking into the top 200 should have posed no problem at all.

Perhaps they had been targeted by a stronger team?

However, their number of beacons had never experienced a huge drop before, so they clearly hadn’t been robbed by a stronger team.

“Huh, look over there. That man and three women are so relaxed,” someone suddenly said with a chuckle. Because the streams on the stone surface weren’t fixed, it would occasionally jump from place to place.

“Hahaha!” Laughter instantly broke out.

Qi Shuang and Yuan also looked over, and they almost fainted in anger.

At the stream, Ling Han, Hu Niu, and the others were casually eating roast meat.

If it were only this, then so be it. More importantly, however, there were four tents behind them!

Did they need to set up tents to eat a meal?

Clearly not. By setting up tents, they made it clear that they were going to stay there for a day or night.

However, what was the cultivation level of everyone? Even if they didn’t eat or rest for hundreds of millions of years, they still wouldn’t feel tired or exhausted, yet how long had they entered the mystery realm for? And these four people had already set up tents to rest? Was this not a joke?

Qi Shuang and Yuan finally understood why their academy was ranked so low. Not only were they missing a member, but Ling Han and the others were more so treating this competition with a passive attitude. It would be shocking if they could enter the top 200 with this attitude.

While furious at Ling Han and the others’ attitude, the two of them were also annoyed at Xun Feng and the others’ inaction. Why didn’t they stop Ling Han?

They were embarrassing themselves at the Thousand Academy Tournament, and this truly made them want to dig a hole to bury themselves in.

“Haha! Which academy are they from?” someone asked.

“Not sure, it seems like their first time here.”

“Heh, their first time? They’re unclear about the situation, so they’re treating it like an outdoor camping trip?”

“Hmm? I feel like I’ve seen them before. I think we arrived at the same time... Ah! It’s the Hundred Battles Academy!”

“What? The Hundred Battles Academy?”

“Hahaha! I’m about to die from laughter! Just because they lost You Yuan, they’ve lost all will and confidence to fight too?”

“Hmph! What use are such people? If they go to the Two Realm Battlefield, they’ll only lose face for our realm!”

The elites all humphed in disdain. They were filled with contempt toward Ling Han and the others’ attitude. Not only were they wasting their own opportunities, but they were also showing great disrespect to the other competitors.

Qi Shuang and Yuan lowered their heads, not wanting to catch the gazes of others. They didn’t want to be pierced by the intense dagger-like glares of everyone.

“Huh? Xu Xing is coincidentally there as well.”

“They’re about to encounter each other.”

“Haha, it is time for them to experience a bitter lesson. This is no place for holidays!”

Excitement suddenly swept through the crowd. The terrifying youth was nearing the lake, and when he arrived, he would definitely see the four tents that had been erected next to it.

Everyone looked toward the smooth stone. They were eager with anticipation.

Inside the mystery realm.

Ling Han and the others were enjoying their meal when the Empress and Hu Niu suddenly faltered and paused in their movements. They then looked to the left in unison. There, they discovered an approaching youth from the Demon Race. His advance wasn’t quick, yet his aura was absolutely petrifying. It was as if he were carrying celestial bodies with him, with his every step shaking heaven and earth. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ling Han and Bewitching Maiden Rou didn’t react. The former had discovered the demon long ago, yet he didn’t give a toss about him at all. Meanwhile, the latter genuinely hadn’t noticed the demon. Only when she realized that the Empress and Hu Niu had been staring at that place for a while did she dazedly raise her head.

“Hand over your beacons, and then p*ss off!” the youth said coldly. As he spoke, his wings unfurled slightly, revealing his arrogant and haughty demeanor. Ling Han smiled and said, “If you want to eat together, you’re welcome to take a seat. If you want to fight, however, please wait for us to finish eating first.”

This youth was naturally none other than Xu Xing. He looked at Ling Han in astonishment. This person was truly courageous, daring to speak to him in such a teasing manner. He chuckled coldly, and said, “You don’t have the right to sit with me!”

He strode toward Ling Han and the others, unleashing his boundless might as he did so. He was much like an indomitable demon god.

Even though Hu Niu and the Empress hadn’t advanced to the Eleventh Leaf yet, they were still Tenth Leaf monarch stars, so they naturally wouldn’t be suppressed by this aura. Only Bewitching Maiden Rou showed slight signs of discomfort. After all, her cultivation was relatively inferior.

Ling Han retrieved an empty wine glass, and filled it up before tossing it to Xu Xing. His action was steady, and not a drop of wine was wasted.

“I already said, you people aren’t worthy!” Xu Xing said with a humph. He threw a punch, yearning to shatter the glass of wine.

After he threw the punch, however, his expression changed slightly. The wine glass was imbued with a strong power of Regulation, and he was surprisingly unable to shatter it. With the might of his punch, this power of Regulation was also just exhausted, causing the wine glass to instantly stop before him. Under the force of gravity, this wine glass then fell toward the ground.

Xu Xing’s expression changed again.

Pa!

He reached out and grabbed the wine glass.

If he had shattered the wine glass with a single punch, that would naturally have been the end of that. However, the situation now was different. Ling Han had precisely calculated the power of his punch, and delivered the wine of glass before him. If Xu Xing hadn’t grabbed it, the wine would have spilled before him, resulting in his humiliation.

Thus, he had no option but to grab it.

When Ling Han had offered him the wine, he had insisted that Ling Han was not worthy. Now, however, he had grabbed it. This was clearly his loss.

Yet, there was nothing he could do about this. Was it not his fault that he had underestimated Ling Han’s strength? He had already lost when he threw the punch.

He indeed hadn’t taken Ling Han seriously. Even though his punch hadn’t been powerful, it had still allowed him to realize Ling Han’s strength.

“Interesting,” he said with a smile, showing his snow-white teeth. He appeared like a vicious beast. “I don’t want to eliminate such an opponent here. I’ll wait for you in the individual tournament. Hopefully, you won’t disappoint me.” He gave a hearty laugh before turning around to leave.

He was raging with fighting spirit. However, fighting here wouldn’t satiate his thirst. After all, there were far too many restrictions.

Thus, he could only endure.

Ling Han smiled faintly. His hands trembled slightly. Of course, this naturally wasn’t due to fear. Instead, it was because of excitement.

This opponent reminded him of Ji Wuming. He was astonishingly powerful.

They would meet again during the ranking battles for the Elite Leaderboard.

The two of them clearly valued each other as opponents. However, the spectators outside could only see the stream, and they were unable to hear the sounds inside the mystery realm. Thus, they were all extremely confused. Why had one of them offered a glass of wine? And why had the other accepted it and then left?

Perhaps they were already acquainted?

“How lucky,” the elites mumbled in displeasure.

They stopped paying attention to Ling Han and the others. This was because the live stream’s focus had changed, moving on from Ling Han and the others. It was now focusing on another area.

In the blink of an eye, 15 days had already passed. The hidden beacons had almost all been found and collected, and some of the teams started to go into hiding. Others swept through the mystery realm, hoping to obtain more beacons.

“It’s time to set off,” Ling Han said with a smile.
