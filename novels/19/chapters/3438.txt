Chapter 3439′. Rumors abound

Translator: Henyee Translations , Editor: Henyee Translations

Cui Zhenhai was suppressed by the formation spirit. When the news of this battle spread out, it caused a great commotion in various ancient sites.

Those Celestial Path elites that had mysteriously appeared all released those that they had forcefully detained. Instead, they used the teaching of supreme Dao as bait, tempting others to become their disciples.

This move was very useful. Who did not want to become an elite, high and mighty, looking down on all life?

However, it was too difficult to enter the Imperial Capital Academy. In the past, only nobles were recruited. Now, though the restrictions had been lifted, the entry requirements were still too high, blocking a large number of people outside.

Now that the Celestial Path elites had established their own sects, and were about to pass on supreme Dao, who would not be delighted?

Moreover, the formation spirit’s message from the Holy Emperor was also very clear. As long as it didn’t violate the Majestic Empire’s laws, Chen Fengyan had the magnanimity to accommodate the world.

Thus, joining these sects to cultivate was not a betrayal of the Majestic Empire.

All of a sudden, the whole nation was stirred up. A large number of young people headed to those ancient sites respectively, hoping to change their destiny.

However, the Imperial Capital was naturally different.

The Council Chairman issued a strict decree, forbidding the children of officials and generals of the Majestic Empire from entering these sects. They could only be sent to the academy opened by the Majestic Empire.

With such a strict rule in place, naturally no one dared to disobey.

Enrolling into a sect was not against the law, but disobeying orders was a serious crime.

Cultivating required resources, and it was difficult for a poor family to produce a talented son. Thus, those sects had recruited a lot of disciples, but there were very few that could be considered talented, and prodigies could be counted on one’s fingers.

In fact there were also prodigies from the poor. However, because of the conditions of their families, they had missed the best age for cultivation. Now, they still wanted to catch up. Putting aside the question of whether they could or not, they would at least have to pay a price that was several times, or even ten times more.

Ling Han cultivated diligently. Now, the world was becoming more and more lively, and more chaotic. It was all thanks to Chen Fengyan’s personal might that he was able to suppress the world. If there came a day that he was defeated or killed, then this Majestic Empire that had once been strong and prosperous would definitely crumble in a single day. All the prodigies would be divided, and war would break out.

Thus, only when one was strong, would he be able to win respect, and live freely.

He stabilized his cultivation level, then began to continue increasing his cultivation level.

This time, it had been rapidly developed, so it was inevitable that there would be a situation of unstable foundations. Thus, he had to investigate it in advance. He could not leave behind any future trouble.

In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.

Chen Fengyan did not come out of seclusion all this while, nor did he take any action against those Celestial Path elites that had suddenly appeared. As time passed, some people became restless.

“Chen Fengyan should also be in the Foundation Building Tier. However, the imperial Capital has set up the Azure Dragon Formation, and only then was he able to suppress Cui Zhenhai.”

“The power of heaven and earth has just begun to recover. It’s already extremely difficult for one to advance into the Foundation Building Tier, so it’s impossible for one to break through to the next level above Foundation

Building Tier.”

“According to reliable sources, the Demon Emperor managed to block too of

Chen Fengyan’s attacks.”

“The Demon Emperor has just forged the foundation of human Dao. Going by this deduction, Chen Fengyan should be in the late stage or peak stage of the

Foundation Building.”

“At most, he should have forged the foundation of Heavenly Dao.” Rumors spread everywhere, and people spread these rumors as if they were the truth.

“The first step of Celestial Path is Foundation Building Tier?” Ling Han murmured. Based on the rumors, Foundation Building Tier was the next step above Mystery Realm Tier. Of course, Foundation Building Tier was who knew how many times stronger than Mystery Realm Tier. After leaping over the Celestial Gate, the leap in level of being was unimaginable.

“However, that day, the Demonic Rat has said that Chen Fengyan’s cultivation level is not limited to the Core Formation Tier.”

■■Foundation Building Tier is the first step on the Celestial Path, so no matter what, the Core Formation Tier has to be the second step. And in Chen Fengyan’s case, he is at least standing on the third step of the Celestial Path.”

“Hiss!”

Ling Han bared his teeth. Theoretically speaking, it would be very difficult to nurture even Foundation Building Tier cultivators in the present environment of heaven and earth. For example, only the Demon Emperor of the Demon Race had reached this kind of cultivation level, and the Demon Race would have complete coverage of land, sea and air, so the resources they possessed would definitely far surpass the resources of humans. Thus, the Demon Race was so confident that they wanted the Dark North Nation to become their subject.

However, Chen Fengyan’s strength was completely unreasonable. He was standing on the third tier of Celestial Path, or even higher.

How did he cultivate?

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes that day, Ling Han wouldn’t have believed that Chen Fengyan was so powerful. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In terms of cultivation alone, Ling Han definitely didn’t think that Chen Fengyan could reach such a high level. Thus, he definitely possessed an astonishing treasure chamber that allowed him to leave the others far behind.

However, Chen Fengyan probably only had enough resources for himself to use. Thus, even his sons’ cultivation level could only be considered normal.

They were far from being genius freaks.

“Rumors are spreading all over the place. Some are false, and some are real. Those people probably won’t believe the Demonic Rat’s words even if they

heard them.”

“People always believe what they want to believe. Subconsciously, they avoid news that is disadvantageous to them, and treat it as a lie.”

“Going by the look of things, the present peace and quiet would not be able to last much longer. Another storm is about to descend.”

Ling Han shook his head, and cast aside all other thoughts. He then turned his attention to himself.

Two months had passed, and the changes in the environment were abnormally rapid The power of heaven and earth was becoming denser and denser, and cultivating would be half the work and double the effect. Originally, he would need to cultivate for two to three days, but now, he would be able to achieve the corresponding effect in a day.

This gave many new recruits who had just stepped onto the path of martial arts a chance to catch up. If they could obtain a few more Treasured Fruits, it was probable that a large number of young elites of Inscription Tier would soon appear.

Ling Han’s progress wasn’t slow either. He was about to reach the peak stage of Second Extreme.

His greatest improvement in these two months was the use of Heavenly Pattern Jade and Demonic Monkey Fists.

In the case of the Heavenly Pattern Jade, he would only need five seconds to complete the compression of the weight. Furthermore, after advancing into Second Extreme, his Spiritual Power had improved slightly. At most, it could suppress the Heavenly Pattern Jade to the point of 1.4kg.

Though it was only an improvement of toog, but to cut off wog on the basis of 1.5kg, this was more than six percent of improvement.

Unfortunately, the Heavenly Pattern Jade’s speed still couldn’t break through ten times the speed of sound, making Ling Han feel regretful.

If it was the Demonic Monkey Fists, he could now throw punch after punch, and a Demonic Monkey would appear. It was extremely ruthless, boosting the power of his fists and increasing the destructive power.

Right at this moment, a force finally couldn’t hold back and entered into the Imperial Capital.

This was Chaos Origin Sect. An old man brought a young man to the Imperial Capital Academy’s entrance. He didn’t say or do anything, simply sitting cross-legged and blocking the way in and out.

Immediately, guards went up to chase him away, but he spoke up. This time, they had come to challenge the outstanding students of the academy in a one-on-one battle. If anyone could defeat that young man at the same cultivation level or the same age range, they would leave without a second thought. Otherwise, they would be blocking the entrance here for ten days. When the news spread out, it immediately incited the fighting spirit of the students in the academy, and they all came out to issue challenges.

In the end, no matter who made a move, they were easily defeated by that young man.

Like a hurricane, this news spread throughout the entire Imperial Capital. The Chaos Origin Sect had come to provoke them, and there was actually no one from the Imperial Capital Academy that could match him?

This was a very heavy slap to the face. The Imperial Capital Academy had gathered the most outstanding students of the entire Dark North Nation, yet they were actually no match for a sect disciple that had suddenly appeared?

This was the Imperial Capital Academy, so what face would it have left?
