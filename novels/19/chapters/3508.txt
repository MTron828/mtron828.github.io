Chapter 3509: Cauldron Forging Tier elite

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

An elite that was suspected to be a Cauldron Forging Tier elite had caught up!

Princess Bixiao paled in shock. How were they supposed to escape if such an elite pursued them personally?

The golden bull’s speed was indeed fast, but could it be faster than a Celestial that was flying on a sword, er, a spear?

Thankfully, there was a forest here, densely covered with leaves, completely blocking vision, which was very beneficial for those fleeing.

If he couldn’t see them, so what if he was a Cauldron Forging Tier?

However, it was clear that Princess Bixiao had released her breath too soon.

Boom!

A terrifying power blasted down from the skies, and as the attack swept past, the whole forest completely sunk. A frightening hurricane swept out, capable of killing even a Mystery Realm Tier easily.

Fortunately, the golden bull’s body released light in time, forming a shield that protected Ling Han and Princess Bixiao. It withstood such a terrifying impact, and also blocked the hurricane that came later.

After all, this was a war colossus that was invincible against Foundation Building Tier cultivators. Even if it couldn’t match the Cauldron Forging Tier, it could still hold its ground against such a large-scale attack.

But though Ling Han and Princess Bixiao had escaped this calamity, they had also been completely exposed to the range of vision of Xuan Tianling. The next time Xuan Tianling made a move, it would be a targeted attack. Would the golden bull be able to block that?

“Merely two ants, and you actually dare to disobey my words. You are merely Chen Fengyan’s dogs. Do you really think you are him?” Xuan Tianling asked coldly. His palm descended. Boom, it was as if the heavens were collapsing and the earth were cracking, terrifying to the extreme.

This was a Cauldron Forging Tier elite, and was standing on the second level of Celestial Path. The gap between him and a mortal was indescribably wide.

Even if Ling Han was 10,000 times more freakish, facing this attack, his only fate would be death.

The golden bull let out a ‘moo’, opened its mouth and spat out a seal, greeting the incoming attack from the skies. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Peng!

The might of this seal was incredibly powerful. Previously, its strike had already caused cracks to appear on Gongsun Liang’s foundation stone of the Celestial Path, and since the foundation stone of the Celestial Path was called a foundation stone, just how sturdy was it?

However, Xuan Tianling’s attack swept over, and the seal shattered. That giant silver hand continued to descend, wanting to suppress Ling Han, Princess Bixiao and the golden bull together.

“Moo, moo, moo!” The golden bull spat out seals continuously, and spat out seventeen in a single breath. Peng, peng, peng, peng! As they collided endlessly, Xuan Tianling’s attack finally crumbled. That giant silver hand shattered, and turned back into the power of heaven and earth.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao exchanged looks, both frowning.

A Cauldron Forging Tier elite’s casual barrage of attacks was enough to force the golden bull to use its ultimate moves repeatedly to dissipate it. This gap was really too wide. Furthermore, the golden bull’s continuous use of ultimate moves was really too exhausting on the Dao Stone, and in an instant, another quarter of its energy had been depleted.

Originally, in a normal battle, the golden bull could last for as long as three days, but now, to say nothing of three days, even three minutes was barely enough.

“What a good war machine. It would be too much of a waste for it to fall into your hands, so it would be better for me to accept it.” Xuan Tianling moved for the third time. He again stretched out his hand and pressed down on empty air. His own power drew on the power of heaven and earth, which again turned into a large silver hand that grabbed downwards.

His attack was only so simple, but it was incredibly practical, forcing Ling Han to control the golden bull with all his might.

One after another, seals shot out, and finally dispersed this attack. However, there was only less than a quarter of energy from the Dao Stone left.

“Ant, in front of a Celestial, you still want to stubbornly resist?” Xuan Tianling smirked coldly. In his eyes, Ling Han and Princess Bixiao were like two insects, but he had actually failed to apprehend them even after making three attempts, which naturally made him very displeased.

His expression was dark, and his eyes were fixed on Princess Bixiao. There was an indescribable brilliance in his gaze.

Xuan Tianling was also born in the prison. In life, the weak were prey to the strong, and even for those in the Cauldron Forging Tier, they couldn’t be considered elites in the prison. They could only keep a low profile with their tails between their legs.

In that place, he was a weakling, and would not get any benefits.

But after he came out, the whole world suddenly became vast, and also became prosperous all of a sudden, which caused a massive change in his mentality.

From being the weak to becoming an elite, from having nothing to enjoying everything.

Previously, he had enjoyed the pleasure of power, and now that he had seen Princess Bixiao, he had awakened another kind of instinctive need.

He wanted this woman.

“Hahahaha!” He released a carefree laugh, and stretched out his hand again, grabbing out at the golden bull.

The golden bull still could only use seals to disperse the attack, but it was expending too quickly. In a few seconds, the energy of the first Dao Stone was exhausted.

Ling Han hurriedly took out a new Dao Stone to replenish its energy. The golden bull became energetic again, and disintegrated Xuan Tianling’s attack.

Xuan Tianling did not take it to heart either, and asked calmly, “How many moves can you all block from me?”

If it was not for the fact that he had reservations because of Princess Bixiao, he would have long since brandished his spear and delivered a grand attack. It was guaranteed that they would be shattered along with this golden bull.

For the sake of a beauty, he had used this kind of “gentle” attack.

Princess Bixiao was extremely anxious. This Dao Stone from Ling Han was used, and she had the only one left now. However, even if they used all of them, how long would they be able to last?

One minute or two minutes?

She couldn’t help but turn to look at Ling Han, only to see that this man was calm and composed, without the slightest bit of panic.

Things were already so dangerous, yet Ling Han was still able to maintain such composure?

Just how big was this heart?

In the skies, the large hand arrived once more.

The golden bull continued to violently spit out seals to disperse the attacks.

The Dao Stone was expending at an astonishing rate.

In just a few moves, the second Dao Stone had also been exhausted.

Princess Bixiao hurriedly added in the last Dao Stone. Her slender brows were tightly knitted together. What were they supposed to do next?

Was Chen Fengyan’s name enough to scare this Cauldron Forging Tier elite?

“Kaka, Chen Fengyan really thinks highly of you guys. He actually bestowed three Dao Stones on you guys, tsk tsk!” Xuan Tianling naturally knew what was what. This Dao Stone was formed by elites condensing the power of heaven and earth, and there was some kind of great dao contained within. It could both drive the war colossus, and in truth, if it was given to cultivators to use, they would also be able to experience the “Dao” of elites from within.

“However, it’s only three pieces, at most, right?” he asked with a smile. “After this, what will you use to block me?”

Boom, he grabbed out with his palm again.

Ling Han felt a pang of heartache, yet did not hesitate to raise his hand and toss. A chess piece flew out, and shua, it turned into a giant silver elephant. Its two fangs were thick and long, its trunk was also thick and long, and its four legs were thick and long.

With a toss of its trunk, it greeted Xuan Tianling’s attack.

Peng!

Xuan Tianling’s attack was instantly dispersed, and the thick and long trunk also swooshed back into the chess piece, falling once more into Ling Han’s hands.

This was the reward that Ling Han had obtained after he had forcibly broken the chess game in the Young Dragon Trial. It was said that he could use it when he encountered danger, and as expected, it had helped him disperse the attack.

Ling Han took a look, and the elephant on the chess piece had dimmed slightly. As expected, if it was used a few more times, it would completely lose its effect.

“Yi?” Xuan Tianling was surprised. He had not thought that these two minor characters were full of treasures.. Aside from the war colossus and Dao Stone, there was actually something like that?
