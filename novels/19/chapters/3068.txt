3069 Two Enemies Joining Forces

The true body of Extermination, the being who had obliterated the Genesis World of the previous era. Now, some unknown person’s will had taken control of this body and unleashed a devastating power.

This was a power far beyond the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. In fact, this was a power that could almost rival Hysteria’s.

Whoosh!

Hysteria also launched an attack at the same time, swinging a tentacle at Ling Han.

Ling Han threw a fist to meet their attacks.

Boom!

His body shuddered, and he retreated 1500 kilometers.

However, Hysteria and Extermination didn’t fare any better, with Hysteria’s tentacles sent flying and Extermination also sent soaring through the air.

‘What’s going on? The two beasts are actually joining forces?’

Ling Han proudly stood in the sky and peered down at Hysteria and Extermination. He then stared at Extermination, and asked, “The seven of them were coaxed here by you?”

Extermination also stood in the sky, with her clothes fluttering in the gusts of energy. She was breathtakingly beautiful.

“So what if they were? And so what if they weren’t?” she retorted.

Ling Han shook his head, and remarked, “I’m truly becoming more and more confused. You people are actually trying to protect Hysteria? What, have you all gone stupid as well?”

Extermination looked at Ling Han, and said disdainfully, “It’s impossible to have a meaningful conversation with someone as ignorant as yourself.”

Ling Han roared with laughter, and replied, “I can suppress Seventh Tier elites while at the Sixth Tier, so do you have any right to look down on me? Where is your courage coming from? Do you really think you can stop me? I can already rival you now, so it’s only a matter of a few billion years before I can suppress all of you with a single hand.”

“You might be growing more powerful, but are we not also growing more powerful?” Extermination sneered.

Indeed, Extermination had been equally as powerful as Ling Han back then, and she was still equally as powerful as him now, even though he had already advanced in leaps and bounds.

Perhaps Extermination’s speed of advance could truly catch up to Ling Han’s.

“By the looks of it, you obtained many secrets from me at that time!” Ling Han said. During his time in the central region of the Genesis World of the last era, he had been invaded by the “World’s Will.” Even though this had given him the ability to develop new dimensions, it was now clear that many of his secrets had been exposed to his opponent as well.

Theoretically speaking, Extermination shouldn’t have been able to replicate his footsteps even after learning of his secrets. This was because he had completed all of his foundations while still at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Yet, Extermination had surprisingly managed to grow stronger at an incredible pace.

‘Hang on… As long as one obtains the ability to develop new dimensions, they’ll be able to slowly manifest new dimensions even if they only started off with one. Given enough time, won’t they also be able to reach the same level as the Genesis World?’

And just how powerful was Extermination to begin with?

However, she most likely hadn’t transformed into a dimension, so how was she able to suppress Seventh Tier ultimate elites as well?

Perhaps she had also followed the same path as Ling Han, and gathered the power of countless dimensions while still at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier? And this had allowed her to manifest the embryo of a Genesis World in her body? Perhaps her abilities hadn’t been as insane as Ling Han’s back then, and she had only possessed 100 or 200 dimensions. After obtaining the secret of nurturing new dimensions from Ling Han, however, a new door to power had been opened up for her.

“It’s a shame that I wasn’t able to obtain all of your secrets,” Extermination said with a sigh. “Otherwise, would I have left you alive until today?”

Ling Han finally understood why the “World’s Will” had told him to join forces with Extermination at that time. It had said that this was the only way for them to defeat Hysteria. In reality, it was trying to convince Ling Han to reveal his hidden secrets to Extermination.

However, Extermination had been forced to compete with Ling Han for the sake of the secret codes of life, and this had allowed Ling Han to discover some clues and guess the true identity of the “World’s Will”—it was none other than Extermination herself.

Otherwise, Ling Han still had yet to reach the Fifth Tier at that time, and it would have been useless even if he had reached the Fifth Tier. He would have been completely unable to rival Extermination, even after taking into account his ability to travel through dimensions. It was extremely likely that Extermination could have seized an opportunity to kill him.

After all, Extermination was far more powerful than Chong Yan and the others. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What’s this got to do with Hysteria?” Ling Han asked.

“Why should I tell you?” Extermination replied coldly.

Whoosh!

Hysteria swung a tentacle and charged over. Even though it was confused as to why its predecessor was helping it, was there any reason not to take advantage of this situation?

“I’ll stop him! You do what you have to do!” Extermination said as she engaged in an intense battle with Ling Han.

She was truly no weaker than Ling Han. Not only was her power immense, but she could even channel Heavenly Venerable Seals. She was much like a second Ling Han, one that could entirely rival him.

Everyone with a battle prowess at the Seventh Tier was engaged now, meaning that there was no one left to stop Hysteria.

Boom!

Hysteria seized this opportunity to counterattack, furiously attacking cities and engulfing land.

In just a day’s time, it reclaimed all of the lands that it had lost to Ling Han.

With no Seventh Tier ultimate elite to stop him, it continued to charge forward at an increasing speed.

Ling Han ignored Extermination and charged at Hysteria. However, Extermination immediately caught up to him again. The two of them were at a similar power level, so neither of them could easily run away from the other.

Just Extermination alone was able to stop Ling Han. Of course, the inverse was also true, and Ling Han could also stop Extermination. In any case, the prerequisite to all this was the fact that Hysteria was powerful enough. Otherwise, if it were someone like Chong Yan, Ling Han could send them flying to heaven knew where with a single strike.

Hysteria was indeed slightly affected by Ling Han’s attacks. However, this was still nowhere enough to stop its advance.

“Ling Han, abandon your futile struggles and welcome the arrival of a glorious age!” Extermination said. Her battle with Ling Han was genuinely meaningless. He couldn’t wound her, and she couldn’t wound him, either. Neither of them was able to gain an advantage over the other.

Thus, Extermination was clearly unwilling to engage in this battle any longer. Even if she wanted to kill Ling Han, it wouldn’t be right now.

“Humph! Allowing Hysteria to engulf the Genesis World is your so-called glorious age?” Ling Han retorted coldly.

“Have you forgotten what I told you before?” Extermination asked with a proud voice. “The eighth type of power is antithesis. After comprehensive destruction, what will follow is a flourishing world filled with even more life and vitality!”

“What kind of new life will the destruction of the Genesis World bring?” Ling Han questioned calmly.

“Such pathetic sympathy!” Extermination scoffed in a cold voice. “After reaching our level, is there still any need to care about those ants? Ling Han, we can join forces to break out of this small pond.”

“No need!” Ling Han replied in rejection.

“Then drown in the furious tides of time!” Extermination said. She continued to engage with Ling Han, preventing him from charging over to obstruct Hysteria.

The other ultimate elites were also fighting with each other, and this was yet another similarly meaningless battle. None of them suffered any wounds, and none of them were even shedding a single drop of blood. Only Hysteria continued to furiously advance.

Ling Han furrowed his brows. With Extermination and the others stopping them, they would have no way of breaking free to stop Hysteria.

What could they do?

“Leave!” he suddenly exclaimed, using his divine sense to deliver this message.

If this continued, the end result could only be them looking on helplessly as Hysteria engulfed the Genesis World bit by bit. If they left now, however, Ling Han would at least still have the opportunity to cultivate and grow stronger.

Moreover, if they didn’t do anything about this, it wouldn’t be long before Hysteria reached the Profound Negative Realm, where Ling Han and Lin Luo’s friends and families were located.

Thus, their best option right now was to retreat.

Lin Luo and the others were all Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, people who understood when to advance and when to retreat. They made up their minds in a split second, and they immediately dashed over to gather with Ling Han.
