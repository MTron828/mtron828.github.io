Chapter 1618: A Wisp of Celestial Qi

Ling Han’s Dao Manifestation towered into the sky, a bronze dragon in its hand. It was like a God of War, a Dragon Slayer. This was an astounding sight, one that snatched the attention of everyone, and caused them to involuntarily hold their breath.

The women of the Long Tribe all had stars in their eyes, their expressions dreamy and intoxicated.

Ling Han looked at Zhong Badu, and calmly asked, “Got any more attacks?”

His voice was calm, yet it carried a hint of killing intent.

In any case, he had already made an enemy of the Open Clouds Forbidden Land, so he might as well take things even further and directly kill Zhong Badu.

Anyhow, he had destroyed their wedding, so would the Open Clouds Forbidden Land let him off the hook? Impossible! That being the case, it was only natural for him to kill Zhong Badu first. At any rate, he didn’t like this person anyway.

Moreover, this wedding would only be considered as completely and thoroughly ruined if he killed Zhong Badu.

Zhong Badu’s aura of might was instantly shattered by Ling Han’s attack. The Time Dragon was one of his trump cards, yet it had actually failed to injure even one hair of Ling Han’s. This was a huge blow to his confidence.

At this moment, he couldn’t help but think, ‘Will I actually be defeated?’

However, he immediately shook his head to rid himself of this thought. This was impossible! And he wouldn’t allow it to happen, either!

He was a Saint, and he was more so a supreme prodigy of the Open Clouds Forbidden Land. As such, how could he lose to a youth, one who was only at the Eternal River Tier?!

“Nine Meridians Celestial Sword!” he roared. Wisps of celestial light instantly rose from nine meridians inside his body. He then retrieved and activated a Saint Tool, which lit up with an array of symbols and unleashed a boundless saintly might.

However, this wasn’t the most terrifying aspect of his attack. Celestial light continued to gather inside his body, forming a razor-sharp blade on the tip of his sword.

After imbuing his Saint Tool with a wisp of Celestial Qi, its sharpness was now imposing and overwhelming.

To say nothing of Ling Han—a measly Eternal River Tier cultivator—even Small Saints and Medium Saints wouldn’t dare to be struck by this Saint Tool. If they were struck, the Celestial Qi contained within the Saint Tool would instantly obliterate their divine sense.

This secret technique... was a Celestial King Tier technique! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, it was a shame that the Open Clouds King had only obtained an incomplete copy of this Celestial King Tier technique. While breaching the underground palace storage to steal this Celestial King Tier technique, the Heavenly River King had severed one of his dragon claws, and also obliterated a large portion of the scroll that held the Celestial King Tier technique.

Although the damaged scroll was still relatively precious, enabling those at the Genesis Tier to cultivate a wisp of Celestial Qi and boundlessly raise their battle prowess, it was ultimately not powerful enough to help them open the gates to the Celestial Realm anymore. Otherwise, the Open Clouds King would have entered the Celestial Realm long ago. There was simply no way he would be content with remaining in the Immortal Realm.

In any case, would this technique not be powerful enough to deal with a measly Eternal River Tier cultivator?

A look of apprehension spread across Ling Han’s face as he glanced at the Saint Tool. He could detect from this Saint Tool an aura that was similar to that of his Divine Demon Sword.

Celestial level power!

However, compared to his Divine Demon Sword, the Celestial level power of this Saint Tool was far too weak. In fact, it was so weak that it was barely detectable.

Even so, Ling Han didn’t dare to underestimate it. After all, Celestial level power was a huge threat to any cultivator of the Immortal Realm.

“Die!” Zhong Badu bellowed as he charged at Ling Han, sword in hand.

In the beginning, he had been content with engaging in long-distance battle. After all, this was the battle style that cultivators were the most familiar with. Now, however, he was doing the exact opposite. He wanted to engage in close-quarter combat with Ling Han. This was because Saint Tools were the most effective when they directly struck their target.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Heavenly bodies quaked and the entire galaxy shuddered as the Saint Tool swept through the vacuum. The wisp of Celestial Qi on the tip of the sword was immensely destructive toward the space of the Immortal Realm, and it viciously tore through the void, forming numerous black holes in its wake.

Ling Han shook his right hand, and summoned the Divine Demon Sword.

‘If we’re going to compete in terms of Saint Tools, who’s more afraid of whom?’

Clang, clang, clang, clang!

The Divine Demon Sword continued to clash with Zhong Badu’s Saint Tool. Both had a toughness of Level 17 Godly metal, and thus it was only natural that neither was able to defeat the other. However, the Divine Demon Sword was a Celestial Tool in its essence, so even though it hadn’t fully awakened yet, it was still hundreds of times more powerful than the Saint Tool that only contained a wisp of Celestial Qi.

After continuously clashing many times, the Celestial Qi on the Saint Tool finally started to waver. Like a struggling fish on land, it looked like it was about to die out at any moment.

“What?!”

Zhong Badu was truly flustered at this moment. The Nine Meridians Celestial Sword was his most powerful technique. In fact, the Nine Meridians Celestial King had once killed a Celestial King in a single strike after unleashing this technique. Now, however, this technique was about to be shattered under Ling Han’s relentless attacks? Just how unfathomable was this?

“I’ll kill you first, and I’ll send the Open Clouds King to hell to meet up with you later!” Ling Han said. He unleashed the Nine Heavens Flame from his left hand as he continued to brandish the Divine Demon Sword with his right. These flames were also at the Celestial King level. Even though he was unable to unleash their full power because he was still extremely weak now, Zhong Badu was also only at the Immortal level as well.

“W-who in the world are you?!” Zhong Badu asked in a quiet voice.

By the looks of it, it seemed like there was great animosity between Ling Han and the Open Clouds Forbidden Land.

“You don’t need to know. Now, rest in peace!” Ling Han activated all of the killing formations in his body, causing his battle prowess to rise explosively. In combination with his Divine Demon Sword and Nine Heavens Flame, he was already close to invincible among the level of Small Saints.

“Damn it!” Zhong Badu brandished his sword to parry, yet he was pushed back dozens of kilometers each time he blocked. He was being completely overwhelmed by Ling Han.

What terrified him the most was the sword and flames in Ling Han’s hands. They were far too petrifying. In fact, he felt like he would face instant death if he came into contact with either of the two. This apprehension undoubtedly hindered his ability to battle at his full potential.

He felt a strong urge to distance himself from Ling Han, yet this was easier said than done. After all, it was he who had actively charged over just then.

Meanwhile, Ling Han formed a cage with his Nine Heavens Flame to prevent Zhong Badu from escaping. They would fight to the death inside this flaming cage.

Pu!

Zhong Badu spat out a mouthful of blood, an incredulous look on his face. He was no match for Ling Han, even in close-quarter combat!

This realization almost drove him crazy. He was a Small Saint, yet his power was actually inferior to that of a measly Eternal River Tier cultivator?

This was simply unfathomable, even if his opponent was at the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier!

“Three strikes, and you’ll be on your way to the afterlife!” Ling Han said coldly.

“In your dreams!” Zhong Badu said with clenched teeth. He started to combust his Source Power in a last-ditch attempt to escape.

However, would his actions faze Ling Han?

Trapped inside the cage formed by the Nine Heavens Flame, it was simply impossible for him to escape!

“Have mercy!” a melodious yet grave voice suddenly said. This voice had abruptly arrived from Gathered Seas Planet after cutting across vast expanses of space.

Dragon’s might surged throughout the space, tumultuous as a tsunami.

“Our respects to Ancestor!” The members of the Long Tribe all kneeled down on a single knee. Even Long Yushan wore a respectful expression, her hands obediently by her sides.

The owner of this voice was none other than the ancient ancestor of the Long Tribe, a formidable Medium Saint!

Zhong Badu instantly regained his composure. His saintly battle against Ling Han had been so intense that it had even caught the attention of the secluding ancient ancestor of the Long Tribe. Now that he was aware of the situation, could this ancient ancestor allow Ling Han to kill him before his very eyes?

Of course he couldn’t! Or else the Long Tribe would also be dragged into this mess!

Choosing inaction while seeing him being killed—what kind of message would that be sending?

Ling Han paid no heed to the voice. He had already made his decision, and no one was going to change his mind.

‘Die!’

Zhong Badu was already starting to relax, yet Ling Han’s reaction instantly caused his hair to stand on ends.

‘How are you so stubborn? A Medium Saint has already spoken, yet you’re still not heeding his words?’

He had no choice but to raise his arms to parry. Unsurprisingly, he spat out another mouthful of blood as he was sent stumbling back by Ling Han’s overwhelming power.

“I said... stop!” A loud roar traveled over from Gathered Seas Planet again. This time, however, the dragon’s might became tangible, with a crimson True Dragon materializing in the air as the voice boomed over. This True Dragon then swooped down at Ling Han.

Ling Han completely ignored this True Dragon as he frenziedly swung his sword at Zhong Badu.

He was hellbent on killing this person.

Peng!

The crimson True Dragon crashed into the cage that was formed from the Nine Heavens Flame, the powerful impact instantly shattering the cage. However, the Nine Heavens Flame was far too high in quality as well, so it also incinerated the crimson True Dragon into nothingness.

Zhong Badu seized this opportunity to flee.

“Third strike!” Ling Han’s ice-cold voice suddenly said from behind him.
