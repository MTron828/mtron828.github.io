1343 The Bringer of Misfortune is Here

The lower-level disciples of the Heaven’s Sword Palace might not know who Ling Han was, but among the higher-ups, he was definitely notorious and known to all.

The main culprit that had brought the Lower Realm into the Immortal Realm through opening the sky.

A freak that had advanced to the Sun Moon Tier in a mere 10 years’ time, and a great enemy that possessed the ability to threaten the existence of the Five Sects!

Now, this powerful enemy had actually come quietly to the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

Gasp! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Cheng Yuan’s hair was standing on ends due to his intense anxiety. His aura had also become extremely unstable. Peng, the Red Headscarf immediately became unlucky—he was instantly sent flying by the force of his aura alone. His face landed on the ground first, and he immediately broke several more teeth, which caused him much depression.

What kind of bad luck was he in?

“Ling, Ling Han!” Cheng Yuan called out in spite of himself. His voice was extremely shrill, and it was sharp enough that practically no one could tell that this kind of voice had come from a man’s mouth.

Ling Han?

The other disciples were all baffled. Could it be that Uncle Cheng Yuan knew this young man? Hold on, Ling? Could he be a descendant of Great Ancestor Ling? But then why was he with the people from the Yang Clan? Could it be that he was the black sheep of the Ling Clan?

Cheng Yuan did not say another word. Immediately, he threw up his hand, and pa, a firework immediately bloomed in the skies.

This was no ordinary firework, but rather the alert signal unique to the Heaven’s Sword Palace. As the fireworks danced, a shock wave swept out in all directions, instantly enshrouding the whole Heaven’s Sword City. It even radiated to several thousand miles away, transmitted to the other four sects.

The expressions of the Red Headscarf and the others all changed swiftly. Among the alert signals of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, there was a total of five colors: crimson, red, green, blue, and purple, with the purple warning indicating the lowest level of danger, while crimson would mean that it was a matter that concerned the continuing existence of the sect.

The worst they had seen was the green-colored signal, and the red signal had never been used before, what more the crimson one.

Cheng Yuan releasing the purple warning signal was obviously because of Ling Han, yet could such an ordinary-looking young man really be such a huge threat that he could threaten the survival of the Heaven’s Sword Palace?

Xiu, xiu, xiu. It was in that short instant that several dozen figures flew over, and the number was still increasing.

The Five Sects were more fortunate. When the troops of the Netherworld retreated, the majority of their members had also returned to their respective sects. All the elites of the Sun Moon Tier dared not leave, keeping their guard at all times against the possibility of Ling Han’s arrival. Thus, they had avoided the calamity in this manner.

Now that they saw the crimson signal, the elites naturally would immediately arrive.

“Ling Han!”

“It’s that brat!”

“Damn it, he actually really dared to come.”

“Quick, activate the Great Protective Formation, then bring out the ancestral weapon to kill this brat!”

A whole group of people were making a ruckus, and they were all the mighty figures in the eyes of these disciples. Even if a mountain collapsed in front of them, they would usually not twitch an eyebrow, yet all of them were extremely anxious now, and there was no difference between them and ordinary people.

This caused the Red Headscarf and the others to feel astonished. Who exactly was this person in front of them? Could it be that he was a bringer of misfortune?

An old man appeared, and solemnly called out to Jiang Qiaoling, “Qiao’er, come back!”

This was the leader of the Yang Faction. His name was Yang Jin, and he was also Jiang Qiaoling’s maternal great-great-great-grandfather. When he saw his own descendant was standing next to a bringer of misfortune like Ling Han, his heart instantly shuddered. He thought that this girl was really outrageously bold.

Jiang Qiaoling was involuntarily shocked. This old friend of her father was a little too awesome, wasn’t he? He had actually caused so many elites of the sect to mobilize; had this ever happened before?

At least, as far as she knew, the answer was no.

Though she was usually mischievous and very headstrong, with Yang Jin being so strict, she did not dare defy his command. Immediately, she walked over to Yang Jin, but couldn’t help from turning her head around to look. No matter how she looked at him, she only thought that Ling Han had delicate features, and did not look anything like a very violent, dangerous character.

Not until Jiang Qiaoling had come to his side did Yang Kin breathe a sigh of relief. He thought that though Ling Han was extremely evil, he was still quite straightforward and upright in his ways; at least, and was not in the habit of using a weaker person as a hostage.

“Ling Han, you are really outrageously bold. You even dare to barge into the Heaven’s Sword Palace; are you not afraid that you will die here?” an old man asked menacingly. He was the leader of the Ling Faction, Ling Kongcheng.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Go and call Jiang Yuefeng over. I have questions to ask him.”

“Humph, you’re here in our sect, and you still want to issue orders?” Yang Jin humphed. At this moment, the Great Protective Formation had already been activated, and the ancestral weapon of the Heaven’s Sword Palace had also been brought out. With a flash, it flew out from a certain corner of the city and was aloft in the skies, exuding a frightening might.

This Great Protective Formation had been strengthened through who knew how many years, and so had the ancestral weapon. Any one of them would be able to match a cultivator in the middle stage of the Sun Moon Tier, or even peak stage, and if the two were used together, they also had the ability to strengthen each other and boost the might to a higher level; they could even stand against the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier.

That also meant that when the Heaven’s Sword Palace started a war, it was equivalent to them having an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, though it was only one in the early stage of low extreme.

But how astonishing was it to cross the gap from the Sun Moon Tier to Heavenly Body Tier?

Now that the two deadly weapons were out, those of the Heaven’s Sword Palace were finally calm and unhurried. Now, Ling Han only had two options to choose from: he could either fight or flee, but whether he chose to fight or flee, the result would not change—he was destined to die in this place.

He had really delivered himself right into a trap!

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “I have seen one of you years ago when I was still in the Lower Realm, and now, 20 years later, I can finally see the true faces of you animals. I am truly feeling rueful at this moment.”

“How dare you!!” another old man rebuked. Four Suns and Moons appeared behind him, exuding a slight aura, and causing the air around him to immediately begin burning.

The others all looked furious as well. He had come to the Heaven’s Sword Palace, and he still dared to insult them as animals. He was really being too arrogant. Could it be that he didn’t know that he was currently trapped in an ultimate killing formation, and there was also an ancestral weapon above him that was aimed right at him?

Meanwhile, Jiang Qiaoling bore an expression of admiration. Whether Ling Han was friend or enemy, he deserved to be admired just for his air of majesty.

However, why was this man also named Ling Han? It had to be known that her father’s master was called this name as well. Ling Han had also said that he was an old friend of her father, so it was definitely impossible that he shared the same name as the founder.

...Could it be?

A theory came up in her mind, but she quickly shook her head. That was too much of an exaggeration. How could this brat possibly be her father’s master? If that was really the case, if the fact that she had called him uncle all this while came to be known to her old man, he would definitely beat her pert bottom black and blue.

Wasn’t that deceiving his master and eliminating her ancestor?

“Activate the killing formation to kill this brat!” Yang Jin commanded darkly.

“All right, I will take charge of the ancestral weapon!” Ling Kongcheng said.

Though he and Yang Jin had competed with each other over the majority of their lives, in front of a shared enemy, they were standing on the same side. Internal strife was internal strife, and they were fighting over power within the sect, but if they could not unite against an outsider and the Heaven’s Sword Palace was finished, what chance would they have for internal strife?

“Eight Spiritual Divine Ghost!” Yang JIn tapped his own forehead, and weng, the formation that enshrouded the whole Heaven’s Sword City was immediately activated. A colossal black-colored human-shaped monster appeared. It was about 300 meters tall, its hand wielding a short staff. The moment it appeared, it was exuding an extremely fearful and evil aura, and even the heaven and earth paled in color.

What an evil entity!
