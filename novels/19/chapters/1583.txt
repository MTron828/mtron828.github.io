Chapter 1584: One word, kill!

The three members of the Tan Clan all covered their faces, their expressions filled with shock.

Ling Han actually came out, and even gave them each a hard slap.

Actually, they felt that it was nothing strange for Ling Han to have come out. As long as he was not made out of clay, no one would be able to tolerate such insults. But Ling Han had sent all three of them flying with a single slap; this was something that they could not accept.

He was just in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier; how could he be this powerful?

“You, you actually dared to attack?” One of the clansmen from the Tan Clan regained his senses, and harshly rebuked Ling Han. His name was Tan Bing, and he was already at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, but he was still very far from breaking through to the pinnacle level.

He did not dare believe this. He was a rank three king tier himself, and furthermore, his cultivation level was much higher than Ling Han, yet he was actually no match for the latter.

“Who asked you guys to insult me?” Ling Han sneered.

“We had not broken any of the rules of this place,” Tan Bing declared menacingly. They had only splashed a bit of dog’s blood, and thrown out a few insults. There were definitely no rules in the Green River Valley that said that such actions would be punished.

In truth, those that could enter into the Green River Valley were all king among kings, so who among the mighty figures here would have predicted that someone would actually do something so despicable.

But Ling Han was a different story. Without getting the approval of others, he had immediately moved. Furthermore, he had dealt injury. This was a serious breach of the rules.

The three members of the Tan Clan actually had a very simple motive for doing this, and that was to anger Ling Han, causing him to do something that broke the rules. Then, the conservative party would be able to move and apprehend Ling Han, and did not need to care about those people from the open-minded party.

Once he fell into their hands, what kind of secret could Ling Han still continue to keep?

Those were all mighty figures that stood at the apex of divine dao. Searching his soul would merely be as easy as stretching out their hand.

But by that time, Ling Han’s secret would not possibly belong solely to the Tan Clan, and definitely would have to be shared with the other Forbidden Lands. Though this was a small flaw, the Tan Clan could not only get their revenge, but also obtain the Celestial King technique, so what else would they be dissatisfied about?

Now, Ling Han had indeed been angered, and had also broken the rules. However, Tan Bing, too, had sustained a slap, which made him very furious.

In his eyes, if Ling Han was unwilling to submit, and made an aggressive move, it should have been him that would personally take him down.

“The rules cannot be broken; you are destined to suffer the consequences of your own actions!” Tan Bing exclaimed coldly. So what if you obtained momentary pleasure and gave me a slap? The price you would pay for this action was your very life.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “You have not seen when I truly break the rules. However, you will be able to see it very soon... That’s right, do you guys have any last words?”

He asked very generously.

“Hahahaha, do you really dare to kill us?” Tan Bing laughed coldly; his expression was completely menacing. The other two members of the Tan Clan stood next to him, also wearing cold smirks on their faces. What a real joke. Previously, they had only been caught off guard by Ling Han, and it was impossible that history would repeat itself now.

Moreover, the mighty figures were not people to be trifled with, either. Since Ling Han had already made a move, it was definite that powerful figures of Black Demon-level would appear, and by then, so what if Ling Han was a big shot among the disciples here? He would only be suppressed.

“Are those your last words?” Ling Han shook his head, appearing to feel sorry for them.

Around them, there were already a great many disciples watching the excitement, but none of them said a single word. Everyone was smart and knew that the matter this time around implicated the conflict between the two voices in the alliance. Though they might be prodigies, if they interfered, it was guaranteed that they would definitely be crushed into dust.

Ling Han had moved to cause injury, and this could be either a very big issue or a very small issue. If the open-minded party had the upper hand, they would naturally be able to turn what would have been a big problem into a small problem, and a casual rebuke would settle the matter. But if it was the conservative party that had the advantage, what would have been a small issue would be magnified.

“Ling Han, you are too arrogant!” Tan Bing smirked coldly. “You are only an outsider, and just because a few grand elders have a high opinion of you, you refuse to adhere to the rules, and casually injure others! You are like this even now, so how much worse would you be when you became a Demon Master?”

“Someone like you should be imprisoned and heavily punished!”

“That’s right, every clan has its rules, and every country has its laws!”

The three members of the Tan Clan berated Ling Han continuously. By now, they naturally needed not to have any more reservations, and could just say whatever they liked.

Ling Han did not say anything else. He drew out the Divine Demon Sword.

“Haha, you are really committing rebellion!” Tan Bing exclaimed balefully, yet took the initiative to attack Ling Han first.

“Standing out is not something so pleasant to do!” Ling Han stated calmly, and suddenly charged, delivering a strike with his sword.

Pu!

A human head suddenly flew into the skies, and it was accompanied by a fountain of blood gushing forth. Peng, Tan Bing’s headless body crumpled onto the ground, while his head showed an expression of absolute disbelief. However, his divine sense had no means of leaving his physical body, and having his vital point directly slashed by the Divine Demon Sword, well, at least no one in the Eternal River Tier would be able to survive that.

He had died with remaining grievances.

At that moment, everyone was stunned, and could not release a single sound.

Mad, this guy must have gone mad to actually dare commit murder in the Green River Valley.

Previously, though Ling Han had broken the rules, as long as some mighty figure had been willing to support him, a casual reprimand would’ve easily settled the matter. After all, he had not wounded anyone. But the situation was different now; the situation had culminated in death.

Now that someone had died, the nature of the matter had become more serious and was a vicious incident.

“You, you, you...” The remaining two members of the Tan Clan were both pointing at Ling Han, their voices trembling so much they could not speak clearly.

“Just three clowns; did you really think you had been assigned an easy task?” Ling Han shook his head with a smirk. “You guys are really idiots, not even aware of the fact that you have been sold. If I don’t kill you, the crime will be too light—did you guys really think that if I just gave you a slap, there would be someone out to target me?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The two members of the Tan Clan couldn’t help but shiver; what Ling Han said... was logical! Otherwise, this little bit of time from the moment their conflict began until now was enough for the powerful figures in the alliance to appear, yet why had there been no reaction at all?

But you clearly knew this fact, so why had you still dared to make a move? Had you gone mad?

Ling Han broke into a grin. “I have not gone mad. It’s just killing a few idiots, no big deal about it! You guys have been scuttling around all these days, and I have given you guys a chance, but you all are so determined to seek death, so I can only send you on your way.”

He moved, brandishing his sword. The 27 killing formations inside his body were channelled, and the two were completely no match for him.

Pu, pu, another two human heads flew up, blood gushing forth like a fountain.

Everyone was watching in shock, dumbfounded. Though these three members of the Tan Clan could only be considered the weakest among them in terms of strength, they were still heirs of a Forbidden Land, and could be considered prodigies themselves, yet they had been slaughtered as if they were just chickens.

Ling Han’s courage was commendable, but it was bloody courage, and definitely could not be seen as an example.

“Humph!” A cold humph rang out. It was as if it came from the depths of Nine Hells—astonishingly malicious. Next, several golden pathways spread over. A few Demon Masters had arrived, and they were not Yellow Demons, either, but rather Black Demons.

“Ling Han, how dare you!!” It was Ye Chengzhang. When Ling Han had first arrived, it was he and Zheng Jing who had been in charge of helping Ling Han settle in.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and retorted, “As a cultivator, I should be decisive.”

Zheng Jing was also there, and he said, “You are drawing calamity onto yourself!” His face had an expression that said that he expected better from Ling Han. He was in fact from the open-minded party, but a Black Demon did not have much say in an argument of this level.

As long as Ling Han did not kill anyone, they would be able to save him, but now, sigh!
