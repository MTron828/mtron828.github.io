Chapter 1722: Extraordinary

“Hahahaha!” The large black dog was rolling on the floor and laughing.

Upon hearing Ling Han’s words, and upon seeing the large black dog’s laughter, Ding Yaolong and Han Lu were both angered to the extreme.

‘What a d-detestable brat!’

If they still hadn’t understood that everything was Ling Han’s doing at this moment, then they would have wasted their cultivation as fourth severance grand elders.

This brat was far too audacious! He was only at the Genesis Tier, yet he actually dared to act so wantonly!

Where had his courage come from?

What an absolute madman!

Meanwhile, Mao Dai and the others were also deeply astonished. They hadn’t imagined that all of this had been triggered by Ling Han. More importantly, he had actually admitted his crime! And he was even provoking them further!

Provoking two fourth severance grand elders would indeed give one a sense of achievement. However, did Ling Han still want to live?

Ding Hu roared in anger and charged at Ling Han again. He hated Ling Han with a passion, and it looked like he wanted to skin Ling Han alive and swallow him whole at this moment.

Perhaps Ling Han was the only Genesis Tier cultivator in this world who could enrage Severing Mundane Tier grand elders to such a degree.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ding Hu launched a flurry of attacks, while Ling Han raised his arms to block. His battle prowess was still far inferior to first severance grand elders, so he could only passively withstand these attacks. However, his physique was far too powerful, so these attacks were unable to even make him vomit blood.

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this, and there was the sound of many people gulping. This was inconceivable!

The defenses of a Genesis Tier cultivator could become this powerful?!

If someone said that Ding Hu was still acting at this moment, who would believe them?

“Humph!” Han Lu chuckled coldly as he grabbed at Ling Han.

Boom!

His large hand transformed into a pitch-black mountain that was intertwined with the great dao. It was incredibly powerful.

“Tight situation! Retreat!” the large black dog shouted as he hurriedly spread his legs and ran. He was extremely slippery, and his speed was also incredibly quick.

“I’ll hitch a ride,” Ling Han said as he grabbed onto the large black dog’s tail.

Whoosh!

Because of the large black dog’s incredible speed, Ling Han started to billow in the wind like a flag.

“Let go of me! You’re too heavy!” the large black dog shouted. “Stinky brat, you didn’t sh*t in the morning, did you? Your entire tummy is full of sh*t!”

“No worries, I believe in you!” Ling Han said with a hearty laugh.

“But Grandpa Dog doesn’t believe in himself!” the large black dog said as he wagged his tongue. He started to run even quicker.

Boom!

A giant hand slammed down behind them, yet it completely missed its target. The large black dog was far too quick. Anyhow, this was expected for someone who always ran around causing trouble.

“Trying to escape?” Ding Yaolong charged over, his body wrapped within intertwining Regulations. In fact, these Regulations had already shrouded his entire body.

No one could understand the fury and hate in his mind at this moment. The ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan had been obliterated, yet he couldn’t do anything to the person who had committed this crime. Moreover, the true perpetrator was actually a measly Genesis Tier cultivator! Not only that, but this was a cultivator he had personally allowed into the Ding Clan!

He had to shoulder these consequences!

He was a f*cking sinner of the Ding Clan!

Swoosh!

Ding Yaolong accelerated, and his speed was surprisingly even quicker than the large black dog’s. He had combusted his life force to forcefully raise his speed. Although he could only maintain this speed for a short period of time, could Ling Han—a measly Genesis Tier cultivator—still escape from him once he caught up?

“Die!” he roared in fury as he mercilessly lashed out at Ling Han.

Han Lu’s mind wavered. He had initially wanted to stop Ding Yaolong because there was most likely some Celestial King Tier cultivation technique hidden in Ling Han’s body. However, after some consideration, he felt that he could still obtain these secrets even if Ling Han were killed. He simply needed to retrieve Ling Han’s fragmented soul in a timely manner.

Moreover, the Ding Clan was indeed innocent, yet he had still obliterated their ancestral shrine just then, so he couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. Of course, if the most powerful being of the Ding Clan had only been at the third severance, then he wouldn’t have taken this matter to heart at all. However, Ding Yaolong was more powerful than him! Thus, he was naturally feeling a little apprehensive.

What if Ding Yaolong went wild without any regard for the consequences?

The difference between being in the right and being in the wrong was still quite large.

Boom!

A large hand slammed down, blocking all paths of retreat. With the large black dog’s current speed, he definitely couldn’t escape from Ding Yaolong.

However, Ling Han smiled calmly as he furiously kicked the large black dog’s bum.

Peng!

Combining the force of his kick with the current speed of the large black dog, the speed of the large black dog instantly soared by an unfathomable amount. He just barely scraped out of the range of Ding Yaolong’s attacks.

Peng!

The powerful strike of the large hand caused the entire Dark Moon City to shudder. The mortals in the city were all uneasy and fearful. The Celestial Realm was far too stable, so there didn’t exist any notion of earthquakes or mountains collapsing. Thus, the only cause of such a phenomenon was intense battles between elites. If some shock waves swept over, then anyone who came into contact with them would certainly die.

“Ah, Little Han, you died such a wretched death!” the large black dog shouted in the distance. He patted his iron underwear, on which there was the clear outline of a foot. It was extremely evident just how powerful Little Han’s kick had been.

He then patted his chest, and shouted, “How courageous and mighty! You sacrificed your life to save Grandpa Dog! Little Han. I wish you a peaceful journey through the Yellow Spring. Grandpa Dog will definitely burn some paper notes of beautiful women for you. As for revenge... These two baldies have committed so many atrocities, so I’m sure that they’ll definitely die in no time at all. As such, there’s no need for me to deal with them.

“However, it’s a shame about your treasures. If you had already decided on death, you could have at least given those treasures to Grandpa Dog!”

The large black dog’s utterances became more and more preposterous. There was a glimmer in his thieving eyes, and it was clear that he was already coveting the treasures the Ling Han owned.

The furious energy dissipated, and the soaring dust and ashes gradually settled back down. When everything became clear again, disbelief instantly spread across everyone’s faces.

Ling Han... was standing straight and proud!

Pu!

Many people instantly spluttered in shock. Was this brat genuinely at the Genesis Tier? He had treated the attack of a first severance grand elder like a massage on his back, and everyone could still reluctantly accept this. However, he had even withstood the attack of a fourth severance grand elder? What a bloody freak!

There was a faint smile on Ling Han’s face, yet he was actually smiling bitterly in his mind. Fourth severance grand elders were fourth severance grand elders, after all. Just blocking a single attack had already exhausted all of his Origin Power. If Ding Yaolong attacked again, he wouldn’t have the ability to channel his Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to block for a second time. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Huh? Little Han, you didn’t die?” the large black dog said as he wiped the non-existent tears from the corners of his eyes. “You made me cry for nothing... Say, how are you going to compensate Grandpa Dog?”

“Heh.” Ling Han chuckled and ignored the large black dog. He then turned his gaze toward Han Lu and Ding Yaolong, and said, “What kind of fourth severance grand elders are you two? One of you couldn’t even touch my sleeves, while the other couldn’t even injure a single finger of mine. Sigh, I feel embarrassed and ashamed for you two. You’ve lived like dogs for all these years!”

“Woof!” the large black dog barked in displeasure in the distance. However, he didn’t dare to leap over and start biting people due to his apprehension toward the two elites.

The expressions of Han Lu and Ding Yaolong were as dark as could be. The abilities of the large black dog and Ling Han had far exceeded their expectations. The former could nimbly dash about the space, while the latter possessed heaven-defying defenses.

“Who in the world are you?!” Han Lu asked gravely.

Firstly, it was impossible for Genesis Tier cultivators to enter the Ancient Realm without the help of at least a Dividing Soul Tier elite. Secondly, unless Ling Han was the successor of some large sect, how could he have possessed such heaven-defying defenses? How could he have survived the attacks of fourth severance grand elders so many times?

Severing Mundane Tier elites should have possessed a crushing advantage over Genesis Tier cultivators—this was a commonly accepted fact.

Yet, this human and dog were far too extraordinary. They definitely had a profound background.
