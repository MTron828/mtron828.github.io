Ling Han believed that his halo of hatred would definitely be effective, and bring him trouble. However, he was fearless, and instead saw it as fun.

However, before this could take effect, Ling Han was called out.

As usual, there would be a lecture on the first day the new students entered the school.

Everyone was summoned to the training ground. The ground here was sandy soil, and even if it was a great battle between Extreme Bone Tier elites, they didn’t have to worry about causing any damage. At most, they could just fill up the sandpit again after the battle.

There were not just 79 new students, but about 100.

…Because there were still freshmen in the Blood Transformation Tier, who did not go through the selections, and directly entered the academy.

“Banner Lord Lian!” Ling Han’s eyes lit up. He saw Lian Xuerong.

Lian Xuerong also saw him and nodded at him. “I knew I would definitely see you here!”

Ling Han laughed. Although he believed in Lian Xuerong’s strength, the beast tide back then was truly terrifying, so he was naturally still a little worried. Now that he saw Lian Xuerong, he finally relaxed.

The two of them should be the only survivors of the Xuanqing Banner. When they talked about the situation that day, they sighed.

“Ling Han!” Someone walked over.

It was Tuoba Tianhuang.

He hadn’t gone through the selection, yet he had appeared here. This could only mean one thing—the other party had broken through to the Blood Transformation Tier.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Long time no see.”

Tuoba Tianhuang was silent for a moment before saying, “You have to break through to the Blood Transformation Tier as soon as possible. I want to fight you again!”

Among those of the same age and cultivation level, he had only lost to Ling Han. This was a stain on his reputation, and he wanted to erase it with all his might.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “There are many crouching tigers and hidden dragons in the imperial capital, and there are plenty of prodigies. There’s no need to have your eyes set on me, right?”

It was not that he was afraid of battle, but on account that they were both in the city, he wanted to give the other party face. Otherwise, he would be traumatized after having been defeated by the same person twice and be unable to recover from it.

Tuoba Tianhuang smiled coldly. “Ling Han, could it be that you’re afraid?” Ling Han sighed. Why didn’t he properly accept his good intentions?

“Alright, since you want to fight, why don’t we do it today?” he said calmly. “I won’t bully you. I’ll just use one hand.”

Tuoba Tianhuang almost lost his breath. ‘You, a Meridian Opening Tier cultivator, want to fight me, and you actually want to give me a handicap?’

Although he had just advanced into the Blood Transformation Tier, because he had cultivated twenty meridians in the Meridian Opening Tier, his First Change battle prowess was comparable to an ordinary Third Change.

Was this something Ling Han could compare to?

“You’re too arrogant!” he said coldly. “Alright, I’ll teach you a lesson first and let you know what a difference in cultivation level means.”

Defeating Ling Han with cultivation level suppression naturally wouldn’t make him happy, but he was truly enraged, and wanted to teach Ling Han a lesson.

The two of them were about to make a move when they saw someone from the academy.

This time, a Deputy Head came. His name was Sui Tang, and he was at the Extreme Bone Tier. It was unknown which Extreme he was standing on. This time, Ling Han and Tuoba Tianhuang naturally could not fight, and the two of them returned to their teams.

Sui Tang gave a speech, the gist of which was to welcome the arrival of the new students. He hoped that they would cultivate diligently in the following period of time, because if a Meridian Opening Tier could not break through into Blood Transformation Tier within five years, they would be expelled from the academy.

The Blood Transformation Tier, on the other hand, had a ten-year deadline to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier, and if one didn’t break through, one could only leave.

Therefore, it was impossible for the academy’s disciples to be older than 40 years old.

Sui Tang talked a lot. At first, everyone listened attentively, but because there were too many meaningless things, most of them were distracted later on. Only Ge Qiuling kept his body straight and alert from beginning to end and did not make any small movements.

“Alright, let’s disperse.” Sui Tang finally announced the end of the freshman lecture and left.

The students didn’t leave immediately, because this was actually the first time many of them had met, so they naturally had to bond. After all, they would have to spend a long time together in the future. It didn’t matter if they couldn’t be friends, but they couldn’t make enemies either.

Some were smooth-talking and were already like fish in water, while others were dull and did not know how to socialize.

Ling Han was just about to leave with Huan Xue when Tuoba Tianhuang stopped him.

“Trying to run?” Tuoba Tianhuang said in disdain.

Ling Han shook his head. He didn’t take Tuoba Tianhuang seriously at all, so after the gathering ended, he naturally planned to leave and return to focus on tempering his body. He wanted to train his physical power to the level of

500,000 kilograms as soon as possible, and then break through to the Blood Transformation Tier.

To think that Tuoba Tianhuang would insist on getting slapped in the face by him.

‘Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish.’

“Make your move.” Ling Han placed his right hand behind his back. “If you can force me to use my right hand, then you win.”

Tuoba Tianhuang couldn’t help but explode with rage as he glared with eyes that seemed like they were about to spew fire.

“You’re too arrogant!” he said through gritted teeth.

“Is that so?” Ling Han smiled, and said, “You’ve been defeated by me, so it’s not too much for me to give you a handicap of one hand.”

“Damn it!” Tuoba Tianhuang roared furiously, and charged towards Ling Han.

BANG!

Unexpectedly, someone charged out from one side and blocked this move for Ling Han.

However, it was clear that that person was no match for Tuoba Tianhuang and he was sent flying.

It was Ge Qiuling.

“If you want to exchange blows with my brother, you have to get past me first!” He got up and was not afraid at all.

After this exchange, the others all looked over. After knowing the situation, they all laughed and watched the commotion from the side.

Fighting was not prohibited in the academy, as long as they were not beaten to death or crippled. However, a Meridian Opening Tier actually took the initiative to face a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator. This was rare; was this asking for a beating?

Furthermore, the other Meridian Opening Tier cultivator was quite arrogant. He actually said that he wanted to give Tuoba Tianhuang a handicap of one hand. This was even more shocking. Where did he get his courage from?

One was arrogant, and the other was stupid. These two people could actually pass the screening and enter the Imperial Capital Academy? They were simply lowering the level of the academy.

Tuoba Tianhuang snorted and said, “You’re not my match. Break through to the Blood Transformation Tier first.’

Ge Qiuling still wanted to say more, but was stopped by Ling Han.

“He wants to challenge me, so don’t steal my business,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Ge Qiuling was confused. “Whose business did I rob? Who’s doing business?”

He was getting serious again.

Ling Han ignored him. Instead, he looked at Tuoba Tianhuang, and said,

“Come.”

“Hmph, don’t tell me you’re asking someone to help you again this time round?” Tuoba Tianhuang revealed a look of disdain.

Before Ling Han could respond, someone else really intervened.

It was Lian Xuerong.

She reached out to block him and said, “We’re all from Huju City. We should work together and not fight among ourselves!”

Tuoba Tianhuang was still rather wary of Lian Xuerong. She had already reached the Third Change Blood Transformation Tier at such a young age. Although she was not as talented as him, she could still be considered a prodigy.

He explained, “Banner Lord Lian, I just want to teach him a lesson so that he won’t be too arrogant! Otherwise, with his flamboyant personality, he will cause big trouble sooner or later.. At that time, he will embarrass our Huju City!”
