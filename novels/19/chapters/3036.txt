No one could imagine that Yan Wuyue, the prized prodigy basking in full glory, would tumble down the mountain so inelegantly in the blink of an eye.

What was going on here?

Everyone looked at Yan Wuyue, and then turned to Ling Han, their gazes moving back and forth between the two. Finally, their eyes were fixed on Ling Han.

This guy was too vicious.

Who said that he was just showing off?

How was this showing off?

This was pure skill. He was not pretending in the least; it was really that easy for him.

Look how he was able to knock Yan Wuyue down the mountain with a simple slap.

How hilarious. Yan Wuyue was the person who’d instigated it too. It was his just desserts to be knocked down the mountain.

Pfft. Someone started laughing.

“This is the Yan Clan’s greatest prodigy?”

“When it comes to eating dirt, sure.”

“Haha, I must admit I am not able to learn such a trick.”

All these people mocking Yan Wuyue had powerful backgrounds, and were not afraid of the Yan Clan.

Yan Wuyue only had himself to blame for showing off earlier, causing all these descendants of Heavenly Venerates to pale in comparison. It was inevitable that they would seize the opportunity to make fun of him now.

“Young Master!” The servant girl who was a Ninth Heaven hurriedly helped Yan Wuyue up.

“Leave me!” Yan Wuyue angrily waved his hand and stood up on his own, indicating that he didn’t need someone else to help him.

“Young Master, I’ll kill him!” The Ninth Heaven servant girl looked at Ling Han with killing intent as the ribbons of iridescent light enveloping her flashed.

“Hmph. Do you think I need you to help?” Yan Wuyue said coldly.

“No, Young Master.” The Ninth Heaven servant girl quickly backed down. Even though her cultivation level was higher than Yan Wuyue’s, she didn’t dare talk back to him.

It was because she was a Celestial King that was raised by the Yan Clan, so she didn’t have any of the confidence or domineering bearing that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King should have.

Yan Wuyue stared at Ling Han. “I’ve underestimated you.”

What he meant was even though he was knocked down the mountain by Ling Han, it wasn’t because he was weaker, but because he had misjudged Ling Han’s strength. Moreover, the mountain had restrictions placed on it to begin with, and possessed an immense repelling force.

Because of that, he was unable to use his strength properly, and fell down the mountain after receiving a blow from Ling Han.

In addition, he didn’t channel all his strength earlier on to save face. This was also why he was defiant about the results.

He said menacingly, “This time, I’ll definitely turn you into nothing but a bloody puddle!”

Ling Han sighed and turned back around, saying, “I was just going on my own path. What does it have to do with you? You attacked me, and I simply acted in self-defense. Yet, you’re still not letting me go, declaring that you want to kill me.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. Ling Han didn’t provoke Yan Wuyue at all. The latter was the one who instigated it.

Even now, Yan Wuyue was unwilling to let things go.

Yan Wuyue simply scoffed. It was Ling Han’s fault for making him suffer humiliation to begin with.

He said arrogantly, “If you’re scared, then get off the mountain, kneel before me, and apologize!”

Ling Han shook his head. “You’re overthinking it. I was just sighing.”

“Haha, then you’re dead meat!” Yan Wuyue said solemnly. His body flew up as he was ready to strike, but suddenly came to a stop.

Weng! A powerful force approached from a distance at incredible speeds.

Suddenly, everyone felt an intense pressure. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were no exception, and felt an urge to prostrate themselves.

They quickly quelled the feeling. It would be embarrassing to really kneel down in public.

In the blink of an eye, a middle-aged man descended from above.

He had a normal appearance, but he stood proudly in the sky, giving off an immense pressure that seemed to bear down on the world.

“We humbly greet you, Lord!” Suddenly, all the Celestial Kings from across the entire mountain bowed.

This person was a Heavenly Venerate.

“It’s Yan Wuyue’s father, Yan Shu.”

“He must really care for his son a lot to personally escort him.”

“It looks like… that person is going to be in trouble.”

Whispers could be heard from the crowd, revealing the identity of the middle-aged man who had just arrived.

Yan Wuyue’s father, Yan Shu. A Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!

“Father!” Yan Wuyue quickly greeted his father.

Yan Shu nodded back. He was extremely proud of his son, and was sure that the latter would be able to surpass him and become the strongest person in the Yan Clan in the future.

“Why haven’t you started ascending the mountain?” he asked.

The rules of Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment were that they needed to climb the mountain with their own strength in order to become a disciple.

Yan Wuyue didn’t know how to answer, and had an awkward expression on his face.

How could he say that he was knocked down the mountain by someone else like a rubber ball?

However, his Ninth Heaven servant girl quickly interjected, “My Lord, the young master was ambushed, and was knocked down the mountain just as he ascended halfway up.”

“What!!” Yan Shu was furious.

Who was so bold as to ambush his son, the prized heir of the Yan Clan?

“I want to see who is so bold as to make a move against my son!” he said solemnly. His attitude was the same as Yan Wuyue.

Those who obeyed him lived, and those who went against him suffered his wrath. He didn’t care about who was right or wrong.

“My Lord, it’s him!” The Ninth Heaven Celestial servant girl pointed at Ling Han.

“Which brat— pfft!” Yan Shu’s eyes nearly popped out when he noticed Ling Han.

He desperately wanted to rub his eyes, and hoped that he was mistaken, but he couldn’t move a single muscle in his arms.

It was because a cold and powerful pressure was pressing down on him, rendering him completely immobile.

It was the bringer of calamity!

Ling Han was definitely the number one bringer of calamity in the world.

None who provoked him had a good ending.

This held true even for someone as powerful as Feng Wuding, who was proclaimed to be the Son of Destiny from the Genesis World of the last era and managed to achieve Seventh-Tier battle prowess.

Look where he ended up.

He was still killed by Ling Han.

Feng Wuding was someone with Seventh-Tier battle prowess, the strongest known existence in the world.

Would Ling Han thus not be considered the number one bringer of calamity in the world?

And now, his own son had ended up provoking Ling Han. This could end up causing the destruction of the entire Yan Clan.

“Father?” Yan Wuyue felt that something was off with his father. His expression made it seem like he had swallowed 10,000 flies.

Pa!

Yan Shu quickly reacted, turning around and slapping his own son in the face, causing Yan Wuyue to spin where he stood dozens of times and his teeth falling off one after the other.

Yan Shu felt bad seeing his son beaten into a bloody pulp, but when he thought about how terrifying Ling Han was, he immediately resolved himself to do the hard thing.

The Yan Clan could not afford to be destroyed at the hands of this idiot son.

Pa, pa, pa. Yan Shu slapped his own son’s face like he was spanking his bottom. All in all, he gave Yan Wuyue 18 slaps in total.

Everyone was dazedly looking on in confusion.

One second ago, Yan Shu was boldly declaring how he was going to take revenge for his son. But now, he was beating that same son up.

Was he possessed?

Could Heavenly Venerates even be possessed?

All this was too peculiar.

The Ninth Heaven servant girl beside them was completely pale from fear, and didn’t dare to move a single inch.

“You absolute imbecile. Do you know who this lord is?” Yan Shu shouted angrily.

‘What?!’

Lord?

Everyone was shocked. What kind of person was Yan Shu? If even he, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, had to address Ling Han as a lord, then what sort of existence was the latter?
