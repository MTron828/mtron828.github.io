Chapter 3283 - 3283: Niu Huaqing’s Request

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han did not owe Feng Ruoxian anything. On the contrary, he had even saved her once. Otherwise, she might already be helping Hu Can with the reproduction of his clan.

Alright, it was fine if she wasn’t grateful. On account of Feng Zisheng’s death in the city, Ling Han didn’t want to hold it against her, but now, she actually wanted to take him in as a slave. This was something that Ling Han couldn’t tolerate.

‘Even if you’re still the Young Miss of a powerful family, you don’t have the right to do so!’

What an ingrate.

Butler Mu saw the change in his expression, and hurriedly advised, “Ling Han, Young Miss needs help right now. Please help Young Miss on my account.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Butler Mu, this request is too much. Forgive me for being unable to comply.”

Actually, Butler Mu had also guessed that Ling Han would not agree. Which peerless genius would be willing to be someone’s servant? It was just that he had been entrusted by Feng Ruoxian, and had no choice but to make a trip.

“Ling Han, if you have any conditions, you can raise them. I will try my best to satisfy you!” he said.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This is a matter of principle.”

Butler Mu sighed and said, “Alright, pretend I never said anything about this.” He quickly bade farewell and left.

In truth, Feng Ruoxian had asked him to use civility before resorting to force. If Ling Han was

unwilling to listen to advice, then he was to directly threaten him.

Feng Ruoxian could say this, but Butler Mu couldn’t.

…His life was saved by Ling Han, so how could he repay his kindness with ingratitude?

To be honest, he really felt like he didn’t know Feng Ruoxian anymore. He had watched this child grow up. How did she become like this now?

What he didn’t know was that although Feng Ruoxian looked glamorous now and was shrouded in a halo, how long could the blessings of a dead person last? When the matter of Huju City came to an end and no one mentioned it again, what was she, Feng Ruoxian, worth?

With only beauty, she could only become a plaything.

Therefore, Feng Ruoxian had to think of ways to increase her strength and walk down this crooked path.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ling Han sent Butler Mu off and shook his head. He had already blacklisted Feng Ruoxian. Otherwise, with his protective personality, since they were all from Huju City, he would definitely not hesitate to help Feng Ruoxian if she encountered any difficulties.

Now that Feng Ruoxian had done this, it was equivalent to closing this door for herself.

Ling Han stopped thinking about this matter. There was no need to waste time on such an ungrateful young miss.

However, this was destined to be a busy night.

There was a third guest whom he couldn’t refuse.

Niu Huaqing was the owner of “There’s a Formations Shop” and the Uncle of Gu Tianhe from the Huju City Formations Association. His title was a little long and scary.

Ling Han was indebted to this person, so Ling Han naturally wouldn’t ignore him.

However, Ling Han had no reservations in his manner towards the man at all, and said with a smile, “Old geezer Niu, you survived a great disaster!”

Niu Huaqing snorted and said, “It’s just a small beast tide, how can it do anything to me?”

Just continue to boast!

Ling Han thought to himself. If Niu Huaqing could really ignore the beast tide, how could the entire Formations Association be wiped out? Oh, no, there was still Yan Jun who had run out, and whom he had yet to finish off.

He did not rub salt into his wounds. He smiled and said, “Are you planning to open another formations shop in the capital?”

Niu Huaqing revealed a complicated expression and said, “I originally thought that I would never return here in my life.”

He paused for a moment, and seeing that Ling Han didn’t respond, he couldn’t help but get annoyed, and said, “Why don’t you ask me why I didn’t come back here?”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and said, “If you’re willing to tell me, you naturally don’t need me to ask. If vou’re unwilling to tell me. it’ll onlv make vou sad if I ask. so it’s better not to ask.”

Damn, why did this kid not look like a twenty-year-old young man at all?

Niu Huaqing sighed, and said, “Back then, I was also a figure who stirred up a storm in the Imperial Capital, and was hailed as a prodigy of formations. I succeeded Dao with formations, and although I was only in the Extreme Bone Tier, I could fight with an Inscription Tier.”

“It’s also because of this that I was very proud when I was young and looked down on everything.”

Ling Han interjected, “You’re the same now.”

The corner of Niu Huaqing’s mouth twitched. He had the urge to hit someone, but he suppressed it.

“Later, I fell in love with a woman and started to pursue her. However, there was another person who competed with me at that time.” He closed his eyes as if he was recalling something. After a while, he said, “In the end, I agreed to fight with that person. The loser would automatically withdraw… In the end, I lost.”

“Yi, didn’t you say that you had attained Dao with formations, and even fight Inscription Tier cultivators?” Ling Han painfully revealed his scars.

Niu Huaqing sighed and said, “That guy is abnormal. His physique is shocking, and he’s naturally able to restrain me.”

Ling Han’s heart stirred, and he asked, “General Vajra?”

In terms of the strongest physique, and one that was at the level of Inscription Tier, only General Vajra was matched that description.

Niu Huaqing glanced at Ling Han, then nodded, and said, “It’s that b*stard. I don’t know how he cultivated, but his body is tougher than iron. No matter how I cast my techniques, he just charged over without any regard for anything, without any skill at all.”

At this point, he seemed indignant. In his opinion, General Vajra’s method of breaking the formation was incomparably rude and shameless.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. Formation masters were indeed afraid of this kind of high defense, and could only trap them. If they couldn’t trap them, then they could only watch as the other party crushed them flat.

“In this battle, not only did I lose, I was also heavily injured, leaving behind wounds that will never heal,” Niu Huaqing continued. “So, my current battle prowess is only at the Blood Transformation Tier, and my Spiritual power has severely shrunk. Even activating Middle Level formations, my Spiritual power is just barely enough.”

‘I see.’

Ling Han nodded. Otherwise, if this old man still had the strength of

Inscription Tier, he wouldn’t have escaped alone.

“I can’t accept this,” Niu Huaqing clenched his fists and said.

“Could it be that you still want to snatch back the person you love?” Ling Han looked at Niu Huaqing with a shocked gaze. How old are you? You should be at least 70 or 80 years old, or even in fact over 100 years old.

Niu Huaqing glared at him and said, “I’m not willing to lose to that iron lump. How can it be that the grand formations can’t do anything to a person who practices brute force?”

Ling Han patted Niu Huaqing’s shoulder, and said with a smile, “Old Niu, I almost misunderstood you.”

You’ve already f*cking misunderstood!

Niu Huaqing was speechless. Talking to this kid really required good self-restraint. Otherwise, he would want to kill someone every minute.

“Brat, I need you to do something,” he said.

“You’re really not polite,” Ling Han said with a smile. “Tell me, what is it? If it’s within my capabilities, I’ll try my best to help.”

“I want you to participate in the Formations Competition at the beginning of the year and obtain first place. Use this opportunity to enter the Formations Association and become the strongest formations master. In the future, defeat that iron lump and clear the name of formations!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Old geezer Niu, back then, even you couldn’t defeat

General Vajra, so what makes you think I can?”

“Because I was alone back then. Now, with my wisdom, experience, and your talent, we will definitely win!” Niu Huaqing said with certainty.
