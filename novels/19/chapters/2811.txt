2812 The Furious Ping Xinghai

Hong Huang. Unexpectedly, he was also called Hong Huang.

Ling Han knew that there were many people that looked alike in the world, but would they also be called by the same name? That was practically impossible.

“That Hong Huang of the Celestial Realm?”

Hong Huang’s eyes blinked. “Are you also from the Celestial Realm?” He wasn’t some kind of huge celebrity, and being able to hang out with Lu Xuanting and the others was also due to being under the banner of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. Coupled with his eloquence, he was able to get along with these people.

!!

Ling Han shook his head. “So it’s true that a bad person will live a long life of 1,000 years. I recall that I have already smashed you into smithereens!”

“You are Ling Han!” Hong Huang couldn’t help exclaiming, and then he revealed an extremely furious expression.

Who was the person whom he hated most in this life? That had to be Ling Han, who had killed him with his bare hands. Had it not been Sealed Emotion who had rescued him despite the act being heaven-defying, then Hong Huang would have been dead for a long time.

Although he survived, his foundation was nevertheless seriously damaged. Therefore, being a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was his limit, and he had no hope of advancing to the position of a Heavenly Venerate even in the Flaming Frost Realm.

This time, he had shamelessly asked others to bring him into this place in order to defy heavens and change his fate once again. He hoped to restore his foundations and rise again.

This place was a magnificent vast world. Hong Huang was obsessed with this place, and hoped that he would be able to shake the world here.

Originally, he should have recognized Ling Han at the first instant. However, who asked Ling Han to alter his appearance and aura at this time, and how could Hong Huang, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, be able to see through it?

“Ling Han?” Ping Xinghai’s eyes also blinked. Of course he had heard of Ling Han. The latter was an extremely renowned person in the Realm Battlefield back then. He was practically a legend on the first and second spatial level.

However, the present time was no longer the era of the Realm Battlefield.

“I heard that you have obtained a Heavenly Venerable Seal on the second spatial level?” he inquired. His tone appeared to be extremely calm, but it couldn’t hide traces of his excitement.

Any of the Heavenly Venerable Seals that wasn’t one of the more widely known seven seals was extremely precious, and even the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate wouldn’t mind mastering one more.

“Admit it, you are already filled with greed. Don’t keep saying what you have heard, aren’t you just being hypocritical?” Ling Han reprimanded mercilessly.

Ping Xinghai was furious. He was just about to speak, but upon seeing Ling Han wave his hand dismissively, he suppressed his words.

“You step aside first, I don’t have time to talk to you right now.” Ling Han stared at Hong Huang. “It should be Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable who has saved you?” In the low-level dimension of Celestial Realm, a First Tier Heavenly Venerate had the strength to be heaven-defying and snatch back a life.

Hong Huang nodded proudly. “That’s right!” He was full of respect for the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, practically blindly worshiping him.

That was only right as well. Those who could become Heavenly Venerates in the low-level dimension actually possessed amazing natural talent and were geniuses.

“Ling, Han!” Ping Xinghai said as he gritted his teeth; he was beyond furious. Ling Han had cut him off when he was speaking twice just because he wanted to settle accounts with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

F*ck, to hell with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King who was nothing compared to him!

Ling Han sighed, and looked over at Ping Xinghai. “Are you blind, can’t you see that I’m busy right now? Yet you keep calling me, are you brainless?”

“Bastard!” Ping Xinghai bellowed. With a tap of his foot, he charged murderously towards Ling Han.

Ka, ka, ka, where his foot stepped, the ground split open, revealing thousands of spider web-like cracks.

Brandishing his palms, he pressed them towards Ling Han.

He was really beyond furious. This blow wasn’t merely attacking from a distance, but rather the power of Third Tier enshrouded his palms, and he was entirely filled with an aura of Primal Chaos. Coupled with his long hair fluttering about violently, he looked like a demonic god.

Ling Han didn’t dare to be careless. This was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, with battle prowess that rivaled his own.

He struck out with a punch towards Ping Xinghai.

Boom! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Fists and palms clashed, creating endless ripples that reverberated in all directions.

“Hmm?” Ping Xinghai revealed a shocked expression. He didn’t get even the slightest upper hand in this strike?

This First Tier… was already heaven-defying.

Ling Han also revealed an expression of surprise. “You do have some strength as a Third Tier, so you can’t be regarded as rubbish.”

‘F*ck!’

Anyone who heard these words would have been furious. A First Tier Heavenly Venerate actually dared to act smug. However, seeing the strength exhibited by Ling Han, would anyone dare to accuse Ling Han of arrogance?

Whether one was arrogant or not, it would depend on one’s strength.

“I really don’t believe it!” Ping Xinghai humphed coldly, and attacked again. This time, a fuzzy seal glowed in his palm as he channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and operated a Heavenly Venerate Technique. He unleashed his full strength in an instant.

He wanted to suppress Ling Han at all costs; just a Heavenly Venerable Seal already made him so excited that he couldn’t help himself.

Ling Han gave a faint smile. He channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and coupled with the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, he went head-on with the opponent.

It was just that, in this way, Ling Han was at a disadvantage.

How could he be at a disadvantage?

In terms of strength, they were almost the same. In terms of Heavenly Venerable Seals, they all used one of the more widely known seven seals, which were the same, capable of increasing one’s power by four or five times.

The key lay in the Heavenly Venerate Technique.

The Nine Transformations Divine Scroll was created by a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. Although it was very powerful, it could only be limited to the Second Tier, but they were currently fighting a Third-Tier battle.

The secret technique that Ping Xinghai had mastered had reached the Third Tier, which allowed him to have an edge over his opponent.

“Haha, this is the strength of our backgrounds!” Ping Xinghai said lightly, which nevertheless didn’t inhibit his arrogance.

He was the disciple of a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate. The secret technique that he was currently channeling had been passed down to him by that Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Although it wasn’t the core secret technique of that Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, it was more than enough for him to use at the present moment.

Ling Han nodded. After all, the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll had been created by a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. However, the Five Elements Lightning Technique and the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll were of a lower level, only the First Tier. As long as the battle prowess exceeded the level of Second Tier, then these two Heavenly Venerate Techniques would not be able to keep up, and the desired effect couldn’t be achieved.

Before, Ling Han had only cared about improving his cultivation level. Now, he ought to go obtain a Heavenly Venerate Technique worthy of his own battle prowess, or directly create a Heavenly Venerate Technique himself.

“Hand over the Heavenly Venerable Seal on your own, and I will spare your life,” Ping Xinghai said arrogantly.

He was only a Third Tier, and it would be an extremely difficult feat for him to refine a Heavenly Venerate to extract the Heavenly Venerable Seal. Therefore, if Ling Han was willing to surrender it on his own, it would save him a lot of unnecessary hassle.

As for whether to spare Ling Han’s life, that would depend on his mood.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “In this world, one must avoid being too conceited!

...

“Did you not want that Heavenly Venerable Seal? Very well, I’ll show it to you!” Ling Han channeled the Ninth Seal, dashed forward and charged murderously towards Ping Xinghai.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two exchanged blows again, and Ping Xinghai’s expression involuntarily drastically changed as Ling Han’s battle prowess was now shockingly on par with his.

Why was this so?

It was very simple. The Heavenly Venerable Seal that Ling Han channeled was higher in level than his. If one could increase the power by five times, while the other could increase by 10 times, then how could it be comparable?

The strength of the two was equal. It was just that one was stronger in terms of Heavenly Venerable Seal, while the other was better at using his Heavenly Venerate Technique, which just happened to result in a tie.

When Lu Xuanting came back, he couldn’t help being dumbfounded when he saw that Ling Han was fighting Ping Xinghai to a draw.

It was not just him, but also the same for the others. They had never seen such a powerful First Tier Heavenly Venerate before.

Ping Xinghai gritted his teeth. He firmly believed that he would absolutely win.

A Heavenly Venerable Seal could only last for an hour, but a Heavenly Venerate Technique was different, so as long as he could hold out until Ling Han was finished with releasing the Heavenly Venerable Seal, he would be able to suppress Ling Han in one fell swoop.

He would definitely suppress this opponent.
