Chapter 1457 Candied Hawthorn

Ling Han chuckled as he unleashed heaven’s might.

Weng!

The expressions of the three other king tiers suddenly changed drastically. They were completely astounded.

Their power had suddenly dropped by two entire stars!

They each had their own way of dealing with this, yet they had been completely unprepared for their power to drop so sharply. Thus, they were completely unable to react in a timely manner. More detestable was the fact that Ling Han had only unleashed this technique after they had launched their own attacks.

If he had unleashed heaven’s might earlier, their attacks would have all been weakened by 100 or so times. Now, however? Their attacks were all at full power as they hurtled toward their opponents. Meanwhile, their defenses had all been weakened by a whopping one-hundred-fold!

This was equivalent to four king tiers ganging up to attack people together, yet apart from Ling Han, the other people had all been weakened one-hundred-fold. That being the case, how could they withstand these attacks?

Peng, peng, peng!

Unsurprisingly, the three king tiers were all knocked off their floating rocks. Even so, the attacks were still unable to cause them any severe wounds. If this were under normal circumstances, these attacks would have barely affected them at all. However, right now was different. Once they were knocked off their floating rock, they could only... fall to the bottom of the abyss.

Ling Han instantly obtained three floating rocks! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was about to ascend the peak!

The floating rock beneath his feet grew larger and larger as it absorbed the other floating rocks. At the same time, it started to rise upward, quickly nearing the height of the gigantic golden boulder above the valley.

The people below him all watched on, disbelief on their faces.

Who would have thought that the final victor would be Ling Han?

He wasn’t a rank three king tier!

“Ling! Han!” Gu Daoyi roared in fury. He was being obstructed by Empress Luan Xing, and thus he didn’t even have the chance to fight for victory. This caused him to burn with indescribable rage. “Ling Han, I’ll kill you if you dare to take another step!”

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Kill me? You think I’m afraid of you?” He raised his foot and stepped toward the gigantic golden boulder without a shred of hesitation.

Golden light radiated from the gigantic golden boulder. This golden light then enveloped Ling Han, making him appear like a God of War, a god who was high in the heavens and transcendent above all other beings.

This was an incredible sight.

“This is Grandpa Dog’s great opportunity!” the large black dog suddenly shouted. At some point in time, he had already risen to a height just six meters below Ling Han. However, there were already no more floating rocks for him to absorb. This didn’t stop him, though, and he leaped up with all his might, biting at Ling Han’s foot.

His speed was incredible, yet this valley had its own set of regulations. Just as he was about to reach Ling Han’s foot, an intangible power suddenly appeared, acting as a net and instantly preventing him from reaching any higher.

“I’ll bite! I’ll bite!” the large black dog shouted as he continued to gnash his jaws. A strange sight suddenly appeared, with the intangible “net” surprisingly bitten open by the large black dog. His head instantly poked through the hole.

Snap!

His jaws forcefully snapped down on Ling Han’s toes.

“F*ck!” Ling Han shouted through gritted teeth.

His physique was indeed freakish, yet the Large Black Dog’s teeth were much like Celestial Tools, causing pain to shoot through his foot.

“Let go, you sh*tty dog! Let go!” Ling Han frantically shook his foot.

“No way! I won’t let go even if I die! This is Grandpa Dog’s great opportunity!” Although he was biting onto Ling Han’s toes, the large black dog was surprisingly still able to speak. One couldn’t help but feel admiration for his abilities.

Below them, Long Xiangyue was already closing in again.

Ling Han sighed, and he had no option but to raise his foot. He was going to drag the large black dog up along with him.

However, there were restrictions in this valley, after all, and the hole in the “net” was only large enough to fit the large black dog’s head. It would be extremely difficult to pull his entire body through. It was as if Ling Han were lifting an immense weight as he slowly dragged the large black dog up, inch by inch.

“Little Han, have you not had lunch? Hurry up! Hurry up! The violent woman is almost upon us!” The large black dog urged Ling Han to act quicker.

“Sh*tty dog, hurry up and let go of me!” Ling Han shouted in reply.

“I won’t let go even if I die!” the large black dog shouted as he shook his head.

At this moment, Long Xiangyue had already caught up to them. With her incredible power, she had essentially crushed all of her opponents as she easily soared up to this height. Only after reaching the last 30 meters did her speed finally slow down. There was nothing she could do about this. After all, there were far too few king tiers at this height.

Even so, she still drew closer and closer to Ling Han and the large black dog. When she was just six meters below the large black dog, she suddenly slashed toward him with her sword.

“Motherf*cking b*tch!” the large black dog yelped in astonishment. However, his defenses were surprisingly no weaker than those of Ling Han. Upon striking him, Long Xiangyue’s sword merely caused a series of sparks to fly into the air. However, the large black dog was completely unscathed.

“The pain is killing me!” the large black dog wailed. It was as if he were in a truly sorry state.

The people beneath him all grimaced upon seeing this. ‘What the hell are you wailing about? Not a single strand of your hair has been injured! I’ve seen shameless people before, but I’ve never seen a being as shameless as you!’

Long Xiangyue was also stunned. Although she hadn’t unleashed her full power just then, her attack should have still been powerful enough to at least slice off some of his hair. This despicable dog... was far from ordinary!

Ling Han was also astonished upon seeing this. However, he quickly recalled that the large black dog was from the Celestial Realm. He had been born from a celestial egg, and he had more so fallen into a slumber and cultivated for heaven knew how many years. Thus, it was only natural that he possessed some extraordinary abilities.

Long Xiangyue slashed at him several more times, each slash eliciting agonized wails from the large black dog. However, not a single one of her attacks was able to cause him any tangible damage. The despicable dog was simply putting on a show.

“Brat, hurry up and lift me up!” the large black dog shouted. “Otherwise, my bum is about to be sliced into two pieces!”

“Nonsense! Whose bum isn’t already two pieces?” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“Oh, Grandpa Dog was wounded, so I’m already becoming incomprehensible! Anyhow, hurry up and pull me up! Have you not eaten anything?” The large black dog started to urge Ling Han to hurry up again.

Right now, Ling Han wanted to stomp on this sh*tty dog’s face. However, the large black dog wouldn’t let go of his foot no matter what. Thus, Ling Han had no option but to pull him up with all his might. Only then would he be able to kick the large black dog and send him flying. With Ling Han exerting all of his strength, the large black dog was slowly dragged up, inch by inch.

However, just as his midriff crossed the hole, Long Xiangyue suddenly leaped upward, grabbing onto his tail. It was clear that she wanted to be pulled up along with him.

Shua!

The floating rock beneath her feet instantly fell down. At this moment, she was fully hanging off from the large black dog’s tail.

‘Holy f*ck! Is this really okay?!’

The people beneath them grimaced once again. They felt that the competition this year was truly lively and full of spectacular scenes. It was as if the three “people” had become a skewer of candied hawthorn[1]. Could their appearance be any more hilarious than it was right now?

“Stinky woman, hurry up and let go of me! Grandpa Dog’s tail is about to be pulled apart by you!” the large black dog barked.

Long Xiangyue naturally ignored him, continuing to grip onto his tail.

“There’s sh*t on my tail! That’s not something that you want to touch!” the large black dog shouted.

Long Xiangyue remained silent.

At this moment, Zi Chenfeng, Second in the World, and Hong Ma had all risen up to just a few meters beneath them as well. Without speaking a word, they also leaped up and grabbed at the large black dog’s tail. Since this was the situation right now, they were also hellbent on ascending to the gigantic golden boulder no matter what.

‘F*ck!

The people beneath them were already at a loss for words. There were several young king tiers hanging off the tail of the large black dog... This was a strange yet comical sight, no matter how one looked at it.

Were these people... genuinely supreme king tiers?

More and more people charged up. Apart from Empress Luan Xing and Gu Daoyi—who were still locked in an intense battle—the remaining supreme king tiers all wanted a piece of the reward. Some of them were unable to withstand the violent winds that gusted through the final 30 meters, yet there were some who were still successful in charging up and grabbing onto the large black dog’s tail.

However, the large black dog’s tail was only two feet long, so how could it possibly house the hands of so many people? It wasn’t long before his tail was covered in hands. That being the case, those who arrived later all turned their attention to his two hind legs. And thereupon, his two hind legs were gradually transformed into skewers of candied hawthorn as well.
