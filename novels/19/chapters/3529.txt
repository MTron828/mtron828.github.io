Chapter 3530: Merpeople

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You’re too paranoid, so you have mistaken the sound of the wind as a song,” the person beside him immediately said.

“No, I really heard someone singing!” That person insisted, “If you don’t believe me, you can pull out the cotton and hear it yourself.

The other person hurriedly shook his head like a rattle drum, “I’m not doing that!”

“I, I heard it too,” another person said, his voice trembling, as if he had received a great shock.

“I heard it too,” a third person said.

“Me too…”

More people expressed that they had heard the song, and most of them had cotton stuffed into their ears. This was completely ineffective.

Strange, why did some people hear the song, but some people didn’t?

“Ghost!”

Everyone was stunned. This was inexplicably mysterious, and could only be attributed to gods, Buddhas, and ghosts.

Ling Han also frowned deeply, because he had not heard any singing either.

He did not think that it was the doing of ghosts, because just like some animals could hear super-high or super-low sounds, or even in fact, when both were human, when they were young and after maturity, their perception of sound was also different.

There were some specific frequency of sound that could only be heard by children.

Perhaps, some people here had a special hearing ability, and that was why they could hear that song on a specific frequency.

“Hey, hey, hey, what’s wrong?”

Suddenly, someone stood up, completely expressionless. There was only white in his eyes, as he walked towards the ship’s railing. Others could not stop him either, and it was as if he had become a walking corpse.

What was going on here?

More people stood up. There were about a dozen of them, and they all walked towards the ship’s railing.

“These people… they all said that they heard singing!” someone said in a trembling voice.

When everyone thought about it, it really was so.

It was really strange. Hearing a song that others could not hear, then turning into a walking corpse, being drawn by an invisible force. Were they going to jump into the sea?

Because it was too strange, or could be that it had nothing to do with them, as long as they could not hear the song, they would be able to recover on the morning of the second day, so not many people actually came out to stop them.

Tong, tong, tong! These people all jumped into the sea.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and with a leap, directly flew out of the large ship. In any case, the ship could not leave now. He only had to return before daybreak.

He was a very curious person. If he did not get to the bottom of this, it would stay as a question in his mind.

Tong, he too fell into the sea. Using his ocular technique, he soon saw those people that had fallen into the sea earlier. They were all waving their arms with all their might, swimming in the same direction.

Ling Han hurriedly followed. With his immense power, he could travel far with a single palm strike. Very soon, he caught up to the people in front of him, and then maintained the same rhythm as them.

Yi?

Ling Han was surprised, because these people actually swam out of the fog, and a reef appeared ahead of them. It was very big, and there were a great many “people” seated on it.

The reason why there was a quotation mark was because these people were not waving their legs in the sea, but rather their tails!

Mermaids?

He could see clearly that those were all females, with long golden hair. They all looked different, some beautiful, and some ugly, but they all had a common characteristic, and that was their eyes were dark green, and their skin was extraordinarily fair.

These merpeople were currently opening their mouths, as if they were singing, but it was so bizarre that not the slightest sound could be heard.

The target of the people who had fallen into the sea was this reef. When they reached it, they all climbed up, their arms hanging by their sides, their eyes glazed over.

It was so cold. Ling Han followed them onto the island, and felt that the temperature here was extraordinarily low.

“Our luck is not too bad this time. There are actually seventeen people that have the same frequency as our tribe,” a merman said.

“Hurry up and bring them back. After mating, we’ll eat them. The flesh and blood of these cultivators are extremely nutritious.”

“Hehe, just look at these two, they’re quite handsome. I really don’t want to kill them so soon.”

“Stop being love-struck. They’re not part of our race.

These merpeople spoke one after another, as if they were explaining to Ling Han.

Sure enough, these merpeople were the source of the singing. Only specific people could hear their voices, and they would also be tempted, losing their self-awareness. They would swim over like zombies.

En, considering that it would also cause one to lose his soul, this should not be a sound, but rather an effect on the level of divine sense. It was targeted at those with weaker spiritual power, and could easily bewitch them. Thus, even if there was cotton stuffed in their ears, it was useless.

Looks like the fog was also created by them, trapping people here. Then, at night, they would use their song to draw out those with weak spiritual power, and bring them back as fertility tools and rations.

As for why they had only taken action at night, perhaps the bewitching effects of their voices at night would be maximized.

At this time, all the doubts had been cleared up. Ling Han no longer had the interest to continue the pretense, and said with a smile, “The hearts of women are the most poisonous. I was really not wrong.

“What!”

The merpeople were all astonished. How could someone actually speak? “Sh*t, he’s not affected. He’s come with the others!” someone exclaimed in realization.

“Humph, there are always people who seek death like this!” The other merpeople all scoffed.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back and said, “I’m afraid you’ll all be disappointed today.”

“We won’t!” A mermaid charged over. With a flick of her tail, she actually burst out with astonishing speed. Her body that was as long as three meters rose into the air, and then swooped down on Ling Han like a giant fish hunting for prey. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She opened her mouth. This was an exaggeration. How wide could a human’s mouth be? It could barely reach 90 degrees, right?

But the moment she opened her mouth, it was as if her whole face had disappeared, leaving behind only that massive mouth.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and shot out a punch.

Peng!

The mermaid was instantly sent flying, and then exploded into pieces.

Ling Han felt that these Sea Race were too cruel. If they were just borrowing seed, then he couldn’t be bothered to interfere. After all, seed concerned the survival of their race, but after they were done, they actually wanted to eat them. This was going too far.

Since you guys are so cruel, then don’t blame him for being merciless.

The death of this mermaid instantly incited the fury of the other merpeople, as they all set their eyes on him.

“This person is very strong. Don’t fight him head-on,” a mermaid said. As if commanding, she opened her mouth and howled. Instantly, a hurricane swept towards Ling Han.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The hurricane transformed into countless sharp blades that swept toward Ling Han.

Ling Han’s Spiritual Power moved, forming a wall of energy in front of him. It was made up of high-level energy of Stone. Peng, peng, peng! The wind blades shot over, instantly shattering into pieces, turning back into waves of wind. “Attack together!” the merpeople all shouted. They all released a battle cry, and instantly, innumerable blades of wind shot towards Ling Han in all directions. Ling Han stood with his hands clasped behind his back. The strongest of these merpeople was only Enlightenment Tier-level, so how could he possibly take them to heart?

The energy shield unfurled, and it was as if he were taking a stroll in a small garden, appearing extremely calm.

Peng!

However, he casually threw a punch, and as the power of his fist surged past, a mermaid was blasted apart. This was a real and solid attack.

The merpeople all opened their mouths and screamed. It was clear that their faces were twisted, yet they did not make the slightest sound. However, Ling Han immediately felt a pain in his head, as if there were countless sharp knives that were gouging at him.

Spiritual attack..
