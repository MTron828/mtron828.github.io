“Kill your sister!” Ling Han snorted.

“You’re rebuking me?” Liu Ru Er felt extremely wronged, and immediately pouted.

“The person outside is in Spiritual Ocean Tier!” Ling Han exclaimed.

Liu Ru Er was instantly silenced. It was precisely a Spiritual Ocean Tier elite, Xu Ke Xin, that she and her sister had lost to. If they had been able to kill a powerful martial artist like that, then they would have had no need to hide here to recover from their injuries.

“Then what do we do?” Yun Shuang Shuang turned towards Ling Han. Having not completely shrugged off Lady Yan’s authority, she was completely at a loss what to do.

Ling Han thought for a moment, then said, “All of you go and hide inside the inner room.”

The three girls quickly rushed into the inner room, whereas Ling Han walked towards the main door and opened it.

At the doorway, Lady Yan was standing in a beautiful pose, exuding a mature, exquisite grace. It was definitely not something that a wet-behind-the-ears young girl could compare to. She smiled softly, and asked, “What were you busy with, Mister Ling? I was waiting for quite a while outside here!”

She was suspicious?

Ling Han was naturally calm and collected. This woman held a deep, powerful love for her son; there was no doubt about that. However, he had never thought that she would have schemes so terrifyingly profound; she had already included Yun Shuang Shuang in her plans quite a few years ago. If it was not for the fact that Yun Shuang Shuang had so coincidentally overheard the conversation between her and Yan Tian Zhao, then perhaps Yun Shuang Shuang would still feel overwhelmingly grateful to her, even until the moment of her death.

But when he thought about it, how could Lady Yan be a simple character if she was able to make the business of Cherishing Flower Pavilion into such a booming establishment?

“Nothing much. I was just playing around with Hu Niu.” Ling Han smiled, and said, “Does Lady Yan have some business with me?”

“So I can’t just come by for a chat if I don’t have any business with you?” Lady Yan smiled sweetly, her charm on full blast.

However, this only gave Ling Han goosebumps. ‘You’re already a middle-aged woman in your forties, and no matter how enchanting and charming you are, you still would not try and make a move on a young man like me, right?’ He frowned and said, “It is not proper for a single man and woman to be together alone.”

“Mister Ling is really good at making jokes. You and Tian Zhao are brothers, and members of a younger generation than I, how does your theory about a single man and woman make sense, then?” Lady Yan said calmly. Then, she giggled, and with a light tremble of her body, she said, “Mister Ling, could it be that you are hiding a beauty in your residence, and fear that I would discover her?”

She forced herself in, and Ling Han had no way to stop her. A Spiritual Ocean Tier martial artist was far stronger than he.

Hu Niu instantly glared at her, and naturally thought Lady Yan to be an enemy.

Ling Han picked Hu Niu up so that the little girl would not be injured by Lady Yan if she actually dared to attack the latter. He followed at Lady Yan’s heels, and said, “I do indeed have a young girl hidden here.”

“Oh, who is it?” Lady Yan asked casually.

“How could it be anyone but this little girl here?” Ling Han laughed. He knew that Lady Yan was already suspicious, which was why she had forced her way in. It was obvious that Yun Shuang Shuang was of critical importance to Lady Yan, so much that she could even turn hostile against him for her.

…This concerned Yan Tian Zhao’s future prospects.

One should never underestimate the maniacal lengths a mother could go to; she could do unimaginable things for the sake of her child.

Lady Yan slightly started, and instantly dissolved into a bout of delicate laughter. She did not mind showing off the “waves” of her body in front of Ling Han, causing Ling Han to feel disgusted. This body was a bit too old for his tastes. He had zero interest in seeing anything at all.

“Mister Ling, has Shuang Shuang come here previously?” She suddenly stopped, turned and asked him.

“Naturally.” Ling Han nodded. “Lady Yan invited me over for a banquet a few days ago. Didn’t you just send Miss Shuang Shuang over with the invitation?”

“Shuang Shuang did not come here today?” Lady Yan asked, her tone laced with meaning. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han knew that this was the point where they would be laying all their cards out on the table.

If he answered no, and Lady Yan managed to find Yun Shuang Shuang here, then the relationship between them would naturally be completely shattered.

“No!” Ling Han denied, without sparing even a moment of thought.

Though he had always had a heart to sympathize with the weaker party, Ling Han thought that the kind of person who could manipulate the adopted daughter that she herself had taken in in such a way was disgraceful.

“Mister Ling would not mind if I take a look for myself, right?” Lady Yan asked.

“If I say I mind, would Lady Yan listen to me?” Ling Han countered, sighing deeply in his heart. If Guang Yuan had come over today, it would have been good.

Lady Yan merely giggled delicately, and began to tour around his courtyard, very quickly arriving at the room that the Liu sisters were staying in. She gave a light push, and when she realized that the doors were locked, a cold smirk curled up the corners of her lips. She suddenly exerted power through her palm, and pa , the latch that kept the doors locked was shattered from the force.

A creak resounded, and the doors opened slightly.

Lady Yan gave a light push, and the two doors instantly opened wide.

“Ya!” A girl had been in the process of putting on her clothes, and when she saw the visitor, she hurriedly used her clothing to cover her breasts and asked with alarm, “Who are you?”

Lady Yan’s eyes swept over her. This was a young girl, and an extremely beautiful one at that, but she looked very different from Yun Shuang Shuang. Moreover, she was too familiar with Yun Shuang Shuang. Even if the latter had disguised herself, there was no way her eyes would be fooled.

This girl was obviously not her.

“Ai, I’d like to request Lady Yan to keep my secret!” Ling Han deliberately sighed. “Please do not tell Yu Tong!”

A flash of suspicion passed over Lady Yan’s face. Could it be that this girl was Ling Han’s little girlfriend, and that was why he had tried repeatedly to stop her from entering? It was as simple as that? However, why did this girl look a little familiar to her?

As she thought, she slowly nodded, and said with a smile, “Men are indeed all greedy and lecherous. Yu Tong is the princess of the Liu Clan. Treat her well; please do not miss out on such a wonderful relationship.”

Ling Han merely grinned awkwardly.

“I shall not disturb the two of you, then. I still have some matters to attend to, so I shall beg my leave here. If Mister Ling is free, please do come frequently to the Cherishing Flower Pavilion to play. Tian’er misses you and Yu Tong very much.” Lady Yan turned around and left.

“I shall escort you.” Ling Han turned around and winked at Liu Feng Er, who was inside the room, then escorted Lady Yan out.

When they arrived at the doors, Lady Yan abruptly turned around and asked, “Mister Ling, what is the name of that girl just now? I seem to have seen her somewhere before?”

“How could that be? She is just a silly girl who has never seen the world,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Lady Yan nodded, turned and left.

Ling Han closed the door and hurried to the room. At this moment, Liu Ru Er and Yun Shuang Shuang had also crawled out from underneath the bed. They had been holding their breath and hanging from the bedframe all along just now, so at this moment, they were panting for breath.

“Hu, thank goodness the old witch was fooled and left!” Liu Ru Er said, patting her chest in relief.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Maybe not!”

“Hasn’t she already left?” Liu Ru Er asked in incomprehension.

“She has, but she has not let go of all her suspicions,” Ling Han said. “If it was not for the fact that she did not want to completely turn hostile against me, she would have searched through the whole courtyard just now. However, this will only delay her for a while.”

He paused, and said to Liu Feng Er, “However, your identity has been exposed. I believe that she will quickly recall that you are a wanted criminal.”

“That’s impossible!” Liu Ru Er shook her head, then said proudly, “I deliberately let my sister step out just now. No one has seen her real face before!”

“Are you an idiot!” Ling Han said bluntly, and pointed at the mirror. “Just take a look at how similar the two of you look like? There would also be some discrepancies with the portrait of the wanted criminal, so the two of you can completely be taken to be the same person!”

“She must have gone to inform the Imperial Guards by now, and before long, the Imperial Guards would arrive to investigate. By that time, the three of you would be found, and her goal would naturally be achieved.”
