Chapter 2085: Respective successes

There seemed to be a problem with that alchemy chamber of Fan Luoling. From the outside, only a very vague outline could be seen. Though she could still be distinguished, and it was indeed her, all other details were too blurry.

Someone gave that feedback, but the response from the Ancient Alchemy Tower was that this alchemy chamber had some slight problem, but now that the competition was about to begin, it was impossible to call a halt to the proceedings, which would affect the others.

In any case, it was only a little blurry, and would not affect the greater scale of things, so it was fine.

Though this kind of explanation was very dissatisfactory to everyone, who would dare to doubt the words of someone from the Ancient Alchemy Tower?

There was no problem, so the competition would begin.

At a command, the competition for the final group began.

Ling Han had long since started studying Four-Star alchemical pills, and had also obtained guidance from Grandmaster Zi Cheng. He had discussed alchemy a great many times with this grandmaster, and was only a step away from success.

He took out his Celestial medicines.

Concocting a Celestial pill naturally needed Celestial medicines, but with the difference of star value of various alchemical pills, the requirement of age for the Celestial medicines would also differ. Ordinarily, concocting a Three-Star alchemical pill would need Celestial medicines that were 10 billion years old, and Four Stars would need Celestial medicines aged 100 billion years old!

As for Five-Star alchemical pills, the Celestial medicines needed would have to be trillions of years old. In fact, it would not be strange for the Celestial medicines to be an epoch old, either, which naturally would be Ninth Heaven Celestial ****.

Even Ling Han only had a small portion of this kind of Celestial medicine. That was a portion of root that looked completely ordinary. It looked like ginger, but in terms of value, it would make the majority of Four-Star Alchemists feel embarrassingly short of money.

Tortoise Tuckahoe, aged 400 hundred billion years old, was specially prepared for him by Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

Even an extremely wealthy person like Grandmaster Zi Cheng would feel pain to hand out this kind of treasure.

Ling Han also felt heartache because this Tortoise Tuckahoe could not be used many more times. Previously, he had already attempted concoction a good few times, and the expenditure of the Celestial medicine was very high.

This was a main ingredient. Of course, there were also some supplementary ingredients. The majority of them were Saintly medicines, and there were some that were Celestial medicines aged around 100,000,000 years old.

Ling Han took a deep breath, and did not rush to begin pill concoction.

There were time acceleration effects of a hundredfold here, and time was comparatively less valuable here. Additionally, the time period for the competition was as long as 10 days, and under the acceleration effects, it would be around three years. To concoct a Four-Star alchemical pill, this naturally was more than enough time, and he could afford to fail quite a few times.

Ling Han calmed his emotions, and after a whole seven days, he finally began moving.

The moment he started, he was like thunder, as fast as lightning. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Under the time acceleration effects, time passed very quickly. Very soon, three months had already passed.

Pa!

The cauldron exploded, and Ling Han’s face was also charred black from the explosion.

“I still have two chances,” Ling Han murmured. Now, it was not time that was lacking, but rather that the ingredients in his possession were only enough for two more attempts of pill concoction.

He was not in a rush to begin his second attempt, but rather closed his eyes to review the details of his failed attempt.

It was a shame that he couldn’t enter into the Black Tower under the eyes of the masses. Otherwise, if he underwent reflection underneath the Reincarnation Tree, it would only be a blink of an eye.

He sat unmoving for a whole half year’s time, and then began his second attempt.

Everything progressed very smoothly, but when it came to the fifth month,?pa, the cauldron exploded again.

‘I’m just that bit away from the finishing line.’ Ling Han felt it was very much a pity. ‘If I had three more portions of ingredients in my possession, I would have absolute confidence that I could succeed, but now… I am only left with the last chance.

‘I will either succeed or die trying!’

He began to sit in reflection again. Then, in another half year’s time, Ling Han’s eyes snapped open, revealing an absolute confidence.

He would definitely succeed this time.

He was the kind of person that the more pressure there was on him, the more he could explode with endless motivation.

And now, there was already no way out for him, but he did not feel the slightest bit of anxiety or nervousness. Instead, his fighting spirit blazed, and his confidence soared. His yearning for success filled him with excitement.

“Come!”

He began his third and also final attempt of pill concoction. If he still failed this time, then he could only choose to concoct a Three-Star alchemical pill.

On the outside, there were people gradually coming out of their alchemy chambers.

Some people had long since succeeded, but were not satisfied with their present results, and wished to concoct alchemical pills that would be more satisfactory, and so were still continuing their pill concoction there.

However, when the eighth day in the outside world arrived, the majority had already ended their pill concoction, and exited their respective alchemy chambers. They handed over their alchemical pills so that they could be assessed.

Pa, the doors of an alchemy chamber opened, and a young man with lanky build walked out.

“Look, Wu Zixu has come out!”

“What kind of alchemical pill has he concocted?”

“With so much time having passed, it must be a Four-Star alchemical pill.”

“That’s not definite. It is possible that he has concocted a considerable number or cauldrons of Three-Star alchemical pills, right?”

Under the spirited discussions of the masses, Wu Zixu strode out, a sliver of pride in his expression.

He had succeeded!

He had not been crushed by the pressure, but had instead successfully surpassed himself, and succeeded in opening the doors to the threshold of a Four-Star Alchemist. From now onwards, he could be addressed as grandmaster, a true grandmaster of alchemy.

He handed over the alchemical pill that he had concocted to be appraised by the alchemist outside, his hands crossed behind his back, appearing to be filled with confidence.

“Semi Deficiency Dao Pill, Four Stars, normal standard.” That alchemist gave out his conclusion after a simple observation.

Instantly, uproar arose in the surroundings.

A Four-Star alchemical pill!

Finally, someone had concocted a Four-Star alchemical pill, and so far, this result was undoubtedly the best.

“As expected of Wu Zixu, he completed his breakthrough under such pressure, and became a Four-Star Alchemist!”

“Heavens, just how old is this guy, and he is already a Four-Star Alchemist.”

“Sigh, this is what natural talent is, which we cannot envy.”

Everyone was looking at Wu Zixu enviously. The people who had come to take part in the competition this time were basically all Three-Star Alchemists, and Two-Star Alchemists and One-Star Alchemists would not have the face to come at all. At most, they would only test their skill at recognizing herbs in the first test.

The difference between Three Stars and Four Stars was the difference between Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier. It was so huge that it was like a whole world of difference.

“It must be Wu Zixu that is the first place this time.”

“After this test, he will be able to catch up to Ling Han in marks, but a Four-Star grandmaster would definitely attain Fifth Refinement in Spirit Refinement. Thus, he would definitely still be able to win in the third test.”

“He, I have already said that Wu Zixu would definitely be the champion this time round.”

“Thankfully, I wagered on Wu Zixu becoming champion, and my bet is a whole several hundred thousand Star Stones.”

“I have also bet all my wealth on Wu Zixu.”

Just at this moment, the doors of an alchemy chamber opened again, and a white bearded old man walked out.

Alchemist Riyang.

“How is it? How is it?”

Everyone was curious. He was a veteran alchemist, and it was long said that he would become a Four-Star Alchemist, but year after year passed, and Alchemist Riyang was still stagnating. However, no one has ever dared to look down on him.

Alchemist Riyang broke into a smile, and spread open his hand. There was a round purple-colored alchemical pill lying in the palm of his hand.

“Fantasy Purple Jade Pill, Four Stars!” an alchemist beside him blurted out, and then bowed to Alchemist Riyang. “Congratulations, Alchemist Riyang. You have finally advanced into the ranks of Four-Star Alchemists.”

Alchemist Riyang smiled faintly, and rubbed his beard, appearing very reserved. However, the curled-up corners of his lips betrayed him. He was clearly extremely proud of himself internally.

“Now, the situation is hard to determine.”
