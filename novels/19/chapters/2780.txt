2781 Black Waterfall Mountain

This mystery realm was called Black Waterfall Mountain.

Ling Han looked up, and a towering mountain entered his vision, its height supreme and unknown. Even with his powerful vision, he was still unable to see its peak. It was as if there were no end in sight. Meanwhile, a black waterfall draped down from the waist of the mountain, the noise that it created deafening and earth-shattering.

This waterfall was astonishing, with innumerable heavenly bodies surging through it. In fact, Ling Han was even able to see living beings on these heavenly bodies. However, these swathes of lands were all protected by layers of light, which prevented them from being shattered.

Just how tall was this waterfall? As these heavenly bodies fell down, they were actually able to nurture living beings?

!!

“This is Black Waterfall Mountain. In the battle of yore, the power of the Heavenly Venerates was absolutely petrifying, and they completely transformed the terrain of this area. In fact, they might have even shattered the void and made contact with some other dimensions, thereby resulting in these falling lands,” Yuan Yinglong explained. He had clearly done his research on this area, so he was aware of many fine details.

Everyone nodded in understanding. As they gazed at the towering mountain, they all felt a sense of awe and respect.

“Where’s the entrance?” Ling Han asked.

“Walking against the flow of the waterfall, the entrance will be at its end,” Yuan Yinglong replied.

Whoosh!

Just as they were about to set off, several figures soared over and stopped not far away from them.

Yuan Yinglong glanced over, and his pupils involuntarily contracted. “Liu Shishuang!” he exclaimed.

“Who?” Ling Han casually asked.

“Father, you can’t focus solely on cultivation and ignore everything else,” Ling Jianxue said with a shake of his head. “Liu Shishuang is an elite ranked in the top 300 on the recent leaderboard.”

This leaderboard wasn’t a battle prowess leaderboard or strength leaderboard, but in some sense, it was indeed something of the sort. After all, without enough power, how could one kill enough enemies and earn enough points?

Perhaps those ranked in the top dozen or two dozen wouldn’t be too far apart in strength. In fact, it was even possible that those who were stronger were ranked lower. This was also up to luck. However, the further apart in rank, the less it would be a problem of luck. Instead, it would genuinely be a representation of difference in power.

Since Liu Shishuang was ranked in the top 300, his strength was definitely far superior to that of Yuan Yinglong.

Of course, there were hundreds of thousands of Heavenly Venerates here, so just being able to enter the leaderboard itself was already proof enough of one’s extraordinary power.

Liu Shishuang didn’t take so much as a glance at Ling Han and the others. Instead, his eyes remained fixed on the black waterfall that was descending from the skies. However, those beside him were filled with arrogance as they swept their gazes over Ling Han and the others. This was especially the case with the Empress, where their eyes lingered the longest.

The Empress had already been breathtakingly beautiful to begin with. Now that she had advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, she was more so elegant and noble in appearance, and it was as if she were born with a dazzling halo that possessed infinite attraction.

Ling Han was displeased, and he shot daggers at these people.

“Brother Ling, don’t be rash!” Yuan Yinglong hurriedly said. He naturally wouldn’t give a toss about those measly underlings. However, Liu Shishuang was far too terrifying. As someone ranked in the top 300, Liu Shishuang could dispose of Yuan Yinglong in under 100 exchanges.

However, would Ling Han pay any heed to him? He couldn’t accept it even if these people were only having sexual fantasies about his wife.

Look not at that which contradicts etiquette. Did they not understand this concept?

He positioned himself before the Empress, blocking their gazes. With his Heavenly-Venerable-Tier power, those people were naturally unable to look through him and stare at the Empress.

“Brat, move aside!” one of them roared at Ling Han.

“Heh, she’s your wife? She’s fairly beautiful. However, isn’t it too selfish to hog her to yourself? Nice things need to be shared,” another person said. His words were extremely demeaning and humiliating.

Ling Han had only been displeased just then. Now, he was furious.

These two people weren’t Heavenly Venerates, and they were only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Yet, they actually dared to ridicule a Heavenly Venerate in public. Their impudence and courage weren’t based on their own power, but instead based on the power of the person behind them.

Liu Shishuang!

Their arrogance definitely hadn’t been nurtured in just a day or two. With such wanton disregard for others, it was certain that their actions were tacitly approved by Liu Shishuang.

While inside the barrier, things had still been alright. After all, they all possessed the same goal of battling against Hysteria. With the looming danger gone, however, their minds immediately started to wander.

This was to be expected. They weren’t members of an army with strict rules and regulations, so how could they maintain an eternal goal and forge eternal cooperation? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han strode toward Liu Shishuang and his underlings.

“Brother Ling!” Yuan Yinglong called, reaching out with a grabbing motion. However, he failed to stop Ling Han, and he could only furrow his brows.

He knew that Ling Han was powerful, but Liu Shishuang was no ordinary person, either! He was an elite ranked in the top 300 on the recent leaderboard! Once they collided, it was truly difficult to say who would emerge victorious.

Would Ling Han listen to Yuan Yinglong’s persuasion? F*ck! If Yuan Yinglong could remain calm when others humiliated his wife, could he still be called a man?

“What’s wrong? Want to fight?” the two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings said immaturely. They weren’t afraid of Ling Han at all.

“Don’t ask for trouble.”

Ling Han took another two steps forward. At this moment, another person stepped forward in front of the two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

This person was a Heavenly Venerate. He was blocky in stature, and he appeared as steady as a mountain.

“Move aside,” Ling Han said.

“Scram!” the blocky Heavenly Venerate also roared. “If you dare to take another step, I’ll be sure to teach you a lesson!”

Ling Han chuckled, and replied, “I genuinely don’t believe you.” He then took another step forward.

“Hmph!” The Heavenly Venerate lashed out, throwing a fist that caused even heaven and earth to tremor. His fist transformed into a large mountain as it smashed toward Ling Han.

Ling Han snapped his fingers.

Peng!

The fist projection instantly shattered, and Ling Han continued to march forward.

“Hmm?” The blocky Heavenly Venerate faltered upon seeing this. His strike had already been extremely powerful, so how had it been blocked with such ease?

“Fang Hongdian, what’s going on? Didn’t have enough for lunch?” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King jeered.

“Exactly. Don’t they call you the Invincible Fist?” the other Ninth Heaven Celestial King said.

The blocky Heavenly Venerate was called Fang Hongdian, and a hint of displeasure flashed across his eyes. These two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were both younger cousins of Liu Shishuang, and it was thanks to Liu Shishuang’s protection that they had become so arrogant and wanton. They even dared to mock Heavenly Venerates.

However, who told Liu Shishuang to be so lenient toward them? If he wanted to follow Liu Shishuang, then he would have to put up with these two stupid fools.

Another Heavenly Venerate stepped forward, and said, “Let me deal with him!” He was slender in stature, and he was so handsome and beautiful that he almost looked like a woman. “I’m Lian Zhenqing, here to ask for some guidance.”

Ling Han remained silent and unfazed. In any case, he would definitely pummel those two annoying people.

...

Seeing Ling Han’s silence, Lian Zhenqing rapidly rubbed his palms together.

Weng!

A blinding light surged forth.

He was channeling a Heavenly Venerate Technique. His companion’s attack had been easily blocked by Ling Han just then, so he decided to immediately unleash a powerful attack.

Boom!

He threw a punch, with his fist transforming into a golden-purple hammer that smashed toward Ling Han.

Ling Han snapped his fingers,

Peng!

The hammer instantly crumbled.

“Hmm?” Upon seeing this, the Heavenly Venerates on Liu Shishuang’s side were all astonished. To block a Heavenly Venerate Technique with such ease, this person seemed to possess unfathomable power.

Even Liu Shishuang retracted his gaze and turned around to look at Ling Han.

...

“You’re… Ling Han?” he asked.

“That’s right,” Ling Han replied with a nod. “Tell those two to apologize, and I’ll let things slide. I’ll only give them a beating.”

“In your dreams!”

“Preposterous!”

The two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings chided him in unison. It was as if they had suffered a great injustice.
