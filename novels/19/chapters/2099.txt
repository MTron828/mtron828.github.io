Chapter 2100: Future daughter-in-law?

Experiencing the heavenly tribulation was only a small matter for Ling Han. After half a day, the dark clouds in the skies dispersed, and fair weather returned—though there was no sun in the skies. It was only studded by countless stars eternally.

The heavenly tribulation had passed, which also meant that Ling Han had truly advanced to Yin Soul Tier.

“Bastard, how are you going to compensate me?” that bright, beautiful young girl yelled out. She did not lose her courage just because Ling Han was a Yin Soul while she herself was only a third severance. She was like a little tiger.

“Ling Han!” The Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou all raced over as well. Meanwhile, Xiao Gu was still bearing that endearingly silly expression. To say nothing of a mere 9,000 years having passed, even if nine trillion years passed, he probably wouldn’t change much, either.

“B-beautiful big sisters!” The bright, beautiful young girl’s eyes involuntarily lit up as she stared at the Empress and the others, no longer caring to call Ling Han to account about how he had brought disaster to befall an innocent passerby like herself.

“Yi, who is this?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked curiously.

This damn man was really quite powerful. He was just undergoing a heavenly tribulation, and he still managed to hook a little girl while he was at it. ‘So shameless! Why don’t you come and seduce me then?’

“Beautiful Big Sister, my name is Chen Shuangshuang.” The bright, beautiful young girl jumped up immediately, and then looked at Bewitching Maiden Rou with a besotted gaze. “Big Sister, can I hold your hand for a bit?”

Seeing her “perverted” expression, the Empress and the others were all surprised. If this little girl wasn’t indeed a genuine woman, they would definitely think that she was actually a man pretending to be a woman, and deliberately trying to take advantage of them.

She looked at Bewitching Maiden Rou with the pitiful eyes of a puppy, as if she would break into tears the moment Bewitching Maiden Rou shook her head or expressed refusal.

When Xiao Gu spotted someone new, his mimicking interest immediately soared, and he also looked at Bewitching Maiden Rou pitifully. “Beautiful Big Sister, my name is Chen Shuangshuang…”

“No way!” Bewitching Maiden Rou immediately stomped. Though Xiao Gu looked exactly the same as Ling Han, and though he was only a bone, how could her hand possibly be held by another man?

It definitely couldn’t.

“Big Sister…” Chen Shuangshuang dragged out her words in a whine.

“Big Sister…” Xiao Gu’s interest did not diminish.

Chen Shuangshuang couldn’t help but become furious. It was all this guy’s fault for butting in that this beautiful big sister was not willing to let her hold her hand. He was so extremely despicable.

“Little girl, just say what kind of compensation do you want?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

“Who’s a little girl?” Chen Shuangshuang planted her hands on her hips. This was just a good opening for her to vent her anger on Ling Han. “My age is much greater than yours, all right?”

Indeed, her flame of life had burnt for a few million years, and she was indeed older than Ling Han. However, not only was she older than Ling Han, she was also older than the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou, and she actually addressed Bewitching Maiden Rou as “big sister” so shamelessly, and without feeling the slightest bit embarrassed.

Ling Han chuckled. “How about I pay you some Star Stones?”

“No way!” Chen Shuangshuang shook her head. She took out a herb sack. “I have gotten a mission from the sect, and have come here to collect Numbing Clouds Mushrooms. However, I was just a bit away from finishing the task when the aftermath of your heavenly tribulation swept onto my herb sack, and as a result, the Numbing Clouds Mushrooms inside were all destroyed.

“I want you to compensate for my Numbing Clouds Mushrooms.”

Ling Han looked towards the three women, and the Empress said, “Just compensate with some Star Stones.” She was incredibly proud, and it was already kind enough of her to be willing to offer a compensation of Star Stones.

“Just kill her directly!” Hu Niu’s vicious nature was on full display. She quite enjoyed scaring others, but sometimes, you couldn’t tell if she was really just giving you a scare, or really planning to kill.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was just about to speak up when she saw Ling Han raise a hand in her direction. “Never mind about your opinion.”

‘F*ck!’

Bewitching Maiden Rou was irritated. This damn man, she really wanted to bite him to death 10,000 times.

“Big Sister, this man does not cherish you in the slightest, so you should leave him quickly!” Chen Shuangshuang took the opportunity to pull the rug out from under his feet.

“Never mind, we’ll just go with you to pick some more Numbing Clouds Mushrooms,” Ling Han said.

“Don’t speak in such a wronged way. This is what you should have compensated me for in the first place!” Chen Shuangshuang was really a hot-tempered little girl. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Let’s go then.”

They began roaming around in the Dark Forest. Though Numbing Clouds Mushrooms was a specialty of this place, it was not found everywhere. Moreover, there were an extremely large number of people who had come to collect it, so a little time was still needed to gather one.

“Miss Chen, which sect are you from?” Since there was nothing better for them to do anyway, Bewitching Maiden Rou began chatting with her.

“Big Sister, I am from the Heavenly Saint Palace,” Chen Shuangshuang immediately answered.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han was startled, and suddenly turned, asking, “You are from the Heavenly Saint Palace?”

“What is it? Gotten a scare?” Chen Shuangshuang was pleased with herself. The Heavenly Saint Palace was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier force, and even in the entire Celestial Realm, it was practically one of the highest-grade existences.

Ling Han was internally excited. “Then do you know someone named Ling Jianxue?”

His precious son had been sent to the Heavenly Saint Palace, and this was what Hu Niu had told him.

“Yi, how do you know of Junior Brother Ling?” Chen Shuangshuang looked at Ling Han, head tilted to one side. “Oh, I get it. You’ve found out that Junior Brother Ling has recently become a core disciple, and thus wish to become his follower, right?”

Become a follower of his own son?

Ling Han couldn’t help but show a strange expression, and said, “Your imagination is really quite active.”

Yet Chen Shuangshuang thought that she had guessed correctly, and proudly declared, “Then you have to work hard on gaining my favor because Junior Brother Ling always listens to me!”

“Is that right?” Ling Han asked casually, and then shot a look at the Empress.

The Empress got his signal, took a step forwards, and said, “Talk about yourself and Ling Jianxue.”

Chen Shuangshuang was immediately bewildered.

She liked beautiful women, not because there was some problem with her sexual orientation, but rather as she liked anything beautiful, and beautiful women belonged to this category. But the Empress and Hu Niu were both too beautiful, so beautiful that she felt pressured. She only dared to peek at them secretly, and did not even dare to strike up a conversation with them.

Now that the Empress was asking her a question directly, her little heart was beating wildly and erratically, so excited that she almost passed out.

However, with the Empress’s repeated questioning, she finally recovered slightly, and spoke of the matters between herself and Ling Jianxue.

Oh!

When Ling Han and the others heard this, they immediately understood. As it turned out, Ling Jianxue liked this senior sister of his, but Chen Shuangshuang was a little too casual, and had not realized the affections that Ling Jianxue bore towards her at all. She thought that the two of them were just fellow sect disciples that were merely closer with each other.

With such words, the gaze that Ling Han directed at Chen Shuangshuang changed. This was his future daughter-in-law.

“Oi, oi, oi, what’s that look in your eyes? So strange.” Chen Shuangshuang got a scare, “Let me warn you, don’t even think of having any designs on me. That would be absolutely impossible!”

“Why?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “Could it be because of that Junior Brother Ling?”

“Humph, even if I didn’t have 10,000 adorers, I would have 8,000. I don’t like a cunning guy like you.” Chen Shuangshuang expressed her disdain. This damn man actually seized three beautiful big sisters all on his own, which she was extremely envious of, so she naturally did not have the slightest liking for Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly. Though this daughter-in-law was a little thoughtless, and her tastes were rather strange, she had a good nature, and did not have any profound ideas, either, which made him very pleased.

“Again, again, I say, can you not look at me in such a strange way?” Chen Shuangshuang exclaimed in displeasure.

Ling Han raised his clasped hands, and said, “Fine, fine, fine. I’ll just avoid looking at you, all right?”

When this little girl found out he was her father-in-law in future, what kind of expression would she have?

Just the thought of it made him amused!

Ling Han suddenly discovered that he was also a mischievous character himself.
