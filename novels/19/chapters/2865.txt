2866 I’m not giving anyone face

“Ling Han, it would be better to pass it to me!” The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate spoke up as well. “In return, I will allow you to choose any 10 raw stones in our raw stone lane as compensation.”

Hearing these words, everyone couldn’t help but scoff secretly.

So stingy!

Could the value of 10 raw stones compare to the value of this broken saber? He was completely just planning to gain something without risking anything of his own. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

!!

Ling Han rolled his eyes at him. He had already made a clean sweep of that raw stone lane long ago. To say nothing of 10 pieces, even 100 or 1,000 raw stones would not be able to reveal anything valuable.

‘You can just keep on dreaming.’

“Ling Han, you should consider carefully,” Leng Dao also advised, his words filled with threat.

Ling Han glanced at him. “I hate you two. If either of you speak any further, I will definitely kill him. Would you believe me?”

The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate and Leng Dao instinctively wanted to say “no,” but when they spotted the killing intent that was hidden under Ling Han’s calm features, they swallowed the words that were just at the tip of their tongue.

They both humphed. What meaning was there for dignified Heavenly Venerates to just argue verbally? When Ling Han exited the city, they could just kill and rob him. The reason why the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate had previously not moved was because he felt that he alone was not enough of a guarantee to kill Ling Han, so he wanted to wait for Leng Dao to arrive.

Ling Han glanced at the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate again. The latter had been quite polite, so he smiled slightly. “Apologies, I myself am also quite interested in this saber.”

The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate’s gaze flickered. Since he was able to become the shopkeeper of Sever Void Lane, and oversee this place, his strength definitely surpassed the average of Fourth Tier.

However, should he move now and suppress Ling Han?

He was wary.

Firstly, this was in full public, and if he made a move to snatch the item forcefully, the matter of Sever Void Lane bullying their customers would spread out. In the future, who would still come to choose raw stones here? Wouldn’t they be afraid that if they unearthed anything valuable, it would be forcefully snatched from them as well?

By then, with several dozen Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates simultaneously interrogating him, how was he supposed to explain?

Secondly, Ling Han was not an ordinary Second Tier; his battle prowess was comparable to a Fourth Tier’s. If they fought, it would definitely cause tremendous damage to Culmination City, and the Fiery Silk would not be able to bear the consequences for such actions, either.

Hence, after further consideration, he nodded slowly. “In that case, Friend Ling has to be careful.”

These words seemed both like a threat and a reminder because it was not just he alone who had designs on that broken saber. Furthermore, there were at least two Heavenly Venerable Seals in Ling Han’s possession as well, and he had even more Great Herbs.

Who did not want to obtain them?

Ling Han merely smiled, then turned, and left.

“Wait!” A voice suddenly rang out, appearing very abrupt.

Everyone looked over, and couldn’t help but feel surprised, because the speaker was actually a Celestial King.

A mere Celestial King actually dared to speak up in these circumstances? Had his head been kicked silly by a donkey?

Yet this Celestial King’s expression was filled with arrogance as he declared, “My young master has said that he wants this broken saber. No one is to touch it. Otherwise, when my young master returns, whoever has taken this saber, my young master will seek them out and demand it from them.”

‘Hiss, what bold words; who is your young master then?’

Even those aggressive people like Yue Chengwang felt an uncontrollable urge to beat someone up. F***, the Celestial King was actually even more arrogant than him? Was he trying to steal his limelight here?

“My young master…” that Celestial King said slowly, extremely calm and steady, “…is Xin Qihu, Lord Xin!”

When these words fell, a dead silence fell over the area.

Who was Xin Qihu?

He was the greatest prodigy of all eternity, and though he had been stuck in the Fourth Tier for many years already, it was certain that his battle prowess had to be at the Fifth Tier, at least. Furthermore, his old man was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, an indestructible, immortal, terrifying existence.

Even if his old man was set aside, and it was him alone, how many people in this world could afford to offend him?

Thus, when Xin Qihu’s name was heard, everyone fell silent, and even Yue Chengwang gave up his intentions to compete.

It could not be helped; he really could not compete.

That Celestial King’s expression was filled with pride. His master had that kind of intimidation. He had already witnessed this kind of scene a considerable number of times, and who would dare to disobey his command?

Ling Han moved, and piled those layers of stone on the broken saber. Otherwise, even he would have to suffer some effects, and this could not be used to intimidate an opponent at all, because once the saber was exposed, and he was the nearest, the effects on him naturally would be the most severe.

“Very good, you are very proactive!” When the Celestial King saw how Ling Han had taken the initiative to “wrap” the broken saber, he couldn’t help but nod, a smile appearing on his face. The action of commanding a Heavenly Venerate made him feel an indescribable feeling of superiority.

He did not need to become a Heavenly Venerate himself, but could still command a Heavenly Venerate. This was too fun.

Very soon, Ling Han had concealed the broken saber completely, wrapping a thick layer of stone around it. Then, he picked it up. He attempted to stow it away into his Spatial Tool, but before he had managed to stow it in, it had already destroyed the Spatial Tool.

He shook his head. From the look of things, the only thing he could do was hold it.

“Bring it over here quickly,” the Celestial King harshly shouted when he saw how Ling Han was moving slowly.

Ling Han glanced at him, and strode over.

When everyone saw this, they all shook their head. Sigh, even someone as strong as Ling Han had to bow his head in submission.

Xin Qihu was too powerful. With this kind of authority, tsk, even just his subordinate could be so domineering and overbearing.

Seeing Ling Han approach, that Celestial King couldn’t help but reveal a proud grin.

Heavenly Venerate? Ptui!

Ling Han had already drawn near, and that Celestial King very naturally extended his hand, wanting to take the broken saber from him.

Pa! Ling Han moved, and delivered a slap right at him.

That Celestial King’s eyes immediately bulged. He had never imagined that Ling Han would, and actually dared to, make a move on him, but how could he possibly be capable of sustaining the blow of a Heavenly Venerate? He did not even manage to counter, and he had already been blown up, turning into a fountain of blood.

Ling Han very carelessly flicked his hand, as if he was swiping off some dirt that was on his hand.

Quite a number of people were gaping, appearing extremely shocked.

That was Xin Qihu’s servant. Though his individual strength was not even worth mentioning, killing him was in fact equivalent to slapping Xin Qihu. This would become a huge problem.

But there were also a number of people who were pleased. A mere Celestial King actually dared to order around a Heavenly Venerate; this was a reasonable kill.

Ling Han turned and left. Since he had killed the Celestial King, that was it. Was there any need to take it to heart? As for Xin Qihu? Sooner or later, he would battle the latter.

...

Everyone saw him off. Some looked impressed and admiring, while some sneered, delighting in his misfortune. There were some that had soaring killing intent, and were waiting for a chance to make a move.

Ling Han, Ling Xi, and Fu Tianxing went to find Hu Niu and the Empress, and they decided to return to base after reuniting with them.

They had already stayed here for more than 900 years, and had already unearthed more or less all the valuable raw stones here. Furthermore, after this competition, Ling Han was probably going to become the least welcomed customer of every raw stone lane here. It was already impossible for him to want to get rich secretly.

Hence, there was not much meaning left in continuing to stay here.

Moreover, Ling Han also wanted Zhou Heng and the others to help him take a look at this broken saber to see if they could think of some way to make it so that it would not have any effect on the user. If that was possible, the significance of the saber would be much greater.

They set out, exiting Culmination City, and turned back around to head to base.

But clearly, it would not be so easy for them to leave.

Not long after exiting the city, they spotted a man that was sitting in the distance.

There weren’t any plants here, so there was nothing keeping the soil rooted. Dirt and sand fluttered in the air, seemingly like a desert. In this kind of place, there was a chair. Aside from deliberately posturing, what other significance would there be?

This show-off was Yue Chengwang.

“Ling Han, do you think you can leave so easily without my permission?” he said in a disdainful tone.
