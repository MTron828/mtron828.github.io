Chapter 233: Feng Yan’s Backer

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Pa pa pa , a flurry of slaps instantly woke Ao Yang Ming up.

“Where am I? Where’s Uncle Fu?” he asked with a shiver in his voice.

Ling Han kicked him and said, “Am I asking you, or are you asking me?”

Ao Yang Ming clenched his teeth, but upon seeing an unfamiliar environment, his expression paled; this obviously was somewhere far from the forest they were just at, or they wouldn’t appear in a plain.

Just how long was he unconscious that he was brought to a place so far away? Was Uncle Fu such a good-for-nothing that he let Ling Han run away with him?!

“You really want to go against Winter Moon Sect?” he said coldly. Since he’d already flaunted his status as Winter Moon Sect’s direct disciple, he naturally wouldn’t back down again, diminishing Winter Moon Sect’s prestige.

Pa , Ling Han threw another kick, kicking off several of Ao Yang Ming’s teeth. Ao Yang Ming’s face was full of fresh blood and he looked extremely dreadful, but there was no need to pity an ingrate. Ling Han said indifferently, “Why did you come here?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Devil Sky Mystery Realm’s appearance was an accident that no one could foresee, so Ling Han would definitely not believe Ao Yang Ming came for the mystery realm.

Ao Yang Ming wiped the blood on the corner of his lips, revealing a hint of fear in his eyes. Uncle Fu was not beside him now and Winter Moon Sect’s reputation couldn’t scare this extremely daring guy before him, so he took the wise path and said, “I came to find someone.”

Pa , he took another kick. He was so angry that he wanted to climb up from the ground and put up a desperate fight against Ling Han, but as he saw Ling Han’s cold eyes, he felt a chill within, losing all courage instantly.

“Don’t leave things half said. If you continue to speak and break off, I’ll break all your limbs, leaving only your mouth to talk,” Ling Han said coldly.

Ao Yang Ming felt a chill brewing from the bottom of his heart, instantly enveloping him as if his entire body froze over. If it were someone else who said such ruthless words, he would definitely snort in disdain—who dared treat him so as a Winter Moon Sect’s disciple?

However, Ling Han… this guy was truly ruthless, making him feel endless chills.

“The person I was looking for is called Feng Yan…” he said honestly.

“Feng Yan!” After hearing this name, Ling Han instantly came to a sudden realization, finally knowing where Feng Yan’s confidence came from.

Winter Moon Sect!

“Why are you looking for him? What’s the relationship between Feng Yan and Winter Moon Sect?” Ling Han asked.

“A few months ago, when Feng Yan was traveling, he met one of the sect’s elders, who intended to recruit him as a disciple. However, he was given a trial—he must break through to Spiritual Ocean Tier in three months,” Ao Yang Ming confessed.

“I wanted to get acquainted with Feng Yan, so I came to Rain Country to become Feng Yan’s friend before his reputation became prominent.

In the end, Devil Sky Mystery Realm opened while I was on the way, so I entered the mystery realm first.”

Ao Yang Ming was very miserable. He came to find Feng Yang in order to increase his status within Winter Moon Sect, but never did he think that he would bump into Ling Han—a malignant star—before he met Feng Yan.

Ling Han felt it odd, and said, “Although Feng Yang has a special constitution, he only has a Silver Mirror Body… what tier is that elder? Flower Blossom, or Spiritual Infant?”

Hearing him speak of Flower Blossom and Spiritual Infant Tiers indifferently, Ao Yang Ming felt a wave of fright, because Ling Han’s tone had absolutely no shred of respect and fear for them, as if Spiritual Infant Tier was not even worthy of his attention.

The reality was certainly so.

“Spiritual Infant Tier!” he said with a quiver in his voice.

“Strange!” Ling Han shook his head. He now knew where Feng Yan’s confidence came from. Becoming a Spiritual Infant Tier’s direct disciple naturally meant he could do anything he wanted in Rain Country; even Rain Emperor wouldn’t dare touch him… otherwise, if an old monster in Spiritual Infant Tier was drawn out, then even Rain Country’s recluse Flower Blossom Tier would be unable to fend him off.

The question was, was one with Silver Mirror Body really good enough to be a Spiritual Infant Tier martial artist’s disciple? Let alone Silver Mirror Body, even Gold Mirror Body was barely worthy of such an honor as Spiritual Infant Tier already stood at the seventh stage of cultivation—what was left above was Deity Transformation and Heaven Tier.

Even further up? Further up was Shattering Void, which could break open the skies and enter the divine plane, attaining godhood.

Feng Yan should have another secret that made a Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator recruit him as a disciple. This point Ling Han had already sensed; for example, he could fight against the Eldest Prince despite his cultivation being two layers lower, a domineering art like Son of Heaven Fist Technique that could borrow from the power of the nation in the latter’s hands notwithstanding.

“Sooner or later we’ll fight, and when the time comes, I’ll dig out all your secrets!” Ling Han murmured.

“Ling Han, if you let me go, I can pretend nothing ever happened!” Ao Yang Ming tested his luck.

“You need a beating again?” Ling Han leisurely asked.

Ao Yang Ming instantly covered his mouth out of fright. He really had not many teeth left for Ling Han to trample on.

“Who is Ao Feng to you?” Ling Han finally asked his main concern.

Ao Yang Ming revealed a startled expression; how could a mere small martial artist from Rain Country know his father’s name? Could it be that he too was… impossible, his father had many illegitimate children, up to the hundreds, but every one of them was surnamed Ao.

“So?” Ling Han’s expression turned cold.

“That’s my father!” Ao Yang Ming hurriedly said.

“What tier is Ao Yang Ming currently?”

“I’m not sure…” Ao Yang Ming said, and explained hurriedly after seeing Ling Han’s sharp gaze, “I normally don’t have many chances to see father, and I’m not his favorite child, so I’m not particularly sure. However, according to the people within the sect, father had already reached the peak stage of Spiritual Pedestal Tier five years ago!”

He involuntarily straightened his back. Although Ao Feng was rather loose, his martial arts talent was exceptional, with the possibility of crossing into Flower Blossom Tier and becoming Winter Moon Sect’s true core personnel.

Ling Han acknowledged it tacitly. After ten years, Ao Feng’s cultivation progress made quite a leap, which was normal—the thought of letting Ling Dong Xing take revenge… that was a bit difficult.

He had to increase his cultivation as fast as possible so that he would be able to restore Ling Dong Xing’s Spirit Base and use large amounts of medicinal pills to slam Ling Dong Xing to Flower Blossom Tier.

Flower Blossom Tier was the largest dividing line in martial arts. It could practically be said that Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivators were the strongest mortals, and Flower Blossom Tier was a stage that surpassed mortals, an indescribable difference.

If Ling Han reached the peak of Spiritual Pedestal Tier, it would be impossible to beat someone in the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier even with his freakish abilities… staying alive would already be something to be proud of.

If Ling Dong Xing was the first to cross into Flower Blossom Tier, crushing Ao Feng would be as easy as the turn of a palm—he could ignore arts and skills, and the difference in experience.

“How many sons and daughters does your old man have?” Ling Han was suddenly a bit curious.

Ao Yang Ming just wanted to shake his head to say he didn’t know, but then he thought of how ruthless Ling Han was, so he hurriedly replied, “I’m not too clear. Father never brought us together, but at least two, three hundred.”

“What a stud pig,” Ling Han sneered, and changed his expression into a serious one before he asked, “Do you know of someone called Yue Hong Chang?”
