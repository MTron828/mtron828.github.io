Chapter 1485 I Want to Take Her As My Wife

This was the wife of a Great Saint, and she had just given birth to his son and only child, no less. Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising if she were slightly more arrogant and haughty.Ling Han nodded, and said, “Then we won’t enter. We’ll drop him off from a distance and let him return by himself.” Although the child was only four or five years old, he had already broken through to the Shattering Void Tier. As such, would he be afraid of tripping over and hurting himself?

In any case, this was Ancient Academy. Even though the Star Sand Saint was always cultivating in seclusion, he would definitely still have a wisp of his divine sense looking over his precious son at all times. Under such circumstances, how could anything happen to him?

After pondering for a moment, Mo Li felt that Ling Han’s words were correct. He immediately stood up and used his Origin Power to stabilize his bones. He then gritted his teeth as he suppressed his pain and left.

There was cold sweat dripping down his forehead, yet he didn’t cry out in pain. In his eyes, this was a very valuable experience. He would remember this day forever, and he would never forget the original intentions that had led him down this path of dao.

The little boy was only four or five years old, and thus he couldn’t be overly immoral regardless of how spoiled he was. With some playful encouragement from the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he quickly started to giggle, quickly forgetting about his desire to ride on her back.

Ling Han walked over, and said, “Let’s bring him home.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Mm-hm!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded in agreement before turning to Ling Han and saying, “I also want a child!”

Her eyes were as limpid as water, and there was a look of intoxicating seductiveness within them.

Ling Han’s heart fluttered, and he said, “Then let’s leave this brat here and head off to make some monkeys!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden rolled her eyes at him. How could he say this before such a young child? Although such a young child definitely wouldn’t understand.

“I want to ride on a monkey!” The little boy understood the word “monkey”, and he immediately started to shout in excitement.

Ling Han casually waved a hand and retrieved a Demonic Beast from the Black Tower. This Demonic Beast was much like a monkey, apart from the pair of wings on its back.

This was a Flying Monkey.

The Demonic Beast was aggressive, and it immediately bared its teeth upon arriving before them. Moreover, it could determine the strength of the three people before it, so it directed all of its aggressiveness toward the weakest young boy.

Although the little boy already possessed a very impressive cultivation level, he was still extremely young, after all. He was given a huge fright by the sudden appearance of the monkey, and he immediately started to bawl.

“We’re meant to be bringing him back home, not scaring him,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. At the same time, she thought to herself that she definitely couldn’t allow Ling Han to raise their child, whenever she managed to give birth to one. He was far too casual.

After spending great effort to cheer up the little boy, the two of them continued to lead him home. After all, he possessed a sensitive identity, so there would definitely be trouble if he went “missing” for too long.

“I want to ride a horse! I want to ride a horse!” After a short while, the little boy started to repeat his previous request again. His attitude was extremely aggressive.

He was already accustomed to being spoiled, and thus he was insistent on getting anything that he desired. If he didn’t obtain what he wanted, he would simply start to cry. Once he started to cry, he would definitely have his wish fulfilled. This tactic had never failed before.

Ling Han tossed the Flying Monkey before him again, saying, “Here, ride it!”

The monkey bared its teeth, a fierce look on its face.

The little boy couldn’t help but plonk to the ground in fright. However, he didn’t cry this time. Instead, his face had gone pale with fright.

“Why you... He’s still a child. Is there any need to frighten him like this?” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden hurriedly helped the little boy up.

Ling Han scratched his head upon hearing this. He was accustomed to dealing with adults, whom he could reason with. If they didn’t understand reason, he would then employ force. However, this was just a spoiled little brat. If both reason and threats failed, he would be at a complete loss for what to do.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden waved a hand at him, and said, “Don’t say anything else!” She deprived him of the right to look after this child.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. He was a cultivation genius, and he was also the Alchemy Emperor. Moreover, he also possessed outstanding talent in the field of formations. It could be said that he was an extraordinary prodigy. However, there was no perfect person, and there were also areas in which he was poor.

If there were anything to blame, it would be that he had spent far too little time with his own son. Thus, he had absolutely no experience when it came to children.

In any case, Hu Niu became jealous far too easily. Otherwise, he would have Helian Xunxue to his left, Shui Yanyu to his right, and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden behind him. In his embrace would be the empress. If that were the case, how joyous would his life be?

‘I have to cultivate harder and strive to enter the Celestial Realm as soon as possible. Otherwise, my wives and son won’t even recognize me in the future!’

It was only natural that the little boy was a very poor guide. As such, it took them a long time and many wrong turns before they finally arrived before a peaceful and serene courtyard. This was the little boy’s home.

Before Ling Han could even knock, he heard a creak as the gate slowly swung open. An old man of around 70 years old walked out from the courtyard. Both his hair and eyebrows were white, yet he wasn’t hunch-backed in the least. He was dressed in a jade robe, and it looked like he was the housekeeper of a prestigious family.

However, it was indeed true that few families in the world could hire a housekeeper such as him.

This was an Eternal River Tier elite, and his cultivation level was even higher than that of Ling Han’s. However, Ling Han couldn’t determine whether he was at the medium extreme, high extreme, or consummate level.

“Young Master Yun!” The old man wore a beaming smile as he reached her arms toward the little boy.

However, the little boy didn’t give him any face at all. He immediately turned around to wrap his arms around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s neck instead. He didn’t want to be embraced by the old man.

“We’ve brought him back home, so let’s take our leave now.” Ling Han nodded toward the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, signifying for her to let go of the little boy. After receiving Mo Li’s warning, he didn’t want to meet the wife of the Great Saint at all. He wasn’t curious in the least.

However, even though the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had already squatted down, the little boy still wasn’t willing to let go of her neck. “Don’t leave! Don’t leave! I want to take you as my wife!” he shouted.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. This little brat dared to steal his wife?

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden smiled, and said, “Be a good boy, Little Yun. Come on, let go of my neck.”

“No, I want to take you as my wife! We can sleep together at night!” the little boy continued to shout.

Ling Han’s expression darkened.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden giggled, and said, “But big sister is already someone else’s wife.”

“I don’t care! I want to take you as my wife!” The little boy continued to cause a ruckus as he held onto the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s neck.

The old man smiled, and said, “Since this is the case, why don’t you stay here for a while, young lady? When Young Master Yun grows tired of you, you’ll naturally be able to leave.”

Ling Han was extremely displeased upon hearing this. He could treat children’s words as a joke since they were just children, after all. However, this was an old man, so didn’t he understand how to respect others? What did he mean that she could leave after his young master grew tired of her? Was he treating her as a fellow human being?

“We’re incredibly busy, and we have no time to look after a child!” he said calmly.

“Young man, Young Master Yun is the son of the Great Saint!” the old man replied calmly, not becoming angry at Ling Han’s words.

“My wife is also the child of her parents. What, do we owe you something?” Ling Han’s voice was cold and aggressive.

The old man chuckled, and said, “Even if Young Master Yun wants the sun in the sky, this old man will still do everything within his ability to obtain it for him. Not to mention, his current request is extremely easy to satisfy!” He extended his arms toward the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden as he spoke, and it was clear that he wanted to capture her and drag her into the courtyard.

“Humph!” Ling Han immediately threw a punch at him. This punch was imbued with a tremendous Sword Qi.

He had lashed out later than the old man, yet his Lightning Sword Technique was astonishingly quick, reaching the old man before he could grab onto the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. His punch instantly collided with the old man’s hand.

Weng!

A powerful shock wave instantly surged into the surroundings. If it weren’t for the Saint-level defensive formation around the courtyard, their exchange would have definitely obliterated the entire courtyard.

“Huh?” There was a look of astonishment on the old man’s face. This young man had actually blocked his attack!

Although he had only struck out casually, he was an elite at the peak stage of the high extreme! As such, how could a junior who had just advanced to the Eternal River Tier defend against him?
