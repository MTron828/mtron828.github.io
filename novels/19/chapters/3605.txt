Chapter 3606: Prodigy of the Lei Clan

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor. Henyee Translations

Zhang Qihua retreated rapidly, escaping the battle area, and withdrew his sword as he said, “I am no match for you.”

When he said these words, his expression was completely dark.

However, as a prodigy, if he didn’t even dare to admit the gap between them, then he wouldn’t be qualified to take another step forward.

However, Zhang Qihua was still filled with confidence. It was only because his cultivation level had been suppressed, and if he battled again in the Foundation Building Tier, he would definitely not be inferior, because his battle prowess was ranked in the 29th place of the younger generation. In fact, his battle prowess was even slightly higher than that rank.

Jumping over the Celestial Gate could possibly turn prodigies into mediocre people, and would also make mediocre people become even more mediocre.

Ling Han nodded. This young man’s abilities were really not weak.

Furthermore, he could be considered frank and upright, which dissipated some of his animosity.

Zhang Qihua stretched out his right hand, which turned into a palm blade that slashed onto his left arm, emitting a crisp sound. That left arm instantly drooped down; apparently, even the bones had been broken.

Cold sweat trickled down his forehead, and he said, “The next time we meet, I hope that you have already advanced into Celestial Path and we can have a good spar.”

Ling Han was surprised. He had actually planned to let him go, but Zhang Qihua really had his own personality, and directly broke his own left arm.

This kind of person was worth making friends with.

He nodded, and said with a smile, “All right. Next time, let’s spar a bit. Here-”

Ling Han threw out a bottle of alchemical pills.

Zhang Qihua took it, and looked at Ling Han in surprise.

“Injury medicine,” Ling Han said.

Zhang Qihua nodded, and revealed a smile. He directly poured out a pill and swallowed it, showing his strong trust in Ling Han.

“Pretty boy, take care that there is poison,” the little loli said. She was the type to wish for the whole world to be in chaos.

Zhang Qihua ignored her completely, and only nodded at Ling Han, “We’ll meet again.” He leaped out of the valley.

just as they were about to leave the valley, he said a few more words, which slowly drifted towards them.

“Be careful of the Pang Clan. They will definitely ask others for help.”

Ling Han smiled. This Zhang Qihua was really quite interesting.

“Little girl, will you feel uncomfortable if you don’t speak?” He looked towards the little loli.

“That’s right.” The little loli licked the toffee very quickly, “Unfortunately, that guy did not fall for it.”

“Let’s go!” Ling Han pulled the little loli into another mountain cave.

Ling Han fought monsters every day. Every morning, he would still cultivate under the morning sun, while he held the Fire Origin Stone in his hand. The power of heaven and earth surged towards him, boosting his cultivation level rapidly.

After so many days, his cultivation level had also improved rapidly, and he had opened another eighteen apertures.

Theoretically, he could already attempt to break through to the Mystery Realm

Tier.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t do that. He still yearned to open the Hidden Apertures. Thus, his path to the Enlightenment Tier was still incredibly long.

He collected more and more fire essence. It was said that when the amount of fire essence reached a certain extent, there was no need for him to do anything at all, as it would naturally condense into a Fire Element Crystal.

“It should be about time. At most, it would take another dozen over days.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. These few days, he had been battling with the flaming monsters. Though he was not afraid of battle, if he kept fighting with the same opponent, he would also get bored.

They were about to leave this place.

They had been battling for so many days, and there were times when Ling Han didn’t pursue efficiency. When he fought with the Flame King, he didn’t use any destructive power. Instead, he fought head-on and went all out against the Flame King, deliberately suffering some fire poison to temper himself.

In this way, even if he broke through immediately, there would be no shortcoming of unstable foundations.

In this place, Ling Han had already become a publicly acknowledged overlord. Everyone would avoid him.

The efficiency of him and the seven babies in killing monsters was too high. Even with how big this valley was, the number of fire monsters was still a little insufficient, often making it so that there were no monsters to kill.

But what could be done? Who would dare compete with Ling Han and the others over the kills?

This caused complaints to arise from the masses. How were they supposed to continue to make a living?

Right at this moment, the Pang Clan finally moved again.

When Ling Han walked out of the cave, he saw a young man standing in the valley. He looked to be in his mid-twenties. He was dressed in black, and his black hair was like ink, exuding a soft divine light.

“Ling Han?” The young man looked towards Ling Han. His eyes were like divine light, causing one’s skin to crack.

This was another elite.

Ling Han looked back, and asked, “And who are you?”

The young man in black strode over. Boom! His entire body surged with vitality, and it was as if he were a terrifying beast.

“You are not worthy of asking my name. I have come to kill you!”

p***

Ling Han’s expression immediately darkened. ‘You’re seeking death.

“As expected of Lei Jiujun, domineering!

“Of course! He’s a prodigy of the Lei Clan! He’s ranked 19th among the younger generation of Peaceful Splendor County!”

“If Young Master Lei makes a move, it would definitely be a sure bet this time.’ “We can finally eliminate this bringer of calamity. Otherwise, we’ll have to fight fire monsters here for decades. Just the thought of it makes me want to throw up.”

This time, there were a great many spectators. After so many days, they were already filled with anger, all wanting to see Ling Han being killed. At the very least, they wanted Ling Han to be chased off.

Lei Jiujun strode over. He couldn’t unleash the strength of a Foundation Building Tier cultivator, but he had also cultivated to an extremely powerful level in the mortal levels. His vitality surged like smoke, and he was like a cauldron that could incinerate everything.

“Do you have any last words?” he asked calmly.

“Handsome Brother, do you want to eat toffee?” The little loli approached. This Lei Jiujun looked quite good, which made her drool.

“Stand aside.” Ling Han picked up the little loli, and sent her to the side with a gentle force. Then, he looked towards Lei Jiujun, “I only have two words for you, heh.”

“Ignorance.” Lei Jiujun leaped out. Boom, he had cultivated a secret technique, and as he leaped out, lightning flickered behind him. All of a sudden, he had pushed his speed to the pinnacle, as if he was a bolt of lightning.

Ling Han humphed, and with a wave of his right hand, xiu, the Heavenly Pattern Jade had already shot out. With the activation of his Spiritual Power, its speed instantly soared to fourteen times the speed of sound.

Lei Jiujun’s speed was extremely fast to begin with, so he naturally couldn’t dodge the Heavenly Pattern Jade that was 14 times the speed of sound. However, he didn’t care. So what if it was a hidden weapon? He could send it flying with a single punch.

Sure enough, he waved his hand and swatted at the Heavenly Pattern Jade.

Peng!

His hand clapped onto the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and his expression changed drastically.

What terrifying destructive power. Such a small thing was actually so heavy, and added with fourteen times the speed of sound, with his present cultivation level of Mystery Realm Tier, how could he block it?

Instantly, blood spurted out, and his right hand was directly destroyed. However, even so, the Heavenly Pattern Jade’s course wasn’t blocked, heavily smashing into his lower abdomen.

“Oh!” Lei Jiujun stumbled backwards. His whole face turned pale at first, then turned dark purple in colour.

He knelt on the ground, his hands gripping onto his lower abdomen, as cold sweat rolled down his face.

At first, the people nearby were still cheering for him, but when they saw this scene, they all stopped abruptly.

How was this possible?

That was the prodigy of the Lei Clan! How had he been defeated with a single strike?
