Chapter 2167: Earnestly thoughtful

“Make him kneel with every step here!” Ling Dongxing exclaimed through gritted teeth. He actually dared to divorce his daughter.

F***, in the past, it had been Cheng Yifeng that had married above his station, and now that the Cheng Clan had obtained great gains from them, while the Ling Clan had lost any value for exploitation, he had discarded his daughter without hesitation?

Preposterous.

“Yes! Yes!” At present, Cheng Rong only wished that he himself could escape. As for Cheng Yifeng, how could he possibly take him to heart? To say nothing of merely crawling on his knees here, he would not be concerned even if they wanted to tear him into pieces.

“Then scram!” Ling Dongxing shot out a kick. “Furthermore, three days later, bring all that your Cheng Clan has obtained from our Ling Clan all these years and come back here. Even if there is just one less Star Stone, it will not be forgiven.”

Cheng Rong nodded quickly. As long as his life could be saved, it was fine even if it meant selling off the entire Cheng Clan. It was enough as long as he was still alive.

A Dividing Soul Tier elite was absolutely capable of rebuilding a powerful force.

Ling Han appeared, and clapped Cheng Rong lightly twice, sending a few streaks of power into his body. “Don’t even think of fleeing. I have planted some kind of restriction in your body, and you have to come back three days later to have me unravel it. Otherwise… You had best already found a good coffin for yourself.”

Cheng Rong’s body immediately trembled. He had indeed planned to bring the elites of the Cheng Clan, and flee as far as they could, but with this restriction from Ling Han, he naturally did not dare to have the slightest idea.

“Go on.” Ling Han patted his shoulder, as if they were good friends.

Cheng Rong was despondent, and knew that the Cheng Clan was really trapped this time. Ling Clan should be also a Dividing Soul Tier, he was sure of this fact. But the aura the other party exuded was stronger than his own by who knew how many times over.

…Without even appearing, he had dealt with him in a way that he did not dare to have even the slightest temper. This gap in power between them was like the distance between heaven and earth.

He did not know how he had made his way back to the Cheng Clan, right until everyone had surrounded him. Only then did he shudder, and regain his wits. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ancestor, what’s the matter?” A middle-aged man approached. He was incredibly handsome, and bore a devilish smile.

He was Cheng Yifeng, known as the “Lady Killer”. It was not because he would kill women, but rather because his charms were too great. There was not one woman that could resist him.

Pa!

Cheng Rong simply sent him a slap, causing Cheng Yifeng to spin seven to eight times from the blow before finally stopping.

“A-A-Ancestor?” Cheng Yifeng’s eyes widened, with him looking extremely innocent.

What had he done to anger the ancestor? He hadn’t done anything, right? He had only seen how the ancestor looked absent-minded, and deliberately came forward to curry favor. He had not thought that his flattery would have landed so completely offside.

Cheng Rong suppressed his anger, and shouted at Cheng Yifeng, “You, tomorrow, you will go to the Peach Blossom Origins, and pick up your wife!”

“Ah?” Cheng Yifeng appeared very astonished. Previously, wasn’t it the clan that had commanded that he was to split up with Ling Yueyan? Why was the ancestor now asking him to bring Ling Yueyan back?

“Kneel with every step, your sincerity has to be adequate!” Cheng Rong continued.

‘What?!’

Cheng Yifeng almost jumped. Not only was he to bring Ling Yueyan back, he would have to make his way there on his knees? He was a heartthrob, and every woman saw him as her dream guy. If he were to really kneel the entire way there, what woman would throw herself into his arms in future?

“Just do as I say, do you want to die!” Cheng Rong shot out another slap at him. It was natural that he would not be the slightest bit affected by Cheng Yifeng’s charms.

Cheng Yifeng could only nod. The ancestor was the heaven and earth for them, and every word from his mouth was a golden rule, and definitely could not be disobeyed.

After Cheng Yifeng was dismissed, Cheng Rong was naturally occupied by a lot of matters. Who knew how many benefits they had gained from the Ling Clan all these years, and even selling off the entire Cheng Clan would not be enough for repayment, but every slight bit that could be paid back counted. At least, it would allow Ling Han to see that he was being sincere, right?

When the second day was close to ending, a person arrived outside the Peach Blossom Origins, kneeling with every step he took, and advancing towards the valley at a very slow pace.

That was Cheng Yifeng.

He naturally could not possibly journey the whole way from Cheng Clan to here on his knees. Otherwise, it would not be enough even if he was given 10-15 days’ time. Instead, it was when he was closing in on the Peach Blossom Origins that he began to kneel with every step.

“Husband!” Ling Yueyan saw this, and immediately wanted to leap out, yet Ling Han stretched out his arm and blocked her, pulling her back.

What a joke, Cheng Yifeng wanted to bluff the rest of the way just by kneeling this little bit of distance?

“Brother!” Ling Yueyan’s personality was slightly soft, and when she saw how her beloved husband’s face was filled with love, she had completely forgiven him, and looked at Ling Han pleadingly.

Ling Han was unmoved. If Cheng Yifeng was not taught a serious lesson this time round, he naturally would not remember it deeply in his heart.

He tapped out lightly, and Cheng Yifeng immediately showed an expression of pain. That was because he suddenly discovered that his body felt heavier than 10,000 jin, and he couldn’t even stand up at all.

“Crawl your way here, and you will have passed. Otherwise…” Ling Han pointed at Cheng Wuya and the others who were still being suppressed in the valley. “They will be your example.”

At first, Cheng Yifeng wanted to continue to plead for forgiveness from Ling Yueyan, but looking at the agonized expressions of Cheng Wuya and the others, he immediately shuddered, and dismissed this idea completely.

He had best just crawl obediently.

He earnestly crawled towards the valley, but with boundless weight pressing down on him, his bones were cracking from the pressure, almost as if they were about to break. Large beads of cold sweat endlessly dripped, and he was feeling great agony.

He was not anyone with strong willpower, and very soon, he was sprawled out on the ground, unable to move the slightest bit further.

Ling Yueyan’s heart ached from watching, but she was being restrained by her parents, so it was impossible for her to rush forwards.

Firstly, Ling Han wanted to teach Cheng Yifeng a lesson, and also meant to drill him. Since he had already become his brother-in-law, with many children, and even grandchildren, this was not just raw rice being cooked, but completely burnt[1].

Thus, since this was a fact that could no longer be changed, Ling Han thus could only polish this stubborn rock. At the very least, this rock could be a bit shinier, and have some use, unlike now, when all he had was a pretty face and a mouth that knew to speak words that would gain him the pleasure of women.

Cheng Yifeng was sprawled out for a long time, and seeing that Ling Yueyan had still not appeared, he could only struggle and get back up. The weight was not something that would disappear just because he was sprawled out. He, too, wished to end this torture as soon as possible.

Two days passed, and he had just barely crawled one-third of the distance. At this moment, Cheng Rong returned.

He took out a considerable number of Spatial God Tools. Each Spatial God Tool was filled with cultivation resources, which included alchemical pills, Star Stones, and Godly metal. He knew that this was far from enough, and made his explanations to Ling Dongxing earnestly. He had indeed completely emptied the entire Cheng Clan, and would pay the rest back gradually. He would definitely not renege on the rest.

Ling Dongxing looked towards Ling Han, and asked, “Han’er, what do you say?”

His son was the pillar of support of the entire family. Ling Dongxing was willing to have Ling Han make the decision in this matter.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “That would depend on the performance of this brother-in-law of mine. If he can crawl his way here, then he will still be my brother-in-law, and we will be family. Matters of the family naturally can be easily negotiated.”

Cheng Rong understood what he meant. If Cheng Yifeng could not crawl here, then he would not be Ling Han’s brother-in-law, and in that case, they would not be family. Ling Han would definitely not have any further reservations.

“Yifeng definitely can do it!” He hurriedly expressed on behalf of Cheng Yifeng, thinking that even if he broke his bones in his crawling, he still had to crawl his way here no matter what.

Ling Han merely smiled in response. For the sake of this younger sister, he was being earnestly thoughtful.
