Chapter 1840: Refining a Celestial Kings’ Heart

Ling Han took a step forward, and started to channel his Origin Power. At the same time, he also displayed his Regulations, especially the Nine Heavens Flame that was burning with vigor.

The large black dog started to form hand seals again, controlling the colossal giant in the sky.

The colossal giant’s chest started to glow.

Pu!

A blazing fist-sized rock then flew over from his chest.

This was the colossal giant’s heart. It had been incredibly large before, yet after being refined by himself, it had now shrunk to the size of an ordinary fist.

Xiu!

The blazing heart was as quick as lightning as it flew toward the large black dog.

If it had been any other Immortal Palace Tier elite, they would have definitely been penetrated by this shooting heart. However, the large black dog had been a Celestial King before, so he still possessed some extraordinary abilities even though his cultivation had already fallen.

In any case, he clearly knew how to deal with this situation.

“Freeze!” the large black dog shouted as he made a tapping motion with his paw. The blazing heart immediately stopped in midair before slowly hovering above Ling Han’s head. “Close your eyes and calm your mind. Free yourself of all thoughts and channel the Flame Control Technique!”

Ling Han sat down and did as he was told.

The large black dog made a pointing motion, upon which the blazing heart instantly unleashed rays of light. It was as if it were unleashing a waterfall.

The large black dog waved his paw, and said, “I’ll share some of its essence with you and help you advance to the third severance. When this brat finishes defying the heavens and changing his fate, all of the remaining essence will be for you to absorb!” A small spark immediately flew out from the blazing heart, and floated toward the Empress.

This small spark then hovered above the Empress’ head before unleashing a waterfall-like wall of flames.

The Empress also sat down to absorb the essence. She didn’t feel embarrassed[1] at all, because in her eyes, it was only natural that everyone else served her. Did she need to be polite?

Boom!

It was as if mountains were crumbling and waves were roaring inside Ling Han’s body. Each of his cells transformed into a world before being tempered by flames and evolving toward a superior state.

Miracles could be nurtured through repetitive tempering.

This was analogous to how Level 20 Godly metal couldn’t advance to become genuine Divine Metal. However, even so, it could be continually tempered and strengthened until it reached the stage of 10-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. It would only be slightly inferior to genuine Divine Metal.

Ling Han was the same. Although his physique wasn’t perfect, the flames of this Celestial King were helping him cleanse the impurities in his body. Only the purest of essence remained. These flames would then use the essence of the Celestial King to nurture and strengthen Ling Han.

Otherwise, if he was only tempered and not nurtured, Ling Han would definitely be incinerated into ashes.

Even so, he still couldn’t help but groan in pain. This process was far too agonizing. This was a heart-wrenching pain that reached the depths of his soul, so it would be useless even if he were knocked unconscious. He would still be able to clearly feel this unbearable pain.

This was a fundamental transformation.

After all, Ling Han didn’t possess a Divine Fetus. Anyhow, what was a Divine Fetus? If a clan had a Celestial King Tier ancestor, and the Regulations of this Celestial King materialized upon some descendant, this would give birth to a Divine Fetus. The owner of this Divine Fetus would possess an extraordinary power, and they would often be invincible among those at the same cultivation level.

Right now, an eighth heaven Celestial King had refined his own body, and extracted his own essence in order to strengthen Ling Han. Was this not enough to comprehensively elevate the level of Ling Han’s foundation?

One had to realize that the Heavenly Fire Celestial King had possessed the ability to advance to the ninth heaven. Although he hadn’t succeeded, this wasn’t a reason to deny his formidable power. Moreover, he had comprehended dao as the Nine Heavens Flame, and he was a being who had been nurtured by the essence of heaven and earth. As such, just how valuable was this offering?

Ling Han’s body was developing into a Divine Fetus. However, there were also huge differences between different Divine Fetuses. After all, could the remnant Regulations of a first heaven Celestial King compare to the remnant Regulations of an eighth heaven Celestial King?

Moreover, this was a supremely powerful eighth heaven Celestial King. Not only that, but they hadn’t held back as they refined their own body.

Ling Han forcefully suppressed his pain as he channeled the Flame Control Technique, and guided the flames to reconstruct his body. Meanwhile, he also channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to protect his weakened divine sense. Otherwise, he would collapse under these extremely formidable flames.

“Old friend, you can finally rest forever!” the large black dog said as he removed his laughable Blood Dragon Armor. He had only used this suit of armor to conceal his power. Right now, he naturally didn’t need it anymore. Of course, he obviously wouldn’t be willing to remove his iron underwear. Otherwise, he would lose his eye-catching demeanor as Grandpa Dog.

A smile surprisingly spread across the colossal giant’s face. He then nodded before crumbling and falling apart.

Peng!

He transformed into countless bursts of flames that shot into the surroundings. Under the suppressive power of these flames, all of the chaotic aura in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm vanished without a trace.

First heaven Celestial Kings were nothing but trash before eighth heaven Celestial Kings, so the aura that they left behind in this mystery realm was naturally also wiped away with ease.

10 days passed, and the Empress suddenly unleashed a long cry. Under the help of the Celestial King Tier power, she had already opened the door to the third severance.

She started to undergo heavenly tribulation, and she performed her third severance of heaven and earth amid the vicious arcs of lightning. This enraged heaven and earth, yet the Heavenly Dao also had to guard its own Regulations. It wasn’t long before her heavenly tribulation calmed down and disappeared.

Before the Empress could even speak, the large black dog pointed at the spark of flame above her, causing a portion of its power to funnel into her. This forced the Empress to sit down again, accepting the transformation bestowed by the Celestial Flame.

She already possessed a Divine Fetus, so this transformation naturally wasn’t to give her a flaming Divine Fetus. Instead, it was a transformation to strengthen her Divine Fetus.

The large black dog clasped his paws behind his back, and his expression finally became incredibly solemn for the very first time.

“Time, it’s always time. There’s always not enough time. If the storm of darkness surges over, will this brat have enough time to grow and develop?” he murmured. “Those old monsters aren’t driven, and they don’t plan to suppress this storm of darkness. Instead, they’re always causing trouble and fighting among themselves. I definitely can’t allow them to discover the existence of this brat. Otherwise, this plan of hundreds of millions of years will vanish in a puff of smoke.

“Brat, don’t die on me. Even though your path is destined to be filled with extraordinary difficulties and obstacles, and even though you might be forced to walk this path alone and become the enemy of all other beings, you’re the only one who’s capable of walking to the end.

“Because you’re the only hope left behind by the Heavenly Venerate!”

Ling Han couldn’t hear the large black dog’s murmurings. Right now, he was completely focused on battling against the power of the flames, and guiding them through his body. He was maximizing the benefit of these flames, and this process of tempering and transformation was an extremely slow and gradual one.

After all, it had taken Gu Daoyi 10 lifetimes to finally develop his Divine Fetus. Although Ling Han had the help of a mighty Celestial King, this still wasn’t something that could be completed in an instance.

One year, two years, five years...

After almost 10 years, the blazing heart finally started to dim. It dimmed at an incredible rate, and after three days, the blazing heart completely lost its radiance.

A gust of wind blew over, causing the heart to disintegrate into ashes.

The last remaining remnant of the Heavenly Fire Celestial King vanished into thin air. Just like how he had been nurtured by the essence of heaven and earth, he was now returning to the embrace of heaven and earth.

Ling Han and the Empress opened their eyes in unison. They then stood up together.

Peak stage of the third severance!

Even though the essence of the Celestial King had mainly been used to temper and reconstruct their respective physique, just a wisp of this essence had been enough to raise their cultivation by an astonishing amount. They were easily raised to the peak stage of the third severance.

However, the Celestial King Tier power wasn’t enough to help them perform the fourth severance. This was something that they had to comprehend by themselves. It was also because of this that the large black dog first helped the Empress advance to the third severance. Otherwise, the extra essence of the Celestial King would have been wasted.

“Brat, you’ll have to fend for yourself in the future. Also, remember to cause more trouble. Otherwise, I’ll be ashamed to be associated with you!” The large black dog waved his paw, and continued, “Alright, my task here is already complete, so it’s time for me to fulfill my dream of many years!”

He spread his four legs and instantly vanished into the distance.
