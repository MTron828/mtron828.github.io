Chapter 1572 There“s Always Someone Stronger

Ling Han was out of options. He had already used all of his trump cards.Although he could still use some celestial techniques, the limit of his cultivation level meant that he wouldn’t even be able to rival Yellow Demons, much less Earth Demons. Moreover, now that he couldn’t enter the Black Tower, he didn’t even have the ability to escape.

Fortunately, Tan Yun only wanted to capture him, not kill him. As such, he still had time. Once Small Tower awoke, he wouldn’t need to be afraid anymore.

Boom!

The large demonic hand blotted out heaven and earth as it descended.

“Heh, Old Tan the Third, how despicable of you. You’re actually targeting a measly Eternal River Tier cultivator! Moreover, you’ve already failed twice! You’re truly bringing shame to Old Geezer Tan!”

A teasing voice suddenly traveled over, and it was surprisingly quicker than Tan Yun’s attack. Moreover, it clearly traveled into every single person’s ears.

Peng!

Tan Yun’s hand descended, yet it was unable to press down no matter what. It was forcefully stopped 30 or so meters from Ling Han.

At some unknown time, two people had already appeared beside Ling Han.

One was a hunchbacked elder whose hair was all white and who was radiating an aura of age. It was as if he might suddenly keel over and die at any moment. The other person was a sturdy and tall man whose upper body was naked. He was dressed in a beast-skin skirt, and it was as if he were a savage.

No one took an extra glance at the “savage”. Instead, they were all staring at the white-haired elder.

This elder didn’t appear special at first glance, yet upon closer inspection, one’s entire focus and mind would be attracted by him. It was as if their minds had entered a swamp that they couldn’t escape from.

Everyone was drenched in cold sweat when they finally managed to compose themselves. However, their bodies felt weak, and even their spirit and energy had been drained by a significant amount.

‘Gasp! Who is this old man?’

Tan Yun had initially been calm and composed, yet he couldn’t help but feel surprised now. “Friend... Senior, are you from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land? It appears as if you’re familiar with our ancestor?”

Meanwhile, Ling Han was astonished as he gazed at the savage-looking man. That was none other than Gou Li!

Gou Li winked with a smile upon catching his gaze, and said, “Didn’t I say so before? I said that we’ll definitely meet again.”

The other Demon Masters were all shocked by what they heard.

‘Senior! Tan Yun actually referred to that old man as senior!’

One had to realize that Tan Yun was already an Earth Demon! That being the case, just how powerful was this old man, someone who he had referred to as senior?

There was only one possible answer—this old man was a Heaven Demon!

The old Heaven Demon chuckled, and said, “Time truly flies by. At that time, you were still a little rascal who ran around butt-naked, yet you’ve already grown up to become a mighty figure who can rule over an entire territory now.”

‘This...’

The Demon Masters all wore peculiar expressions.

‘Senior, you’re truly skilled at denigrating others. Even though everyone has experienced a similar childhood, saying this before an Earth Demon elite is probably taking things a bit too far.’

Tan Yun’s face flushed beet red. At his cultivation level, one should have been able to remain calm and composed like a mountain. However, these words had been uttered by a Heaven Demon, and there were more so many Demon Masters standing beside them and listening. How could he not feel humiliated?

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in his mind. Gou Li had most likely been raised by this old man. Both young and old were just as wickedly offensive as the other. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, he liked this.

“Senior, it appears as if you’re familiar with our ancestor!” Tan Yun forcefully composed himself, and he resolutely tried to change the topic.

The old Heaven Demon pondered for a moment before replying, “That’s already a matter from hundreds of millions of years ago. I had initially wanted to cooperate with your ancestor on a matter of great significance, yet it’s a pity that Old Geezer Tan was far too cowardly. Heh...”

‘Great, I’ve been denigrated again.’

However, Tan Yun didn’t dare to talk back to him. That was a Heaven Demon! These were beings who stood at the pinnacle of the Netherworld and peered down at the world. Their power was simply unfathomable. He pondered for a while before saying, “Senior, this person killed a disciple of the Tan Clan. Since you’re acquainted with our ancestor, please allow me to take him with me. I’m sure that our ancestor will be grateful for this favor.”

“What, are you trying to use Old Geezer Tan to pressure me?” The old Heaven Demon humphed, and two clouds of black air burst from his nostrils. They then transformed into two divine spears that slashed at the sky, instantly causing heaven and earth to lose their luster.

A sense of apprehension rose in everyone’s heart. At the same time, everyone beneath the level of Genesis Tier fell to their knees. They were stunned by this overwhelming aura. Only Ling Han was an exception. He had been recognized by heaven and earth twice, so from some point of view, he could also represent heaven and earth. Thus, his “status” wasn’t lower than that of the Genesis Tier Demon Masters.

Tan Yun hurriedly bowed, and said, “I would never dare to!”

Just like how he had pressured the Hysteria Demon Master and the others into obedience before, he was now being pressured into obedience by the old Heaven Demon. He had no option but to play to his whims.

This was the influence of strength!

The old Heaven Demon waved his hand, and said, “For the sake of Old Geezer Tan, I won’t press you any further. Go on, return to wherever you need to go!”

“Senior...” Tan Yun was unwilling to accept this outcome. That brat had killed a prodigy of the Tan Clan, and he more so possessed a paramount secret technique. How could he give up so easily?

“I’m not asking for your opinion!” the old Heaven Demon said with a humph. He ruthlessly lashed out with his palm.

Pa!

Tan Yun was instantly sent flying, and he quickly became a small black dot in the distance, disappearing into the vast and boundless galaxy.

The old Heaven Demon then turned around to face Tan Feng and the others, asking, “What, do you people also need me to send you on your way?”

Tan Feng hurriedly shook his head, and exclaimed, “No! There’s no need to trouble you, Senior!”

“Then hurry up and scram!” the old Heaven Demon humphed.

“Yes, yes, I’ll scram right away!” Tan Feng frantically grabbed the four disciples of his clan before releasing his golden path and fleeing into the distance.

“Tan Clan, I’ll definitely remember the ‘kindness’ that you showed me today,” Ling Han suddenly said. “I’ll make sure to repay this favor in the future!”

Tan Feng suddenly ground to a halt, a murderous expression appearing on his face. He almost gave in to the urge to turn around and smack Ling Han to death. However, upon thinking of the old Heaven Demon, cold sweat involuntarily formed on his forehead. He didn’t dare to make another peep as he fled into the distance.

The old Heaven Demon clapped his hands, and said, “The show is over; it’s time to leave now.”

Although his voice was soft, this was the decree of a Heaven Demon. Who dared to disobey him? The Demon Masters hurriedly grabbed their disciples and descendants before unleashing their golden paths and leaving. They certainly didn’t want to be smacked flying by the old Heaven Demon.

“Young man, come here, accompany me for a walk.” The old Heaven Demon’s voice was extremely amicable as he gestured for Ling Han to come over.

Meanwhile, Gou Li smiled and said, “Filth King Ling, don’t be shy. What’s there to be embarrassed about? It’s not like you’re a small girl or anything!”

Ling Han rolled his eyes in reply. This person couldn’t be treated. He clasped his hands in respect, and said, “I still haven’t thanked Senior for stepping in to help me.”

“It was nothing,” the old Heaven Demon replied with a chuckle. He started to walk forward, and Ling Han and Gou Li both followed beside him, one to the left and one to the right. However, they both lagged a small step behind him.

“Young man, I assume that you already know about the Celestial Realm,” the old Heaven Demon said as he glanced at Ling Han. He had retracted his aura, and he seemed like an especially ordinary old man.

“Yes, I do,” Ling Han replied with a nod. His answer was short and to the point. There was no need to show off before this kind of powerful being.

The old Heaven Demon nodded, and said, “Then that saves me from having to explain.”

Ling Han didn’t interrupt him, and he simply waited for the old Heaven Demon to continue.

“My name is Ouyang Taishan,” the old Heaven Demon said. “Moreover, I also have another identity. I’m the ninth elder of the Heaven Crushing Alliance.”

‘Heaven Crushing Alliance!’
