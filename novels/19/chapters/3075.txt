3076 Death

The battle between Ling Han, Hysteria, and Extermination had already transcended the level of ordinary Seventh Tier elites. This wasn’t a battle that Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and the others could interfere in.

Even though Hysteria and Extermination were theoretically nothing more than ordinary Seventh Tier elites, with Ling Han further being only a Sixth Tier elite, they were still far more powerful than the other ultimate elites at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier.

Ling Han fought fiercely with his enemies. He was incredibly powerful, and grasping all of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, his explosive power could genuinely be viewed as unfathomably terrifying. In fact, it was possible that he could damage or even obliterate the body of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate with a single strike.

However, Hysteria and Extermination were also unimaginably powerful. After blocking most of the power from his strikes, their indestructible physiques were more than capable of withstanding the remaining power.

In contrast to them, Ling Han was only at the Sixth Tier, so his physique was his glaring weakness.

As the battle dragged on, this glaring weakness also became more and more obvious.

He was covered in blood, and even his meridians were starting to become chaotic. It was as if they were about to explode.

“Ling Han, the arrival of a new age is inevitable, yet you still insist on going against the flow. This can only result in death!” Extermination said with loud laughter. Even though she was being pushed back with Hysteria, neither of them had suffered any genuine wounds to speak of. Instead, it was Ling Han who was becoming increasingly wounded. This would eventually lead to his demise.

“Why don’t you embrace this new age?”

Ling Han roared with laughter, and chided, “What bullsh*t new age? I’ll crush them all!”

“Foolish!” Extermination spat with an ice-cold expression. “If that’s your choice, then you can go and die now!”

The two supremely powerful beings unleashed a barrage of relentless attacks at Ling Han, forcing him to unleash his full strength. They didn’t give him any chance to recover, and they forced him to hurt himself more and more.

If this continued, whether for a dozen years or 100 years, Ling Han would eventually succumb to his own self-inflicted wounds.

Lin Luo and the others naturally understood the situation. They were all extremely worried, yet this wasn’t a battle that they could interfere in. If they charged over, being sent flying would be the least of their worries. It was even possible that they might be crushed into smithereens.

“Haha!” Chong Yan and the others were filled with delight. They had all been bullied by Ling Han before, and the five ultimate elites from the previous generation had all experienced suppression at his hands. Meanwhile, Golden Silk Moth had almost become Ling Han’s servant. As for Ten Thousand Shadows, he would immediately flee whenever he saw Ling Han. These were all humiliating memories.

Now that Ling Han was in such a miserable state, they were naturally feeling as delighted and satisfied as could be.

“This little brat is finally facing his reckoning!”

“Hmph! We’ve already let him live for so long, so it is indeed time for us to end his pathetic life!”

“Shut your traps!” Bai Mifan bellowed in anger. He unleashed an attack at the traitorous Seventh Tier elites.

However, their strength was similar, and Seventh Tier elites were also unable to wound fellow Seventh Tier elites. Thus, Chong Yan and the others wouldn’t be affected even if they didn’t try to block this attack. However, Seventh Tier elites naturally cared about their face. After all, who wanted to be sent flying for no reason?

Thus, Chong Yan and the others all decided to counterattack. An intense battle broke out among them again.

Ling Han was also aware of his current situation. If this continued, it would only be a matter of time before he was inevitably ripped apart by the devastating power surging within him.

However, he definitely couldn’t die. Otherwise, everyone in the dimensions inside him would die as well.

So, what could he do?

Retreat? And allow Hysteria to engulf the Celestial Realm?

No.

Ling Han shook his head in his mind.

There was only one option left.

He retrieved several core fragments of the dimension and pressed them to his chest, immediately starting to refine them.

These were the core fragments of the Profound Negative Realm, and he hadn’t used them this entire time. He had saved them up for this exact moment, the moment when he attempted to break through to the Seventh Tier.

Right now, he needed the physique of a Seventh Tier elite.

This was the decisive moment. Could he sense the sixth type of fundamental power while facing such immense pressure?

If he could, and if he managed to extract a wisp to temper his body, then he could immediately obtain an indestructible Seventh Tier physique.

At that time, the burden that caused his skin to crack and blood to seep from his mouth would be nothing more than a mere tickle.

At that time, Hysteria and Extermination would no longer be a threat!

Not only that, but he would also be able to cultivate his dimensions to the transcendent level. This would allow him to grow more and more powerful, to a stage where Hysteria and Extermination would have no option but to be suppressed by him.

‘Come, let me take a gamble.’

Ling Han refined the core fragments of the dimension. This was because dimensions naturally extracted fundamental power from the void as well before transforming it into something that they could use. Moreover, this fundamental power was extracted and transformed through the cores of the dimensions.

Thus, refining the core of a dimension would allow one to lay eyes on the fundamental power of the Genesis World.

More importantly, Ling Han was far too powerful, and this severely inhibited him from detecting the last fundamental power of the Genesis World. Moreover, these were only core fragments of the dimension, and not a complete core of the dimension, so the power they contained would definitely be far inferior in comparison.

Thus, everything was reliant on Ling Han being able to withstand this immense pressure.

‘Come! Come! Come!’ Ling Han roared in his mind.

His follicles opened up, and he attempted to detect that last remaining fundamental power.

Hysteria and Extermination naturally noticed this, so they both increased the speed and ferocity of their attacks in an attempt to distract Ling Han and prevent him from advancing to the Seventh Tier.

Boom! Boom!

The battle between them was intense, and Ling Han continued to vomit large mouthfuls of blood. This wasn’t as a result of being wounded by Hysteria or Extermination, but instead as a result of unleashing his supremely powerful attacks.

His wounds became increasingly severe, and his recovery speed was unable to keep up with them, even though the dimensions inside him were brimming with powerful life force.

A cruel smile tugged at the corners of Extermination’s mouth, and she murmured, “Die, hurry up and die already. I can’t wait to swallow your body and obtain all of your secrets.”

Ling Han didn’t reply. Instead, he fought against them with his full power.

One day, three days, 10 days.

This was far longer than what Hysteria and Extermination had expected. Ling Han had actually managed to hold on for so long! However, his situation was also becoming increasingly dire. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

His willpower was simply terrifying.

“It all ends here!” Extermination sneered coldly. Her attacks became even more ferocious.

Peng!

Clouds of blood exploded from Ling Han’s body, after which he was no longer able to defend himself.

Would Hysteria and Extermination go easy on him because of this? No! They would naturally seize this opportunity to kill him once and for all!

Their attacks furiously slammed into Ling Han, whose body had yet to become undying and indestructible. Thus, they could genuinely kill him if they managed to breach his defenses.

Boom, boom, boom!

Boundless energy windstorms erupted, with the two formidable beings frenzied as they attacked Ling Han. This was utterly terrifying.

Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and the others were unable to see clearly through the wild storms of energy. However, they understood that Ling Han was most likely facing a perilous situation with little hope of recovery. After all, he was only at the Sixth Tier, so it was inevitable that he would be crushed to death once his defenses were breached.

Lin Luo and the others were filled with panic. However, to say nothing of the fact that they were being obstructed by Chong Yan and his ilk, what could they do even if they charged over? Could they stop Hysteria and Extermination?

Any one of them would be able to severely wound or even kill them.

What could they do? Was this the end?

Was it already impossible to rectify the situation?

Hysteria and Extermination finally ceased their attacks. The energy windstorms also started to slowly dissipate.

When the void stabilized again, what they saw was Ling Han hovering in the void, with his limbs hanging by his side and his body drowned in blood.

Was he dead?

The expressions of Lin Luo and the others changed drastically. They could no longer sense any life force from Ling Han.

Everything… was truly done for.

“Hahahaha!” Meanwhile, Chong Yan and the others all chortled with laughter. They had already waited far too long for this day.

“Hmm?” Extermination suddenly turned around. Just then, she had already been walking over to kill Lin Luo and the others.

Hysteria also stopped in its tracks. It had initially been slithering over to engulf the Celestial Realm.

Hovering in the void, Ling Han’s finger moved ever so slightly.
