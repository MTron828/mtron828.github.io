Chapter 850: Ancient Mineshaft Sends Troops Out

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han and Helian Tianyun ran. As long as they survived, there’d be a time in the future when they fought back, or else all would be for naught.

They might not look old right now, but they’d both lived one life already. Would they still let emotions sway their decisions?

That would be stupid!

“You want to run?” Ao Jian immediately began his pursuit. Only he was qualified to chase, because the others—even the imperial family—would be suppressed by Helian Tianyun’s dragon’s might, chasing for nothing.

He was a genius of immortal realm’s dragon race, with the blood of True Dragon flowing in his veins, and currently already had Shattering Void nineteen stars of battle prowess, being only one star away from the extreme battle prowess.

Thus, he was extremely conceited.

“Stop!” Ao Jian constantly used spells and controlled the stream to ram it towards Ling Han and Helian Tianyun.

He was a descendant of a True Dragon, and could inherently control water.

These were waves drawn by a Shattering Void Tier elite. Ling Han and Helian Tianyun only had the cultivation of the Heaven Tier, so how could they block them? Peng, peng, peng, they were slapped by the waves, shocked and numb all over. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Fortunately, one of them had a physique of tenth-tier rare metal, while the other was only slightly inferior, not that far off, or else the waves alone could shatter them into pieces.

However, Ao Jian seized the chance to catch up with them.

“Sh*t, now that’s a great loss!” Ling Han finally unleashed the Instant Teleportation Talisman. This time, he wasn’t just doing it for show, but truly planning on using it. Otherwise, being trapped and unable to escape from this sea area, he would still have to use the Instant Teleportation Talisman in the end.

“Instant Teleportation Talisman?” Catching the his gaze, Ao Jian sped up in a rush, trying to stop them from leaving.

“See you next time, little brat. At that time, This Lord will definitely kill you!” Helian Tianyun said fiercely. A dignified alternative dragon like him was hunted down and had to flee helter-skelter... such a thing couldn’t be stomached.

Shua , Ao Jian extended his hand and thrust a long spear, but when the spear point landed, only a vacuum layer was created. Ling Han and Helian Tianyun already disappeared without a trace.

“Damn it!” His gaze shone with a chilling glare, appearing very regretful.

Honestly, he wouldn’t chase them onto land, because he’d already heard that there was an extremely powerful human, who was also a born killing formation, there, and on top of power of the nation’s blessing, his battle prowess broke through twenty stars!

He was afraid he’d die there.

No way—he was a dignified True Dragon’s descendant with boundless prospects, and couldn’t possibly endanger himself in this lowly, small world. The only purpose he had here was to ensure smooth creation of the Realm Pill.

Wretch! Damn it! How could they have an Instant Teleportation Talisman, something extremely rare even in the divine realm?

Xiu , with a flash, Ling Han and Helian Tianyun already appeared at sea level.

“Where’s this?” Ling Han gazed into the distance.

Helian Tianyun sniffed, and then said, “As far as This Lord can tell, it should be the west sea.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but reveal a strange expression, and said, “You can smell that out?”

“No sh*t, the waters of the four sea’s are all different, how can This Lord not smell it!” Helian Tianyun snorted, appearing very proud, and then said strangely, “Brat, how come you have an Instant Teleportation Talisman? Although this thing’s well-known, even This Lord has never obtained it before!”

Ling Han came to a realization, connecting it with that big news that Asura Demon Emperor had revealed.

If the vast lands originally “stayed” in the immortal realm before, then it wasn’t unacceptable that some divine level things appeared here—they could’ve been dug from a grave by Ma Duo Bao.

This fatty was really a pretty good person to have given him such a precious thing.

“Someone gifted it to me,” Ling Han said without thought.

“Gifting even such a precious thing?” Helian Tianyun was shocked. “Hurry, hurry, hurry, who’s that person? Introduce him to This Lord. This Lord doesn’t mind becoming good friends with him.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and said, “You and him really are somewhat alike in some ways.”

He told Helian Tianyun about Ma Duo Bao while returning to land. Since they were in the west sea, they would obviously first arrive at the west region, then turn towards the north region to return to the imperial capital.

With their pace on foot, they finally left the ocean area after seven days, stepping on land.

The people in the Black Tower also knew the course of the matter. Except for Hu Niu running out, the other people still stayed inside to accommodate fast pace of the journey. However, Ling Han would sometimes take his son out and hold him, nourishing the bond between father and son.

The west region was now also Great Ling Empire’s territory, with the totem’s duplicate silhouette, and Ling Han only had to connect to it to be able to find out about the movements of the Great Ling Empire. Originally, he just randomly thought of it and thus connected to the totem, but after receiving some news, he immediately revealed a shocked expression.

The “things” buried underneath the former Fire Country’s mineshaft... finally came out!

Through the totem silhouette, he saw blurry shadows of humanoid creatures enveloped in black current that were extremely powerful, besieging towns and strongholds in their path. With every city they conquered, they refined everyone in the city into the walking dead, which were also bound by black current, becoming their subordinates, though their strength was average.

Fortunately, refining one city took a considerable amount of time. They still hadn’t completely seized the desolate north, so it wouldn’t be any time soon that they’d pass through the Fallen Moon Gorge and enter north region’s large territory.

“What’s the matter?” Helian Tianyun asked casually.

Once Ling Han spoke of the situation, Helian Tianyun also frowned.

It just had to be at this time!

If the two of them were given time, they’d be the strongest elites with battle prowess of Shattering Void Tier twenty stars in the future, but the heavens seemed to deliberately make things difficult for them, not even giving them one year, and setting up difficult problems for them one after another.

Ling Han immediately made a decision to let the Rock Spirit make a trip to Purple Moon Emperor’s Court to get reinforcements while he immediately charged back. Whether it was out of responsibility or for himself, he had to stop those people from the ancient mineshaft.

They buried and remade themselves with the Yin Qi in the ground, turning from a living person to one of the underworld, even trying to turn this small world into part of the underworld. When the time came to split open the skies, they’d be ascending into the underworld.

It definitely couldn’t happen!

With power of the nation’s blessing, Ling Han’s power instantly skyrocketed to Shattering Void Tier nine stars. Although the desolate north was small, after falling into enemy hands, it still affected the power of the nation, or else he should boast the power of Shattering Void Tier ten stars now.

The Thunderclap Ninth Heaven and Fairy Demon Steps were activated by him at the same time, so his speed was swift as he was flying rapidly in the direction of the Fallen Moon Gorge. On the other side, he issued orders through the totem, having all elites gather at the Fallen Moon Gorge to fight the people of the underworld.

After three days, he arrived at the Fallen Moon Gorge. At this time, the Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing also arrived with large amounts of experts, and stopped the large army outside the gorge. Yi Shuang Shuang was also requested to come, and was now sitting leisurely on the side, out of tune with everyone else.

“Your Majesty!” Seeing Ling Han, everyone knelt down to pay their respects.

Ling Han waved his hand, having everyone stand up, and then said, “Big Brother, how’s the situation?”

The desolate north already fell into enemy hands, and the totem obviously also lost its use as his eyes and ears. He no longer knew what happened inside.

“According to what I saw the few times I scouted the gorge, the enemy already rallied their forces again, and will come out the gorge in a few days,” the Rain Emperor said with a frown. He’d seen the destruction those “things” had caused, and as Rain Country’s former ruler, he obviously utterly detested it.

“Report!” A scout suddenly charged in, knelt down, and said, “There is movement within the gorge!”
