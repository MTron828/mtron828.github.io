2964 Wait another hour

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Duanyun and the burly young man kept exchanging blows, no longer backing down, with each move being a head-on strike.

“Hehe, even if the strength is similar, Brother Rulong’s fists have been tempered with a combination of spiritual herbs and godly metal, which makes them equivalent to a God Tool. It’s a very stupid decision to fight him head-on.”

“We’re waiting to see all his bones smashed to bits.”

“Haha.”

Gou Li and the others laughed. They didn’t doubt the strength of the burly young man’s fist. Even Gou Li had to admit that he wouldn’t dare to fight head-on against the burly young man’s fists if it was a fight at the same cultivation level.

It was just that it was unknown just how much suffering one had to endure to practice and train up such iron fists; few people could endure it.

After exchanging more than 100 punches consecutively, someone had really gotten blood through his fists, but it wasn’t Ling Duanyun—it was that burly young man.

“Ah!” the burly young man screamed. His fists were badly mangled, and a strange indentation could be seen. It was obvious that the bones had been shattered in the midst of exchanging blows.

‘This!’

Gou Li and the others were stunned. They couldn’t believe it; they really couldn’t imagine that Iron Fist Rulong would be beaten so badly.

Ling Duanyun felt a surge of pride, and he launched a fierce counterattack with a battle cry. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

One had to know that although it was impossible for him to comprehend the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll all at once, his body has been slightly strengthened by Ling Han with fundamental particles, so just how strong would his body be?

If Sixth Tiers were to unleash their full power, they could even raise a mortal to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in a short period of time, but the disadvantage of doing that would be that the person wouldn’t be able to go any further.

Ling Duanyun had a huge room for improvement, and Ling Han certainly wouldn’t sacrifice his future prospects in exchange for quick success; it would actually make things worse.

Battle, battle, battle.

The burly young man no longer had the courage to fight hard. He was defeated in the field he was best at, which caused his self-confidence to plunge rock bottom; he no longer had any fighting spirit.

After a few rounds of battling, he was sent flying by Ling Duanyun, and was completely defeated.

Although the defeat of the burly young man was only a matter of time, to actually witness him defeated, Gou Li and the others were filled with disbelief.

“Senior has really got some great techniques.” A young man came out and bowed respectfully to Ling Han. “I’m Kang Xing, and I would also like to ask Ling Duanyun for a spar.”

He was also of the Eternal River Tier, but he was much stronger than the burly young man. He was already almost at the peak of the Eternal River Tier.

Being so respectful was firstly because Ling Han’s technique was indeed heaven-defying, so he had to be cautious, and secondly, he also had an ulterior motive. In case Ling Han was the kind of super elite who traveled around the world, and was only helping Ling Duanyun out of impulse, would this kind of fortune befall on him as well?

Therefore, he behaved reverently, wanting Ling Han to be pleased with him, and also to press his finger upon him.

Ling Han shook his head. Ling Duanyun’s current physique was indeed so strong that even a Genesis Tier would find it difficult to kill him. However, his power was flawed; he definitely wouldn’t be able to match Kang Xing. The gap in strength between the two was a whole major tier.

“I’ll teach you another hour,” Ling Han said to Ling Duanyun.

Ling Duanyun was naturally overjoyed. Earlier, it was just an hour, and his strength appeared to improve by leaps and bounds. How strong would he be if it was for another hour?

“Thank you, Senior!” He bowed respectfully once again.

Gou Li and the others were envious. They also wanted to pay respects to Ling Han and ask him to teach them a thing or two.

It was a pity that Ling Han didn’t care about them at all, and just tossed a sentence to them. “All of you wait for another hour.”

Ling Han raised a finger, and pressed it on Ling Duanyun’s forehead.

Boom, an astonishing aura surged from within Ling Duanyun’s body, boiling and raging.

“How is it possible? His cultivation level is improving at this speed… Astonishingly fast!” Gou Li and the others exclaimed. This was really unbelievable. Did he become so powerful just by consuming celestial medicine?

After an hour had passed, bang, there was the sudden rumble of thunder in the heaven and earth.

Thunderclouds were rolling, and the heavenly tribulation was approaching.

“A breakthrough!” Gou Li and the others murmured, their expressions looking like they had seen a ghost.

With just a single tap of his finger, he was immediately going to break through to the Eternal River Tier. How could people believe this?

Although those below Severing Mundane Tier weren’t considered elites at all, it would take at least 100 years to take this step even in the Profound Negative Realm. It was not uncommon for those with poor aptitude to require tens of thousands or millions of years.

“Go through the tribulation first,” Ling Han said.

Ling Duanyun quickly responded, and went to meet the heavenly tribulation.

Bang, bang bang! The heavenly tribulation descended, causing serious injuries to Ling Duanyun.

“That’s almost enough,” Ling Han said to the sky. “We are in a hurry.”

Weng, the thunder clouds moved and disappeared quickly.

‘F*ck!’

Gou Li and the others were really shocked now. Who the hell was this person? Just by opening his mouth, he could make even the heavenly tribulation dissipate?

…How would they be able to know that there was a unique power of the Profound Negative Realm in Ling Han’s body, which could even develop into a second Profound Negative Realm in the future, and the connection he had with the Profound Negative Realm was far beyond any other person’s?

Ling Han had already surpassed the high level of the Regulations. Additionally, having such a connection, he was of course given face.

Even the heaven and earth had to give him some face.

Hence, the heavenly tribulation dissipated. Anyway, it had already struck a few times, even if that was only symbolic.

Ling Duanyun was also shocked to the point of incomprehension. He knew Ling Han’s strength better than the others, but he was still speechless when he saw this scene.

Impressive, too impressive.

He felt that he was really lucky to be favored by such a powerful person.

“Okay, go and fight.” Ling Han waved his hand.

“Yes, Senior!” Ling Duanyun became more respectful. He first paid his respects to Ling Han, and then walked towards Kang Xing. “Come on.”

Kang Xing’s first reaction was to back out from fighting. F*ck, in front of Ling Han, he didn’t even have the courage to stand straight, and his legs had gone limp from fright, so how could he still fight? However, thinking of the good fortune that Ling Duanyun had acquired, he gritted his teeth again.

He wanted it too.

In this battle, if he was to perform brilliantly, would he win Ling Han’s appreciation? Would Ling Han also just help him casually?

Thinking of this, he jumped out. “Come on, let me see your strength.”

The two immediately started fighting. They were both of the Eternal River Tier, but one was at the peak of the Eternal River Tier, while the other just entered the Eternal River Tier.

However, Ling Duanyun went against logic; his power was only slightly weaker than Kang Xing’s, but his physique was invincible, like it was made of Divine Metal.

Ling Duanyun only had to attack, and there was no need for him to defend at all. What was the use of Kang Xing’s slight advantage in power?

After fighting for thousands of rounds, he was sent flying by a punch from Ling Duanyun, and was completely defeated.

“Who else?” Ling Duanyun looked around, looking very domineering.

‘A fox exploiting a tiger’s might[1]!’ Gou Li and the others chided in their hearts; if it wasn’t due to Ling Han, there would be at least four people here who could easily thrash Ling Duanyun, who was a mere Heavenly Body Tier.

Especially Gou Li, an elite of the Severing Mundane Tier, who had no need to make a move at all. He could kill him with a single thought.

“Let me see your strength too.” Among those people in Gou Li’s group, a young man stood up.

He was of the Genesis Tier, and was already a Great Saint.

Ling Duanyun looked at Ling Han. “An hour?”
