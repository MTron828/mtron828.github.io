Chapter 2347: The Battle Beast is born

The intense battle continued for who knew how long. Finally, Ling Han got the complete upper hand, the beast wailing in pain continuously at his attacks. Its figure was also becoming fainter and fainter, revealing the core within.

Ling Han grabbed it in a single stroke, and instantly felt the thought of defiance and unwillingness to submit emanating from this Battle Beast.

Because it was an existence destined to become an Ancestral King.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and sent out a message through divine sense as well. “Don’t feel that you are unfortunate. In the past, there were nine Source Powers of heaven and earth that followed me, and which of them were not existences that would be able to become Ancestral Kings once they gained intelligence? As for me, my finish line is definitely not just Ancestral King, nor is it Heavenly Venerable Tier, but rather becoming a true overlord of the universe!

“If you follow me, it will only set you off on a path towards greater strength!”

Instantly, that Battle Beast appeared hesitant. It had not hatched, so its intelligence was no more than a three-year-old child’s. If it were not for the support of its primitive instincts, it could not possibly have attacked Ling Han, either. With Ling Han’s persuasive words now, its resolve was naturally swayed.

Ling Han did not rush it, either, and merely waited patiently.

After a while, the Battle Beast opened its core on its own volition, and let down its guard completely against Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out a finger and pressed down, planting his own mark on the core of the Battle Beast’s consciousness. Instantly, a certain special connection was formed between him and this Battle Beast.

It was very hard to describe what kind of feeling this was. It was like his body had gained another limb that he could freely move, yet this limb had its own self-consciousness, and executed his commands completely once he issued them.

…No matter how unreasonable or dangerous this command was.

“How do I hatch you?” Ling Han asked via divine sense.

“The Regulations of the Great Dao nurture me the best, so, Master, you only need to use your power of Regulation to cultivate me, and I will be born very quickly. The stronger the Regulations you supply are, and the wider the variety, the sooner my birth will be,” the Battle Beast said.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh.’ “I have to give you a name.”

If the Empress and the others were present, they would definitely try to stop him with their best efforts.

This guy really had no standards in terms of coming up with names. It would be something like Little White, Little Black, Little Qing1, or Little Gray. This Battle Beast was an existence that was destined to become an Ancestral King. If some hideous name was given to it, it would definitely be teased to death in future.

Too bad, this Battle Beast did not know that, and still very happily exclaimed, “Please bestow a name on me, Master!”

Though it had not hatched yet, it was already equipped with preliminary intelligence, but this time it had clearly gone blind.

“I’ll call you Little Terror, then!” Ling Han said. “With how terrifying you look, this is not a bad name. In the future, you will be responsible for scaring people for me.”

It was a pity that this little beast did not understand at all, and was still cheering there happily, celebrating the fact that it now had a name. When it hatched, it would truly develop its own intelligence, and it would probably feel extremely depressed about its rash actions today at that time.

“I’ll go out first, and I will hatch you as soon as possible.”

Ling Han withdrew from the spiritual world, and then used the power of Regulation to nurture this little guy with his arms around the beast egg.

This time, it was not for the sake of battle. Ling Han extracted the power of Regulation in a gentle manner, and it was all the Regulations together at that, offering the best nurturing conditions for this Battle Beast.

“Master, you have actually grasped so many Regulations!” the little guy exclaimed in shock, communicating this to Ling Han through divine sense. “Going by the look of things, I will be born in three years at most!”

Ling Han nodded, and activated the Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique—after he advanced to the Eleventh Secret, his physique evolved from Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique into Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique, which was much stronger than the former.

He used time acceleration on himself, and the effects were not the least bit inferior to those of the Time Cultivation Chambers outside. In fact, they were far superior because what he needed to accelerate was only himself. The burden was naturally countless times smaller, and the effects also increased madly.

After cultivating this kind of physique, he actually would no longer need to use any Time Cultivation Chamber.

Three years’ time passed in the blink of an eye. A crack appeared on the egg shell with a crisp sound, and the crack widened quickly afterwards. The number of cracks also increased, endlessly spreading out.

When the number of cracks had reached as many as over a dozen, crack, a black paw suddenly stretched out of the crack, and ripped it apart. With that the egg shell broke apart like it had dried and aged.

A small beast leaped out. It was completely black as ink, and only had a pair of ruby-like eyes.

It looked exactly the same as the great monster that Ling Han had seen in the spiritual world. It was just countless times smaller, adn was only a foot tall now. On the surface, it looked completely harmless, and instead seemed dumb and cute. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The little beast saw Ling Han, and immediately approached, rubbing its head against Ling Han’s calf.

When it rubbed its head against him, Ling Han almost lost his footing and fell onto the ground.

The little guy’s brute power was extraordinarily shocking. Though it was also because Ling Han was taken off guard, how could he have been affected if there had not been enough power?

Ling Han crouched down, and said to the little beast, “Little Terror, you are very impressive!”

“Ao! Ao!” The little beast opened its mouth, and released what sounded like the howls of a wolf.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. What part of this guy looked like a wolf that it actually let out such sounds? Could it be that its father had an inappropriate relationship with a female wolf, and thus such a little guy was born?

If the little guy did not speak through divine sense, it would be no different than an infant that had just been born. Its calls were extremely childish, so cute that it would melt anyone’s heart.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel gloomy. He was such a mighty and dominant man. If he led such a little guy in public openly, would others look down on him?

However, the brute force that the little guy displayed at birth was incredibly shocking. It was almost at the Ascending Origin Tier already, so if it grew for a while longer, reaching the power of Celestial King Tier would be just around the corner.

But if it only had brute force, and did not have the support of corresponding Regulations, it would still be useless.

“Come, let me see your strength,” Ling Han said, and tossed out a piece of Pseudo-Divine Metal. It had been left behind after the Divine Demon Sword had advanced to the level of a Celestial Tool.

Little Terror stretched out its front paw, and swiped at this piece of Pseudo-Divine Metal. Zi, an ear-piercing sound rang out, causing Ling Han to feel great discomfort in his ears. However, his eyes lit up because a groove about half an inch deep had immediately appeared on the Pseudo-Divine Metal where the little guy’s claws had swiped.

This was astonishing. The little guy hadn’t used much force at all, and merely swiped out casually at the Pseudo-Divine Metal.

Though this was only a Three-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, it could still prove that the little beast did not just have strength, but also indeed had astonishing destructive power.

Ling Han took out another piece of Pseudo-Divine Metal. This time, it reached the height of Six Stars.

The little beast swiped its claws again, and a piercing sound rang out. A fine line was left behind on the Six-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, but it was not very obvious.

This angered the little beast. Its ruby-like eyes shone with a violent light as it charged forwards and randomly bit the Pseudo-Divine Metal. When it loosened its jaws, this Pseudo-Divine Metal was already damaged and tattered.

So powerful!

Ling Han tried again, and discovered that the limit of destructive power for the little beast was Seven Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal. It could damage it, but would need to expend a lot of power, and faced with Eight Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal, it could do nothing at all.

This was already extremely terrifying. It should be known that the little guy had just been hatched. If it matured even further, just what kind of astonishing destructive power would it have?

Ling Han studied the little guy’s claws closely. Upon the first look, they were just black scales and hard armor, but if he studied it closer, he discovered that they were covered with seals.
