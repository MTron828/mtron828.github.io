Chapter 1009: Entering the Fog for the Third Time

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You’re so mischievous,” Shui Yanyu said with a sigh in the Black Tower.

Luo Yu and Luo Wu were both pillars of the Luo Clan, while Zuo Xiao, Fan Yong, and Liu Ying and the other three women were all cultivators who had lived for tens of thousands of years. However, all of them were wrapped around his little finger.

He claimed that he wanted to catch the perpetrator’s tail, when in fact, he simply wanted these people to fight among themselves. Meanwhile, he could spectate from the sidelines and enjoy their aimless struggle.

“Do you like it?” Ling Han asked with a smile. It was a pity that the fog still obstructed his vision even though he had already entered the Black Tower. This disappointed him greatly.

“No!” Shui Yanyu answered hurriedly. She was afraid that Ling Han would start to grope her again, which was something that she enjoyed yet disliked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Don’t they say that girls like bad boys?”

“Twisted logic!” Shui Yanyu scolded. She definitely wouldn’t be attracted to a bad man. Otherwise, how would her relationship with Zhao Lun have become so bad?

“It’s about time for us to exit,” Ling Han said. He could already sense the sunshine starting to illuminate the ship again.

Xiu!

The two of them exited the Black Tower. However, thanks to the Black Fog, no one had discovered that they had disappeared and then reappeared again.

The radiant sunshine shone upon the ship.

As though they had returned to the world from a dark and sinister hell, everyone felt a slight sense of delight. It felt truly horrible to lose their vision and divine sense.

Gasp!

However, everyone was immediately stunned. There were seven new corpses laid in a neat row on the deck. These corpses belonged to the last remaining members of the Black Five Gang.

Moreover, all of them had been killed in the same manner, with a fatal sword wound to the chest.

‘Who was it?’

Everyone’s gazes involuntarily turned to Ling Han. He was the one who had suggested entering the Black Fog again, so it was only normal for everyone to suspect him the most.

“Ling Han, what do you have to say this time?” Luo Yu shouted immediately.

“There’s naturally nothing to say to stupid fools like you.” Ling Han smiled, and said, “My suggestion was quite good, wasn’t it? The culprit has indeed acted again. However, none of you worked together. Otherwise, with the help of several elites at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, how could the perpetrator have committed such crimes and then escaped?”

“Stop twisting the facts! The culprit is clearly you!” Luo Wu jabbed his finger at Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Let’s cut the bullsh*t, shall we? Everyone was clearly attacking me just then. What chance did I have to assassinate others? Seven others, mind you.”

“Stop making unfounded claims!” Fan Yong said calmly.

“Exactly, stop spewing bullcrap!” Luo Yu immediately refuted Ling Han’s claim as well. It would definitely be troublesome if news of him trying to assassinate a fellow student of the Scarlet Heaven Academy were to spread.

Yang Tiecheng wore a deep frown as he listened to the others speak. He had naturally noticed that everyone was indeed attacking Ling Han during the commotion just then. If one were to say that Ling Han could still find the opportunity to kill seven people under such relentless attacks, he definitely wouldn’t believe them.

On the other hand, however, Ling Han’s actions were indeed the most suspicious. He was the one who had suggested entering the Black Fog again, and he was also the one who bad blood with the Black Five Gang. Right now, all the evidence was pointing toward Ling Han’s being the culprit.

Luo Yu pointed at Ling Han, and said, “Why don’t we enter the Black Fog again? But this time, we have to tie him up!”

“Brilliant idea!” Fan Yong immediately clapped his hands in agreement.

“Hehe, Ling Han, haven’t you been claiming innocence this entire time?” Luo Wu said. “Then don’t resist now. If people are killed again, then your name will have been cleared.”

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Are you retarded? If the culprit doesn’t kill anymore, won’t I become their scapegoat? Also, all of you are staring at me with such hostile expressions. Do you think I dare to let you restrain myself and become your targets?!”

“Brother Yang, you’re the owner of this ship. I’ll leave the decision to you!” Luo Yu passed the problem to Yang Tiecheng.

Yang Tiecheng pondered for a moment, and said, “Ling Han, come over here. I’ll ensure your safety!”

By saying this, it was clear that Yang Tiecheng had agreed to Luo Yu and the others’ suggestion. They would restrain Ling Han, and then enter the Black Fog again.

Ling Han hesitated for a brief moment, and then said, “Fine! I trust Captain Yang!”

He nodded at Shui Yanyu, and both of them walked to Yang Tiecheng’s side.

Yang Tiecheng retrieved two sets of handcuffs, and said, “These handcuffs are forged from Level Four Godly metal, and there are even three divine patterns engraved onto them. Once restrained, even cultivators at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier won’t be able to escape.”

Everyone nodded in understanding. These handcuffs were specifically made to restrain elites. While these two sets were forged from Level Four Godly metal, there were also ones that were forged from Level Six, Seven or Eight Godly metal. Some of the high-level ones could even restrain elites at the Sun Moon Tier.

Meanwhile, the three engraved divine patterns would suppress the power of cultivators. Once restrained, cultivators would become no different from cripples.

‘Hehe, he’s dead this time!’ Luo Yu and the others said in their minds.

They didn’t give a toss whether Ling Han was the culprit or not. All they wanted to do was seize this opportunity to end Ling Han’s life.

Yang Tiecheng handcuffed Ling Han in front of everyone else, and said to him, “Rest assured, I’ll definitely protect you until my last breath!”

Ling Han didn’t believe him for a second.

Yang Tiecheng was indeed powerful, but the other people on this ship weren’t weak, either. Luo Yu, as well as Liu Ying and the other three females, were all at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. If the five of them targeted him together, how could Yang Tiecheng block them?

As long as they could distract Yang Tiecheng for just a few seconds, the remaining people would naturally be able to easily kill Ling Han.

Ling Han only agreed to their suggestion because he had the Black Tower.

“Lads, come over here and form a circle around these two people,” Yang Tiecheng suddenly shouted. “Don’t move from your spot even if you’re killed!”

“Understood!” the 20 or so sailors answered in unison. They immediately formed two barriers in front of Ling Han and Shui Yanyu.

‘Humph! They’re mere trash at the low extreme of the Mountain River Tier. What use will they be?’ Luo Yu and the others all sneered in their minds.

The gulf between each cultivation level in the Immortal level was extremely huge. Even a difference of one sub-minor level would give a crushing advantage to the cultivator with the higher level, let alone a difference of two or three sub-minor levels. Even the fabled five-star geniuses would only be able to swallow down their grievances.

The ship turned around to enter the Black Fog again.

Everyone immediately fell silent.

The ship slowly entered the fog, and, when the last ray of sunshine disappeared, an intense battle instantly erupted again.

Ding, ding, ding! Peng, peng, peng!

Everyone unleashed their attacks without reserve, drowning the ship in flashes of swords and gushes of power.

Yang Tiecheng bellowed loudly as he blocked those who were charging over. He was at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, and he had even more so reached the peak stage of this minor level. Unless he broke through to the Sun Moon Tier, there was already no room for him to grow stronger.

With thousands of years of battle experience, his battle prowess had already become resilient and domineering. Right now, his fists were no weaker than Godly metal of the same level. Moreover, he was a two-star genius, so his battle prowess was truly extremely frightening.

However, the problem was that too many people were attacking him right now, and none of them were aiming for him. Instead, all of them were trying to barge past his blockade.

As a result, it became extremely hard for him to stop them. It was simply impossible to keep all of them back.

“Aaah...” The sailors started to wail and moan in agony as they collapsed to the deck.

“You dare!!” Yang Tiecheng flared up in rage, and his three-meter-tall body started to radiate with a metallic black sheen. He was finally unleashing his full powers.
