Ling Han looked at the jade plaque, and with a thought, a stream of spiritual energy surged out, heading towards the jade plaque.

This was strength of the spirit.

When the spirit was strong to a certain extent, a mere thought would be able to move the regulations of the heavens and earth, and shatter even a colossal planet! Of course, this was something that could only be done by an ultimate elite of the Genesis Tier, and Ling Han was still who knew how far away from that step.

Pa , the jade plaque immediately shattered into pieces.

Ling Han smiled slightly. He was still very far away from being able to destroy a planet with a single thought, but how difficult would it be to shatter a jade plaque? Furthermore, he merely delivered a careless trike, and had not used Sword Heart. Otherwise, his spiritual energy would be even more frightening.

This was because he had drunk the Reincarnation Tea. Even if it was just a single sip, his present spiritual strength would definitely not be weaker than any other Shattering Void Tier cultivator’s in this world.

“I have not yet said what range of distance you have to be in to make your move,” the Tool Spirit suddenly said.

Ling Han gave an “ah”, and said, “Is it too near? Then just place another jade plaque.”

“No, you have passed,” the Tool Spirit said, “According to the roles, you can be as close as three feet away to blast out your spiritual energy.”

Ling Han could not help but shed cold sweat. Why did he feel that this Tool Spirit carried a bit of the feeling that Small Tower gave off as well? It actually had a cold sense of humor as well.

“Pei, how could it compare to me!?” Small Tower meanwhile was acting tsundere again. It disliked other tower-shaped Spirit Tools the most.

“You can advance to the third stage,” the Tool Spirit said. The wall once again disappeared, and yet another corridor appeared.

Ling Han walked along the corridor to the end, and saw that there was yet another stone chamber ahead of him. However, in comparison to the previous two chambers, this one was a hundred times bigger. Rather than calling it a stone chamber, it would be more appropriate to call it an arena.

“Block 10 moves from him, and you can pass,” the Tool Spirit said. Starlight flickered and condensed into a human figure.

This was a human figure made out of spots of light, and one could vaguely distinguish that it was the image of a man. He had a tall, slender figure, but his exact features could not be clearly seen.

“Young man, make your move,” the starlit man said, his voice clear and loud, possessing a kind of forcefulness that could cause others to yield.

Ling Han could not help but be surprised, and said, “Why is this so similar to a real person?” Not just the appearance, but also those reflexes and that presence.

“In the first place, it was formed from the spiritual mark that an elite left behind,” the Tool Spirit said. “Throughout history, out of all participants, only the person with the strongest battle prowess would be able to leave his spiritual mark behind, becoming an assessment for those who come afterward.”

Ling Han was even more curious now, and asked, “Then this is?”

“Xu Ran of a certain clan,” the starlit human figure said.

“Xu Ran, he entered into the Academy 300,000 years ago, and has been known as the greatest genius in history. He left 300 years later, charging out into the world alone, and no further news was heard of him,” the Tool Spirit said.

“In this million years, no other person surpassed him?” Ling Han was shocked.

“He was a monster!” The Tool Spirit made its evaluation. “In the same cultivation level, others could only approach his height, yet were unable to stand as his equal, what more surpass him. The test you are undergoing is only on the level of the Shattering Void Tier, and he is also the keeper of the record on the Mountain River Tier.”

This treasured Spirit Tool could actually start up another assessment on the level of the Mountain River Tier?

Ling Han’s eyes could not help but blaze with fierce fighting spirit. Pointing at Xu Ran’s starlight body, he asked, “What if I can defeat him?”

“Then you would have automatically passed the third stage on the remaining eight levels,” the Tool Spirit replied. “The test on every third stage of each level is to withstand 10 moves from him, but the higher the level, the stronger he would be, and the finer his moves would be.”

Ling Han was filled with competitive spirit. He finally had a strong interest, and he said, “Senior Xu, please make your move!”

“Take care!” Xu Ran hollered, and took the initiative to move, delivering a punch straight at Ling Han’s chest. There was obviously no art to this move; it was simple and ordinary, but when the fist shot over, it felt as if the whole world was about to collapse, and Ling Han was at the center of the cave-in.

Simplifying the complex, this was a mastery of Fist Heart!

Ling Han nodded. The great Dao was most simple, and in fist arts, Xu Ran’s grasp of the skill had exceeded the move itself. A careless punch would be in accordance with the great Dao and Truth, possessing ultimate might.

However, cultivators were still strongest in their strength!

Ling Han flipped over his palm and delivered a palm strike. As the Earth Overturning Seal was used, a golden light flickered brilliantly.

Peng!

In the exchange of a single blow, Xu Ran was forced back 30 steps, while Ling Han did not move at all.

Ling Han could not help but frown, and asked, “Your ability is obviously not limited, so why will you not exert your full effort?”

“Because this is only the first level,” the Tool Spirit answered.

In the assessment of the nine-storied tower, one level was stronger than the previous.

Ling Han broke out into laughter, and said, “Unseal his power! I want to battle the strongest Shattering Void Tier cultivator!”

The Tool Spirit considered it for a moment, then said, “As you wish!”

Hong , a frightening energy suddenly exploded from Xu Ran’s starlit body, becoming solid and transforming into waves that surged out. The waves washed over Ling Han’s body, and he could not help but come out in goosebumps.

This strength was too powerful!

Yet Ling Han was fearless, and merely felt incredibly excited. He said, “This is the strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier! Hahaha, no wonder no one has been able to surpass you; you have really cultivated the strength of Shattering Void Tier all the way to the maximum limit!”

In Shattering Void Tier, the limit of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier was not for battle prowess, but rather strength. However, not many could reach battle prowess of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, what more pure strength.

“Come!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and approached fearlessly.

Peng!

With a single blow, Ling Han was sent flying. However, his physique was too monstrous; this punch did not even cause the slightest bit of injury to him.

One could claim that if the test of the third stage was to withstand 10 moves, then not just 10 moves, he would be fine even with a 100,000 moves. Without reaching the strength of the Immortal level, how could Xu Ran possibly damage Godly metal?

With a loud shout, Ling Han came back around. He directly drew a bow and notched an arrow. The Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow was used, and ******1 towards the other.

Xu Ran did not possess a physique as strong as his, and dared not to use his bare body to take this strike head on. Immediately, he gripped his fist and delivered a blow at the arrow.

Pa , undoubtedly, the arrow was sent flying by his blow, but there was also a burst of starlight on Xu Ran’s hand. It seemed he had been injured.

That was the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, after all, a powerful secret technique really inherited from an elite of the Immortal Realm. Added with the fact that Ling Han had conquered the whole Lower Realm, there was naturally no lack of resources in his possession. He reforged a Level Ten treasured bow, and forged arrows from a certain amount of Level Ten precious metal.

What kind of strength did Ling Han presently possess? 16 Stars of Shattering Void Tier! If one took on this shot from him head on, what Shattering Void Tier cultivator would be unscathed? Unless his physique could also reach the level of Ling Han’s physique.

The Tool Spirit could not help but be stunned. Ling Han’s physique and battle prowess both caused its “eyes” to light up. One had to know that this human had yet to reach the maximum strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier.

Ling Han did not pull his punches at all. Xiu, xiu, xiu . Another three arrows consecutively shot out; then, wielding his sword, he charged out. His right hand used the 10,000 Techniques Return to One, whereas his left hand circulated the Earth Overturning Seal, blasting out at Xu Ran.

Peng, peng, peng . The two were embroiled in a fierce battle. Endless waves of power spread out like waves in a sea.

Ling Han used his battle prowess to the fullest. The other’s strength was superior to his, so he was naturally not going to go head to head with him by force. Instead, he displayed his own battle prowess to its fullest, especially the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow. He combined with it the two Mystical Powers of Thunderclap Ninth Heaven and the Eye of Truth, and the battle prowess it could exhibit was the most terrifying.

But, disappointingly, Xu Ran did not have any weakness at all over his entire body.

He was not a real living being, but rather branded by the Tool Spirit making use of the essence Xu Ran had left behind, so it naturally did not possess the weaknesses of an actual living being. However, while it did not have weaknesses, it could still be claimed that its whole body was covered with weaknesses.

Ling Han shot out arrows madly, every shot frightening. Once he had closed the distance between himself and Xu Ran, he abandoned the bow, and used the sword. As the 10,000 Techniques Return to One slashed out, exploding with an ultimate strike, it would be able to force even an elite the likes of Xu Ran to retreat.

The battle was at a stalemate.
