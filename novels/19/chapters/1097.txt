Chapter 1098: Fast and Slow

“This...!” The spectators on the two sides were all pale with shock.

“They’ve only walked one-tenth of the distance, yet the might of the puppets has already increased! How can they possibly make it to the end?”

“Yeah... It might become even stronger after a while.”

“Isn’t this almost impossible?”

Everyone shook their heads, thinking this formation was impossible to pass.

The four tiers of prodigies continued to advance. The fourth tier originally had the most people, but it rapidly decreased in size as they entered what was speculated to be the second segment of the formation. After a while, they became one of the tiers with the least people, with only a few more members than the four people in the first tier.

“Huh?”

Everyone was astonished. As the large majority of the fourth tier was eliminated, the few remaining people all became especially eye-catching. Thus, Ling Han immediately attracted a lot of attention.

“I can’t believe it! There’s actually someone at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier!”

“By the looks of it, he still hasn’t formed his third River yet. It’s clear that he still hasn’t reached the late stage of the high extreme.”

“Yet he’s still able to make it so far?”

“This doesn’t make any sense at all! Is he a freak?”

“He’s probably got some treasure that can protect him from injuries.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. If this weren’t the case, there would be no way that Ling Han could have advanced so far, even if he were a supreme prodigy. His cultivation level was too low, after all, and the attacks from the stone statues were relentless and ruthless. It was as if they would never stop attacking. How could a cultivator at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier possess this much Origin Power to use?

However, little did they know that Ling Han also practiced body arts. His stamina would recover over time, and this was completely different from Origin Power.

More and more people were eliminated as they continued forward, and the original horde of several thousand people had already decreased dramatically, with only several hundred people remaining. Those who were eliminated were mostly from the fourth tier. Some had fled from the formation, while many had also been killed by the stone statues.

Right now, the second and third tiers had the most members. There were 100 or so people in the first tier, and there were 300 or so people in the second tier. Meanwhile, both the first and fourth tiers numbered in the single digits.

Fight, fight, fight!

The hot-bloodedness of the young prodigies was all stimulated, with their pride causing them to become even more resolute. ‘Since this trial exists, it’s definitely possible to pass. Since that’s the case, why can’t I be the person who passes?’

Such determination was to be lauded at times as it could push cultivators to improve. However, it was also detrimental at times as refusing to back down could cause one to lose their life.

After two hours or so, the first tier of prodigies finally neared two-tenths of the formation.

As the battle prowess of the stone statues had increased after the first tenth of their journey, everyone prepared themselves for when the stone statues would suddenly become stronger.

Sure enough, the battle prowess of the stone statues increased again when they passed the 20% mark.

A second divine pattern materialized on their fists!

“Ahhh!” The elder who was using the turtle shell was the first to fall victim. The turtle shell was relentlessly attacked by the stone statues, and the divine patterns that decorated it released an unstable glow. This glow eventually died, and the turtle shell was shattered into seven pieces.

With his defensive treasure shattered, how could the elder stand up against the relentless attacks of the stone statues? He was instantly smashed into pulp, not even having the chance to escape.

“I’m out!”

In the face of such a brutal reality, many prodigies chose to swallow their pride. This was only the “third stage”, and there were still seven other stages ahead. It would definitely become more and more difficult, and as such, it would be impossible for them to pass.

‘Is this really something that a Mountain River Tier cultivator can accomplish?’

However, everyone’s eyes instantly turned to Ling Han. He was the only remaining member of the fourth tier—everyone else had either fled the formation or been killed, yet he, a cultivator at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier, still persisted.

“Who is this person?”

“I know right? He’s not the only person with a treasure, yet he’s the only high extreme cultivator remaining.”

“F-freak!”

“He’s the number one prodigy in our Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, which is located on the Joint Peace Planet. He arrived from a small world two years ago after opening the sky.”

Someone from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire was present, and they revealed Luan Xing’s identity.

“What?!”

Everyone was stunned, unable to believe their ears.

Was this person joking?

Before this, they had felt that Ling Han’s cultivation level was too low as he was only at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier. Even so, he was still able to advance through the stone statue formation. This made them realize that he was an absolute freak! However, after hearing that Ling Han had only arrived from the small world after opening the sky two years ago, their first reaction was that Ling Han’s cultivation speed was far too quick!

He had only been in the Immortal Realm for two years, yet he had already advanced from the Shattering Void Tier to the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier?

Was this possible?

However, there was more than one person from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire here, and they all confirmed that this was true. The others had to believe this even if they didn’t want to.

After all, there was no point in lying about this. Even if they could fool people for a while, the truth would eventually come out.

However, if this were true, then Ling Han was absolutely inhuman! His cultivation speed was shockingly quick!

The 400 remaining prodigies quickly decreased to less than 200. This time, it was the third tier that lost the most members, falling from over 300 to just around 30. Some members from the second tier also gave up or died, yet they still maintained a count of over 100.

“Heh, let’s play a guessing game. When do you guys think that cultivator at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier will stop?” This person’s voice was filled with curiosity.

This attracted enthusiastic guesses from many people. However, it was a shame that there was no one to bet. After all, no one here had a good enough reputation for others to trust their money with—they came from over 100 different stars, and thus they were all unfamiliar with each other.

“Master will definitely make it through the formation!” Ding Ping said with clenched fists.

“Of course!” the Asura Demon Emperor concurred. “Master is wise, mighty, and peerless throughout the world. He can easily complete this formation, even if it’s 10 times longer.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Shui Yanyu also trusted Ling Han’s abilities. However, she couldn’t help but grimace upon hearing the Asura Demon Emperor’s words. He had already become shameless in order to praise and flatter Ling Han.

At this time, even the first tier of cultivators had started to slow down. So what if they were Xia Wuque or Shao Sisi? They all appeared strained under the relentless attacks from the countless stone statues.

However, there was someone who had become quicker.

Ling Han!

He had already caught up to the third tier, and because of this, the fourth tier no longer existed. This was as he was the last person.

Everyone clutched their heads upon seeing this. This was far too astonishing. The others were all slowing down, yet he actually had the ability to speed up?

“He’s not speeding up. Rather, it’s the others who have slowed down! However, he hasn’t slowed down!” Someone revealed the truth.

Everyone was stunned.

They were under increasing pressure with each step that they took, yet Ling Han was still able to maintain a steady pace. What did this signify?

‘Crazy... The world’ s gone crazy!

”How the hell are you only at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier?”

Indeed, Ling Han didn’t feel too much pressure. Up until now, the puppets were unable to hurt him, and could only cause him pain. As they couldn’t injure him, Ling Han naturally didn’t need need to use the recovery ability of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. He still had heaps of trump cards.

Two hours passed, and the first tier of prodigies entered the fourth stage.

The battle prowess of the stone statues rose again, with the number of divine patterns on their hands increasing to three.

Their power clearly hadn’t increased, yet the appearance of these divine patterns raised their battle prowess by a large amount. It was absolutely shocking.

The second tier of cultivators started to decrease in numbers.
