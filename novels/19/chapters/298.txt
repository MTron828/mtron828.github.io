Chapter 299: There’s More After All’s Sold Out.

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Even if Zhu Wu Jiu didn’t speak of inspecting goods, everyone would never have overlooked it; it cost ten Origin Power Crystals after all!

Those special crystals containing the Origin Power were very normal products produced in large amounts—otherwise, with the market demand, they would already be used up, and it would impossible for such large amounts of them to appear.

There was a standard to Origin Crystals’ size—they were the size of a finger. Also, rather then being a piece, they were more like sticks.

But to fill this small Origin Power Crystal, a Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivator had to spend a month’s time... this was the normal rate if a Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivator expended all their Origin Power and recovered it through meditation and not through eating medicinal pills—otherwise, it would be squandering family fortune, since medicinal pills were very expensive as well.

Even Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivators could only refine twelve pieces a year, so this thing was extremely precious and could reflect the value of the hundred-year ginseng and ganoderma.

One after another, people paid Origin Power Crystals to receive a stalk of ginseng or ganoderma, and hurriedly examined them closely. If they personally didn’t understand, then they asked others on the side to appraise it, all of them revealing an exulted expression.

It certainly was hundred years old!

“I still want to buy a stalk!”

“I have money! I also want to buy three stalks!”

After confirming that the ginseng and ganoderma Zhu Wu Jiu sold were genuine, everyone was extremely excited, brandishing their Origin Power Crystals and barging in like local tyrants. These Origin Power Crystals were actually given by their families or forces for emergency usage; after all, the currency that flowed through here was Origin Power Crystal, while silver was used only between average people.

In the Nine Nations of the Desolate North, the Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors were definitely the pinnacle, so how could they possibly refine and condense Origin Power Crystals all day? Thus, even the Eight Great Clans couldn’t take out that many Origin Power Crystals, what more normal families.

Therefore, these people that threw ten Origin Crystals at a time were simply willfully rich.

Guang Yuan shook his head repeatedly as he watched, and said, “If anyone dared to squander this lord’s Origin Crystals like this, this lord would personally beat them to death!”

Ling Han sighed. “You say it as if you’ve refined Origin Power Crystals before.”

“Pah, this lord doesn’t even have time to cultivate, so how could I possibly waste Origin Power to do such a thing!” Guang Yuan immediately spat out shamelessly without caring for his image at all.

It made sense. Now that Ling Han was an Earth Grade alchemist, Guang Yuan’s status was countless times lower than Ling Han’s, so Guang Yuan naturally revealed his rowdiness as there was absolutely no need for him to put on airs of a senior or a powerhouse.

Everyone laughed underneath their breaths. Guang Yuan might be rude, but he was also an interesting person.

Everyone was disorderly crowded around Zhu Wu Jiu, and the scene was extremely bustling. Some people didn’t have ten Origin Crystals on them so they bargained with Zhu Wu Jiu, while others were a bit more rich and imposing, saying that they were willing to add onto the price to have priority over the selling of the goods as they were afraid that ginseng and ganoderma would be sold out.

Cheng Fei Jun’s expression was gloomier and gloomier. The martial arts tea party he held was to pick out potential talents for Luo Ji Feng to select, but not for Ling Han to sell goods!

He couldn’t help but stand up and remind everyone that it was about time to continue sparring.

However, no one paid attention to him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

People saw the ability of several others previously, and knew there was no chance for most of them to obtain the first place. So, since there was only one prize for the number one, why not focus on a treasure in their sight instead?

Cheng Fei Jun almost cursed out. The tea party was held by him and he was a high level Black Grade alchemist—how dare a group of mere Gushing Spring Tier martial artist not give him any face?

But Ling Han was on the scene, so he as a high level Black Grade alchemist was really nothing great. So what if they didn’t give any face? There was still Master Ling, right?

This damned Ling Han, was he born to go against him?

Cheng Fei Jun slumped into his seat, his gaze filled with fury. He was even feeling hate for Luo Ji Feng now. That old man said he would get rid of Ling Han, but he had done nothing after so many days, letting Ling Han run around wildly perfectly fine.

After several more hours, Zhu Wu Jiu finally sold a whole basketful of spirit medicine, but there were still many people brandishing their Origin Power Crystals, wishing to buy more. He looked at Ling Han, and seeing Ling Han nod, he then said, “Those friends who haven’t bought any, don’t worry, you can find me later at the inn’s seventh courtyard. There will be large amounts of ginseng and ganoderma provided—a hundred-year-old ones. I promise everyone will be satisfied.”

Only upon hearing that were those who hadn’t bought any willing to leave.

However, everyone was shocked—after a wicker basketful of spirit medicine was sold, there were still more!? This was hundred year old ginseng and ganoderma we were talking about, not some random cabbage!

Normal people had a mere lifespan of a hundred years, and nowadays, areas deep in the mountains were full of medicine harvesters, thus the amount of spirit medicines was becoming fewer and fewer. One would be grateful for being able to occasionally harvest one stalk of hundred year old ginseng, but now a basketful was sold to them, and there was still more... could they have dug up an ancient medicinal garden?

Cheng Fei Jun’s expression was like the fluctuating weather, filled with intense avarice. He thought that Ling Han must’ve found an ancient medicinal garden—obtaining it along with a grandmaster alchemist’s heritage would explain both his supply of spirit medicine and his ability to become an Earth Grade alchemist at such a young age.

If he could obtain it... instantly, his heart was burning with inexhaustible desire, making him willing to take risks out of desperation.

Guang Yuan took it all in, and said to Ling Han, “Ling Han, that brat has aimed his killing intent at you.”

Ling Han laughed lightly, and said, “No matter, a mere clown. I originally didn’t care, but since he seeks death, then I’ll send him on his way. I’ll leave it to Old Brother Guang.”

Pu! Guang Yuan instantly spurted out and said faintly, “That guy is still a high level Black Grade alchemist, if I kill him, then the whole world’s alchemists would see me as the most hated person.”

“Just do it cleanly. He’s merely at the seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier, and based on Old Brother Guang’s cultivation of the eight layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, you can definitely suppress him with one hand, with neither god nor ghosts finding out.” Ling Han smiled.

Guang Yuan received the complete Large Sun Heaven Heart Scroll, and with Ling Han’s provision of medicinal pills, his cultivation welcomed a small upsurge, reaching the peak of the seventh layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, which was also unbelievable to even himself.

“Alright, leave this guy to me!” Guang Yuan said clenching his teeth. He received so many benefits from Ling Han yet hadn’t truly done anything for him, making him feel obliged to do something.

Ling Han nodded. He truly didn’t care for Cheng Fei Jun; as for Luo Ji Feng who almost blinded his eyes, he hadn’t gone to”peak” again, so he didn’t deeply understand this person.

That old man’s presence gave him a familiar feeling, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
