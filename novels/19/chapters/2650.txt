2651 Uncanny Sight

Miao Hua dazedly stared at Ling Han. He was completely unable to accept this result.

Elites and freaks like them had already reached the peak of cultivation, yet Ling Han had actually employed such a technique? He had chosen to exchange a wound for a wound?

No, Ling Han had indeed been wounded. However, Miao Hua had been killed.

Miao Hua was filled with puzzlement. Ling Han had clearly been struck by his spiritual attack, so how had he remained unaffected? Moreover, his hand had clearly been shattered, so how had he remained so calm?

Moreover, Ling Han’s attack had directly obliterated Miao Hua’s bones and internal organs, and caused Miao Hua to instantly become sluggish. It was because of this that he had been unable to dodge Ling Han’s sword.

‘Why? Why?’

He died in confusion.

At this moment, Xiao Yingxiong’s attack finally arrived, with his spear stabbing at Ling Han.

Ling Han retreated and unleashed his Body Art.

Peng!

He immediately accelerated, dodging the spear by mere millimeters.

Ling Han looked at Miao Hua, and said, “If you knew about what I’ve experienced these years, you wouldn’t be surprised by my resilience and endurance. Moreover, I’ve already mastered the Five Elements Lightning Technique, and this is a Heavenly Venerate Technique, so it’s only natural that you weren’t able to withstand it.”

During the past 5,000,000 years, Ling Han’s body would erupt once every 1000 years. Thus, compared to this pain, what did a shattered hand matter? Similarly, after enduring such pain over and over again, what effects could a spiritual attack still have on him?

After enduring such attacks enough times, one would naturally develop immunity to them.

However, Miao Hua was still unable to accept this. He slowly exhaled—this was his remnant resentment and vexation. His head then flopped to the side, signifying his demise.

His mind had been obliterated, and this was something that even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings couldn’t survive.

Ling Han casually retrieved Miao Hua’s Spatial Celestial Tool. He then channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, immediately starting to heal his broken hand. However, this was an extremely slow process. After all, this wound had been caused by a Celestial Tool, so a fearsome destructive power continued to rip through his hand, preventing it from healing.

Xiao Yingxiong took a deep breath, saying, “Who would’ve thought that you’ve already become this powerful!”

In the blink of an eye, Ling Han had already caught up to Xiao Yingxiong. Miao Hua, someone equally as powerful as him, had more so been killed.

This wasn’t because Miao Hua was weak. Instead, it was because Ling Han had been far too brutal. He had opted to exchange a wound for a wound, a life for a life. Miao Hua hadn’t been prepared for such ferocity.

“You’re unafraid of spiritual attacks, and you’ve more so mastered a complete Heavenly Venerate Technique. I’ve underestimated you!” Xiao Yingxiong said. However, he was unafraid. He gripped his Celestial Spear tightly, and his fighting spirit soared into the sky.

Ling Han smiled faintly. In fact, he hadn’t needed to be so brutal. However, even if his battle prowess could suppress that of Xiao Yingxiong and Miao Hua, if they were intent on fleeing, whom would he pursue?

No matter whom Ling Han pursued, the other would be able to escape. If Ling Han wanted to kill them in the future, that would be incredibly difficult.

Thus, Ling Han had decided to take a gamble. Risking a severe wound, he resolutely killed Miao Hua. Now, even if Xiao Yingxiong wanted to flee, Ling Han wouldn’t have to worry. He was confident that he could kill the former no matter what corner of the world the other party fled to.

Moreover, with the two of them cooperating, Ling Han might not have been their match. This was to say nothing of killing them.

“Since that’s the case, why don’t you kneel down and accept death?” Ling Han said calmly.

“I’m no Miao Hua!” Xiao Yingxiong scoffed. “I’m not as conceited as him.”

“Then come battle!” Ling Han said as he leaped forward.

Peng!

He unleashed an astounding power, instantly arriving before Xiao Yingxiong and thrusting his sword.

Ding!

Xiao Yingxiong raised his spear to block Ling Han’s attack.

“Haha! Just as I expected. Even though you’ve advanced to the Seventh Heaven, the rise of your battle prowess is lagging far behind this level,” Xiao Yingxiong said with laughter. Otherwise, he would have fled long ago.

Ling Han’s flurry of slashes was like a downpour of rain. During the past 5,000,000 years, his Body Art had indeed improved. However, this improvement hadn’t been significant. After all, he had been cultivating with no external help, so how could he soar into the skies in a single bound?

Ling Han appeared indifferent at this moment, merely exchanging strikes with Xiao Yingxiong. He was waiting for his left hand to recover so he could summon the Five Elements Lightning Technique again. At that time, Xiao Yingxiong would know the meaning of regret.

Being a spectator and being the actual person involved were completely different experiences. A complete Heavenly Venerate Technique was far too terrifying.

Ding, ding, ding!

The two of them were locked in an intense battle.

Even though Xiao Yingxiong’s words were tough, after failing to suppress Ling Han after several attempts, he started to show signs of wanting to leave.

This was because Ling Han wielded the Divine Demon Sword, a Celestial Tool that could suppress his spear. If they continued to battle, he would be at a huge disadvantage.

Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately turned around to leave.

Ling Han gave chase. This time was different from last time. He had already obtained the inheritance of the Five Elements Lightning Technique, so there was no reason for him to stay.

One fled, and one pursued.

Xiao Yingxiong’s goal was very clear. He was charging toward the uppermost level of the palace, and searching for the rumored passageway that led out of the Celestial King Graveyard.

Even though Xiao Yingxiong had failed to kill Ling Han, he had still soared from the early stage of the Seventh Heaven to the late stage of the Eighth Heaven in just 100,000,000 years. Was this improvement not impressive enough?

This was already enough. Thus, he decided to leave the Celestial King Graveyard first. In any case, he could reenter in the future to obtain the final inheritance of the Five Elements Lightning Technique.

Someone like him naturally knew when to fight for something and when to retreat. He understood how to weigh things up.

Ling Han pursued him relentlessly, with his Divine Demon Sword slashing without mercy. He definitely wouldn’t allow Xiao Yingxiong to escape.

They continued upward, quickly arriving on the 18th floor. They then entered the 20th floor, the 30th floor… When they arrived at the 33rd floor, they were both given a start, stopping in their tracks.

This was because this floor wasn’t empty anymore. Instead, there were numerous giant eggs on the floor, with each being two persons tall. Their girth was also wider than what two people could embrace. They were ink-black in color, and they were also surrounded by wisps of rising black air. This was an uncanny scene.

Row after row, column after column, the eggs were dense and boundless.

According to rumors, there was an ultimate inheritance hidden here, and there was also a passageway to leave the Celestial King Graveyard. What in the world was this, then? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Yingxiong glanced at Ling Han before dashing forward again.

Meanwhile, Ling Han looked at his right hand. A new hand had already grown from his wrist, and the final finger had also finished growing.

This signified that he had completely recovered from Miao Hua’s strike.

Ling Han accumulated some power before bending his knees and lunging forward. At the same time, he also activated the Regulations of Time and the Regulations of Space. With his wound healed, he no longer had anything to fear, so he unleashed his full strength.

Even though Xiao Yingxiong wasn’t facing Ling Han, his divine sense was naturally aware of his surroundings. Thus, he could clearly “see” Ling Han catching up to him at an incredible speed. At the same time, Ling Han’s sword pierced at his back.

If Xiao Yingxiong didn’t block this strike, he would be seeking death.

Ding!

He turned around and swung his spear, catching the Divine Demon Sword and pushing its tip aside.

Boom!

Just how terrifying was the battle prowess of these two supreme prodigies? Their exchange instantly unleashed a ferocious shock wave into the surroundings.

The surrounding eggs bore the brunt of this shock wave.

Crack, crack, crack…

They all split apart. However, in an uncanny sight, only the outer layer of the eggs crumbled. The black mist dissipated, revealing an almost transparent inner shell.

Ling Han had initially wanted to launch another strike. However, upon seeing the matter in the eggs, he involuntarily stopped.

Inside these eggs… were people!

Each egg held a person, and it was as if these people were in a deep slumber. Their arms were wrapped around their knees, and they were curled up like a ball. They were completely naked, yet they were astoundingly surrounded by nine ribbons of iridescent light.

Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings!

Heavens! Each egg held a Ninth Heaven Celestial King! It was as if they were dormant and undergoing some kind of transformation.

Ling Han finally understood why he hadn’t come across any Ninth Heaven Celestial King. However, knowing this was one thing. Right now, he was even more puzzled. What the f*ck was happening here?
