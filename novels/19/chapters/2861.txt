2862 A draw

The raw stones chosen by Ling Han and Grandmaster Xuanlai could be said to be very different.

Ling Han’s piece was the size of a man, while Grandmaster Xuanlai’s one was only the size of a fist, not even one percent of Ling Han’s piece.

“Hehe, if the comparison is based on size, then Ling Han will sure win,” someone joked.

“Shut up. He is a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, with battle prowess that is comparable to that of a Fourth Tier, how can you joke about him?” Someone immediately scolded him lest he brought calamity upon himself.

!!

The man froze, and didn’t dare to speak any more.

Everyone was looking forward to this, what kind of sparks would be produced in the fierce contest between these two people?

As layers of stone scraps fall off, whether there was anything contained in the raw stone, and what it might be, would soon be revealed to the public.

“Yi!”

“Gasp!”

As a Heavenly Venerate, Ling Han was naturally faster. Under his hands, the raw stone was already showing a hint of Primal Chaos, and a seal could be vaguely seen as churning.

“Heavenly Venerable Seal!” everyone exclaimed.

How awesome, obtaining a Heavenly Venerable Seal at the very start—this already affirmed his invincible position.

The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate’s eyes also lit up as he secretly thought that it would seem that some good things had leaked into the raw stone lane despite having been browsed by a grandmaster of raw stone.

Ling Han stopped his hand. He couldn’t open it up any further, or the Heavenly Venerable Seal would come into being.

On the other side.

“Yi, there’s also treasure here.”

“It’s also a Heavenly Venerable Seal!”

The exclamation sounded again. Unexpectedly, Grandmaster Xuanlai also unveiled a Heavenly Venerable Seal.

As expected of a grandmaster of raw stone, amazing.

But there were Heavenly Venerable Seals on both sides, how to judge this?

Unless these two seals would be collected into one’s mind, it would be impossible to compare which one was of a higher level.

The problem was, this was a Heavenly Venerable Seal, so even if it was given to someone, who would be willing to take it out again?

Besides, if that person was to take out the more widely known seven seals to deceive them, who would know?

The first round… was it considered a draw?

Grandmaster Xuanlai smiled. “Although the Heavenly Venerable Seals cannot be analyzed, this old man here has a Complete Heavens Ring, which can be used for scanning to match the Heavenly Venerable Seal to the sequence so that comparison can be made.”

Everyone looked at each other. Was there such a thing?

“You can try it.” Grandmaster Xuanlai took out a ring, which was engraved with seals, but it was by no means Heavenly Venerable Seals.

“Grandmaster Ling, please channel a Heavenly Venerable Seal and press this on it,” he said to Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, randomly channeled a ninth-grade seal while holding the ring, and one of the nodes suddenly lit up.

Grandmaster Xuanlai glanced at it. “This is a ninth-grade seal.” He pointed out an area on the ring. “Everything that lights up here is a ninth-grade seal. Grandmaster Ling, you can try again.”

Ling Han once again channeled another ninth-grade seal, and sure enough, it still lit up in the designated area. He was curious, and said, “What if it’s a seventh-grade seal?”

“Here.” Grandmaster Xuanlai pointed to another area of the Complete Heavens Ring.

Ling Han channeled an eighth-grade seal and the Complete Heavens Ring lit up again, and it was indeed not in the area of the ninth grade, nor in the area designated by Grandmaster Xuanlai just earlier.

“This is an eighth grade seal,” Grandmaster Xuanlai said with a smile.

Ling Han nodded. “This can indeed reflect the level of the Heavenly Venerable Seals.”

Everyone was surprised. There was actually research that produced such a thing now?

“This is a recent invention, so it’s no wonder that everyone doesn’t know about it,” Grandmaster Xuanlai said. He first introduced which area corresponded to the symbol of the ninth-grade seal, and then pressed the raw stone in his hand on the Complete Heavens Ring.

Suddenly, the Complete Heavens Ring lit up.

“A seventh-grade seal,” everyone said.

“Grandmaster Ling, you try it.” Grandmaster Xuanlai handed the Complete Heavens Ring to Ling Han.

Ling Han took it, and pressed the raw stone on the Complete Heavens Ring. The Complete Heavens Ring also responded, and it lit up.

“It’s also a seventh-grade seal.” Everyone was surprised; they didn’t expect that this still failed to distinguish who would be the winner.

“In the first round, it is a draw,” the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate said.

Both Ling Han and Grandmaster Xuanlai nodded, approving such judgment.

“Grandmaster Xuanlai, do you still have many of such Complete Heavens Ring?” someone asked Grandmaster Xuanlai.

Grandmaster Xuanlai laughed loudly. “Do you intend to use the Complete Heavens Ring to select the raw stones which contain Heavenly Venerable Seals? That is impossible, as the raw stone must be cut to the extent that only a trace of stone scrap remains and the Heavenly Venerable Seal can be seen so that the Complete Heavens Ring can sense it and map it accordingly.”

Hearing what he had said, everyone shook their head. They could already see it, so how could they cheat? However, this wasn’t without its benefits. In the past, even if you saw someone else unearth a Heavenly Venerable Seal, you could only take a gamble when rushing to procure it. Whether you might have bought a high-level or a low-level seal at a costly price would only be based on luck.

But now?

After mapping, one would be able to know which grade it belonged to, and even the specific sequence would be clear, so one would also be able to know whether one already owned this Heavenly Venerable Seal.

Ling Han also became very interested. He had to go get one so that he would know which seals in the sequence he was missing, and be able to connect the combination seals in a sequence.

“Grandmaster Ling, let’s start the second round?” Grandmaster Xuanlai asked.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded.

“It’s still the same, you limit this old man to a specific area. But since it’s a longer time limit this time, how about expanding it to three out of the 10 areas previously divided?” Grandmaster Xuanlai said with a smile.

Ling Han agreed, and randomly assigned three areas to Grandmaster Xuanlai, while he also chose three areas.

...

“This time, six hours,” the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate said, and he threw out another hourglass. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The two immediately began to choose. The first confrontation had allowed them to understand that the other party was a stubborn opponent, and was not easy to deal with.

Everyone held their breath once again. Such an even match was indeed exciting, which made them look forward to it even more.

Soon, six hours had passed.

“Stop,” the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate said. He further added, “Please select your own stone respectively.”

Ling Han and Grandmaster Xuanlai fetched a stone each, but this time the stones that they had selected were about the same size.

Both of them chose to cut open the stone by themselves. As the stone scraps continued to peel off, the contents inside also reappeared.

“Great Herb!”

“Both sides have unearthed a Great Herb.”

“Ling Han’s is yellow-colored.”

“Grandmaster Xuanlai’s is also yellow-colored.”

...

“Hiss, is this another tie?”

“See whether one side has properties of healing. Below the orange grade, the value of Great Herb that heals injuries is higher.”

Everyone was surprised. They didn’t expect these two people would both unearth a yellow-colored Great Herb at the same time.

After the Great Herbs had been fully extracted, they were handed over to the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate for evaluation.

The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate observed carefully for a while, and said, “They are both Great Herbs to improve one’s cultivation level.” He paused, and emphasized, “Invaluable.”

Ling Han and Grandmaster Xuanlai took a closer look at the two Great Herbs, and they both nodded, agreeing with the conclusion of the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate—that they were indeed great medicines for improving one’s cultivation level.

So, this second round came to a draw again.

This was beyond everyone’s expectations. Who would have thought that such a process would happen? What now?

“For the third round, this old man wants to enter the treasure area, and then compete to see who is better,” Grandmaster Xuanlai suddenly said to the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate.
