Chapter 2211: True might of First Secret

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I only wish to ask Young Master Han to reconsider,” Hu Yan said, his tone having lost all its previous good nature, exuding an air of imperiousness.

“Hehe!” Ling Han took the initiative to move, and grabbed out at Hu Yan.

Boom, the giant hand spread out like a layer of dense clouds.

Hu Yan smirked coldly. “Young Master Han, do you think I’m Ji Yutang?”

He sent out a punch in response to Ling Han’s giant hand.

Boom, a loud sound spread out, and Ling Han’s and Hu Yan’s body trembled. Endless brilliance surged out, turning into layers of seals.

In this clash, the two of them had actually come out even.

Ling Han appeared slightly surprised. This Hu Yan had not been making empty boasts. He was indeed stronger than Ji Yutang, and could be ranked in the top tier even among monarch tiers. However, he was still a far way away from Ling Han, Ji Wuming, and their likes. Otherwise, with an advantage of a major tier on his side, he should be completely capable of overwhelming Ling Han.

Hu Yan’s expression was filled with pride as he declared, “I have cultivated Severing Mundane Tier seven times, and have struck myself a total of 35 times. Though I still have not attained Dividing Nine Souls, my battle prowess would not be much inferior to Dividing Nine Souls!”

He was a supreme prodigy himself, but Hong Huang was far more freakish than him. Furthermore, his background was too extraordinary, and that was why he had been willing to fall under the latter’s rule. Otherwise, he himself should be a great emperor, so how could he be subordinate to another?

Ling Han merely chuckled in response. No matter how many strikes he delivered, he was only Severing Mundane Tier at most, and could not be compared with Dividing Nine Souls. Otherwise, Hu Yan would not have tied with him in battle. Was your advantage in cultivation level meaningless?

After all, only if one had cultivated every cultivation level to perfection could he be supreme in his brilliance.

“I am quite intrigued,” Ling Han said smilingly. Ji Yutang was too weak, and Ling Han had been able to suppress him single-handedly. What would be interesting about that?

“Intrigued?” Hu Yan humphed coldly. This gentle, mild young man showed a fanatacism, and this was his true colors. “Then let me first ensure that you know the true measure of your own abilities to avoid you acting inappropriately in front of Lord Hong Huang.”

This time, he took the initiative to move. He sent out a punch with his eyes wide, a frightening divine light shining brilliantly.

“Mystical power of Immortal Palace Tier?” Ling Han was slightly curious. In the face of this divine light, it was hard for him to even open his eyes. He was completely unable to see the situation ahead of him. It was not only his vision that was affected, but also divine sense as well, as if he had indeed become blind.

The Immortal Palace Tier cultivated the Mystery Realm within their bodies, Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. WIth cultivation of every Mystery Realm, they would possess a strong ability.

For example, the dazzling divine light shining from Hu Yan’s eyes was one of the abilities. This was suppression of the cultivation level. Even if Ling Han was equivalent to First Secret, he had not truly crossed over into the Immortal Palace Tier, after all, so he could not be immune.

It was a dominance of cultivation level, and could not be helped.

As the divine light shone brilliantly, Hu Yan charged out, a fist aimed directly for Ling Han’s face.

As the saying went, when you get into a fight, never aim for the face. Yet he purposely made a move for Ling Han’s face, so his intentions to humiliate him could not be more obvious.

Presently, Ling Han could only depend on his instincts warning him about danger. Otherwise, if he were to react when he felt the incoming force, it would already be too late.

He smirked coldly, and his right hand stretched out to grab Hu Yan’s wrist.

Involuntarily, Hu Yan’s expression shifted slightly. In a situation when the five senses and divine sense were affected, he could still react so precisely. This was a little shocking.

This was the battle instinct of a supreme monarch tier?

As he thought this, his attacks did not slow down in the slightest.?Peng, peng, peng, his feet moved, and he began circling around Ling Han, unleashing punches in a quick barrage.

“Break!” Ling Han shouted. He was naturally unwilling to be beaten down like this.

Boom, Great Clash of Source Powers blasted out, and fiercely exploded with him at the center.

Hu Yan was instantly pale with fear. This destructive power caused a chill to rise all over his body, and he felt that he would be instantly turned to dust if there was the slightest contact.

Hurriedly, he retreated, not daring to face this head-on.

Ling Han did not pursue. Instead, he channeled Origin Power, and multiple seals flickered in his eyes, causing his sight to slowly go back to normal. He stated calmly, “Your first Mystery Realm has been formed through temperance of fire.”

“That’s right!” Hu Yan answered proudly. “You have attained Dividing Nine Souls, which is comparable to the First Secret, but against a true First Secret, you still have a long way to go!

“The strength that I have previously shown is only one of the abilities of my Mystery Realm, and a negligible part of it at that.

“And now, I will show you the true power of the Mystery Realm of the Immortal Palace Tier!”

With a soft exclamation,?boom

, fiery flames were instantly ignited all over his body, and the clothing on his upper body was instantly burnt into dust. His body had become semi-translucent, and his heart was easily visible.

“The first Mystery Realm I cultivated was the Heart!” he declared proudly. “It was tempered in the flames that would never be extinguished in an epoch of Burning Mountain, and I can also draw on a sliver of might of the Inextinguishable Burning Mountain!

“Do you know what that means?

“The Inextinguishable Burning Flame is at the Celestial King Tier. Hence, with my grasp of a sliver of the Inextinguishable Burning Flame, it would be equivalent to having possessed a sliver of Celestial King Tier might!

“Hahaha, this is the true power of Immortal Palace Tier!”

Boom, his heart turned into a raging furnace. No, it would be better to call it a volcanic crater, spurting crimson red lava, endlessly surging out, and turning the surroundings into an ocean of flames.

Weng, weng, weng.?However, when the lava flow reached the herbs and sides of the abode, multiple streaks of light flashed, turning into brilliantly shining seals, stopping the lava’s invasion, and protecting the medicinal ingredients and structure.

This was a formation laid down by a Celestial King, and that was why Hu Yan dared to move recklessly. Otherwise, there were masses of valuable herbs on this herb mountain, and some of them were even astonishingly old Celestial medicines. How could Hu Yan afford the reimbursement?

This lava was extremely terrifying, with shards of Regulations moving within it, and turning into multiple ancient seals.

Burning Mountain was a famous ancient mountain of the Celestial Realm. The time of its existence could no longer be traced, and it was one of the most ancient locations of the Celestial Realm. Furthermore, Burning Mountain constantly experienced volcanic eruptions, and the underground flames burned endlessly.

That was also a holy land for concocting alchemical pills. A great many alchemists would go there, and draw on the help of the underground flames for concocting alchemical pills. It could greatly increase the success rate and effects of the completed alchemical pill.

Now that Hu Yan had plucked the flames of the inextinguishable flames of Burning Mountain to refine into his first Mystery Realm, he had also gained a sliver of might of this ancient flame.

“There is still time to correct your attitude now!” Hu Yan’s whole person was flowing with lava. Like a God of Fire, he strode towards Ling Han, an expression of arrogance on his face.

They were both monarch tiers, but with the different power of heaven and earth that they plucked upon advancing to the Immortal Palace Tier, their battle prowess would also be greatly different.

Ji Yutang?

Hehe, he had originated from the Imperial Void Sect, so how could he be compared with that kind of trash!

“Quite interesting,” Ling Han murmured.?Boom, a flame also surged from his body, standing off against the lava.

Nine Heavens Flame, a Source Power of heaven and earth.

Unfortunately, due to the limits of Ling Han’s cultivation level, the Nine Heavens Flame could only form a shield of fire around him, and could not unfold a territory to stand off against this omnipresent lava.

Yet Ling Han was completely unconcerned. Instead, he was quite keen. That was because the Nine Heavens Flame was presently swallowing the lava. Though the rate was very slow, it was indeed happening.

It could not be helped. In terms of essence, the Nine Heavens Flame was definitely stronger. This was a Source Power of heaven and earth.

The Nine Heavens Flame was analyzing the lava, or to be more precise, it was analyzing the Regulation of Fire in the lava, gradually absorbing it and making that power its own.

This was extremely necessary. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If Ling Han could advance into Celestial King Tier now, the Nine Heavens Flame would naturally rise with him, and cross over into Celestial King Tier as well, but that was only limited to the First Heaven. This was the restriction of heaven and earth. However, the Nine Heavens Flame still had room for improvement, and that was to fuse with other Regulations of Fire.

And what the Nine Heavens Flame was presently doing was precisely this..
