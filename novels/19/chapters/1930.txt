Chapter 1931: A meaningless death

Ba Yao was involuntarily astonished, and hurriedly turned around, seeing that a middle-aged beauty had unknowingly appeared behind him.

All of a sudden, coldness rose up in his body as he felt every single hair rise on end.

‘Impossible!’

He was an Ascending Origin Tier elite, the strongest existence below Celestial King Tier, but he was actually completely unaware that a person had appeared behind him, so how could he not be dumbfounded.

“Who are you?” he asked, a tremor in his voice.

“Are you even worthy to ask?” Lu Hairong asked calmly, her voice icy cold.

This idiot actually dared to be insolent to her Young Imperial Empress. Just how tired was he of living?

“Niu wants to smack him!” Hu Niu cried out, appearing incredibly indignant and infuriated. “You actually dare threaten Niu’s Ling Han. Niu wants to beat you up into a pig’s head, and then feed you to the dogs!”

Though she was still as violent as she had been, Ling Han breathed a slight sigh of relief. At least, this line was slightly more normal. She was no longer declaring wanting to feed a dog’s head to the dogs.

Lu Hairong had completely no need to move at all. She only gave a light humph, and boom, the pressure of a Celestial King that could move the Nine Heavens surged out. Involuntarily, Ba Yao’s legs weakened, and he knelt.

Whatever previous Holy Son, Consummate of Ascending Origin Tier... In front of a Celestial King, this was all trash.

Ba Yao felt his whole body covered in cold sweat. He was really terrified now.

All the prodigies also tsked in amazement. They were all from Celestial King Tier-level backgrounds, and it was not unusual that this had led to the arrival of a Celestial King. However, Celestial Kings were the strongest existence in the Celestial Realm. Which of them was not an overwhelmingly proud ruler with their own domain?

But looking at Hu Niu’s previous attitude, it was as if she was commanding a subordinate!

‘Just who exactly are you? You are a little too extravagant, aren’t you? Having a Celestial King follow you even on your travels?’

Old Demon Blood Shadow also forgot to moan. He looked dumbly at Hu Niu, and then looked at Ling Han, tremendous regret rising up in his heart.

Ling Han actually had such a terrifying background.

He felt like everything was so surreal. This was too unfathomable.

Since you were so awesome, why had you gone to become the Holy Son of Alchemy City?

...Though Alchemy City was indeed very awesome, it could only take a leading role among four-star forces at most, and barely could be considered a five-star force of the lowest rank.

‘Were you pretending to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing?

‘You screwed me over!’

He did not reflect on himself in the slightest, that it was he who had taken the initiative to trifle with Ling Han. Instead, he laid the blame for all the misfortune he had suffered on Ling Han, and thought that all of this was Ling Han’s fault.

With Hu Niu’s personality, she was naturally not going to be reserved about anything. Pa, she leaped over and sent a kick straight at Ba Yao’s face, kicking Ba Yao onto the ground. Then, pa, pa, pa, she stomped on him madly.

She was furious. This guy not only dared to threaten Ling Han, but dared to have ideas about her beyond his station. This definitely could not be tolerated.

Niu was Ling Han’s!

‘Stomp, stomp, stomp, Niu will stomp him dead!’

Ba Yao’s cultivation level had been sealed off by Lu Hairong. He could not possibly fight back. There was only a sliver of power left that was protecting his vitals. Thus, while he was battered and bruised from Hu Niu’s kicks, his wounds still immediately recovered.

As long as there was not someone else’s martial intent left in his body, every Celestial could very quickly heal their physical body.

In this way, he had become a perfect bullseye, allowing Hu Niu to vent her anger as much as she liked without being broken.

But while he would not break, it still hurt. Did you think an Ascending Origin Tier felt no pain?

“Ah!” Ba Yao screamed out in pain. Every stomp from Hu Niu’s foot would result in a groove in his flesh. If there were bones beneath the flesh, his bones would definitely be broken. If it was an internal organ, the internal organ would also be crushed.

“See if Niu won’t kill you!” Hu Niu cursed as she continued to kick, looking completely like a little psycho.

Everyone turned their gaze elsewhere. An incredibly exquisite beauty could actually be so violent.

Even Lu Hairong could not bear to watch any longer. With a wave of her hand, Celestial King Tier Regulations surged, and Ba Yao’s bones were directly crushed into dust that was blown away with the winds. He had turned into nothing, not even the slightest bit of him left behind.

She had no wish for her Young Imperial Empress to show how violent she could be in front of others again, so it was naturally best to eliminate Ba Yao directly.

...This Ba Yao had really died a meaningless death!

If you could not bear watching, then wouldn’t it be fine for you to just stop Hu Niu? Why did you kill him? So how meaningless was his death?

Everyone was looking at Lu Hairong in astonishment. This was a Celestial King, and even though she was only First Heaven, she was still a supremely noble existence in front of them.

In fact, a Celestial King was a supreme noble wherever they were.

“Greetings, Senior!” All the prodigies bowed in respect. Even Yan Xianlu was no exception. This was the respect that an absolute elite deserved. If it was not for the fact that they, too, were heirs of Celestial King Tier sects, merely bowing was not enough. They would have to kneel to pay their greetings.

“Young Imperial Empress, can we go back now?” Lu Hairong looked at Hu Niu. This little girl was so obstinate and determined, demanding to come out to find Ling Han. Now that she had finally found who she was looking for, her wish fulfilled, they naturally had to return.

“No!” Hu Niu wrapped her arms around Ling Han. At present, she was tall and had long legs, so this bear hug abruptly drove Ling Han’s head into her breasts, yet she was completely unconcerned. “Niu wants to play with Ling Han!”

Play! Play! Play!

Lu Hairong was speechless. While this Young Imperial Empress had the mark of great dao left behind by their last Imperial Empress, and was practically capable of advancing into Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier lying down, this personality of hers... really did not look the slightest bit like an elite’s.

Thankfully, this was the Eastern Celestial Realm, and they had brought a rare treasure with them, so they could conceal their destiny, preventing the predictions of other elites. It should be fine as long as they took extra caution.

Then just let Young Imperial Empress play around for a while. Otherwise, this girl was definitely capable of doing something more unthinkable.

Thinking that, she did not make any further protest. In any case, she would just protect her from the shadows.

Additionally, she also had another important mission, and that was to watch over Ling Han to prevent him from bringing ruin to their little princess.

“Brother Yan, then I will take my leave first. Allow me to return and make some preparations.” Someone began to bid farewell to Yan Xianlu.

“Me too!”

“Me too!”

Many of them wanted to first return to their own home bases and make some preparations. After all, they were heading to a natural Mystery Realm. Furthermore, they would be contesting with the prodigies of Wide Prosperity Heaven. All of them could possibly be incredibly terrifying opponents for them.

They respectfully bowed towards Lu Hairong, and then walked backwards and left[1].

Ling Han looked towards Old Demon Blood Shadow, anger rising in his heart.

“Old bastard, you call yourself an Ascending Origin Tier? You actually wanted to launch a sneak attack on me. Is there anyone more shameless than you?” He strode over. “At first, I had planned to kill a shameless old bastard like you only after advancing into the Ascending Origin Tier. However, from the looks of things, you would not be able to live until then anyways. Let us battle now then!”

Old Demon Blood Shadow’s vitality was extremely withered, and he would only be able to live for 100 or so years at most. In fact, it could even be just a few decades.

Yin soul?

He could match that!

Ling Han presently was equivalent to Yang soul, but for a monarch tier like himself, how could it be that he did not have tier-surpassing battle prowess?

Old Demon Blood Shadow stared fixedly at Ling Han, showing a murderous expression.

With a Celestial King here, he definitely would not be able to get any benefit, but now that Ling Han had delivered himself straight onto his doorstep... this was a chance for him! He could capture Ling Han, and then use him to blackmail the Celestial King into handing over some super Celestial pill to recover the damage to his life force!

And in this way, he would be able to continue living.

When this thought popped up, he could not hold back any longer. Boom, a Blood Shadow spread out, forming a mist behind him, and it was continuously vibrating like it had a life of its own.

His cultivation level had indeed dropped, but Ling Han was really too arrogant, actually wanting to match him, a Yin soul, when he himself was only a Severing Mundane Tier. It should be known that there was a major tier separating the two of them!
