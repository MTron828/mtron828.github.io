2876 Calling Reinforcements

“And this saber as well…” Zhou Heng retrieved a broken saber, and handed it to Ling Han. “Sure enough, the ability of Seventh Tier elites is extraordinary. Even with the three of us working together, it still took a huge amount of work to refine the murderous aura within it and make it gather together. If it’s activated, it will now unleash a murderous aura in a set direction.

“If you unleash it by surprise, even Fifth Tier elites will be slightly affected. However, only slightly.”

Lin Xiaoyang added, “In fact, this is mainly because this saber is broken, causing it to lose its previous might. Otherwise, even us three wouldn’t be able to suppress it.”

Complete Seventh Tier precious tools would contain the willpower of Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, so it was only natural that they could suppress the heavens. Now, however, this saber was already broken, and the Heavenly Venerate willpower inside it had already vanished. It was because of this that the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates were able to refine it.

Ling Han accepted the saber. “Thank you, Seniors.”

He also retrieved some items that were wrapped in stone, and handed them to Zhou Heng and the others. These were the Heavenly Venerable Seals that he had obtained. He, Hu Niu, and the Empress had already mastered them, so he was now giving them away as a friendly gesture.

Just how valuable was this broken saber? Even Xin Qihu had especially had someone stay here to search for it. However, Zhou Heng and the others had returned it to him after spending a huge amount of effort to refine it. In comparison, the three of them were far nobler in manner.

Zhou Heng and the others laughed heartily as they accepted the Heavenly Venerable Seals. They used the Complete Heavens Ring to observe these Heavenly Venerable Seals first, only keeping them if they didn’t already possess them. Otherwise, if they directly absorbed all of them into their minds, and only severed them if they were already present, this would end up damaging their bodies.

After they finished, there were still three Heavenly Venerable Seals remaining. These were Heavenly Venerable Seals that all three of them already possessed.

Ling Han accepted them back. He would leave them for his son and daughter.

“Seniors, do you reckon there’s another dimension under this dimension?” he suddenly asked.

“We’ve also considered this possibility. However, the resources here are yet to be fully split, so we haven’t set out to investigate this, either,” Zhou Heng replied. “If there exists another dimension under this dimension… That will truly be a big matter.”

Dimensions overlapping one on top of another… This was something that had never occurred in the past. Just what in the world had caused this?

To say nothing else, just the overlap of these two dimensions was already impossible to explain. Theoretically speaking, only the combined strength of several hundred Seventh Tier elites would be able to forcefully overlap a transcendent dimension with a high-level dimension.

However, from past to present, had there ever been this many Seventh Tier elites?

Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, so how had several hundred Seventh Tier elites suddenly vanished without a trace? How was this possible?!

“Perhaps an earth-shattering secret that can shake the foundations of the Genesis World is hidden in this place!” Chu Hao said slowly.

After chatting for a while, Ling Han took his leave. He toyed around with the broken saber, familiarizing himself with how to use it.

This was very simple. As long as he activated it with his fundamental power, he would be able to unleash the might of the broken saber. However, because it was broken, it couldn’t unleash the might of Seventh Tier elites. Instead, it could only unleash power equivalent to Ling Han’s. However, this saber had killed far too many elites before, so as long as he pointed it in a certain direction and activated it a second time with his willpower, it would unleash a devastating murderous aura that could attack one’s mind.

“This isn’t enough to dispose of Fifth Tier elites. However, if I unleash it by surprise, it will be enough to buy me some time to escape,” Ling Han murmured to himself.

He had killed Xin Qihu’s subordinates, so Xin Qihu definitely wouldn’t let things slide just like that.

If they were at the same cultivation level, would Ling Han be afraid of Xin Qihu? However, this person was at the Fourth Tier, and his battle prowess had already soared to the Fifth Tier. Right now, Ling Han was definitely no match for this kind of opponent.

He needed some ways to protect himself.

Ling Han decided to stay put for the moment. For the past few years, he, the Empress, and Hu Niu had all relied on Great Herbs to elevate their cultivation. This wasn’t something they had cultivated themselves, so it was inevitable that their cultivation was slightly unstable.

Thus, they all decided to enter seclusion to stabilize their cultivation.

This was especially the case with the Empress and Hu Niu. They still yearned to break through the barrier of their current cultivation level to ascend to a higher tier.

As for Ling Han, even though he had already reached the peak stage of the Second Tier, he was actually still some way off from breaking through. Moreover, there was a large number of Powers of Dimension inside his body, so even the final step before the breakthrough would require a lengthy amount of time.

This was inevitable. This was the price for strength.

Several hundred million years later, Hu Niu and the Empress advanced one after the other, with one ascending to the Fourth Tier and one ascending to the Third Tier.

The Fourth Tier was a dividing line. Combining all of the Heavenly Venerates in the myriad dimensions, the number of Heavenly Venerates under the Fifth Tier would be in the hundreds of thousands. This was a terrifying number. However, from the Fifth Tier onward, this number would start to drop drastically.

Right now, there were around 1000 Fifth Tier elites and around 100 Sixth Tier elites. There were even fewer Seventh Tier elites, with the total number possible to count on two hands.

The reason for this was simple. From the Fourth Tier onward, the repulsion from the fundamental power would become far too powerful. Out of 10 Fourth Tier elites, nine would fail to detect new fundamental particles. Thus, how could they communicate with them and use them to advance?

This was also why the orange-colored Great Herbs were so valuable—these were herbs that could allow Heavenly Venerates to detect fundamental particles. If one wanted to advance from the Fifth Tier to the Sixth Tier, one would most likely need to rely on crimson-colored Great Herbs. However, up until now, no such Great Herbs had been found.

Ling Han also stabilized his cultivation. However, he was still far away from being able to advance. If he wanted to slowly cultivate by himself, to say nothing of one epoch, this would at least take him 100,000,000 – 200,000,000 years.

He still needed a huge amount of supremely valuable Great Herbs. If he managed to obtain them, he would merely need to enter seclusion a few more times to stabilize his cultivation.

“Father!”

“Grandfather!”

Ling Han exited seclusion, only to see Ling Jianxue and Ling Feifan walking over.

“You two finally know to come back?” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. After going out on an adventure, this father-and-son pair had already forgotten about their father/grandfather.

“Hehe.” Ling Jianxue and his son both chuckled as they recounted their experiences from the past years.

Ling Jianxue had already advanced to the Second Tier, while Ling Feifan had only just become a Heavenly Venerate. The genes of the Ling Clan were far too powerful. However, this bloodline advantage only lasted for two generations, with Ling Feifan’s children being nowhere near as freakish. They still had yet to become Celestial Kings.

This great-grandson had been born several hundred million years ago. At that time, both Ling Han and Ling Feifan had been elsewhere. Thus, Ling Han had never met this great-grandson before.

In any case, his descendants would naturally have their own fates and fortunes. Thus, he wouldn’t stick his nose into every single matter.

This was what Ling Han told himself. He pushed away the thoughts of wanting to personally raise his great-grandson, and he simply asked a little about his situation.

This great-grandson was called Ling Tianhua, and he possessed a fairly decent cultivation aptitude. However, it was only decent, and not freakish. To say nothing of Ling Han, Ling Jianxue, and Ling Feifan, he was still lagging far, far behind just compared to those of the same generation as him.

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle at himself. If his bloodline could remain powerful for generation after generation, then wouldn’t the descendants of Seventh Tier elites all become Heavenly Venerates?

“If there’s anything you want, just say it out loud,” Ling Han said as he glanced at Ling Jianxue and Ling Feifan.

“Father, what are you trying to say? Are you saying that we wouldn’t visit you otherwise?” Ling Jianxue hurriedly said.

Ling Han stood up, saying, “I’m incredibly busy. If there’s nothing important, then I’ll continue to cultivate in seclusion.”

“Wait, wait, wait!” Ling Feifan exclaimed, hurriedly dragging Ling Han back. He then looked at Ling Jianxue, and said, “Father, what did I tell you? Grandpa is so brilliant and mighty, so of course he’ll be able to see right through us!”

“Enough with the flattery,” Ling Han said.

“Hehe, it’s like this,” Ling Jianxue said. “While we were traveling around, we discovered a large mine that contains 10 veins of ores. However, a bunch of other people came before we could start digging.

“Our strength was similar, so choosing to fight would only have resulted in both sides being heavily wounded. Thus, we decided to settle things through a competition.

“We’ll hold 10 battles, with each battle determining the ownership of a vein of ore.
