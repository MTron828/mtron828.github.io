3029 Taking Down the Sign

Even in a street brawl, it was an unspoken rule not to hit the face. The signboard was like the face of their place of enlightenment. If it got taken down, then even if they managed to win the fight, how would the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment continue operating?

No one would be able to endure such humiliation.

As such, the Celestial Kings were completely enraged.

Chen Ruijing and the others looked at Ling Han. The latter gave them a nod, and said, “Take it down!”

He didn’t have to hold back against Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains. On the contrary, the more he could piss him off, the better.

“Yes, Master!” his disciples acknowledged the command.

They quickly flew out towards the place of enlightenment.

“Stop!” the Celestial Kings yelled. If they did let someone take down their signboard, how would they be able to show their face from now on?

Ning Haixin casually pressed down. A First Tier Heavenly Venerate’s strength was tremendous. Under the immense pressure, the Celestial Kings felt their chests tightening and their movements being completely sealed.

“Haha. Uncle Rabbit is here!” The rabbit rushed forward quickly, and said, “Let’s see who can take down the signboard first!”

“You’re on!” The old ginseng accepted the challenge.

“Ao, ao, ao!” The stone golem tucked in its limbs, and formed a massive ball of rock, rolling forwards. The sheer weight of its body created many deep crevices in earth along its path. It almost seemed like a small river.

Little Qing was also soaring through the sky like a bolt of lightning.

The large black dog cracked his neck, and said, “How childish. What’s so fun in that?!” He only had a condescending look for a quick second before lunging forward at full speed, and saying, “Grandpa Dog is number one!”

Whoosh! He was a Second Tier, so even if he moved later than the others, he still got to it before them. In a quick flash, he was right underneath the place of enlightenment. He then leaped upwards, biting on the signboard and tearing it down.

“Grandpa Dog is so cool!”

“Grandpa Dog is so awesome!”

“Grandpa Dog has a big chest!”

The rabbit, old ginseng, and stoneman spoke respectively.

“Can it with the big chest! Do you even know how to compliment someone?” The large black dog kicked the rock golem, causing it to roll back from whence it came.

The old ginseng took the signboard. It was a gold plaque inscribed with the words “Shatter Mountains’ place of enlightenment.” There definitely was an impressive stature to it.

“You little brats, the signboard is in your Grandpa Ginseng’s hands. Try and take it from me if you can!” it taunted the Celestial Kings.

Even though the Celestial Kings were furious, they couldn’t move a finger. Under the suppression of a Heavenly Venerate, it would be surprising if they could.

After all, not everyone was like Ling Han.

The large black dog took the signboard, and had a self-absorbed look on his face.

There was no blaming him. Previously, he was suppressed by the five ultimate elites. The large black dog was caught and imprisoned for a long time. Naturally, he had a bit of resentment.

Ling Han smiled. “The signboard is in my hands now. I’ll be in Feng Lai Inn the next few days. If you want it back, you’re more than welcome to come for me.”

He was intentionally hiding his identity. As such, the Celestial Kings could only hear the message, but not the identity of who sent it.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han turned around and left.

Shatter Mountains wasn’t here. It was pointless to dally any longer. After all, they already took the signboard down. This was like a slap in the face to Shatter Mountains.

“So much for a place of enlightenment. Not a single one of them was capable of putting up a fight!” the old ginseng intentionally said loudly. “Sigh, it’s so lonely being unbeatable!”

“Challenge us if you dare, puny rabbit bastards!” The stoneman had also taken up some bad habits.

Pa! It immediately got kicked in the face by the rabbit.

“What’d you do that for?” the rock golem said begrudgingly with a confused expression.

The rabbit stomped its foot, and said, “You’re the rabbit bastard!”

“Oh!” The stoneman quickly understood that it had used a word that was taboo for the rabbit. It quickly rephrased, “You dog bastards—”

Pa! This time it got kicked out by the large black dog.

“What an idiot. You can’t say a single thing right.” The old ginseng was enjoying the situation.

Up in the sky, Little Qing flew even higher, looking at the rest of them condescendingly. It was too embarrassed to call these guys its teammates.

The way they were arguing clearly had no respect for the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment. The Celestial Kings were utterly enraged, and wanted to fight them right away.

But what could they do?

They could only watch as Ling Han and the others left.

“Everyone, are we just going to sit here?” someone asked.

“What else can we do? There’s definitely a Heavenly Venerate among them. Even if we all joined forces, we’d only be marching to our deaths.”

“That’s strange. Since they’re a Heavenly Venerate, they should be aware of how strong Lord Shatter Mountains is. Why would they still choose to provoke us?”

“Why don’t we ask help from a Heavenly Venerate as well? If we can take back the signboard, we can still save some face.”

“Hmph, do you think a Heavenly Venerate is going to come just because you asked?”

“I happen to be acquainted with a Heavenly Venerate. If we ask for a favor in Lord Shatter Mountains’ name, I believe he will be willing to lend a hand.”

“That’s right. Even though we might not be influential enough to ask for a favor, Lord Shatter Mountains definitely is.”

“Let’s go!”

***

Ling Han and the others went straight back, but didn’t meet up with the women. Instead, they stopped by a nearby town. There was an inn here, which was the Feng Lai Inn that Ling Han had mentioned.

They all stayed in the inn. Given that everyone was a big eater, they ordered many delicious dishes, and began their feast.

“When do you guys think Shatter Mountains will come?” the old ginseng asked as it drank a flagon of wine. It didn’t drink with its mouth, but rather it extended its ginseng roots into the flagon, and absorbed its contents directly with its tendrils. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I don’t think he’ll be able to tolerate such humiliation. He should be here soon,” the large black dog opined.

“Not necessarily.” Ding Ping shook his head. “They might not report this incident to their superiors. If I’m guessing correctly, they will want to take matters into their own hands.”

“What can a few loser Celestial Kings like them do?” the old ginseng said with contempt. It seemed to have forgotten that it was also a Celestial King.

“They might be able to ask a Heavenly Venerate for help,” Jiuyao said.

“Yeah!” Chen Ruijing, Jiang Yuefeng, and the others nodded.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was yawning out of boredom. He was training his mental strength in the earthly realm in hopes of breaking through to the Sixth Tier sooner. He wasn’t too concerned about what the Celestial Kings were planning. Either way, Shatter Mountains would eventually show up before him.

The longer he waited, the more exhilarating it would be to finally do battle. He might just use that as a catalyst for his breakthrough.

Everyone drank to their heart’s content and got intoxicated. A normal wine would naturally not have such an effect, but Ling Han had used a Celestial King Great Herb as an ingredient to create this celestial wine. As such, it was more than capable of getting Celestial Kings drunk as well.

The only ones still sober were the large black dog and Ning Haixin. The large black dog had been slowly sipping the alcohol, whereas Ning Haixin simply stood quietly behind Ling Han, and obediently served her master.

Her initial intent had not changed after all this time. It was the same from when she was at the Severing Mundane until now, despite having risen to a First Tier.

In less than half a day’s time, a crowd started to gather in front of the inn. Quite a number of them were Celestial King elites.

The large black dog immediately stood up, and barked, “Hm, are you guys looking for a fight?”

“Don’t be hasty.” Ling Han shook his head. Even after rising to Heavenly Venerable Tier, this big dog was still so impatient and easily agitated.

“Master, we wish to become your disciples!” A voice echoed from outside.
