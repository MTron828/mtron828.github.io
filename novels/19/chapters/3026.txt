3027 Despicable Ginseng

The Fourth Heaven Celestial King’s face turned livid. He had to be an idiot to want to pretend to be the old ginseng’s relative.

However, his surname was indeed Dang, and his first name was Shen. In front of everyone, could he change his surname and first name? Could he be so shameless?

Damn it, he had unexpectedly crossed paths with this despicable ginseng.

“You’d better not fall into my hands, or I’ll definitely stew you!” he said viciously to the old ginseng.

The old ginseng stretched out a few ginseng roots and made a disdainful expression. “You go eat sh*t!”

Ling Han was also extremely speechless. At his level, there was actually such a farce.

However, it didn’t matter. In any case, they were here to crash the party, so he’d let it mess around as it liked.

Ling Han said to the large black dog, “You’ve led another one astray!”

“Pei!” The large black dog jumped up, pointed at Ling Han, and said, “Little Han, don’t slander Grandpa Dog. That old ginseng is clearly a crook, extremely devious. Did Grandpa Dog still need to lead it astray?”

Ling Han sighed. Even the large black dog was busy trying to distance himself from the old ginseng. It could be seen to what extent the old ginseng had “infuriated both humans and gods.”

When Dang Shen attacked, he was filled with pent-up anger. He wanted to defeat Kang Xiuyuan, drag the old ginseng out, and use the cruelest torture in the world to torment him. Then, as the final step, he would stew it to make soup and drink up the entire concoction. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Brother Dang, you must put more effort, and take down this despicable ginseng!”

“Fight for our place of enlightenment!”

“Damn, this demonic ginseng is too despicable!”

All the Celestial Kings in the place of enlightenment were also enraged. The despicableness of the old ginseng had successfully provoked everyone’s anger.

There was no lack of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings here. When every one of them exerted their auras over, it made the old ginseng’s skin to feel as if it had been sliced by a knife, causing it great agony.

It became scared and retreated repeatedly. Then, it hugged the large black dog’s leg and became arrogant again. “What are you all shouting about? If you have the ability, come fight my Grandpa Dog!”

The large black dog hurriedly kicked his leg. “Get lost! Hurry up and get lost! Don’t hug Grandpa Dog’s noble thigh!”

“No, Grandpa Dog, your thigh is too thick. Let little Ginseng hug it for a while longer[1]!” The old ginseng was shameless to the core.

Everyone was dumbfounded. How could there be such a despicable existence? Its despicableness simply shot through the roof, breaking records.

Dang Shen repeatedly attacked Kang Xiuyuan.

Kang Xiuyuan was also an alchemist. With a flick of his index finger, a vermillion pill flew out. It trembled with a violent force and immediately exploded.

Having learned a lesson from his predecessor, Dang Shen naturally wouldn’t repeat the same mistake. He was already prepared, and immediately flew up to avoid the area of the explosion.

However, this alchemical pill didn’t detonate into a black hole. Instead, it transformed into a huge mud puddle, causing Dang Shen’s body to immediately slow down.

The Regulations turned into visible threads that continuously bound Dang Shen.

Kang Xiuyuan attacked. He wasn’t affected at all, and naturally gained the upper hand.

Ling Han nodded. Although his two disciples’ natural talent in martial arts wasn’t that great, they were quite accomplished in alchemy.

Not to mention Chen Ruijing’s black hole alchemical pills, Kang Xiuyuan’s mud alchemical pills were also very useful. Both of them had incorporated Regulations into their alchemical pills and walked their own unique paths.

Of course, both of them had sought guidance from Ling Han and received crucial pointers, but they were still worthy of praise.

Everyone could clearly see that Kang Xiuyuan’s battle prowess wasn’t very high, and he could only be ranked as average or below average among his peers. In fact, he might even be ranked slightly lower than average. But who asked Dang Shen’s strength to be weakened?

After barely holding on for a few dozen moves, Dang Shen was completely defeated, and the old ginseng pointed a finger at his face to show off.

“Who else?” The old ginseng had such an arrogant look on his face that it made people want to hit it. “Bring it on. If Grandpa Ginseng says the word ‘afraid,’ just treat me as your father, and I won’t be your grandfather anymore.”

F*ck!

With just one sentence from him, everyone became so infuriated that they wanted nothing more than to rush forward and hack the old ginseng into 1,000 pieces.

“What? Not willing to admit defeat? So what if you’re not willing to admit defeat?” The old ginseng jumped more and more as he pointed at the crowd. “It’s not that Grandpa Ginseng looks down on all of you, but you all are just a bunch of trash!”

Boom! All the Celestial Kings were infuriated, and their fury became solidified.

The large black dog smirked evilly, and suddenly kicked the old ginseng. Pa, the old ginseng was flung away, and he fell right in front of the Celestial Kings.

The old ginseng crawled to its feet. When it raised its head, all it saw was the Celestial Kings’ murderously furious expressions.

It instantly squeezed out a flattering smile, and suddenly jumped up, pointing at Ling Han and the others. “Trash! You trash actually dare to threaten Grandpa Ginseng and speak ill of these lords behind me! Now that I’ve obtained my freedom, I don’t need to be threatened by you anymore!”

The old ginseng turned around and bowed to the Celestial Kings. “Greetings from little Ginseng, my lords.”

Everyone was dumbfounded. How could there be such a shameless guy?

“I’m going to kill it!” One of the Celestial Kings couldn’t hold back any longer, and he swung his fist toward the old ginseng.

“Save me!” The old ginseng hurriedly burrowed into the ground. Before he had obtained his abilities, he was already adept at escaping. Now that he had advanced into the Celestial King Tier, his battle prowess was still mediocre, and he was at the bottom of the First Heaven, but his ability to escape had greatly improved accordingly; it was truly quite extraordinary.

It dug itself into the soil, and when it came out again, it was already by Ling Han’s side.

“Come on, you guys come and get me!” The old ginseng started jumping around again.

“Bastard!” At least a dozen Celestial Kings rushed out at the same time.

“I’ll do it!” Yun Yongwang jumped out and swept out with his palm, attacking those Celestial Kings simultaneously.

Peng, peng, peng. The energy of his palm was incomparably intense, and he sent those Celestial Kings flying with a single strike.

“So powerful!” a Celestial King exclaimed in shock. They were both at Fifth Heaven, but Yun Yongwang was unbelievably powerful.

Among those Celestial Kings, at least four of them were at Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier. However, even with so many of them joining forces, they were still no match against him.

This group of people were all very powerful. Each of them had the strength to crush their peers. No wonder they dared to come and crash the party.

However, so what if they were more powerful? This was an ultimate elite’s place of enlightenment. If they really provoked Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, no matter how many people were to come, or who had come, only death awaited them.

Yun Yongwang was full of confidence as he waved his hand. “I’m Yun Yongwang. Please provide guidance!”

He had cultivated the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll and the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and was adept at both offense and defense, so he was naturally impressive and awesome to the extreme.

In the past, Ling Han had been unable to teach them the Heavenly Venerate Technique, but now it was not a big deal. Furthermore, so much time had passed, and thus disciples like Yun Yongwang, Jiang Yuefeng and the others, who were proficient in martial arts, naturally had all grasped it.

Yun Yongwang let out a long howl and took the initiative to attack.

Peng, peng, peng. His entire body emitted a faint golden light, and he seemed to be invincible. As he channeled the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, his strength increased by more than 100 times, far exceeding the level of Fifth Heaven.

Bodies were sent flying one after another. There was not a single one capable of being his match, and even Celestial Kings of the same cultivation level could only be sent flying with a single strike from him.

In just a period of a few breaths, no one could stand in front of Yun Yongwang anymore.

“Good battle.” He cupped his fists.

“At least you have some ability. No wonder you dare to cause trouble!” A Seventh Heaven Celestial King walked out. “However, don’t forget that this is Lord Shatter Mountains’ place of enlightenment!”

“Let me, Lan Ruoping, deal with you!”
