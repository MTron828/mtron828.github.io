Chapter 3518 - 3518: Strange Blood Rain

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“En?” The old man in green had just stretched out his hand, yet forcibly stopped himself.

He raised his head, only to see that it was starting to drizzle.

Lightning struck, wind blew, and rain fell. Originally, there was nothing strange about this, but this rain was strange, because it was red in colour.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Blood rain?

Blood rain fell from the skies; this was a kind of warning.

“Yi, where did the bloody water come from?”

“Your face is covered with blood.”

“You too!”

“What, the rain from the skies is actually a rain of red blood!

The people below were all stunned, all of them panicking. Blood rain was falling from the skies; this was a sign of great calamity. Could it be that these thirteen elites would bring bad luck?

The white-bearded old man and the other 12 elites also frowned, looking confused.

They were completely confused as to why it was raining blood. This was indeed a sign of great misfortune.

“This blood?” The expression of the old man in green suddenly changed drastically, and he suddenly flew down from the skies, “Let’s go!” He was the first to rush into a nearby house, and used this to dodge the rain.

With this call from him, the expressions of the other twelve elites also changed drastically, and they similarly flew indoors.

Seeing how these elites were all so terrified, this naturally caused a panic-stricken riot. Everyone found a place to hide from the rain, as if it was poisonous.

Ling Han was still fine. He had been standing at the door all this while, and there was a shelter above him, so he naturally had not been drenched by the rain.

“Father, this rain is extremely evil!” Second Baby said. She activated her ocular technique and looked at the sky. “That old geezer stimulated the power of lightning just now, and it was as if he accidentally opened a spatial passageway. This bloody water gushed out from there and fused into the rainwater.”

At first, it was very normal to have a little drizzle, but now that it had fused with blood, that was a completely different story.

Ling Han nodded. If it weren’t strange, there was no way that a Core Formation

Tier cultivator would be so evasive. The old man in green definitely wasn’t faking his fear. Instead, it was a fear that came from the depths of his heart. “That’s Corpse Blood,” Second Baby said. “It’s at least several hundred years old, and it’s filled with resentment that can’t be dispersed. It’s like a curse. If one touches it, they’ll be plagued by misfortune.

Ling Han was surprised. Could this be the pile of corpses he had seen in that strange place of the Young Dragon Trial?

To say nothing of the impossibility, this connected to a separate dimension, and just happened to be there?

Kuang, thunder rang out endlessly, and the rain began to become heavier, as if

it was pouring.

Ling Han took out a piece of clothing from his Spatial Spirit Tool and placed it on his head. He then hurriedly ran inside. The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and the area at the door was small, allowing him to hide from the light rain. However, he couldn’t do the same under strong winds and heavy rain.

He arrived in the main hall, and Xuanyuan Dingguo and the others naturally followed him back. Thankfully, there were too many towering trees in their department, which had the effect of sheltering them. Only Tian Chi was drenched in a few drops of blood.

“When will this rain stop?” Ling Han turned towards the skies outside. Endless blood rained down, and the whole sky was a strange red colour.

Now, he could only wait.

“Ah!” A scream filled with terror rang out. Ling Han looked over, only to see that Shi Yiqing had collapsed onto the ground, crawling backwards on all fours, her face filled with terror.

Ling Han followed her gaze, and saw that she was presently looking at Tian Chi. And on Tian Chi’s back, there lay a person whose hair was disheveled. It could not be distinguished whether it was male or female. More importantly, it only had half its body, as if it had popped out of Tian Chi’s body.

How could this not be frightening?

Even Ling Han felt his heart constrict, and an indescribable chill rose up in

him.

The others also looked over. Seeing such a scene, they were all so scared that they took a few steps back.

Tian Chi’s condition was not right either. His head was drooping, as if he had lost consciousness.

Right at this moment, the half-human suddenly raised its head. Its hair parted, revealing an incredibly pale face. There was a sword stabbed between its brows, and blood was still gushing out.

This was a woman’s face. It looked like she was crying, yet was not. It was a smile that did not look like a smile.

A coldness assailed them, and everyone felt a chill run down their spines, making them panic.

Ling Han activated his ocular technique, instantly seeing something that others couldn’t.

This half of the woman was not a physical body, but rather formed from a strange energy. However, it was vivid and lifelike, and could not be distinguished with the naked eye.

And the source of this was actually… the blood rain that had stained Tian Chi. How inauspicious. He had only touched a few drops, and he had actually been possessed by a ghost?

“Ah-” Tian Chi suddenly released a loud roar. His eyes snapped open, and they were actually completely pale. His pupils could not be seen, and only the whites of his eyes remained.

He used the whites of his eyes to look around, and said, “I hate! I hate! I hate!”

Shua, he leaped out, and charged towards Shi Yiqing, “Die!”

He threw a punch with astonishing power.

Hu Er hurriedly approached, and began an intense battle with him.

Peng, peng, peng! A fierce battle instantly erupted between the two of them.

Hu Er was a two-star genius, so logically speaking, he should be able to easily suppress Tian Chi. However, the present Tian Chi was extremely strange. His body was actually unafraid of heavy blows, and when they landed on him, they would only release muffled pu, pu, pu sounds, but could not injure him in the slightest.

This was equivalent to being invincible, and added with the fact that Tian Chi’s fist technique was also quite amazing, only defending and not attacking, this instantly caused Hu Er to feel a headache coming on.

Ling Han saw very clearly that the blood on Tian Chi’s body was slowly dispersing.

Tian Chi’s change should have been caused by the bloody water, then when the bloody water disappeared, his condition should have recovered as well.

As expected, another while passed, and the ghostly shadow on Tian Chi’s body began to fade. Then, with a sudden somersault, he collapsed onto the ground without any prior warning. Hu Er had not expected this, and did not manage to completely withdraw his attack in time. Immediately, it landed on Tian Chi’s behind.

“Ao!” Tian Chi released a terrible cry, and suddenly jumped up, hugging his behind. His eyes swept over, focusing on Hu Er.

“You damn transvestite, you actually dare to have ideas about my behind, I’ll fight you to the death!” He charged out, and engaged in another fierce battle with Hu Er, but this time, he had obviously returned to normal.

He had only battled for a short while, and then he collapsed to the ground, his vitality completely exhausted.

This should be the aftereffects brought about by the bloody water, but it was unknown whether it was because of the ghost, or the opposite effect of his previous “invulnerability”.

Ling Han looked once more at the skies, and saw that the rain was already lessening. It would probably completely stop in a few more minutes. He had not guessed wrongly. In just three minutes, the clouds dispersed and the rain cleared, and the skies became clear again.

Just how chaotic would it be outside?

Previously, Tian Chi had only been drenched in a few drops of blood rain, and he had already been possessed by a ghost, and gone mad like that. There was no lack of people who had been completely drenched outside, so what could happen?

He leaped out, and had not even reached the main doors, when with a bang, the wall was forcefully blasted open, and a person crashed over like a cannonball.

Ling Han looked over, and couldn’t help but inhale sharply. That was one of the 13 Core Formation Tier elites, but his body was presently entwined with ghostly shadows. All of them had broken arms and legs, and some didn’t even have a head.

So what if he was in the Core Formation Tier? He was completely controlled, and as if he had gone mad, he jumped up again and charged out. In the next instant, he had already soared into the air, and was battling extremely intensely with his opponent..
