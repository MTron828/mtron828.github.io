Chapter 1886: Huge Gamble

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This elder was naturally Alchemist Zi Cheng. There was an imposing expression in his eyes as he gazed at Ling Han, and it was as if just his gaze alone would be able to suppress all matter. He was indescribably mighty.

He was an Ascending Origin Tier elite, after all, so he was naturally as powerful as could be.

Ling Han’s mind whirred, yet his expression remained unchanging. Instead, he smiled calmly, and said, “Senior, I don’t quite understand.”

“I invited you time and time again, yet you declined my invitations with all kinds of excuses. You seem to view yourself in even higher regard than me?” Alchemist Zi Cheng said. His expression was solemn, and a projection of the great dao started to materialize behind him, transforming into all kinds of different shapes and forms. This was a projection that was filled with imposing might.

This old man was even stronger than Old Demon Blood Shadow.

Even though Ling Han was too weak to compare their auras, he had a nagging feeling that Alchemist Zi Cheng was more powerful.

He smiled, and said, “I’ve been treated unfairly!”

“Oh? You beat up my alchemy apprentice, yet you’re claiming that you’ve been treated unfairly?” Alchemist Zi Cheng couldn’t help but chuckle in extreme anger.

However, Ling Han remained extremely calm and composed. If Alchemist Zi Cheng genuinely wanted to punish him, would he speak so much nonsense with him? To a Four-Star Alchemist, Ling Han was nothing more than a Severing Mundane Tier cultivator and a One-Star Alchemist, regardless of how freakish he was. He was nothing in their eyes.

They could kill him with a single thought.

Now, however, Alchemist Zi Cheng was actually speaking so much nonsense with him. Combined with his previous speculation, Ling Han was even more certain of himself now.

“I’ve indeed been treated unfairly,” he said. “Moreover, I feel extremely aggrieved and furious!”

“Heh, you’re becoming more and more wanton!” Alchemist Zi Cheng said with a cold smile.

Ling Han remained composed as he said, “A measly alchemy apprentice actually dared to shout commands at me, a One-Star Alchemist. What happened to the rules and regulations? To say nothing of other One-Star Alchemists, even Two-Star Alchemists and Three-Star Alchemists remained silent! It was as if they were already accustomed to this. I find this to be... unacceptable!”

“Oh? So that’s your reason for beating up my alchemy apprentice?” Alchemist Zi Cheng asked in a calm voice. There was a profound expression on his face.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “Indeed.”

“How audacious of you. Have you heard of this phrase before? Before beating a dog, one also needs to consider their master,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said in a menacing voice. A terrifying killing intent radiated from his body, and he immediately transformed into a petrifying demon king. He lightly slammed the table, and Ling Han shuddered even though there was no noise. It was as if heaven and earth were about to collapse.

This was the might of an Ascending Origin Tier elite. Each of their actions could affect one’s mind.

“Seeing that you’re a prodigy, I’ll make an exception and give you a chance,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said. He paused for a moment before continuing, “I can spare you if you immediately kowtow and apologize to my alchemy apprentice.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Han didn’t hesitate before replying, “I can be killed, but I can’t be humiliated. Moreover, I did nothing wrong, so why do I need to apologize?”

“Haha, I’ve lived for trillions of years, yet this is the first time I’ve come across such an audacious brat. Since you insist, you can die with your measly dignity intact!” Alchemist Zi Cheng immediately lashed out with his palm.

Boom!

His palm transformed into a colossal flaming hand that was shrouded in symbols of the great dao.

To Severing Mundane Tier cultivators, this was nothing short of a palm of death. To say nothing of facing it head-on, just glancing at it could instill them with boundless terror. Those who were more cowardly might directly collapse upon seeing it.

Moreover, this palm strike was extremely slow, and it was as if it wanted to drown Ling Han in terror before taking his life.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back and stood as straight as a sword.

If this palm struck him, he would definitely have no time to enter the Black Tower. Right now, he was taking a huge gamble. He was gambling on his understanding of Alchemist Zi Cheng. If he lost this gamble, he would have to pay with his life.

In reality, Ling Han didn’t need to take this gamble. Since he had the Black Tower, he would naturally be safe if he entered it. Of course, this was unless he came across a Celestial King. However, the more powerful he became, the less he wanted to rely on the Black Tower. At the very least, he didn’t want to rely on it when he didn’t need to.

“If you kneel and beg for forgiveness, you still have a chance to survive!” Alchemist Zi Cheng said. His voice boomed like thunder, almost rupturing Ling Han’s eardrums. His words more so pierced into his Dao Heart, carrying with it a profound and unstoppable might.

Ling Han didn’t reply, and he simply remained standing straight and proud.

Boom!

The palm landed, and the entire seventh peak shuddered.

A devastating shock wave swept past, and Ling Han’s figure gradually reappeared. He was completely unscathed.

This wasn’t because Ling Han was heaven-defyingly powerful. He naturally couldn’t block the attack of an Ascending Origin Tier elite. Instead, it was because the palm strike had avoided him at the last possible moment. Otherwise, he would have already been dead. Moreover, not a single shred of his corpse would have remained.

“Hahaha!” Alchemist Zi Cheng chortled with laughter. His killing intent instantly vanished, and his laughter was as joyous as could be. It was as if his mood had suddenly improved to the extreme.

Although Ling Han’s back was drenched in cold sweat, his expression still remained calm and unchanging. He knew that he had gambled right.

Anyhow, even if he had gambled wrong, it wasn’t as if he would truly die. After all, he could channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and rise from the ashes, giving him another chance. Moreover, doing so would even dispel the Black Murderous Curse.

However, it was best not to use this kind of resurrection technique. After all, such techniques couldn’t be used many times. Following his advance in cultivation, he would only obtain an extra one or two opportunities to channel Rising From the Ashes. Moreover, he viewed the Black Murderous Curse as a kind of grindstone to temper himself with, so he didn’t want to dispel it any time soon.

“Brat, you’re truly audacious!” Alchemist Zi Cheng said.

Contrary to before, Ling Han became much more respectful. He clasped his hands in respect, and said, “Thank you for sparing me, Senior!”

A look of appreciation spread across Alchemist Zi Cheng’s face. Those who only knew how to be rude and unreasonable had no future. However, Ling Han knew when to be tough, and he also knew when to be respectful. Where he needed to be tough, he would be extremely tough. Where he needed to be respectful, he would ensure that he followed all of the proper etiquette. Alchemist Zi Cheng was extremely satisfied with his performance.

After so many years, he had finally found a prodigy who suited his tastes.

“You already guessed that I wouldn’t kill you?” Alchemist Zi Cheng asked.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “I was 70-80 percent sure.”

“But you weren’t 100 percent sure. Moreover, what if you guessed wrong?” Alchemist Zi Cheng asked.

Ling Han’s smile remained, and he answered, “A probability of 70-80 percent was already worth a gamble.” He naturally wouldn’t say that he could still rise from the ashes, giving him a sliver of a chance even if he guessed wrong.

“Bravo! Bravo!” Alchemist Zi Cheng exclaimed. His eyebrows and beard quivered, and it was clear that he was beside himself with excitement.

He gestured with his hand, and his expression became as kindly as could be. “Lad, come here, take a seat.”

Ling Han walked over, and sat opposite Alchemist Zi Cheng. He rested his hands on his knees, and his expression was filled with respect.

Alchemist Zi Cheng became even more satisfied. His eyes were filled with approval, and he smilingly asked, “Do you consider me as someone who will allow those beside me to act in a domineering and wanton manner?”

Ling Han spoke his mind, saying, “I didn’t understand Senior before, so upon seeing Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s arrogance and haughtiness, I indeed considered Senior as such a person. However, after teaching Alchemy Apprentice Mo a lesson, the law enforcement officers that I expected didn’t arrive. Instead, I was visited by Alchemy Apprentice Mo again. At that time, I knew that Senior definitely wasn’t such a person.”

“Haha!” Alchemist Zi Cheng laughed heartily upon hearing this. “Then tell me, why do I allow Little Mo to act so wantonly, so much so that many others also consider me as an unreasonable person?”
