Chapter 1808: Picking Up Trash

The Empress completely ignored his shout. In her eyes, Qianzhao Yang, Luo Changfeng, and the others were no different from ordinary dogs and cats. She wouldn’t pay any attention to them at all.

She simply needed to crush her enemies.

With a phoenix-like shout, she waved her slender hand and struck her palm at Qianzhao Yang.

“Hmph!” Anger spread across Qianzhao Yang’s face when he saw this. Although he was attracted by the Empress’ beauty, he definitely wouldn’t be merciful if they were to do battle. If push came to shove, he would simply hold back a little and only capture her alive. Afterward, he would... do unspeakable things to her.

He extended a finger.

Weng!

The 10,000 swords rung in unison before shooting toward the Empress like a shower of meteors.

The Empress shuddered as she released her nine doppelgangers. With another shudder, all of her 10 bodies summoned 10 flaming Battle Beasts each.

She had also learned the Flame Control Technique. Although she didn’t have the Nine Heavens Flame to act as a foundation, the fire particles in the surroundings were still extremely friendly toward her. Thus, she could easily summon 100 Battle Beasts. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Nine Deaths Heaven Art and the Ten Beasts Technique—this was the combination of two powerful celestial techniques!

Was this not freakish?

Boom!

The 100 Battle Beasts roared in unison, forming a visible sound wave that shook the 10,000 swords.

What level was the Myriad Sword Technique at?

It was the celestial technique of a three-star force, so it could only be at the Immortal Palace Tier even if it were a top-notch core technique. That being the case, could it rival the combined power of two Celestial King Tier techniques?

It naturally couldn’t!

The 100 beasts charged toward the 10,000 swords. Meanwhile, the 10 Empresses wore expressions of pride and haughtiness as they stood back to watch the result.

Peng, peng, peng!

The 100 Battle Beasts unleashed their overwhelming destructive power, clashing with the golden swords and completely obliterating them. They then tossed the scraps onto the ground, with all of the symbols that had once adorned the swords completely destroyed. The swords were reduced to nothing more than ordinary Pseudo-Divine Metal.

Although these Battle Beasts only possessed battle prowess at the peak stage of the fourth severance, and although they hadn’t reached the king tier yet, were they not powerful enough to deal with these swords?

Ling Han was grinning from ear to ear as he cheerfully retrieved all of the fallen golden swords. These were all nutrients for his Divine Demon Sword.

“Stop!” Qianzhao Yang roared with a pained expression. Even for a Holy Son of a three-star force like him, One-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal was still incredibly rare and valuable. In fact, he had exhausted all of his savings to refine these 10,000 swords.

Why hadn’t he exchanged his savings for Two-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal? Wouldn’t that have resulted in more powerful swords?

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to, but it was because he simply couldn’t afford it.

Qianzhao Yang charged toward Ling Han in an attempt to prevent him from “stealing” his swords. However, the Empress immediately dashed over to block his path.

Boom!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and the Empress was clearly at a disadvantage.

This was inevitable. After all, the Empress was only invincible against those one minor level above her. Thus, it was quite challenging for her to rival those at the early stage of the fourth severance. Meanwhile, Qianzhao Yang was a king tier at the peak stage of the fourth severance. If it weren’t for her supreme Divine Fetus, and if it weren’t for her nine doppelgangers absorbing some of the damage, she would have already been defeated long ago.

Ling Han didn’t rush over to help her. The Empress was also a cultivation prodigy, so such a powerful opponent could give her enough pressure to more quickly advance to the peak stage of the second severance.

Once she reached the third severance, the Empress could remain fearless before king tiers at the peak stage of the fourth severance even if she couldn’t defeat them.

Ling Han joyfully continued to retrieve the golden swords. Since Qianzhao Yang had unleashed them, he wouldn’t need to think about retrieving them anymore!

Qianzhao Yang couldn’t endure this any longer. He pointed at the sword formation, and shouted, “Return!”

The vast sword formation instantly started to retract.

“Freeze!” Ling Han roared. He was going all out to retrieve this Pseudo-Divine Metal. He unleashed his water-element Source Power, instantly causing the surrounding temperature to drop to pit-bottom. Even the flying golden swords were frozen, and they were unable to move by even a single inch.

It was as if time had also been frozen. In the next instant, however, the golden swords suddenly started to plummet toward the ground.

“Ling Han, you dare?!” Qianzhao Yang shouted in a shrill voice. This was all of his savings! Yet, Ling Han was retrieving them as if he were picking up trash! His heart ached in pain.

“Little Han, you’re even picking up trash? I’m ashamed to be acquainted with you!” the large black dog said in disdain. He immediately ran off into the distance.

With his detestable nature, how could he be so righteous and just? He had most likely found a target, so he was simply running off to commit some evil.

Qianzhao Yang was beside himself with rage. They were actually referring to his golden swords as trash? They were the true trash!

He wanted to stop Ling Han, yet he couldn’t break free from the Empress’ obstruction.

Firstly, the Empress was too strong. Secondly, the Empress was breathtakingly beautiful, so how could he steel his heart to wound her? He would always instinctively hold back.

Ling Han cheerfully collected all of the golden swords. If he were lucky, the Divine Demon Sword might advance to the stage of Level Three Pseudo-Divine Metal. He smiled at Qianzhao Yang, and said, “Thanks for your generosity!”

“Return my swords!!” Qianzhao Yang roared in wild rage. He finally unleashed his trump card, extending his hand and drawing a circular symbol in the air. This symbol was extremely complex, and it radiated with a brilliant glow as it flew toward the Empress.

The Empress didn’t dare to face this attack head-on. Its destructive power was far too terrifying, and if she came into contact with it, her doppelgangers would definitely be obliterated. Meanwhile, even if her true body could offload some of the damage to her nine doppelgangers, she would definitely still suffer severe wounds.

One definitely couldn’t underestimate the Holy Sons of large sects. Those who enjoyed such a status had all defeated and risen above tens of thousands of other prodigies. They were all freakishly talented and powerful.

With a roar, Ling Han activated his Lightning Flash, and immediately arrived before the Empress. He then clenched his right hand into a fist, and used the Xuanyin Source Water to form a water dragon that coiled around it. With this done, he threw a punch at the overwhelming circular symbol.

‘You’re seeking death!’ Qianzhao Yang involuntarily said in his mind. Could his symbol be defeated so easily?

This was a symbol that had been carved into his mind by an Immortal Palace Tier elite of his sect. It was because of this that he could channel it. Moreover, the engraving would be consumed each time he activated it, so he needed to replenish it from time to time.

However, its might was astounding, and it was almost unparalleled in the Severing Mundane Tier.

‘You’re at the second severance, yet you actually want to face this attack head-on? Are you not seeking death?’

Ling Han’s fist whistled over.

Peng!

Winds howled and clouds rumbled, and the surrounding mountain path was forcefully cracked and fractured. Shards of rock shot through the sky as if they were weightless.

Crack!

A web of cracks appeared on the circular symbol, and it wasn’t long before the symbol crumbled like a piece of brittle pottery. It disintegrated into countless tiny shards that fell to the ground.

Pu!

Qianzhao Yang was transfixed with shock and disbelief. Just then, he had still been daydreaming about smashing Ling Han into smithereens with a single strike. Now, however, the result was completely different from his imagination.

This was far too incredible!

How had Ling Han shattered the Regulations of an Immortal Palace Tier elite?

Qianzhao Yang naturally didn’t know that the Xuanyin Source Water was at the Celestial King Tier. If one had to make a comparison, it was as if a Celestial King had implanted a Regulation inside Ling Han’s body. Even though the limitation of Ling Han’s cultivation level meant that he couldn’t fully unleash it, would it not be powerful enough to crush everyone else at the same cultivation level?

Trying to rival Ling Han’s Regulations was an absolute joke. In some sense, even Celestial Kings couldn’t rival Ling Han. This was because he possessed two types of Source Powers.

Ling Han was brimming with killing intent. At this moment, he was already certain that it was Qianzhao Yang who had commanded his subordinate to launch a sneak attack on him. Thus, that assailant had only been a tool. Meanwhile, Qianzhao Yang was the true culprit.

Facing this kind of person, he naturally didn’t need to show any mercy. He would kill him without hesitation!
