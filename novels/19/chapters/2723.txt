Heavenborn couldn’t help but pause.

He was the manifestation of the willpower of heaven and earth, so his senses far surpassed his cultivation level. With a single glance, he could tell what was up with the Divine Demon Sword.

This was a Heavenly Venerate Tool!

His physique was indeed tough, and even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate’s blow would only leave behind a groove on his skin. However, if he was struck by a Heavenly Venerate Tool, he definitely would be sliced open.

!!

Heavenborn couldn’t help but thank his luck secretly. If he really had swallowed Ling Han into his stomach just now, he would probably have been ripped open and dissected by now.

His recovery ability was indeed powerful, but the destructive power of a Heavenly Venerate Tool was astonishing. It was unknown how much time he would need to heal his injuries.

“Your luck is also overwhelmingly good!” Heavenly Venerate growled through gritted teeth. Even if he was the manifestation of the heaven and earth, he had not been able to obtain a piece of Devouring Metal himself—though the Black Tower was also a Heavenly Venerate Tool, it had not been forged by his own hands. Furthermore, it was still seriously damaged at present; it could not unleash the battle prowess that it should have at all.

“Hence, you had best accept your death obediently!” Ling Han charged over.

“Do you think I fear you!” Heavenborn took out the Black Tower. Weng! It immediately enlarged in his hand, turning into a staff-like form, which he wielded as he charged towards Ling Han.

Boom!

Two Heavenly Venerate Tools clashed, instantly bursting with a light so dazzling that even the heaven and earth paled in comparison.

With a strong flick of Ling Han’s sword, peng, Heavenborn was sent flying.

The Divine Demon Sword had only advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier in terms of material, but the martial intent of a Heavenly Venerate had not been branded on it yet. Thus, it was extremely sharp and incredibly sturdy, but aside from these two points, it actually could only still be considered a Celestial Tool.

As for the Black Tower?

It was indeed a genuine Heavenly Venerate Tool, but it was severely damaged at the moment, and was not able to awaken fully at all.

This Heavenly Venerate Tool that was not awakened was actually just considerably sharper than a Celestial Tool, and considerably sturdier. In terms of battle prowess, it was actually inferior.

Hence, in the clash between the Divine Demon Sword and the Black Tower, it was actually two pieces of Devouring Metal crashing into each other. Naturally, neither would be able to get the upper hand.

The factor that decided the outcome of this clash would still be Ling Han’s and Heavenborn’s own battle prowess.

Of course, it was certain that Ling Han was definitely stronger.

Peng!

Ling Han shot off in pursuit, and followed up with another punch, which landed on Heavenborn’s nose. Even if Heavenborn’s physique was tough, so what? This punch still broke his nose, and caused him to shed golden blood.

Ling Han used this opening, and struck out with the sword, stabbing at Heavenborn’s heart.

Ding!

Heavenborn laid out the Black Tower horizontally so that it acted as a shield in front of his chest.

This strike was blocked, but as the massive power surged past, Heavenborn was again sent flying.

He was involuntarily shocked. His power was much greater than the ordinary Ninth Heaven Celestial King’s because he had also previously been able to draw on the power of heaven and earth to temper himself. But this could only be done in the Celestial Realm. After he had come to the Flaming Frost Realm, he, a manifestation of the heaven and earth, had naturally “fallen out of favor.”

That was the case even for him, so how was it that Ling Han could be even more powerful than that?

Heavenborn was the manifestation of the dimension of the Celestial Realm. Why was it that it was he that would be inferior to this bug that had been born in this dimension?

Peng!

Heavenborn suffered another punch, and stumbled back from the impact. His face was covered with golden blood, and looked extremely tragic.

This was Ling Han’s power being too strong, surpassing Heavenborn’s recovery ability. However, this could only cause him some slight injury. The body of Divine Metal was not so easy to destroy.

“Ling Han, you can do nothing to me!” Heavenborn roared. “Even if you are slightly superior to me, so what? I am the manifestation of the dimension, and possess a boundless room for evolution. My path of cultivation only requires me to devour elites. There is no need for comprehension at all. I will very soon surpass you, and at that time, I will crush you into dust.”

Ling Han scoffed. “If you really had been so amazing, how could I have possibly caught up to you in cultivation level and suppressed you in battle prowess?”

Heavenborn was instantly rendered speechless. In the past, his cultivation level and battle prowess had both overwhelmed Ling Han, yet he no longer had the slightest bit of advantage now.

Just think back to the past: how high-spirited he had been, snatching the Heavenly Venerate Tool from Ling Han’s hands, and beating down on him so badly that the latter could only flee in a panic. If it were not for the uniqueness of that spatial passageway, Ling Han would have long since died hundreds of millions of years ago.

‘Damn it, damn it!’ Heavenborn shouted furiously in his mind, but time could not be reversed. To say nothing of the fact that he was only a manifestation of heaven and earth, even if he was the heaven and earth itself, this was something that he could not do.

Ling Han used the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, and his battle prowess suddenly soared countless times over. Chasing after Heavenborn, he blasted him madly.

Peng, peng, peng, after several dozen punches, Heavenborn’s whole chest had caved in. It was as thin as paper and almost close to being shattered. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The large black dog could not help but remind, “Little Han, take it easy. This body still has to be used by the Heavenly Venerate.”

Heavenborn naturally heard these words, and his face instantly scrunched up with anger. ‘You guys actually want to use my body?’

“Don’t even think about it!” Heavenborn fought back strongly, using the Black Tower like a staff. Boom! The Heavenly Venerate Tool unleashed its might. Even if it only possessed the might of the Devouring Metal itself, that was still terrifying enough as it broke through the layers of space.

But faced with Ling Han, this move was not effective. It couldn’t be helped, for Ling Han possessed the Divine Demon Sword.

Boom!

The two of them exchanged blows intensely. Ling Han, who possessed battle prowess on the level of late-stage Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, completely suppressed Heavenborn, beating him so hard that the latter was beginning to doubt himself. Why was he, a manifestation of heaven and earth, actually no match for Ling Han?

Heavenborn was filled with hatred. If he had known this, he would not have come to the Flaming Frost Realm at all. If this was the Celestial Realm, he could influence the heaven and earth to a limited extent. The various natural treasures would just appear on their own in front of him, helping his cultivation level to soar.

However, the overall level of the Celestial Realm was too low, and it would target even just a First Tier Heavenly Venerate. Even he could not be exempted from this, because once he was separated from the heaven and earth, he was actually an independent individual.

It was precisely because of such considerations that Heavenborn had come to the Flaming Frost Realm so he could seek a wider space for his own growth. He had not thought that he would encounter a freak like Ling Han here.

He gritted his teeth, and decided to retreat. If they continued fighting like this, he really would be done for.

“You can’t escape!” Ling Han declared coldly. He had already targeted Heavenborn for so long, so how could he miss this chance?

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han shot out like an arrow in pursuit, and he forced Heavenborn backwards once more with a series of more than a dozen punches.

“If you kill me, you will not be able to escape punishment, either!” Heavenborn roared harshly.

At the very least, he was wearing the ring which had a recording ability. If he died by Ling Han’s hand, those at the barrier would definitely know about it.

This crime was much greater than killing fellow disciples at the martial academy. It was a definite death sentence. Even if you were the son of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, it would be useless.

Ling Han shook his head, and asked smilingly, “Who said I would be killing you?”

Heavenborn was slightly taken aback. Thinking back to the large black dog’s previous words, he naturally came to a realization. “The two of you want to bring the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable back to life, and have him replace me in this body that I am presently occupying? Hahaha, that is delusional!

“If I die, I will definitely eradicate his lingering soul before my death!”

Ling Han humphed. “Will you be able to?”

He attacked aggressively, every strike of his sword harsh and powerful, no longer keeping anything back.

Heavenborn instantly felt the pressure on him increase greatly. Once Ling Han unleashed his might, he would not be able to hold up at all. After all, the gap in strength between the two of them was too wide.

This was a one-sided oppression, a one-sided torment.

Peng, peng, peng! Heavenborn was beaten tragically.

When they had had a fair battle in the Nine Deaths Formation, Heavenborn had already been no match for Ling Han, and now the gap between the two of them was even wider than before.

After around 100 moves, Ling Han kicked Heavenborn over, and leveled the Divine Demon Sword at the latter’s neck.

…If it were not for the fact that he could not truly kill this guy, what need would there have been for Ling Han to use so many moves?

Of course, beating Heavenborn to his heart’s content was also another reason.
