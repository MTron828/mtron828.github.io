Chapter 1007: The Great Danger Hidden in the Fog

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Every single alchemist was nurtured by copious amounts of wealth. The only difference was whether it was a larger or a smaller amount.

In a mere four days’ time, Ling Han had refined materials worth the astronomical amount of 2,000,000 True Origin Stones. This sum was sufficient to make a force like the Luo Clan feel extreme heartache, and it was all spent on a Level Two Divine Pill. If it was a Level Three, Level Four, or Level Five, what then? Every time an alchemist’s furnace exploded in the concoction process, it would really bring one to tears.

Ling Han spent a total of 1,000,000 True Origin Stones on alchemical materials, and only 100,000 was spent on the materials to concoct the Heavenly Qi Pill—the other materials were for the concoction of the Heavenly Pearl Pill. As for Level Three and Level Four Divine Pills, he was not going to consider it for the moment.

“Everyone, please gather at the front deck.” A voice suddenly rang through the whole ship. It was Yang Tiecheng’s voice.

“What happened?” Shui Yanyu asked.

Ling Han shook his head. “I don’t know. Let’s go out to take a look first.”

The couple walked out of their cabin.

Jiang Anyun just so happened to walk out from the cabin next door as well. His face was completely black, and he used a ferocious gaze to sweep endlessly over Ling Han as if he had caught an adulterous couple red-handed.

In his thoughts, what could a lone man and woman be up to in a room by themselves? It had to be *******.

They arrived at the ship’s prow, and could see that there were already a few people standing there.

“We are about to enter into the zone of the Black Fog,” Yang Tiecheng explained as he pointed ahead. “In the Black Fog, our divine sense and vision would be greatly affected. At most, we would only be able to see objects half a foot in front of us.”

He paused, and then continued, “That was why I gathered everyone here. I do not want any unpleasant things to happen.”

It was very obvious. Once they entered into the zone of the Black Fog, his divine sense could not possibly shroud the whole ship, and anything that happened would be out of his control. He was not ignorant of the state of mutual hostility among the passengers on this ship. If someone really died, he would definitely have to bear responsibility.

Hence, everyone had to come out obediently, and stay there right under his nose. Then, he would not have to worry about any possible problems.

Ling Han looked out into the distance, and could see an area of black fog roughly three miles ahead of them. It had a very wide range, and there was no way to circle around it. It had to be known that the ships that traveled in this sea all moved very, very slowly. If they really circled around it, the length of their journey would probably increase by more than half a day at the very least.

“This is a characteristic feature of the Star Sea. It would occasionally create black fog, but as for the reason why that is the case, no one knows to this day,” Shui Yanyu murmured lowly next to him.

“I am really quite interested now. I’d like to dive beneath it and take a look,” Ling Han said with a smile, but then shook his head. “Why is this bunch of pirates so obedient? It has already been quite a few days, and there is still no activity from them.”

Shui Yanyu’s slender brows wrinkled as well; apparently, she was very unhappy.

Others would be afraid of encountering pirates, but the two of them wanted nothing more but to encounter pirates.

“I have to trouble everyone to all stand where you are obediently without moving when we pass through this Black Fog. Otherwise...” Yang Tiecheng clenched his fists, his eyes filled with threat.

No one opened their mouths to speak, but their eyes were wandering in all directions. It was apparent that they all had their own plans.

“Be careful!” Shui Yanyu was a little nervous. There was no shortage of elites in the high extreme of Mountain River Tier here, and there were also elites in the consummate level.

Ling Han cracked a grin, and said, “It’s all right. Later, we’ll enter into the Black Tower to talk about life, and who cares what trouble they create outside.”

Immediately, a ripple of emotion surged in Shui Yanyu’s heart. This guy, the big pervert he was, liked to explore her body when they were talking about life.

The ship was already getting closer and closer to that black-colored fog, and the atmosphere on board was suddenly becoming tenser as well.

“Later, when we enter into the fog, you all kill that brat!” Jiang Anyun issued a command to his subordinates.

“But, Young Gang Leader, Yang Tiecheng is just on the sidelines,” one of his subordinates protested weakly.

“Humph, so what? The fog hampers our divine sense and sight, and as long as you move fast enough, who will know you were the ones who killed him?” Jiang Anyun asked. Then, he added, “You definitely must not injure that woman. Otherwise, I will toss you all into the sea to be buried next to her!”

“Yes, Young Gang Leader.” There were a total of eight members from the Black Five Gang aboard the ship, and the remaining seven could only obey his command obediently.

Jiang Ji was busy cultivating, and was still hoping for Jiang Anyun to carry on the ancestral line. Thus, even if Jiang Ji knew about this, it was possible that he would be supportive of it.

On the other side, Zuo Xiao and Fan Yong were also whispering amongst themselves, discussing how they should make their move later. Meanwhile, the two people from the Luo Clan were similarly not content with peace, their four eyes focused on Ling Han while boiling with killing intent.

The beautiful faces of Liu Ying and the other death guards were ice-cold, and danger was lying all around them.

The eyes of that middle-aged man in gray, though, were flickering as his attention wandered in all directions.

Meanwhile, the young man that hugged a sword, the youth in coarse cloth, and the woman in white stood next to Yang Tiecheng as if they, too, had sensed that there would be violent turbulence ahead. They did not want to be drawn into the storm.

It was in this kind of atmosphere that the ship slowly moved into the fog.

Immediately, everyone felt as if they had been blinded. Even if they had their eyes open, they could not see anything in front of them. Only when they placed their hands in front of their eyes could they barely see a vague outline.

It was even worse for divine sense. The moment they stretched their divine sense out of their bodies, it would be swallowed up by something. It was rendered completely useless.

Thankfully, their hearing was still there. Otherwise, if they lost their three basic senses—sight, hearing, and divine sense—at the same time, a considerable many would probably be driven mad.

It was complete silence on the ship.

However, the silence was only momentary. Peng, peng, peng, peng. Immediately, sounds of battle were heard, and there were violent waves of power surging out, yet they were completely incapable of moving the fog in this place. Thankfully, this ship was specially built, and could sustain that terrifying gravity. It was naturally incomparably sturdy as well. At least, Mountain River Tier cultivators would find it very difficult to damage this ship.

“Stop!! Stop!!” Yang Tiecheng roared in anger continuously. He charged into the battle, and whomever he encountered, he would grab and toss out of the melee. Peng, peng, peng. They endlessly crashed into the pillars and ship’s hold.

The crew of the ship joined him, trying to stop the chaotic battle. However, this only caused the battle to become even more chaotic.

In the fog, nobody could see clearly, and they could only move based on instinct.

After about 30 minutes, a ray of light suddenly shone in, and the fog began to dissipate.

The battle instantly ceased. When the long missed sky once again reappeared, everyone was obediently standing where they were as if they had all been civilized people just now and none of them had moved from their initial places at all. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

But if one took a closer look, they would be able to realize that there were some who had had their faces punched, a bruise forming around their eyes. There were others whose hair was messed up, and some even had their clothes torn open, every one of them cutting very sorry figures indeed.

“Young, Young Gang Leader!” An exclamation of shock rang out. Everyone turned to look in the direction of the exclamation, and saw that Jiang Anyun was lying face-up on the ground, a bloody hole in his chest. It pierced precisely through his heart, and Jiang Anyun had already lost all signs of life.

His expression was one filled with shock as if he had completely not imagined that he would be attacked in this manner, and it would even be a fatal strike.

“You!! It must have been you!!” The elder from the Black Five Gang pointed at Ling Han, his face filled with murderous intent.
