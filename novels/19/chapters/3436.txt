Chapter 3437: Azure Dragon Formation Spirit

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng! Ling Han’s entire body trembled, and blood flowed from his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. He looked too horrible to look at.

A Celestial Path elite was truly powerful. With just a glare, he had almost killed a freakish prodigy of this generation. However, this also proved how powerful Ling Han was, being able to withstand a strike from the Celestial Path elite an not die.

Cui Zhenhai was also slightly startled. He had not thought that Ling Han would be able to withstand his spiritual attack without dying.

Merely from this aspect, this brat was indeed ten times, no, a hundred times more outstanding than Cui Changyun.

Unfortunately, this person was not his son. On the contrary, he was the enemy that had killed his son.

“At least you have some abilities. No wonder you dared to be so insolent. However, in front of me, you are ultimately just an ant.” Cui Zhenhai stated calmly.

“The one who has killed my son, die!”

He moved aggressively, and shot out a palm strike from afar, turning into ten million sharp swords that shot towards Ling Han.

Every sharp sword was entwined with high-level energy, and shot out densely, covering the skies and enshrouding the earth.

This strike was something that one below the Celestial Path couldn’t deal with. After crossing over the Celestial Gate, the level of being of a living being would undergo a leap. Compared to Mystery Realm Tier, this was a completely different level, and there was no comparison at all.

Thus, if Celestial Path elites made a move, mortals could only wait for death.

Ling Han didn’t want to wait for death. He was waiting for a miracle.

Ten thousand swords attacked, forming a dark mass.

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared.

No one saw how he appeared. A ball of light suddenly condensed, and then he appeared, standing in front of Ling Han, facing those tens of thousands of sharp swords.

This person stretched out a hand and pushed, and instantly, tens of thousands of sharp swords stopped at the same time. Then, he stretched out a hand and pressed down. Pa, pa, pa, the sword projections were all shattered.

Everyone was dumbfounded. Someone had blocked the attack of a Celestial

Path elite.

Hiss, had Chen Fengyan made a move?

Everyone focused their gazes, yet were shocked, because they did not know this person at all.

Cui Zhenhai showed a hint of seriousness, and asked, “Who are you, sir?” This was a mysterious person. His surroundings were all enshrouded in light, yet his face would appear from time to time. Thus, everyone was certain that he wasn’t Chen Fengyan.

However, aside from Chen Fengyan, there was actually another Celestial Path elite in the Imperial Capital?

Previously, the old eunuch, Zhu Qi, was already extremely shocking. There was actually a Mystery Realm Tier elite keeping watch in the Imperial Capital. This time, it was even more shocking. A Celestial Path elite had directly appeared. Just how many trump cards did their Holy Emperor have hidden?

The mysterious person spoke up, and said, “I am the formation spirit of the Azure Dragon Formation of the Imperial City. My duty is to guard the capital region, and prohibit the Celestial Path elites from making a move. You have broken the rules, so I have especially come to suppress you.”

Formation, formation spirit?

Everyone was surprised. Their Imperial Capital actually had a formation protecting it?

Furthermore, from the tone of the formation spirit, it could suppress even elites of Celestial Path. This was too shocking.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief in his mind. Sure enough, Chen Fengyan wasn’t cultivating in seclusion. He had long since made his preparations. If someone dared to oppose him, he wouldn’t need to worry about Celestial Path elites.

“Suppress me?” Cui Zhenhai smirked coldly, “Chen Fengyan, Chen Fengyan, oh Chen Fengyan, you are really quite arrogant. You don’t even show yourself, and merely sent out a formation spirit, and you want to suppress me?”

-The Holy Emperor is high and noble, and there is absolutely no need for him to move personally,” the formation spirit stated calmly, as if it understood human nature very well.

“All right, I really want to see how you are going to suppress me!” Cui Zhenhai laughed in fury. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Boom, he unleashed his full power, and the clothes on his body suddenly bulged. A pattern of light appeared between his brows, spreading out towards his whole face. Then, his whole body was glowing, appearing incredibly sacred.

“Die!” He charged out, and delivered a palm strike at the formation spirit. Not only was he going to destroy the formation spirit, but he was also going to kill Ling Han as well.

The formation spirit went up to greet him. His whole body was glowing in the first place, and similarly exuded a sacred brilliance.

Boom!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and instantly, a terrifying shockwave blasted out in all directions. This was a clash between elites of Celestial Path, and the aftermath was incredibly terrifying, enough to kill Mystery Realm

Tiers.

The formation spirit pressed down with its hand: “Trap!

Four light screens appeared, enshrouding him and Cui Zhenhai, and also imprisoning the surging energy within. Peng, peng, peng, peng! No matter how turbulent the aftermath was, it could not be blasted out at all, saving them from a calamity. Otherwise, though the people in the plaza would be heavily wounded and killed, it was possible that even the Imperial Palace would not be able to be protected, and would be turned into ruins.

Cui Zhenhai couldn’t help but look surprised. The formation spirit’s strength had exceeded his expectations.

However, he was still proud, and said, “Though you are powerful, you are ultimately only a formation spirit, and do not truly exist in this world. How could you possibly match my several hundred years of hard cultivation. ” He grabbed the back of his head, and with a powerful pull, a shocking scene appeared. He actually pulled out a long pillar of light from his body. This pillar of light was a little like a sword, but also a little like a snake. Its body was slightly bent.

-This is the foundation of human Dao that I have cultivated, and I have studied the corpse of the True Dragon, and built it into a great dragon.” Cui Zhenhai declared proudly. As he spoke, the long pillar in his hand actually released a dragon’s roar, and manifested four legs. It really had become a great dragon.

“Kill him!”

With a soft roar from Cui Zhenhai, the great dragon moved its four legs, and charged towards the formation spirit. A pressure that was transcendent above the mortal world assaulted, making everyone shiver.

Thankfully, there were four light screens that blocked most of the pressure. Otherwise, everyone here would have knelt down.

Celestials were superior to the Nine Heavens, and mortals could only worship them.

Yet the formation spirit was unfazed and unafraid. He greeted the great dragon with a punch.

Simple, direct and violent, very much like Chen Fengyan’s style.

Could it be that the formation spirit could inherit the personality of the person who set up the formation?

Peng, the punch landed, but a strange scene appeared. The great dragon actually wormed into the formation spirit’s fist.

What was going on?

But in the next instant, the great dragon was spat out from the formation spirit’s mouth again, but this time, it lost its great dragon form, turning into a pillar of light, as if it was a sword without an edge.

Xiu, the pillar of light flew back into Cui Zhenhai’s hand.

“You, you, you-” Cui Zhenhai paled in shock, “You actually extracted my great dragon essence!”

His foundation of human Dao was far stronger than his peers, and that was because he had observed the True Dragon, and formed a sliver of Dragon Qi. But now, this Dragon Qi had been absorbed by the formation, so his advantage naturally no longer existed.

The formation spirit was unfazed, and said indifferently, I am the formation spirit of the Azure Dragon Formation. For me, the Dragon Qi is something nutritious. If you use the great dragon to attack me, your only fate would naturally be destruction.”

p***l

Cui Zhenhai cursed internally. How did he know that this formation spirit was so freakish, that it could actually extract the soul of Foundation Building. Otherwise, how could he possibly do that?

However, his heart was also beating like a drum. To be able to easily extract the soul of Foundation Building, just how strong would this formation spirit have to be to be able to do so?

This was not something that could be done just because their attributes were incompatible.

Fear suddenly welled up in his heart. Chen Fengyan hadn’t even made a move yet, yet the formation spirit alone was already causing him to suffer a great loss. If they continued to battle, the situation might become extremely dire..
