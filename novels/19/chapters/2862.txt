2863 Broken Saber

The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate hesitated.

There were many raw stones considered to be of high value in the treasure area, but scrap stones might also be discovered at the same time. As a result, they had not been retained internally, but placed here as a signboard to attract customers.

If these two people were to take off with high-level Heavenly Venerable Seals or an orange-grade Great Herb, then Sever Void Lane would sustain a great loss.

He thought about it, and decided to agree nonetheless.

This was an excellent opportunity to improve the store’s reputation, and since they could only choose one raw stone each, then the loss would still be limited even if the treasure was harvested by them.

“Treasure area!”

Everyone was excited. The treasure area of Sever Void Lane had always been a reserved area, and people were rarely allowed to enter it. It was just that an orange-grade Great Herb had been harvested a very long time ago, and additionally, a primitive beast had also been unearthed from here. It was extremely amazing.

However, everyone wasn’t allowed to enter the treasure area together. Only Ling Han, Grandmaster Xuanlai, and the Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate were allowed to enter, while the others could only watch from the outside.

“One day’s time.” The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate threw out the third hourglass.

Neither Ling Han nor Grandmaster Xuanlai wasted any time. They started immediately.

As expected of Sever Void Lane, there were huge quantities of raw stones in this treasure area, arranged in a dazzling setup. Once one entered, one could feel a great aura, as if what was placed here wasn’t stones, but rather time and age.

Ling Han smiled. Although there was a huge quantity of raw stones here, there were only about 1,000 pieces. One day’s time was enough for him to explore the area several times and choose the most valuable one among them.

As he walked, he touched the stones one by one, but he was frowning slightly.

In this majestic treasure area, there wasn’t even a single Heavenly Venerable Seal?

‘F*ck!’

‘Hmm?’

He stopped quickly, and tapped lightly on a raw stone. There was a Great Herb in it, but it was only yellow-grade. He shook his head and moved on.

After walking around a third of the area, he stopped again, and found another Great Herb. Moreover, it was of the orange grade.

The orange grade was a leap from the yellow grade.

The yellow-colored Great Herb could only improve one’s cultivation level or heal injuries, but the orange-grade Great Herb could help a Heavenly Venerate cast away the shackles of his cultivation level and advance towards a new height of power. To put it simply, it could help a Heavenly Venerate sense new fundamental powers.

Therefore, the orange Great Herb was more precious than the Heavenly Venerable Seal. Of course, for a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, the orange Great Herb wouldn’t have any meaning at all.

Ling Han didn’t take the stone. If he subsequently found out that this was the most precious raw stone in the entire area, Grandmaster Xuanlai wouldn’t be able to snatch it from him anyway—Ling Han had the battle prowess of Fourth Tier, which was not something which a Ninth Heaven Celestial king could contend with.

After walking for a while, Ling Han stopped for the third time, and had a look of surprise on his face.

It was because he discovered a saber in this particular raw stone.

This was a broken saber, and yet it still made Ling Han feel a terrible and fierce aura despite being isolated within thick layers that could cut off even the divine sense of a Heavenly Venerate. Just a simple touch already caused him to have a headache.

It was too scary. This was definitely a Heavenly Venerate Tool, and had to have come from the hands of a high-level Heavenly Venerate to have such terrifying destructive power.

Ling Han believed that the value of this broken saber should be higher than that of the orange-grade Great Herb. This saber could only be refined by at least a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and it might even be a treasure of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, which was more amazing.

He was sure that Sever Void Lane couldn’t conclude the value of this raw stone, so it had been put here, otherwise they would definitely have opened it themselves. This saber… had terrifying power.

Ling Han still didn’t take it, and kept walking.

This precious area was in the shape of a ring, so when Ling Han walked more than half of the place, he met Grandmaster Xuanlai.

Grandmaster Xuanlai smiled politely at him, and then passed him by.

Ling Han also smiled slightly. He had a good impression of this old man.

After walking for a while, Ling Han turned around and saw that Grandmaster Xuanlai had already walked in front of the raw stone with the broken saber, and he kept looking at it with a puzzled look on his face, as if he didn’t know whether to choose it or not.

It seemed that the old man also felt something, but he didn’t have the kind of “see through” ability like Ling Han, so he seemed to be conflicted

Ling Han turned his head, and continued to move forward.

He found a few more Great Herbs one after another, and even discovered a Heavenly Venerable Seal, which made him nod in approval. The reputation of the treasure area really didn’t just come out of the air, and there were indeed precious treasures here.

‘Huh?!’

He was suddenly taken aback, and stopped in his tracks.

His hand was lying on a huge raw stone, and he could hardly believe his “eyes.” What he saw was completely beyond his expectation.

This was too unbelievable, too amazing.

Ling Han took a deep breath, and walked past this raw stone. His heart was beating wildly; should he choose this stone later? If he was to choose it, what he unveiled might be earth-shattering, but if he didn’t choose it, was there any possibility for him to come here in the future?

He also became conflicted, and had the same feeling as Grandmaster Xuanlai. There were really many good things here, and if he could only choose one… It wasn’t enough.

After going a full circle, Ling Han had already made up his mind.

“The time has come.” The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate spoke up.

In fact, both Ling Han and Grandmaster Xuanlai had gone round once. To them, this treasure area was still a little small, and it wouldn’t take a day’s time to check out the whole place.

“Please.”

Both Ling Han and Grandmaster Xuanlai made their moves, and things turned out as Ling Han had expected. The raw stone that Grandmaster Xuanlai chose was the one with the broken saber, while Ling Han chose the huge raw stone that had shocked him.

“Grandmaster Xuanlai, you go first,” Ling Han said.

Grandmaster Xuanlai did not decline, and immediately started to cut open the raw stone. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After a while, boom, a murderous aura rushed towards his face. To say nothing of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, even the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate turned pale, and had an indescribable heart palpitation.

Pa, the Celestial Tool in Grandmaster Xuanlai’s hand immediately fell to the ground, and his entire being also sat down on the ground, paralyzed, with cold sweat flowing down from him like a stream.

“This… Is there any peerless monster about to be born?”

“I am a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, but why do I still have a feeling of fear?”

Everyone exclaimed. What exactly came out of this?

...

“Let me do it.” The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate walked up. Obviously Grandmaster Xuanlai was no longer able to cut open the stone. Even if he was allowed to stay there, his body might be torn to pieces by the murderous aura.

One ought to know that its contents had not been truly unearthed yet.

Everyone gathered together, and could only vaguely see something.

“Yi, this looks like… a saber!”

“Furthermore, it’s a broken saber, and the breaking point is here.”

“It is still covered by a layer of stone scrap, and the murderous aura is already so terrifying? Heavens, what is this?”

The Fiery Silk Heavenly Venerate’s hands also trembled a little. So what if he was a Fourth Tier? The murderous aura of this broken saber was too strong indeed, and he couldn’t control himself.

But a Fourth Tier was a Fourth Tier, after all. He forcibly suppressed the palpitations in his heart, and gave it a slap.

Now that it was known that a saber was hidden in it, with a murderous aura so terrifying, its grade obviously had to be far above a Celestial Tool, so there was no need to worry about it being smashed by the power of a Heavenly Venerate.

Pa, the stone shattered, and a broken saber immediately appeared in front of everyone.

The whole body of this saber was pitch-black, and it looked like one-third of it was broken. If one was to look carefully, this saber wasn’t naturally black, but it had been stained with too much blood, which made it appear black.

...

Pa! Pa! Pa!

As soon as the broken saber came out, at least 90% of the people went weak and collapsed onto the ground; even the Heavenly Venerates were no exception. Only the Fourth Tier was able to stand upright, but his legs were shaking.
