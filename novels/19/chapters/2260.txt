Chapter 2261: Might Unleashed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s foot immediately transformed into a colossal black foot that was as large as a mountain as it descended upon the Foreign Realm elite.

Everyone shook their heads upon seeing this.

This was an ant challenging a lion.

To say nothing of transforming his foot into a mountain, even if it were transformed into a celestial body, what good would it do? Before a Celestial King, such power was measly and insignificant.

Moreover, he dared to actively challenge a Celestial King Tier elite? And to use his foot at that? Just how much disdain was he expressing?

The Foreign Realm elite was incandescent with rage. ‘Just because you have the protection of a Celestial King, you dare to treat me with such utter disdain?

‘You’re seeking death!’

He was accumulating power for an ultimate attack, so he paid no heed to Ling Han’s attack. This was only an Eleventh Secret weakling, so what did it matter even if the Celestial King was hit? Once the latter unleashed his attack, the greatest threat to the future of the Foreign Realm would be reduced to ashes.

“No! No! No!” Shen Chao’s face was pale with fright. Ling Han’s attack would definitely be futile against that Celestial King. However, when the Celestial King counterattacked, both he and Ling Han would be blasted into oblivion.

He didn’t want to die.

Boom!

The foot landed, and with a pop, the Foreign Realm elite immediately vanished without a trace. Only the colossal foot remained, seemingly tangible in its existence.

Gasp!

Ah!

Huh?

Everyone fell deathly silent. Much like the time when Ling Han had blocked the attack of the Foreign Realm elite just then, no one could believe this result.

Measly Immortal Palace Tier elites were like ants before Celestial Kings. However, with a single stomp, a Celestial King Tier elite had actually disappeared? No, even his aura had vanished. It was as if both his figure and divine sense had been destroyed.

Who could accept this? Who could believe this?

“Do you believe me now?” Ling Han asked with a smile as he glanced at Shen Chao.

Shen Chao’s mouth was agape with shock. He was stupefied, and his mind was blank.

Ling Han raised his foot.

Boom!

That colossal foot also rose. When the dust settled, everyone could see the bloody pulp that had once been the Foreign Realm elite.

Interestingly, the Foreign Realm elite had possessed the shape of a cockroach. As such, it was as if Ling Han had truly trampled a pest to death.

A mighty Twelfth1 Lotus elite had actually died just like that? He had died in such a vexing manner?

Commotion ripped through the realm. Everyone had already recovered from their shock, and what remained was strong doubt and immense confusion. Was there truly an elite protecting Ling Han?

A Fifth Heaven Celestial King could indeed crush Third Heaven Celestial Kings. However, which Celestial King wasn’t a prodigy? Even with a gap of two minor levels, the result shouldn’t have been so lopsided, right?

Moreover, due to the limit of this realm, those above the Fifth Heaven couldn’t enter. As such, how could this be explained?

“Perhaps the Celestial Realm has come up with a special way to send those above Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings in?” a Foreign Realm elite speculated.

“Perhaps we’ve come up with a special way for those above Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings to enter?” a Celestial King from the Celestial Realm murmured.

“I don’t believe this!” an elite from the Foreign Realm shouted as he stepped forward. He reached over, and made a pressing motion at Ling Han.

Boom!

Countless symbols lit up, and a paramount aura suffused through the surroundings. This was a Fourteenth Lotus elite.

This was the power of a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, the strongest power that could exist in this realm.

At this moment, the elites from the Celestial Realm also forgot about trying to save Ling Han, or perhaps it was better to say that they had been sent into numb shock by the elite behind Ling Han. They wanted to see how this figure would deal with this attack.

“Aaah...!” Shen Chao was scared out of his skin. He refused to believe that Ling Han truly possessed the power to rival Celestial Kings. As such, he once again became pale with fright.

In fact, he hadn’t always been such a cowardly person. However, after being attacked by Celestial Kings several times, he naturally couldn’t control his emotions anymore.

Boom!

A large hand reached over, causing the entire sky to shudder. This was paramount power.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he balled his hand into a fist. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Boom!

Peng!

The large hand instantly shattered.

The elite from the Foreign Realm groaned as a trail of blood flowed from his right hand. The backlash of the Regulations had wounded him.

Upon seeing this, all of the Celestial Kings came to a solid conclusion. Ling Han wasn’t being protected by a Celestial King or whatnot. Instead, he truly possessed the power to rival a Celestial King!

How was this possible? He was only at the Eleventh Secret!

Shen Chao was also numb with shock as he stared at Ling Han. At this moment, he felt as if this person was a demon. There was nothing but terror in his mind.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “You dared to attack me? Quite the courage, huh?” He unleashed a boundless killing intent, and with a flash, he had already appeared before that Fourteenth Lotus elite. He then threw a punch.

Celestial Kings were naturally powerful, and their divine senses were also extremely sharp. At almost the exact same moment that Ling Han appeared, the Fourteenth Lotus elite had already lashed out, striking at Ling Han’s face.

This time, Shen Chao’s reaction wasn’t so pathetic. He surprisingly didn’t squeal. Looking closely, however, his eyes had already rolled into his head. He had fainted from fright.

Ling Han’s formidable might had shocked him into unconsciousness.

Peng!

Ling Han’s punch was faster, and he immediately struck the Fourteenth Lotus elite’s head. Like a watermelon, the elite’s head exploded into bits.

Peng!

His headless body then swayed for a brief moment before collapsing to the ground with a heavy thud, throwing dust into the air.

There was no grieving from heaven and earth. His death was like that of an insignificant ant.

Ling Han’s movements were practiced as he searched this elite’s body, and retrieved his Spatial God Tool, stuffing it into his pockets.

He had truly done this many times.

Gulp...

There was the sound of uncomfortable swallowing.

That was a Fourteenth Lotus elite! The equivalent of a Fifth Heaven Celestial King!

If there were no exceptional circumstances, monarch tiers could only reach such a level as well. However, Ling Han had actually killed such an elite at a whim? He had crushed them like an ant!

Just then, who had called Ling Han an ant? Why didn’t they step forward now? Their death would be guaranteed!

“Y-you obtained the Origin Magic Cube!” an elite from the Foreign Realm stammered as he pointed at Ling Han. He finally came to his senses.

Not good!

Ling Han grinned, and said, “There’s finally a smart person. However, it’s too late!”

The expressions of the elites from the Foreign Realm changed drastically. They weren’t afraid of the fact that Ling Han had obtained the Origin Magic Cube. This realm was far too small, so even though Ling Han had obtained the Origin Magic Cube, he could only obtain the battle prowess of an Eighth Heaven or Ninth Heaven Celestial King at most. He would still be no match for Heavenly Venerates.

However, once he self-destructed this realm, that would trigger a devastating storm of energy that might even affect the stability of the connection point between the two realms. At that time, even Heavenly Venerates would have trouble trying to enter.

This was what worried them the most.

“There’s no need for you people to consider so much, because... I’m going to obliterate each and every one of you!” Ling Han said in a cold voice. There was no sympathy and pity when it came to this battle between the two realms. There was only death and destruction. Things would only conclude when one side was thoroughly destroyed.

“Leave!” an elite from the Foreign Realm roared. This brat was nowhere near the Celestial King Tier. However, after obtaining the Origin Magic Cube, he had become the ruler of this realm.

That they had been able to enter this realm proved that they were inferior to the power of this realm. As such, they would naturally be no match for Ling Han. In other words, facing him head-on wasn’t an option. That would merely be seeking death.

In any case, there were over 130 Celestial King Tier elites from the Foreign Realm. If they charged out together, would not even a single one of them survive?

Boom!

The elites from the Foreign Realm turned around to flee. By the looks of it, they could only seek the help of a Heavenly Venerate to destroy this realm. Even if that delayed their invasion by 10 billion years or an epoch, it would still be worth it.

“Have I allowed you to leave?” Ling Han said in a cold voice. He was going to unleash his divine might.
