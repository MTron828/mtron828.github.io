Chapter 1411 Charging Through the Encirclemen

Ling Han charged toward Point Star City. If anyone tried to stop him from rescuing his wife, they could go and die!

Die! Die! Die!

Killing intent emanated from his body, and it was as if he were a demonic god.

Moreover, because he was charging toward the city from the outside, many people from the two Majestic Empires initially thought that he was an ally. However, they quickly realized that they were wrong. Ling Han looked far too unfamiliar! Those above the Immortal level all had incredible memory, and the Jade Drop Majestic Empire and Eternity Sky Majestic Empire only had several tens of thousands of Sun Moon Tier cultivators anyway. None of them matched Ling Han in appearance!

In any case, no one dared to guess that Ling Han was actually a Heavenly Body Tier elite, even though his speed was astounding.

“Who are you?” There was a cold humph as someone appeared before Ling Han.

Ling Han had no time for this nonsense. He was focused on reaching Point Star City as soon as possible, and he didn’t want to waste any time. Thus, even though he was brimming with killing intent, he didn’t lash out at anyone along the way. However, now that his path was being obstructed, he naturally wouldn’t hold back any longer.

Pa!

He casually waved his hand, and the person before him was instantly crushed into smithereens. Ling Han dashed through the cloud of blood, barely stopping for even a split-second.

However, his action naturally drew the attention of the others, meaning that he was unable to remain low-key any further.

“There’s a spy!”

“Capture him!”

“Kill him!”

A dozen or so cultivators instantly charged over, all of them at the Sun Moon Tier. The Heavenly Body Tier elites were observing the battle from in the sky, and it was naturally impossible for some random enemy to spur them into action.

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered attacking these cultivators. Anyhow, his physique was as tough as Level 12 Godly metal, so what would it matter even if he were struck by the attacks of 100,000,000 Sun Moon Tier cultivators? He simply unleashed his Heavenly Body Tier aura as he descended to the ground and continued to charge toward Point Star City.

If he traveled through the sky, he would be targeted and attacked by the enemy Heavenly Body Tier elites. As such, it was naturally safer for him to travel along the ground.

One had to realize that the Jade Drop Majestic Empire wasn’t the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, a young empire that had only been founded 1,000,000 years ago. With its rich history, this empire also had an evident pyramid structure of elites. Among its Heavenly Body Tier elites, there were those at the low extreme, medium extreme, high extreme, and also consummate level.

If Ling Han were targeted by an elite at the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, even if he weren’t stopped in his tracks, his speed would be affected drastically.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han was like a raging arrow as he shot through the crowds of enemies. Moreover, his formidable aura caused all of the charging Sun Moon Tier cultivators to shudder. These cultivators were then tossed into the air, where they would instantly explode into a cloud of blood and flesh.

Once on the battlefield, Ling Han would become steel-hearted and ruthless.

“Sh*t! He’s not a Sun Moon Tier cultivator; he’s a Heavenly Body Tier elite!” someone exclaimed in astonishment.

“Hurry, report this to the great elites!”

Cries of astonishment rippled through the enemy ranks, and it wasn’t long before the Heavenly Body Tier elites in the sky also noticed the abnormal commotion below. They all focused their gaze on Ling Han.

“How audacious! You actually dared to lay in ambush behind us and kill warriors of my Majestic Empire. You’re seeking death!” A Heavenly Body Tier elite launched an attack from a dozen kilometers away, drawing on the power of heavenly bodies as they did so.

Whoosh!

A large Origin Power hand materialized before Ling Han.

Ling Han didn’t dodge or evade. In fact, he didn’t even slow down, charging toward the large hand just like that.

Peng!

He forcefully barged through the large hand, continuing to charge toward the city. Meanwhile, the Heavenly Body Tier elite in the sky let out a muffled groan as a gaping hole was ripped into the large hand. Looking down, a bloody hole had appeared in his right hand.

Although it was an Origin Power hand that Ling Han had barged through, the fact that it was linked to the aura of the elite meant that the latter had also received a minor wound.

The elite was stunned. This was because he knew that Ling Han hadn’t attacked him at all. Instead, he had merely crashed into his Origin Power hand. However, the destructive power of this collision had ripped through his Origin Power hand and even wounded his actual body.

What kind of physique was this? What kind of destructive power was this? This person was the definition of a human weapon!

“Stop him at all costs!” a Heavenly Body Tier elite ordered coldly.

The soldiers on the ground instantly moved into formations. They were going to combine everyone’s strength to block Ling Han.

Peng!

Ling Han crashed into the formations, and the enemy soldiers were instantly sent flying like falling leaves on a blustery autumn day. They were completely unable to stop his advance. In fact, some soldiers were blasted into pieces by the overwhelming force of the collision. Regardless of whether they were at the Mountain River Tier or Sun Moon Tier, none of these soldiers had the right or ability to stop Ling Han.

Upon seeing this, even the Heavenly Body Tier elites were astounded.

Inconceivable!

When Sun Moon Tier cultivators entered a formation, they could not only unleash more power, but they could even distribute the damage that they received. As such, these formations gave Sun Moon Tier cultivators the right to challenge Heavenly Body Tier elites. Of course, such formations could only be used on battlefields during war. Otherwise, there definitely wouldn’t be enough Sun Moon Tier cultivators. That being the case, it would be useless even if they teamed up and entered a formation.

However, Ling Han had destroyed these formations simply by charging through them like a wild ox?! He didn’t play by the rules, nor did he know the rules. He was simply charging through these formations using brute strength, taking full advantage of his superior power and physique.

“Humph!” Another Heavenly Body Tier elite launched an attack, unleashing a ray of sword light at Ling Han. This ray of sword light rapidly caught up to Ling Han, slashing at his back.

Ling Han frowned upon sensing this attack. This was an elite at the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, and they were just powerful enough to wound him.

‘I can’t stop!’

Ling Han immediately reached a decision, and he continued to streak along the ground.

The city protection formation had suddenly shut down, so a dramatic turn of events had most definitely taken place inside Point Star City. He had to hurry over as quickly as possible.

Pu!

The sword light slashed into Ling Han’s back, shredding his clothes and sending them fluttering through the air like colorful butterflies. A bloody mark also appeared on his jade-like back, with blood immediately seeping out from within it.

However, the Heavenly Body Tier elites of the Jade Drop Majestic Empire weren’t delighted upon seeing this. Instead, they were utterly stunned.

‘Holy f*ck! What kind of physique is this? It’s far too freakish!’

One had to realize that Ling Han had been attacked by an elite at the peak stage of the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. Moreover, this elite was a four-star genius. As such, the might of his sword slash was already nearing the peak stage of the consummate level. That being the case, who dared to face his attacks head-on?

Ling Han’s speed hadn’t decreased, so it was clear that he had focused all of his energy on charging forward. As such, his defenses had naturally been at their weakest. Most importantly, he was only at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, so what would it matter even if he had defended with all his strength?

However, this still wasn’t the most astonishing thing. It wasn’t long before the Heavenly Body Tier elites sucked in another cold breath.

As they watched on, they saw the wound on Ling Han’s back healing at a rate that was visible to the naked eye. Before long, not even a scar was remaining!

If it weren’t for the streaks of blood on his back, who would believe that Ling Han had been cut by a sword just then?

Xiu!

Ling Han dashed into Point Star City at an incredible speed.

In fact, the distance between the mountain and Point Star City hadn’t been great, so how long would he—a Heavenly Body Tier elite—have needed to cover it?

The great elites of the Jade Drop Majestic Empire all chuckled coldly. Wasn’t entering Point Star City right now akin to running into a trap? So be it. They would destroy him along with this city.

Ling Han immediately unleashed his divine sense upon entering the city, discovering that there were eight powerful auras currently converged together. He immediately sprung into action, reaching that location in just a few strides.

Qu Qiuxue, the Left and Right Ministers, and the others appeared before him.

“What happened? Why did the city protection formation suddenly shut down?!” Ling Han roared.

Wary looks instantly appeared on the faces of Qu Qiuxue and the others. Right now, any outsider was a potential enemy.

Ling Han swept his gaze over them. There were several Great Generals who he had ever seen before, yet he immediately frowned after looking over all of them. “Where’s Ding Li’an?” he asked.

There were only eight Heavenly Body Tier elites present.

The Left Minister wore a dark expression, and he replied, “Today was Ding Li’an’s turn to take control of the city protection formation!”

“So it was was him who purposefully shut down the formation to allow enemies in?” Ling Han immediately connected the dots. His heart jolted, and he hurriedly turned to Qu Qiuxue, asking, “Where is Her Majesty? Hurry up and take me to her!”
