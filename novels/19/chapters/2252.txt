Chapter 2253: Tu Ta

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han saw many familiar faces here.

There was the alliance of Yi, Yan Xianlu, Fu Zhou, He Xinjue, and so on. However, he didn’t see the Empress, Hu Niu, and the others, nor did he see the Rain Emperor, Ji Wuming, and the other Monarch Stars.

There were also many people from the Foreign Realm, yet they kept their distance from those from the Celestial Realm. The two sides stood 50 kilometers from each other.

Ling Han didn’t plan on making a scene at this moment, so he simply fused with heaven and earth to observe the situation.

Everything was within his grasp. This was truly a peculiar feeling.

Many people enjoyed possessing influence and a lofty status, while others enjoyed absolute power. Both could manipulate peoples’ fate, yet this was still nothing compared to becoming the ruler of heaven and earth.

Every minuscule matter that occurred here was under his control. With a single thought, he could bring change to heaven and earth. Everyone was under his grasp—he could kill whom he wanted, and he could bully whom he wanted.

Ling Han could “see” that more people were making their way over.

After a long time, his spirit was finally lifted. This was because he saw the Empress, Hu Niu, Bewitching Maiden Rou, and the Rain Emperor.

The Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou had already reached the Fifth Secret, a reflection of their quick cultivation speed.

“Hmm?” The Empress suddenly stopped in her tracks. She had a strange feeling, and it was as if she were being observed by someone.

Hu Niu clapped her hands, and exclaimed, “It’s Niu’s Ling Han!” There was joy and delight on her face.

“Fourth Brother?” The Rain Emperor’s senses weren’t as keen as the two women’s, so he was slightly astonished.

“It’s me,” Ling Han’s voice said in their minds.

“Ling Han, where are you?” Hu Niu asked.

“I’m waiting for you guys at the destination,” Ling Han said with a smile.

The Rain Emperor was astounded. They were still incredibly far away from their destination, and he couldn’t sense Ling Han’s presence at all, yet Ling Han had been able to locate them with such precision. Not only that, but he had even used his divine sense to speak in their minds. Just what kind of power was this?

“Ling Han, Niu misses you!” Hu Niu said in a coquettish voice. She didn’t care about where Ling Han had been all these years, nor did she care about what he had been doing. She would be happy as long as she could see him again.

Ling Han nodded, smiling, and said, “I’ve also missed my Niu!”

“Teehee!”

Ling Han briefly told them about the Origin Magic Cube. In reality, there wasn’t too much to say. Most of the time, he had been in a confused and fuzzy state.

The Empress and the others couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. They hadn’t imagined that such a treasure existed in the neutral zone.

Meanwhile, their experiences these past years had also been extremely simple. They knew that Ling Han had definitely disappeared because of some rare opportunity, so they weren’t worried at all. They simply cultivated as normal. 1,000 years ago, the Rain Emperor had been taken away by the Eternity Celestial King to undergo focused cultivation.

The Rain Emperor had taken the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou with him, and he had clearly expressed that they either all receive nurturing, or he wouldn’t go at all.

Thus, the Empress and the others were also taken along with him. However, the Empress and Hu Niu were indeed worthy of nurturing, and it was only in the Dividing Soul Tier that they hadn’t reached a state of perfection. Even so, they could still reach the Eleventh Secret of the Immortal Palace Tier, and they could still climb to the lofty height of Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

The Rain Emperor’s freakish talent was also displayed, and he had already advanced to the Sixth Secret. All four of them had cultivated the Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique, while the Rain Emperor was more so advancing toward the Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique. He could transform into the flow of time itself, and this was an incredibly mysterious power.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t feel jealous, as he could also cultivate the Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique when he reached the Fifth Secret. With the possession of the Origin Magic Cube, he could more so transcend the Regulations, something which was far more powerful than any physique.

However, it was a shame that the Origin Magic Cube had already fused together with him. As such, he couldn’t let the Empress and the others comprehend it.

As they conversed, the Rain Emperor and the others finally arrived at the destination.

They met up with Ling Han, and the five of them didn’t attract much attention as they sat together. After all, the Rain Emperor wasn’t as renowned as Ji Wuming and the others. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

People slowly trickled in, and almost everyone had arrived now. Ling Han also saw Ji Wuming, Hong Huang, and the others, but these people naturally couldn’t see him.

‘Nine Celestial Kings have come. The number of Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm is also nine.’ Ling Han’s eyes were shut, yet he could see everything extremely clearly. ‘Is this something they agreed on earlier? Otherwise, how can there be such a coincidence?’

‘If there are only nine Celestial Kings, that’s a bit too few,’ he thought to himself.

He wanted to do something significant and kill enough Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm because such a trap could only be used once.

Whoosh!

A Celestial King from the Foreign Realm appeared, and there was a black lotus with 12 petals between his brows. This signified that he was equivalent to a Third Heaven Celestial King. He stood in the air, and the Regulations locked within his body were naturally astonishing in amount. In fact, the invaders from the Foreign Realm relied on such Regulations locked within their bodies to do battle. To them, this was no big deal.

“Begin,” he said in an apathetic voice. “We’ll fight an open tournament, where the winner can stay on and continue to battle. What do you say?”

An elite from the Celestial Realm stepped forward, and replied, “Accepted.”

To the Celestial Realm, such a format was even more beneficial. This was because a single victory could win them 10,000 years of preparation and rest time.

“Tu Ta, you go first,” the 12th Lotus elite said.

A cultivator from the Foreign Realm immediately flew forward, landing on the elevated platform in the center of the plain.

He had the body of an insect, a praying mantis. His blade-like arms were astonishing in length, and his six legs were also riddled with razor-sharp, gleaming spikes.

“Tu Ta, here to battle!” he roared as he waved his blade-like arms, emitting a sharp clanging sound. “Who wants to come up and accept death?”

“Arrogant insect!” a cultivator from the Celestial Realm spat as he leaped forward. He was a tall and elegant youth. Moreover, he was a Fifth Secret monarch tier!

In such tournaments, only monarch tiers could participate. Moreover, they needed to be at least at the Fifth Secret. Otherwise, wouldn’t the Celestial Realm have agreed to such a competition long ago? By delaying it, they were simply buying more time to raise the next generation of young prodigies.

Tu Ta lightly rubbed his two blade-like arms together, and said disdainfully, “No need to tell me your name, because I’ll never be able to remember trash like you!”

“Such arrogance!” the youth roared as he charged at Tu Ta.

The human and insect battled, and the cultivators from the Celestial Realm quickly developed a frown. Tu Ta was clearly enjoying the upper hand.

After 200 exchanges, the gulf between them became extremely evident, and even fools could tell who was at an advantage.

Seeing that the youth was in danger of death at any moment, a powerful figure from the Celestial Realm said, “Enough, we admit defeat in this battle.”

The youth wanted to retreat, yet Tu Ta wasn’t willing to comply. He swung his arms, unleashing a surging killing intent.

The powerful figure from the Celestial Realm humphed coldly, and he immediately reached over, saying, “I said, stop!”

Peng!

However, before he could press down, an elite from the Foreign Realm also reached over, grabbing his arm.

“This is a battle between youths, so why are you trying to interfere?” the elite from the Foreign Realm said coldly.

“Aaah!” There was a scream of wretched agony as the youth was cut in two at the waist by Tu Ta’s blade-like arms. However, when Tu Ta wanted to deal the killing blow, it was as if the youth had received the help of a god as he pushed up from the ground and miraculously shot away, landing in the crowd of cultivators from the Celestial Realm.

As if by a stroke of fortune, he escaped from the clutches of death. In reality, however, this was Ling Han’s doing in the shadows. As the ruler of this heaven and earth, he could naturally do this without alerting any of the Celestial Kings. It was simply as if the youth had suddenly unleashed the potential of his life.

Tu Ta abandoned his pursuit, and he simply wore a twisted expression as he stuck his tongue out to lick the blood on his blade-like arms.

“Next!” he said in a baleful voice.. He was radiating with burning killing intent.
