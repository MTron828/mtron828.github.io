Chapter 1234: Seeing Another Bewitching Beauty

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Lin Yuqi’s each and every action was seductive and bewitching.

Empress Luan Xing was born a stunning beauty, and even her silhouette was enough to draw people into endless fantasies. Meanwhile, this woman accentuated her charm through various kinds of small movements.

She swayed her bottom left and right... This was so seductive that people would barely be able to control themselves.

With each sway, the shape of her curvaceous bottom would be accentuated, revealing the breathtaking assets of this stunning beauty. If people saw this, they would feel an urge to reach over and caress her bottom so that they could personally experience its fullness, suppleness, and softness.

Ling Han guarded his mind closely. This was another bewitching beauty!

To his surprise, Lin Yuqi’s hairstyle wasn’t one of a married woman, even though the maid in azure had referred to her as milady1—generally speaking, married women would tie their hair into a bun. Young unmarried women definitely wouldn’t adopt such a hairstyle.

Lin Yuqi’s silky-black hair rolled down her back, only revealing a tiny bit of her snow-white neck. The silky-black and snow-white formed an intense contrast.

‘This has nothing to do with me,’ Ling Han immediately said in his mind.

Although she wasn’t married, did that mean he could take her as his own? Clearly not. Thus, he naturally didn’t need to take her charm to heart.

The carriage was only so big, yet Lin Yuqi somehow managed to walk for a long time. She seared the image of her bewitching figure into Ling Han’s mind. Only now did she turn around with a smile, and say, “Please sit, Young Master Ling!”

Her smile was as beautiful as 100 blossoming flowers. The entire carriage seemed to become more radiant and warm.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he sat down. He then asked, “Madam, for what reason did you invite me?”

He was in a hurry to go to the Water Element Valley at this moment, so he truly didn’t want to waste any time.

Lin Yuqi almost jumped up in anger upon seeing the hint of impatience in his eyes.

She was confident in her charm, and she enjoyed having people in the palm of her hand. She loved it when they became mesmerized with her, and she loved it when they embarrassed themselves or revealed the ugliness of their character. She never denied that she was a bewitching woman. This was just how aloof and heartless1 she was. Who told her to be so beautiful and bewitching? Her beauty allowed her to do anything she wanted.

However, Ling Han actually dared to feel impatient before her? This... This was a slap to her face!

If this impatience had been on Ling Han’s face, she could say with certainty that he was doing it on purpose—he was playing hard to get. If that were the case, he could be regarded as an experienced womanizer.

However, there was an expression of calm on Ling Han’s face. Meanwhile, that look of impatience was coming from his eyes. This led her to believe that he was truly impatient with her.

Eyes didn’t tell lies. Moreover, Lin Yuqi was a woman who had great experience in toying with men. He wasn’t having any improper thoughts about her, and she could easily detect this fact.

She was extremely ticked off!

Lin Yuqi calmed herself down. How could a bewitching beauty like her fail in seducing a small youth? She flashed him a beautiful smile. This was a mesmerizing smile that could melt even hardened steel. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Must I have a reason to invite Young Master Ling?” she asked lazily. It was as if her voice had little hands that tickled him softly, trying to arouse his flames of lust.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “If there’s nothing you want to say, then please excuse me for taking my leave!”

He stood up and turned around to leave.

“Oi! Oi!” Lin Yuqi was genuinely about to explode in anger. She dashed forward at an incredible speed and blocked Ling Han’s path. Ling Han’s expression suddenly became serious. This breathtaking and seemingly provocative woman was actually an elite!

In fact, he hadn’t even seen her movements clearly! It was extremely likely that if she had suddenly attacked him, he would have been hit!

However, her voluptuous breasts were right before him, almost about to touch him. Ling Han frowned, and had no option but to take a step back.

He already had enough lovers, and he naturally wouldn’t dump any of them. So, he definitely, definitely didn’t want to take any new partners.

Lin Yuqi squinted her eyes upon seeing this. Her eyes were each like a slit at this moment, yet they were still enough to capture any man in the world. She laughed in a silvery voice before asking softly, “What are you afraid of? Are you scared that I’ll bite?”

‘Holy sh*t!’

Ling Han nodded seriously, and said, “Madam, please watch yourself!”

Lin Yuqi let out a long and silvery laugh. Her breasts shook as she laughed, and they made one want to transform into a beast and leap onto her so that they could personally experience the size and sensation of her breasts.

“People all say that a concubine is better than a wife, and a lover is better than a concubine1. Hehe, want to experience someone else’s wife?” she murmured softly. Her voice was dripping with temptation.

‘Brat, submit to my charm!

‘Once you show any sign of affirmation, see how I beat you to death. I’ll then make you my slave, and have you become a coolie forever! Humph, that’s the price for daring to lust over me!’

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Madam, you’ve had too much to drink. You’re really quite drunk! Alright, I’ve got no time for such games. If you don’t allow me to leave, I’ll have no option but to destroy your carriage!”

Lin Yuqi was astounded. This man had rejected her yet again!

“Wu!” She suddenly sat down in sorrow and started to sob.

‘What are you playing at now?

‘I didn’t touch a single hair of yours, so why are you acting like someone harassed you?

‘The less time I spend with this woman the better. Time to leave!’

Ling Han was just about to leave, yet there was suddenly a blur in front of his eyes. Lin Yuqi, who had been squatting on the floor and sobbing just then, had blocked his path again. The strength of this woman was truly profound. Ling Han hadn’t noticed her movement at all.

“You’re bullying me!” Lin Yuqi sobbed. However, she was a seductive beauty to begin with, so her sobbing simply made people feel she was extremely pitiful. They would more so feel an intense urge to leap over and conquer her.

‘This kind of high and mighty noblewoman can best stimulate men’s desire to destroy and conquest. Men will yearn to rip her clothes off and make her kneel under their... F*ck!’ Ling Han grimaced as he suddenly came to his senses. This woman was far too enchanting. She had made his thoughts wander so far!

He hurriedly thought about Empress Luan Xing. Once her stunning appearance appeared in his mind, Lin Yuqi instantly lost her charm and luster. She appeared especially ordinary now, and nothing she did could make him feel aroused.

‘The empress can actually be used as a mind-purifying medicine! This is... brilliant!’

Lin Yuqi clicked her tongue in wonder. ‘I’ve already pulled out all my tricks, yet you actually seem disgusted?’

She was truly stumped at this moment. Could it be that she actually had to strip?

She was merely playing—playing with men’s emotions. However, she had no desire to sacrifice herself for such games.

“Young Master Ling, please sit!” she said with a serious expression. Was there still any trace of tears on her seductively beautiful face?

Ling Han was almost driven mad. ‘Are we that familiar with each other? Is it really alright for you to play around like that?’

However, the strength of this woman was truly profound. If she insisted on making him stay, there was no way that Ling Han could leave... unless he used his Black Tower. However, Ling Han had become more cautious after learning about the Celestial Realm, and he more so didn’t want to expose the secret of his Black Tower.

What kind of existence was the Black Tower?

The Reincarnation Tree needed 12 trillion years to mature in the outside world, yet this exorbitant amount of time was cut down to three years in the Black Tower. Although the Reincarnation Tree’s effects hadn’t reached its peak yet, it was still extremely heaven-defying.

This would probably be a precious treasure even in the Celestial Realm, right?

However, he still had yet to reach the Genesis Tier. So, wouldn’t he be seeking death if he allowed beings of the Celestial Realm to find out about his Black Tower?
