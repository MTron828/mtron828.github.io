Chapter 3601: Frightening Destruction Energy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor. Henyee Translations

So this was the essence of fire?

Ling Han picked up the fiery red thing on the ground. It looked a little like a flickering flame, and was very scorching, but in truth, it was not burning. It was just that the temperature was extremely high.

“All right, let’s move separately.” Ling Han nodded.

“All right!” the Calabash Brothers shouted one after another, running off on their little legs.

Ling Han had brought them over naturally because he wanted them to help him “fight monsters”. He had already tested out the battle prowess of the seven toddlers, and they were not much inferior to him.

An Innate Divine Physique was really that awesome. There was no need to cultivate at all, and one could naturally advance just by eating and drinking normally.

However, the little loli still followed Ling Han. She was a lazy person, so how could she be willing to be a coolie?

Ling Han didn’t mind either. If he didn’t have the little lolita’s help, he wouldn’t have been able to come to the Moonlight Planet either. This alone was enough help to him.

He charged into the midst of the flaming creatures, and began his barrage of attacks.

Peng, peng, peng! Under the crushing pressure of his powerful strength, they were completely outmatched, and he destroyed everything in his path, leaving behind a field of essence of flames.

The seven babies were also incredibly powerful, using all kinds of methods, pushing aside all obstacles in their way.

They headed deeper into the valley, smooth sailing all the way.

Even if this valley was very big, it could not hold up to the strength of the eight of them. In only half a day’s time, they had advanced to the end of the valley.

That was it?

“The fire here is strong, and the fire element is endless. Probably, tomorrow morning, the fire creatures will once again fill this valley to the brim,” the little loli said, licking the toffee.

Second Baby was also licking one. The seven babies and the little loli were already a group. She said, “However, there are a great many mountain caves in the valley, and there should be even more fire elements inside. Though I can’t see clearly, I can still sense a strong wave of fire energy.”

“Alright, then we’ll continue to move separately. Each person will take a cave, and after dealing with it, we’ll meet back here,” Ling Han said.

“Yes, Father.”

The babies dispersed one after another. Ling Han and the little loli also found a mountain cave. It was very big, and the cave mouth had to be fifteen meters tall. They had not even entered yet, but could already feel an intense burning sensation surging over.

This valley was already very hot, but the cave was even hotter.

Ling Han strode forwards, while the little loli pulled on the corner of his shirt and followed behind.

Not long after, a human-shaped flaming creature appeared ahead of them.

It was very tall, as tall as six meters, and its body was even more sturdy. However, it had arms but no legs. It just floated in midair like that, and there was a flaming halberd in its hand.

It was high level; those fiery creatures outside didn’t bring weapons.

This flaming creature also discovered Ling Han’s presence, and immediately floated over, launching an attack at Ling Han.

The halberd stabbed over, fierce flames raging.

This attack contained a powerful high-level energy, and the scorching flames could melt metal.

Ling Han threw a punch that was also enshrouded in flames, which landed on the tip of the halberd.

Peng!

Ling Han’s body trembled, and so did that monster. It was sent flying from the impact.

Its strength was not weak; he actually did not manage to insta-kill him with a single strike.

Ling Han pounced out again. Peng, peng, peng! He threw ten consecutive punches, and the flaming monster collapsed.

The elemental essence left behind this time was slightly larger than the outside.

En they were similarly farming monsters. Clearly, the gains here were greater, but outside, one punch was enough, while ten punches were needed here. Going by that calculation, in terms of efficiency, it was actually more profitable outside, but the fire monsters outside were farmed too slowly, so there was not enough for him to kill.

Unless… he could increase the efficiency of his slaughter here.

‘I got it!’

Ling Han continued to advance, and very soon, he saw a second large-sized fire monster. It similarly held a halberd in its hand, and the moment it discovered Ling Han, it immediately floated over and began to attack.

“Handsome Brother, go!” As the little loli licked the toffee, she cheered Ling

Han on.

Ling Han still threw a punch, but this time, his fist was wrapped in destructive energy, and it was completely dark.

Peng!

The punch landed on the halberd, and the black-colored energy instantly spread along the halberd’s body, quickly covering the entire body of the flaming monster. Then, this giant crumbled with a bang, leaving behind a streak of fire essence.

So awesome?

Even Ling Han himself experienced a shock. He knew that destructive energy was terrifying, but being powerful to this extent was still far beyond his expectations.

“Yi, Handsome Brother, are you on steroids?” Tang Yun’er was extremely stunned, and did not even lick the candy anymore. She wormed her head in, “This high-level energy is so terrifying, filled with destructive power.” Ling Han suddenly became curious. Where had Primordial True Lord obtained this Spirit Diagram from?

Did it have any relation to the reason the other had stayed behind in the Celestial Sea Planet?

He shook his head and put away the essence of the flames. Since his slaughter was so shocking, collecting the essence of the flames in this cave was obviously a good idea.

“It’s a secret!” He gestured for the little loli to keep quiet.

“AU right, I will keep your secret.” The little loli spread out her hands, “Adults are really troublesome.”

They advanced again, and Ling Han was completely unmatched. Once the destructive energy was unleashed, everything would be destroyed, and the destructive power was endless.

This cave was quite complicated. There were many crossroads, and Ling Han would take a right turn whenever he encountered a crossroads. He first constructed a three-dimensional map in his mind.

He quickly swept through one cave after another, and after returning to the starting point, he continued onwards.

Yi?

After walking for a while, he revealed a surprised expression, because he had already walked for a very long time, and he actually did not encounter a single flaming monster.

According to his previous experience, this shouldn’t be the case. At most, he would have to walk for a minute before he would definitely encounter a new flaming monster.

Unless… there was someone in front that was also killing monsters. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han quickened his pace. After walking for a while, a flaming monster appeared ahead of him, but he didn’t find anyone else.

Right at this moment, shua, a flash of Sword Qi rapidly stabbed down from the top of his head.

A cold smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. Since he was already suspicious, how could he be unprepared?

He stretched out his hand, and pa, grabbed onto the sword’s blade. The energy of Stone wrapped around his hand, and his defenses soared, allowing him to ignore the sharpness of the sword’s blade. Then, he pulled strongly and smashed down again, and a figure was sent flying and smashed onto the ground.

Peng!

Ling Han had used his full power, and under the powerful impact, that person instantly threw up blood madly.

This was a man who looked to be in his thirties. There was a scar on his face, which added a bit of toughness to him, but now that he had been knocked dizzy, he was actually unable to get back to his feet for the moment.

Ling Han casually waved his hand, and the sword in his hand instantly shot out, soaring towards the flaming monster in the distance.

The flaming monster discovered Ling Han’s presence, and it had already charged over. With a wave of its hand, it sent the sword flying. Its speed was practically unaffected.

But Ling Han followed up with another punch, and as destructive energy surged past, this flaming monster was blasted into smithereens.

At first, the man on the ground was still very fierce, but when he saw that the flaming monster was actually no match for Ling Han, and was directly destroyed, he shivered in fear, losing all his courage.

Ling Han put away the essence of the flames, then looked at the man, and asked, “Why did you sneak attack me?”
