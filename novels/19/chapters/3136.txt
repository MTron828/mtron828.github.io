3137 Proposing marriage

When martial arts began to flourish, everyone deduced that they would be ushering in a great era.

Thus, this also made people wonder if this was perhaps just an illusion.

One’s power was limited at times, and a Twelve Meridians could attain 50,000 kilograms of might. This was extremely terrifying. If one surpassed this foundation, would their human body be able to withstand it?

But now, they had seen an ancient corpse with their own eyes, and experienced the pressure that surpassed the Twelve Meridians, which instantly strengthened their hearts that yearned for improvement in martial arts.

There was no end to the path of martial arts. At least, if there was, it was definitely not the Twelve Meridians.

Everyone searched carefully, and discovered a smaller cave in the depths of the cave. That cave was connected to an underground river. They were sure that the female lizard should have followed this underground river and coincidentally arrived here.

It was strong because of the ancient corpse’s blood. Originally, it might only have regarded this place as its lair, but the miners just happened to dig through this place. Thus, the female lizard charged out, and treated everyone as its food.

“The ancient corpse can’t be moved, but the blood can,” Sun Jianfang immediately said. “Collect the blood and take it back for study.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They fetched vessels and collected the corpse blood, then brought it back to the Ancient Dao Sect.

The mine was reopened, and new miners were recruited to start work. There were also new supervisors in place. However, the last batch of miners was completely eliminated, leaving behind a terrifying legend. Later, the rumors spread that this mine had a demonic nature and would devour the miners, causing the Ancient Dao Sect to be unable to recruit people.

Ling Han also returned to the Ancient Dao Sect. His life returned to normal, and he spent all day cultivating.

He searched for information about formations on the optical computer, but unfortunately, there were very few books from the ancient times that had been unearthed. Aside from those find early on at the beginning, when there were also people who publicized them in order to increase the strength of the entire human race to fight against the Demonic Beasts.

As time progressed, everyone kept their techniques to themselves. For example, even the elders could only learn three to five moves of the Four Directional Fists, so how could they share it with all the surviving humans?

Thus, Ling Han could only learn the Three Elements Formation, the Three Elements Formation, and a few of the simplest formations. As for the more profound formations, perhaps books about formations hadn’t appeared yet, or perhaps someone had mastered it, but kept it secret.

Ling Han suddenly thought that if he had mastered high-level formations, he definitely wouldn’t have publicized it so widely. Now that the heaven and earth had changed, ancient sites had appeared one after another, yet they were all protected by formations. If he had mastered formations, he would be able to secretly make a fortune. Who would be stupid enough to publicize it?

Wasn’t he afraid that he would be captured by some force, and forced to focus on unraveling formations, yet would only be able to get a sliver of profit?

Several days passed, and Huan Xue walked over to report to Ling Han that someone wanted to pay him a visit.

“Who is it?” Ling Han asked. He had instructed Huan Xue that he would not meet any guests, but the usually obedient little female attendant actually reported it to him, indicating that the visitor was of high status, and Huan Xue could not refuse.

“Elder He,” Huan Xue said.

“Oh?” Ling Han was surprised. Why had He Guan come to find him?

He stood up. Since he knew that He Guan had come, he naturally had to personally go and receive him. Though the Dao Child was the future sect master, he was still not as powerful as an elder now.

‘Yi, what the hell was this?’

“No.” Ling Han also smiled, and invited the two of them in.

After exchanging pleasantries, He Guan praised Ling Han for a while. He praised Ling Han for being young and promising, causing Ling Han to doubt whether the person he was talking about was him or not. Was he, Ling Han, really that good?

Finally, He Guan finally revealed the true purpose of their trip.

“Dao Child Ling, you’re not young anymore. As the old saying goes, one can only aspire for success after marriage.” He wore a beaming smile, and continued, “I’m not boasting, but this granddaughter of mine is both beautiful and has good moral character. In the future, she’ll definitely be a good wife and mother!”

Ling Han was surprised. Was the old geezer trying to betroth He Miaoyin to him?

The problem was, Li Changdan had only been dead for a few days, and he was already impatient?

Ling Han looked at He Miaoyin, and this woman’s expression was filled with arrogance. He shook his head and said, “At present, I have no plans to marry, so I will have to disappoint Elder He’s kind offer.”

“Ling Han, what are you so smug about!” He Miaoyin immediately jumped up and pointed at Ling Han, her face filled with anger. “The fact that I agreed to marry you is already the virtue that your ancestors have accumulated for eight lifetimes, and you actually dare to despise me?”

“Little Yin!” He Guan hurriedly said darkly. He had just praised his granddaughter as the most virtuous and best wife, yet in the blink of an eye, she had revealed the face of an unruly young lady. Wasn’t this a slap to his face?

Only then did He Miaoyin shut up, but the corners of her lips still curled up, looking defiant.

“Hehe, marriage is a big matter, so there’s no need to rush to make a decision. You can consider carefully.” He Guan gave himself a way out, then left with his granddaughter.

“Young Master, thank goodness you didn’t agree. Otherwise, if you married Miss He, you would definitely be bullied in the future.” Huan Xue escorted them out, and when she returned, she began to complain.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “It’s always been me bullying others. How can I be bullied by others?”

He Miaoyin?

Hehe, even if he was given the position of master over the entire Celestial Sea Planet, he could not possibly marry such a woman.

However, after being rejected like this, the He Clan wouldn’t give up so easily, especially He Miaoyin. She was so conceited, and now that she had been rejected, she would definitely fly into a humiliated rage.

However, he already had the power of Ten Meridians, and only Ten Meridians elites or above could pose a threat to him. Could it be that He Miaoyin could still inciteexistences such as the elders to attack him?

He couldn’t be bothered to pay her any regard. In any case, he would deal with whatever came his way.

Another few days later, the appraisal of the ancient corpse’s blood was finally completed.

There were extremely astonishing energy factors contained within, which were extremely beneficial for the growth of living beings. However, there was also a great amount of poison contained within. If it was directly consumed, it could possibly be fatal.

This should also be the reason why those lizards had strong poison in their claws, but why did they not die?

It could only be assumed that these lizards were far more resistant to poison than humans.

Ling Han shook his head. He really didn’t want to touch something like the blood of a corpse. There were many ways to increase cultivation level, so there was no need to use this kind of thing.

However, while he had such scruples, the other disciples did not. They were all filled with anticipation, hoping that the successful development of these medicines would help them grow wings that could make them soar..

A few days later, Ling Han was called over by Sun Jianfang, who said that he had discovered the Volcanic Fruit.
