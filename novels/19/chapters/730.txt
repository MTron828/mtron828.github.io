Chapter 731: Slaying Zhou

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

“There’s no point in talking rubbish with him. Get rid of him and the Mystical Power will be ours!” Zhou Yu Cheng yelled from the side.

“True!” Zhou De Yuan nodded and headed in Ling Han’s direction in big strides, the aura of the Deity Transformation Tier unleashed. This was a show of his formidable might, made to terrorize Ling Han, and also to intimidate the others as well. The meaning was clear: this young man was his, so the lot of them should bear that in mind and weigh their decision carefully before laying a hand on him.

Ling Han looked upon these two members of the Zhou Clan and could not help but feel his killing intent boiling over. Previously, because of Zhou De Yuan’s strike, he’d missed the Earth Overturning Seal, and were it not for the fact that there was another chance... So what if he chopped Zhou De Yuan to pieces?

Earlier, he was too occupied to bother getting even with them, but now, they themselves sought him out, so was there a need for Ling Han to hold back?

He smiled drily as he taunted, “There’s a certain saying: the bird which takes the lead gets shot first... None of the others made any move, and only the two of you foolish birds jumped out. If this is not courting your own demise, then I don’t know what it is?”

“What impudence! Do you think that you can still act with such haughty air and high-handedness in front of Third Elder?” Zhou Yu Cheng said with his finger pointing at Ling Han. If not for his level being inferior to Ling Han’s, he really wanted to charge at him and tear him apart.

Zhou De Yuan’s gaze was also dark as he stretched out his right hand, drawing forth a pattern interwoven into the form of a dazzling light. He then gave a frosty snort and made a grab in Ling Han’s direction as his Origin Power gathered and transformed into an even bigger palm, swatting down from above straight at Ling Han.

Extremely swift and fierce, it was unleashed with the ultimate objective of taking Ling Han’s life.

Ling Han stood still and motionless, and waited for when the big hand came downward—only then did he strike out, his Sword Ray slashing forth. Pu , the big palm had then been divided into two, and its dazzling light completely vanished.

“Ah!” Zhou De Yuan involuntarily let out a groan, using his left hand to support his right hand. A terrible gash could be seen in the center of his right hand’s palm, where fresh blood was now flowing out. Pa, pa, pa , the blood dripped onto the ground, shaking the earth.

The blood of a Deity Transformation Tier cultivator was absolutely an invaluable tonic. For an Alchemist who had no scruples, it could even be collected to be used as an alchemical ingredient.

Zhou De Yuan hastily used his origin power to seal off the flowing blood and stop the blood loss. However, he was astonished to discover that there was a terrifying sword intent circulating within the wound—his origin power was being shattered to bits by it as the latter surged forth, in the end leaving pretty much none to seal the wound.

Blood... remained streaming.

How could this be possible? This guy’s battle prowess was so strong that only one strike already injured him so heavily?

Zhou De Yuan could not believe it. As he saw it, Ling Han was merely a junior in the Spiritual Infant Tier. Even earlier, when Zhou De Yuan had struck him, Ling Han also did not retaliate and just meekly yielded, daring not even to express any anger. If he was really this strong, then just why endure and put up with it earlier?

“Third Elder!” Zhou Yu Cheng was somewhat shaken. In his heart, he had always believed that the four elders of his clan were existences that ought to be able to sweep away any opposition in this world, yet how was it possible that one of them would lose out facing a young fellow?

Where Zhou De Yuan’s air of arrogance stemmed from was also where his confidence lay. Now that his third elder was actually injured by the opposing party’s strike, Zhou Yu Cheng immediately wanted to retreat, fearing the what if.

“Old wretch, since you insist on courting death, then I can only fulfill your wish!” Ling Han did not draw the Revere Life Sword or the Demon Birth Sword. Just now, he had merely brandished his two fingers, but he used the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, and it was precisely this Mystical Power that wreaked havoc within the opposing party’s wound, not letting it easily heal.

“I want to kill you!” Zhou De Yuan roared as he summoned forth his saber, brandishing it in a strike in Ling Han’s direction.

Xiu , a light over 300 meters long flashed out of the saber, transforming into a raging dragon.

Ling Han also drew out his sword. After all, the opponent was an existence at the peak of the Deity Transformation Tier. His strike from before could be said to have leveraged the other’s negligence, but he indeed should not underestimate his opponent. The sword he drew out was the Demon Birth Sword—it should suffice to tackle the likes of Zhou De Yuan.

If the Demon Birth Sword still had its tool spirit, it definitely would feel absolutely aggrieved, thinking: I am also an impressive Tenth Tier Spirit Tool, but have now actually been reduced to slaying a Deity Transformation Tier?

Shua , Sword Ray struck out, merely about 10 meters in length.

The power of Ray was decided by its length and its thickness. The longer and the thicker, the more frightful would be the destructive power of the Ray. Therefore, upon seeing that the Ray that Ling Han struck out was merely 10 meters long only, Zhou De Yuan’s heart immediately felt calm, while Zhou Yu Cheng on other hand also recovered his confidence. He had actually doubted his own elder... he had really thought too highly of that brat.

Pu!

The Sword Ray and the Saber Ray clashed, colliding against each other. Pu , the Saber Ray was actually broken into half!

Both broken halves of the Saber Ray still swept over in accordance with its original course, and actually streaked past on both sides of Ling Han’s body. He needed not give way—not even slightly. However, the Sword Ray was akin to an ultimate divine weapon as it continued sweeping over at Zhou De Yuan.

Zhou De Yuan was terror-stricken and hurriedly leaped into the air to evade, his face filled with fright and panic.

How could it be possible that his Saber Ray was actually so far off from Ling Han’s Sword Ray in terms of quality? In a head-on collision, it was crushed by the opponent’s Sword Ray... It was truly like a broken wooden sword running into a genuine sword, being promptly destroyed once touched.

He could not help but shudder somewhat. Indeed, the thicker and longer the Sword Ray, the better as the destructive power was even more powerful. However, similar to the Sword Qi, the Sword Ray’s power also depended on two other factors—the cultivator’s comprehension and the level of the weapon that the cultivator used.

That sword!

Zhou De Yuan absolutely did not believe that Ling Han’s understanding of the sword far exceeded his mastery of the saber. In that case, there was only one explanation: the level of the Spirit Tool within the opponent’s hand was too high, resulting in the Sword Ray being also extremely swift and fierce, not only making up for the gap of an entire cultivation tier in terms of quality, but still turning around to oppress him.

“Haha, this is also going to be mine!” In his heart, he has already concluded that Ling Han was actually depending on the strength of his Spirit Tool and not own strength being exceptional... even if Spirit Tool was also part of the actual strength.

He once again charged forth. He had to move with a dazzling speed to make Ling Han wield his sword in vain; he would then strike again to kill Ling Han and seize that treasured sword and the Mystical Power.

Ling Han stood motionless, appearing as if he was unable to catch sight of Zhou De Yuan’s figure at all.

Zhou De Yuan couldn’t help feeling jubilant. His figure, rapidly flashing past, had already appeared behind Ling Han and abruptly struck out in a chopping arc, slashing in the direction of Ling Han’s neck.

Just die, just die!

His saber struck. Zhou De Yuan was first delighted, but then felt greatly alarmed as Ling Han’s figure had somehow disappeared before him.

In his heart, a strong sense of uneasiness welled up immediately, and sure enough, a voice spoke out behind him. “What is it? Are you perhaps looking for me?” He was so shocked that his a*** tightened. The cold sweat all over his body instantly fell akin to a waterfall as he hastily turned around, wielded his saber, and struck out.

The Saber Ray’s extensive moves were piercingly cold as well as densely chilling.

But, the strike hit empty space again!

Could it be?

Just when Zhou De Yuan felt his heart was engulfed in a shocking breakdown, a voice again drifted over from behind. “I don’t want to play with you anymore.”

No! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Zhou De Yuan was just about to shout out, but... Pu , he only felt a coolness over his chest and back, and then noticed the sharp point of a sword protruding from his chest—it had already pierced his heart. He was both furious and shocked, actually being made to play a game of cat and mouse, yet the corners of his lips actually revealed a sneer.

He felt Ling Han underestimated a Deity Transformation Tier cultivator too much—achieving the kind of high level he was at, how was it possible that he could die so easily? His life and vitality were too powerful. So what if his heart had ruptured, he could condense his Origin Power while taking life-saving treasured elixirs and he still could live on.

However, your one strike pierced through my body—if I wield another strike, how would you be able to dodge any longer?

Zhou De Yuan wanted to turn around and strike out, but immediately realized that his origin power was like the floodwater from an opened floodgate—he was unable to condense it in any way as it flowed endlessly. Pa , he didn’t even have the strength to hold his weapon as the treasured saber fell, the sharp point of the saber slicing downward and in the end slashing off half of his right foot.

A Deity Transformation Tier cultivator without the protection of his Origin Power—how different was he from a Body Refining Tier one?
