Chapter 2232: Poison pills

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han and the others entered into the neutral zone.

Thankfully, because this zone was continuously widening, being close to covering the connecting point between the two Realms, the Foreign Realm rarely launched offensives in the recent days—only those below the Ascending Origin Tier could come over here, so what was the point of fighting?

The Foreign Realm had only brought up the motion of conducting a spar among the Immortal Palace Tiers of the present generation, but the Celestial Realm had not agreed, fearing that this would again end in a terrible and serious humiliation.

In any case, they could not do as they liked, could they?

After entering into the neutral zone, the five of them relaxed.

The Regulations of this place were not recognized by the Celestial Realm. Even if a Celestial King had come, he would very quickly become useless. Thus, they had completely no need to worry that the divine sense of Celestial Kings would extend inside here. That was an absolute impossibility.

Their goal was to do a sweep of the creatures here. With the heaven and earth newly created, every creature was actually a supreme treasure.

Ling Han and his group had always had good luck. Very soon, they encountered a creature that was unique to this place—one that had reached the Immortal Palace Tier at that. The five of them charged forwards, and dealt with this creature that looked like a combination of a deer and goat in a few strokes.

When they dissected it, as expected, there was a fruit tree being nurtured in its heart, and the tree had born three large fruits, emanating a refreshing fragrance.

“Strange, the time this area has been formed should not reach 100 years, so how could such a powerful creature be nurtured here, as well as an astonishingly aged celestial medicine?” The Rain Emperor looked at all corners of the heaven and earth, looking puzzled.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “The secrets of the heaven and earth are not something that the present us can perceive.”

The Empress nodded, and remarked, “The Regulations are subsidiary to the heaven and earth. Even the most mysterious Regulations of Time are only serving the heaven and earth. In that case, it would not be strange that creatures that are aged hundreds of millions of years old could appear here when only a short 100 years has passed in the outside world.”

Ling Han stowed this creature away. He had tried it. Consuming the flesh of this kind of beast could slightly replenish the power of Regulation that had been expended.

For him, this little bit of use was not effective, but for others, it would be of astonishing help.

Ling Han understood it with some thought. It was through exhaustion that he had defeated Shen Chao. The flesh of this beast could replenish Regulations, and it meant that others would be able to replicate his miracle.

“However, the power of Regulation in the meat is limited, and could never compare to the energy stored in the Black Tower.” Ling Han scrambled his brains. “But I can think of some way, and turn this meat into an alchemical pill, increasing its effects of recovery.”

“No, no!” Hu Niu hurriedly grabbed Ling Han’s thigh. “Niu wants to eat meat, Niu doesn’t want to take alchemical pills. Bitter!”

Ling Han didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Aside from eating, what else did this little girl think about?

“Play, of course!” Hu Niu declared self-righteously.

Ling Han and the others were amused. With such a high natural talent in cultivation, yet having a disposition so playful and voracious, she was probably the only one like this in this whole world. This was practically an exorbitant waste.

If this little girl had been willing to spare more effort on cultivation, her accomplishments definitely would not have been limited to what she’d thus achieved.

The five of them continued their journey, doing a sweep their whole way. However, there were pitifully few living creatures here, and there wasn’t even a blade of grass on the barren ground.

…Now, the heaven and earth here were newly created. Each blade of grass and each tree were all “Sources,” and were precious treasures.

Of course, the creatures here were strange. It might be that they were all hybrids of animal and plant, and pure plants could not possibly appear.

They swept onwards continuously for a month, and finally decided to return.

Their leave was close to ending, and Nie Heshan would have a new mission to assign to them.

However, before they returned, Ling Han ventured again to that valley from before, wanting to check on that creature underground. But, he did not dare release his divine sense, because he discovered that the creature had strengthened a bit merely by slightly probing the surface.

As expected, this heaven and earth was presently rapidly perfecting its Regulations, and a stronger creature was about to come into existence in this space.

“Can we kill this creature?” Ling Han and the others were all thinking this.

Every single creature here was equivalent to a Source Beast, and even had its own celestial medicine, which had astonishing effects.

Though a market had not yet formed at present, they were sure that as more people discovered the use of these creatures, their corpses, and the celestial medicine in their heart, would go for astronomical prices.

By then, it would be difficult to hunt these creatures. This place had no lack of prodigies and elites.

Hence, Ling Han and his group wanted to take advantage of this opening when the trend had not yet begun to take down that great Ascending Origin Tier beast as soon as possible.

The problem was that they were all only Immortal Palace Tiers, so wasn’t having designs on a great beast of Ascending Origin Tier delusional?

“It is not that we are completely without a chance.” The Empress planned in advance. “This great beast has a very large weakness: it is kind of being suppressed already, and cannot move the slightest bit… At the very least, it cannot leave there.”

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded. He pondered. “Right, though even our battle prowess combined together cannot match an Ascending Origin Tier, I am a Four-Star Alchemist, so I can concoct Four-Star alchemical pills.

“And Four Star alchemical pills are not just limited to tonics, but also… poison!”

He had never studied poison before, because there was absolutely no need, but now he had that kind of idea.

After returning to camp, Ling Han immediately entered into the Black Tower, and began to concoct poison pills.

Only two days had passed in the outside world, and Ling Han had already found a suitable poison. Thinking of how he had to conceal its aura, he could disguise it as an excellent Celestial pill.

However, before he had the time to purchase the ingredients for the poison, the 17th camp mobilized completely, heading to a location for training.

This time, it was not the neutral zone. Instead, they retreated to the desolate plains behind Clear Heaven Pass.

This was the second battlefield between the Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm. A great many elites of both Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm had died in battle here, and after countless years, the number of elites who had died was chilling.

Their mission was very simple, and that was to roam around in the desolate plains. The time assigned was one month. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ling Han had walked over this desolate plain before, and knew that this was actually quite a frightening place. That powerful aura and pressure it exuded were really too strong.

Moreover, they were not taking the same route they had taken before.

…Previously, the path that Ling Han and the others had walked had actually been deliberately opened up, and a great number of corpses of elites had already been moved away, but the place that they now had to roam was a region that had not been dealt with at all.

Nie Heshan still divided them into 20 small teams, and they were to move separately.

Shen Chao humphed, and moved independently while bringing the six natives with him, ignoring Ling Han and the other disciples of Saintly Origin Academy altogether.

Ling Han was also pleased with the situation. What the eye didn’t see, the heart didn’t fret over. With that kind of havoc, the conflict between the natives and outsiders would probably become bigger and bigger.

He couldn’t help but sigh. The invasion of the Foreign Realm was close at hand, but there were still a great many people that had focused their energy on internal strife, wasting time and energy for nothing. However, he smiled bitterly. The most useless should be those three Heavenly Venerates, right? Otherwise, if they were willing to interfere, the fighting of Clear Heaven Pass would definitely not be so critical.

…If he could recall how he had been the victim of an attack from the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate at the Timestream, he would probably feel even sicker at heart.

He was not in a good mood, and was silent as he walked ahead of them, and Mei Hua and the others naturally would not dare say anything, either, so the atmosphere appeared extremely depressed.

While they were walking, they heard cracking sounds ring out. A white skeleton had popped up out of who knew where. It was nine meters tall and strangely shaped. Words could not describe its exact appearance..
