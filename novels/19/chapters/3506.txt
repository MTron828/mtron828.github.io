Chapter 3507: Might of the colossus

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At the entrance, Shen Tian, Tu Jianbai and the others were all standing, all glaring angrily at Ling Han.

They were incompetent, and actually needed Gongsun Liang to personally move out. Naturally, they would be embarrassed, and all this was blamed on Ling Han – as a beauty, Princess Bixiao decisively avoided a great deal of aggression.

Ling Han smiled, “Why would Sect Leader Gongsun say such a thing? Could it be that you think that Princess Bixiao and I, two high-ranking officials of the Imperial Court and personally appointed as the Department Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department by the Holy Emperor, would actually do something like theft and theft?”

Princess Bixiao instantly felt disdain in her heart. This guy was really shameless. It was clearly him who had done it, yet now, he was actually making excuses in such a self-righteous manner.

En, she definitely could not trust him in future.

Gongsun Liang’s eyes flickered, and he was just about to flip out. However, he was extremely wary of Chen Fengyan’s strength. Even if he had already found a backer, he was still unwilling to completely become hostile with Chen Fengyan. After all, what Core Formation Tier cultivator would become his bodyguard and protect him every day?

If he killed Ling Han and Princess Bixiao, he would have completely offended Chen Fengyan. At that time, that could possibly planting the seed for his destruction.

Thus, unless it was absolutely necessary, he did not want to kill anyone. “What’s the point of quibbling in front of me?” he said calmly. “In fact, on the basis that you have the ability to sneak into the treasure chamber right under my nose, I will even allow you to keep a few things, but that broken stone tablet must be returned to me.”

Ling Han was astounded. Gongsun Liang would even allow them to keep One Star materials, yet he only wanted that broken stone tablet that was made of some unknown material and used for some unknown purpose. This meant that he definitely knew how valuable the broken stone tablet was.

Previously, Gongsun Liang had tried his best to put them off and drag out the time, but now that the treasure chamber had been robbed, he appeared almost at the first instant. What did that mean?

This broken stone tablet was too important, so important that he had no choice but to appear.

Ling Han naturally could not possibly return the item to him. Since he had stolen it with his own abilities, what right did he have to make him hand it over?

Gongsun Liang?

In the territory of the Dark North Nation, he had occupied an area of territory and established his own rule. Now that he and Princess Bixiao had come on behalf of the Majestic Empire, this guy avoided them andplayed dumb. It was clear that he would stubbornly resist to the end, so there was no need to be polite to this kind of person.

Ling Han shook his head, “Sect Leader Gongsun, you previously said that the Imperial Capital was too far away, and you did not manage to make it here.

Now that we have come, we would like to ask Sect Leader Gongsun, what exactly is your decision?”

Gongsun Liang was furious. Ling Han actually dared to ask him a question?

A mere Inscription Tier cultivator was inferior to even an ant in his eyes, and he actually dared to question him and embarrass him?

Was he certain that he would not dare to become hostile with Chen Fengyan?

He humphed, and said, “In front of me, what right do you have to ask questions? Answer whatever I ask. If I am not satisfied, don’t even think of leaving this place alive.”

“My patience is limited. Don’t force me to commit murder.

Hearing Gongsun Liang’s words, Shen Tian and the others also rebuked him one after another, telling Ling Han not to cause trouble for himself, and to quickly obey obediently.

Ling Han shook his head and said, “Sect Leader Gongsun, then I’ll take your words as a rejection of the imperial court’s offer of amnesty.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“A mere mortal dares to be so outrageously bold!” Gongsun Liang finally couldn’t hold himself back from making a move. Boom, endless power of heaven and earth condensed, turning into a large black hand the size of a well, which struck out at Ling Han.

“Go!” Ling Han tossed out the golden bull. With a moo, golden light flashed, and the golden bull’s figure enlarged, crashing towards that large black hand. Peng, this large hand was immediately shattered.

The golden bull shook its head, and charged towards Gongsun Liang.

Peng, peng, peng! The golden bull’s speed was extremely fast. As it raced, multiple streaks of golden light turned into arrows that shot rapidly towards Gongsun Liang.

Gongsun Liang couldn’t help but feel startled. Frowning, he asked, “A puppet?

A mechanical beast?”

Peng!

The golden bull crashed over, and Gongsun Liang could only parry. He was a Foundation Building elite, and had crossed the Celestial Gate, forming the foundation of human Dao. His battle prowess was unimaginably powerful. He opened his mouth and spat out a silvery Sword Qi, which turned into a flying sword that sliced towards the golden bull.

However, since the golden bull was bestowed by Chen Fengyan, as a powerful lackey of the Foreign Affairs Department, how could ordinary Foundation Building elites deal with it?

The golden bull didn’t dodge or evade. Instead, it charged forward. Peng! The silver sword instantly shattered, transforming into countless broken stars. Gongsun Liang’s expression involuntarily changed. How could this golden bull be so powerful?

He hurriedly drew out a large saber. Once it was activated, instantly, endless veined patterns shone with light, incredibly blinding, as if they were even more dazzling than the sun, brandishing it in a slash towards the golden bull.

Clang!

The saber struck the horn of the golden bull, and countless shards of light exploded, falling in all directions.

Ling Han, Princess Bixiao, Shen Tian, and the others hurriedly dodged. As long as these shards of light touched them, it was guaranteed that they would immediately explode into pieces, and there would not be a single complete corpse.

As the saying went, when immortals fought, mortals would suffer. This was precisely the logic.

“Come!” With a wave of Gongsun Liang’s hand, Spiritual Power transformed into a giant hand that grabbed a rock the size of a house and smashed it at the golden bull. In an instant, it reached ten times the speed of sound, whistling through the air as it did so.

No matter what, this rock weighed at least more than 50,000kg, and it could actually accelerate to ten times the speed of sound. Furthermore, it was being activated by pure Spiritual Power. This was practically like a fantasy story.

Ling Han was astonished. If Gongsun Liang’s attack had been delivered through the Heavenly Pattern Jade, just how powerful would it have been?

No wonder the Heavenly Pattern Jade could be ranked as a Two Star precious material. For elites of Celestial Path, the Heavenly Pattern Jade could become a deadly weapon in their hands.

Peng, the golden bull possessed an incredibly tough physique, and when it collided head-on, the massive rock immediately crumbled.

It was practically unhindered as it continued to chase after Gongsun Liang. Gongsun Liang used his trump cards frequently. The Spiritual Power of Celestial Path elites was frighteningly strong, and the Spiritual Power took form, endlessly grabbing rocks to blast at the golden bull. Furthermore, the long saber in his hand was also a One Star Spirit Tool. It drew on the power of heaven and earth, its divine might immeasurable.

But against the golden bull, all this was futile.

It was unknown what material the golden bull was forged from. Any attack that landed on it would be completely deflected, and could not cause the slightest bit of damage to it.

“En, this formation is really brilliant.” Second Baby looked at it, and evaluated. Seeing Ling Han glance over, she explained, “Actually, the materials used to forge the golden bull are not all that valuable. They are only One Star-level, but there are at least four formations laid out on them. One is the Shrinking Formation, one is the Iron Sheet Formation, one is the Storm Formation, and the last is the Rocket Formation.”

Ling Han nodded. The reason why the golden bull could shrink was naturally because of the Shrinking Formation, and the Iron Sheet Formation allowed it to be indestructible. The Storm Formation allowed its speed to be astonishingly fast, and the flaming arrows it spat out were the Rocket Formation.

Second Baby’s words had just fallen, when he saw the golden bull open its mouth. Xiu, xiu, xiu, at least several hundred fire arrows shot out simultaneously, as if they were burning the skies, descending towards Gongsun Liang..
