Chapter 3481: Caught up

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng, peng, peng! The golem ran. It didn’t know qinggong, nor did it know movement techniques. It simply relied on its massive power to propel itself forward. With a leap, it jumped into the distance, and with another step, it had traversed the distance of several meters.

The palace was very large and spacious. Otherwise, with the golem being fifteen meters tall, it wouldn’t even be able to stand upright.

On the way, Ling Han passed by a great many doors. By the looks of it, they should have been tightly closed, but they had been violently smashed open, and there were clear signs of damage.

This benefited Ling Han. He didn’t need to expend any effort to get through them.

He ran and ran, and about four hours later, he finally saw eight golems ahead of him.

They were currently engaged in an intense battle. It was three against five, and it should be the five members of the Demon Race that were ganging up on the three humans.

There was a slight difference among the nine golems. Ling Han used his memory from before to identify the eight of them.

This was Hong Tianbu, this was Princess Bixiao, this was Hu Er, this was… he recognized all eight of them with a single glance.

Hearing the loud commotion caused by Ling Han’s arrival, the eight of them stopped fighting at the same time, and then looked towards him.

“Ling Han, you’re finally here!” Wu Lidong’s divine sense fluctuated, and it was impossible for sound to transmit out of the stone statue at this moment. Thus, he could only communicate through his divine sense.

Ling Han smiled, and asked with his divine sense, “Was I late?”

“Better late than never,” Mei Hua said as well. “We can’t hold on much longer!”

Only Hong Tianbu did not speak. He was too proud, and thought that he alone was enough to sweep aside the five members of the Demon Race. Even if others came, they would only be a burden to him, and would only lead to the opposite effect.

“A guy who has spent so many days to reach 90% compatibility, do you guys expect him to turn the tables for you?” Xiong Bao laughed loudly. He leaped over, and threw a punch at Ling Han, “Just see how I will deal with him with a single punch!”

The golem raced over, and threw a straight punch. Hong long long, there was no technique to speak of, but the momentum was astonishing.

Ling Han clenched his hand into a fist, and his elbow was slightly pulled back. Then, when Xiong Bao charged over, he threw a punch.

Peng!

The two stone fists crashed into each other, and Xiong Bao retreated continuously. In a single breath, he retreated more than thirty meters, and when he crashed into a pillar, his retreat was finally stopped.

One punch… stunned everyone.

F***, this was too powerful, wasn’t it?

No matter how wide the gap was between their cultivation levels, no matter how wide the gap was between their battle prowess at the same cultivation level, after fusing into the golem, it was greatly shrunk.

Even for those as strong as Hu Er and Hong Tianbu, their strength was only around 70,000kg, while Princess Bixiao’s strength was 65,000kg, while Xiong Bao, Mei Hua and the others all looked to be around 60,000kg.

There was indeed a difference, but if it was just this bit of power difference, it was very difficult for a battle to be decided so decisively. On the other hand, because the Demon Race had the advantage in numbers, they were completely on the upper hand.

Inside the golem, movement techniques couldn’t be cast, and martial arts techniques couldn’t be used. It was like a normal person fighting; they could only compete in power and adaptability.

Inside the palace, there were many tightly shut doors that had to be blasted open, and this took a very long time. Thus, even if Xiong Bao and the others came in later, they still caught up to Hong Tianbu and Hu Er, who were in front of them. And once there were more of them, the battle became more and more of a stalemate.

If they could easily end the battle, it wouldn’t have been to the point that no one had reached the end of the palace.

But now?

Ling Han’s punch actually caused Xiong Bao to retreat more than 30 meters. It was possible that the power behind this punch was even more terrifying.

All of a sudden, a powerful wariness rose up in the other eight people.

If everyone’s abilities were equal, then it would be fine, as they would restrain each other, but now that Ling Han was the only prodigy among them, he had incited the common hostility of the other eight people.

In a fair competition, who would be Ling Han’s match?

This brat had stayed outside for so long. As it turned out, it was not that his compatibility had improved slowly, but rather that he was improving his battle prowess.

The question was, how had he done it?

Only by surpassing one’s cultivation level could one increase the golem’s power, but could this ability be increased after cultivating for two to three days?

When Ling Han saw them, he immediately knew what these eight people were thinking. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

—They had to deal with him first. Otherwise, none of them could possibly reach the summit.

Only if their abilities were equal would there be a chance for them to compete. Otherwise, it would be a one-sided battle.

Ling Han smiled faintly, completely unconcerned. He was the strongest in the same cultivation level, so what need was there for him to fear being ganged up on?

“Come!” He took the initiative to charge out.

“Human brat, you are too arrogant!” Ying Pokong approached and took the initiative to attack.

Hu Taifeng worked closely with him as he charged over from the other side.

Ling Han was unafraid. When the two of them were close enough, he swung his fists repeatedly.

Peng! Peng!

The two golems were instantly sent flying, but Ling Han was also hit twice. Though there was not the slightest bit of damage to him, he received a notification, “The defensive energy has weakened by 30%. When it falls below zero, the doppelganger would be injured, and if the damage level reaches 100%, it would be unable to continue fighting.”

“The defensive energy will automatically recover in non-combat state, recovering one point every ten seconds.”

Ling Han was surprised. So there was actually such a setting?

No wonder Xiong Bao had stopped attacking after sustaining a punch. It must be that his defensive energy had been completely expended, or was close to the bottom. Thus, he needed to leave the battle, and wait for the defensive energy to recover.

“Little Brother Ling, I’m sorry!” Mei Hua also charged over. Ling Han’s strength had already surpassed the threat of the Demon Race. At least, if it was a three-on-five battle between them, though they were at a disadvantage, it was not that they were completely outmatched.

But if Ling Han was not eliminated first, then whether it was the Demon Race group of five or the human group of three, they could not possibly be a match for Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, completely unafraid.

He greeted the oncoming attack with a punch. Peng, peng, peng! He was engaged in a fierce battle with Mei Hua, and the others were not idle either. They all rushed forwards, joining the ranks of the besiegers.

However, Hu Taifeng, Xiong Bao, and Ying Pokong didn’t approach. They were making the most of their time to recover their defensive power.

This was very disadvantageous to Ling Han. He was going to lose a portion of his defensive energy, and in a situation when they were ganging up on him, it was impossible to recover. In a prolonged battle, the defensive energy would definitely be completely exhausted, and the subsequent attacks would cause damage to the golem, right until it was forced out of the competition.

‘You people are being far too naive.’

Ling Han’s legs bent slightly, and suddenly burst out with power. Peng, the golem instantly soared into the skies, leaping a total of 27 meters into the air. He grabbed onto the hanging ornament on top of the palace hall, and jumped around like an ape.

Peng, when his figure landed, he had already appeared beside Xiong Bao and the others.

F***, he could do that?

Hong Tianbu and the others were all stunned. They naturally tried the golem’s jumping ability, but it could only jump nine meters high. Mainly, the golem itself was too heavy, so even if it had over 50,000kg of power, it couldn’t jump very high.

This was not enough to touch the top of the palace hall, so they naturally could not possibly be like Ling Han, who had escaped the battle from above like an ape.

After fusing with the golem, everyone’s reaction was slightly slow. They turned around sluggishly, and rushed towards Ling Han again.

Ling Han smiled, clenched his hand into a fist, and fired a series of punches at Xiong Bao..
