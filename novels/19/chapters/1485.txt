Chapter 1486 Returning Kindness with Hatred

“Wife, let’s go!” Ling Han said solemnly. It was clear that he was already extremely displeased at this moment.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded as she placed the little boy down. If a Heavenly Body Tier elite wanted to break free, how could someone at the Shattering Void Tier stop them?

The little boy started to pout, a look of sadness on his face. He then suddenly turned around and sprinted into the courtyard. There were tears streaking down his face, and he screamed, “Mom! Mom! Mom!” Great, he was crying for his mother now.

“You can’t leave until Young Master Yun gives you permission to do so!” the old man said balefully. He released his heavenly bodies, which spread throughout the sky like a heavenly river. These heavenly bodies were incredibly radiant, and there were 9999 of them in total.

He was at the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and he was just a step away from advancing to the consummate level. However, this was an incredibly challenging barrier, and it would be astonishingly difficult to condense the 10,000th heavenly body. Perhaps he wouldn’t be able to condense this heavenly body even if he lived for 10 more lifetimes.

In any case, each of the heavenly bodies surrounding him was brilliant and dazzling. Moreover, they all exuded a powerful aura that was unique to Eternal River Tier elites. This aura was extremely close to being able to resonate with heaven and earth.

Compared to this, Ling Han’s measly five heavenly bodies appeared to be incredibly shabby.

There was a huge gulf between both their cultivation level and power. They were on two completely different levels. Moreover, even if Ling Han’s power could surpass six stars, that would still only elevate his power to the late stage of the medium extreme. Meanwhile, even if the old man weren’t a one-star genius, the difference in their power would still be a whopping five stars.

Although power wasn’t a complete representation of battle prowess, such a huge gulf would still give the old man a crushing advantage. Before such formidable power, what use were techniques and skills?

Not to mention, the huge gulf between their cultivation levels also meant that the old man was planets ahead of Lin Han when it came to their grasp of the Regulations of heaven and earth.

Ling Han’s power simply couldn’t compare to that of the old man. In fact, he didn’t even possess the right to challenge him!

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stepped back, giving Ling Han space so that he could battle without any worries.

“I’ve come to realize that the conscience of many people has been swallowed by dogs. We brought the little boy back in a gesture of goodwill, yet this is how you treat us? If everyone is like you, who would still dare to offer gestures of goodwill in the future?” Ling Han said calmly. “Old geezer, if you fall over one day, and no one comes over to help you, letting you slowly rot on the ground, how would you feel?”

The old man was instantly enraged. What was his cultivation level? Would he not be able to get up if he fell over? The tongue of this brat was far too toxic. He was actually cursing him to die!

“This world is fair. That is, those who are powerful are kings!” the old man said coldly.

“Since you want to twist the facts, I have no choice but to subdue you with force.” Fighting spirit exploded from Ling Han’s body as he tore through the old man’s sea of heavenly bodies.

“You still had yet to be born when I was commanding the sea and waves!” The old man lashed out again, several hundred dazzling heavenly bodies on his palm.

He didn’t need to unleash his full power. Were several hundred heavenly bodies not enough to suppress a cultivator at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier?

It was a shame that he hadn’t witnessed Ling Han’s heavenly bodies. Those were heavenly bodies that were several hundred times larger than those of ordinary Eternal River Tier elites. As such, Ling Han’s five heavenly bodies could be wielded as if they were 500. That being the case, how could he be suppressed by a mere several hundred heavenly bodies?

Ling Han didn’t activate the Yinyang Five Element Formation. Instead, he simply replied with a casual punch.

The two of them exchanged another strike. However, the commotion this time was far greater than the last. In fact, even the space surrounding them was violently torn apart. If someone were to wander into this area, their body would be instantly torn into countless shreds.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had already retreated sufficiently far enough, yet she was still pushed several hundred meters back upon being struck by the shock wave of their exchange. Only after retreating into a huge boulder was she able to stop and stabilize herself.

Ling Han retracted his fist and clasped his hands behind his back, calmly saying, “The young are gradually overtaking the old now. It’s time for you to retire and enjoy the last moments of your life.”

The old man couldn’t help but feel astonished. He couldn’t underestimate this young man any longer. After all, his power was already nearing the peak stage of the medium extreme! He chuckled strangely, and said, “Young man, your power is indeed extraordinary. It’s no wonder that you were able to enter the academy. However, this old man is at the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier!”

As he said this, he lashed out for the third time. This time, however, all of the heavenly bodies around him lit up, unleashing a vast and seemingly boundless power.

He was unleashing his full strength.

In reality, Ling Han could choose to face this attack head-on. Even if he didn’t channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his physique had already surpassed the toughness of Level 14 Godly metal, and was nearing the toughness of Level 15 Godly metal. Thus, he could face the attack of an elite at the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier head-on.

However, he hadn’t come here to suffer a beating! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He made a pointing motion, and the 10 killing formations inside his body instantly started to circulate, transforming into cold and vicious killing intent. This killing intent then intertwined with his Sword Qi as it slashed at the old man.

Shua!

This was Sword Qi that had simply been unleashed from his fingers, yet it was dazzling and formidable as it soared into the skies.

Peng!

Ling Han was pushed several hundred meters back before he was finally able to stabilize his body. It was clear that his power was still lacking. However, his physique was far too freakish, and thus he didn’t even spit blood after being struck by this overwhelming shock wave. Meanwhile, the old man groaned in pain. Raising his hand, he more so found that there was blood seeping from the webbing of his hand.

During their exchange just then, it had appeared as if Ling Han had suffered greater damage. However, in reality, it was the old man who had suffered more. The reason for this was simple—Ling Han’s skin was far too thick.

“Good one, brat!” The old man’s beard and hair all stood on ends as a look of anger spread across his face. He was incandescent with rage.

How many years had it been? When was the last time he had suffered such damage?

Ling Han stood tall and proud before him. The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had always been incredibly effective when it came to defensive ability. Now that he had combined it with the power of formations, he was finally able to elevate his offensive ability to a formidable level as well.

In the Celestial Realm, Ding Yaolong was able to challenge elites two minor levels above him simply because he had grasped Tide of the Ages. However, could Tide of the Ages compare to the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll? It wouldn’t make sense if Ling Han couldn’t challenge elites who were two or three minor levels above him!

In the past, Ling Han had only been missing a trigger. Now that he had finally learned how to use his body as a formation, it was as if he had been given wings. His power had soared to a new height.

Moreover, this was in light of the fact that he had only just broken through, and not had the time to swap his formations out for a Level 15 killing formation. Otherwise, upon circulating his 10 killing formations, he could even kill elites at the peak stage of the high extreme!

The old man suddenly shuddered at this moment. This wasn’t out of fright. Rather, it was because he had activated all of his Qi and blood.

Those at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier had a lifespan of 100 million years. Meanwhile, those at the high extreme had a lifespan of 300 million years. Of course, these were the limits under the most ideal situations. In reality, most elites couldn’t enjoy such a long life.

Thus, during the latter stages of their life, cultivators would definitely exert strict control over their blood and Qi, preventing them from being overly consumed. Only by maintaining this strict control would they be able to live to the limit of their lifespan.

This old man was already nearing the tail end of his life. Thus, during ordinary times, his blood and Qi would be in a deep slumber. This was to prevent excess consumption. However, his opponent at this moment was far too powerful, so he had no choice but to activate his blood and Qi. This was destined to be an intense and dazzling battle.

Otherwise... it was very likely that he would be defeated by this young man.

Boom!

A terrifying aura erupted from his body, enveloping him in a divine halo. It was as if he were a god who had just descended into this world.

This was the true power of an elite at the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier!

“Good boy, don’t cry. Mom will definitely bring your wife back for you!” At this moment, a voice suddenly traveled out from within the courtyard. Immediately afterward, a woman appeared at the gate of the courtyard, a little boy in her arms.

The old man had still been liked a ferocious lion just then, yet he immediately retracted his aura at this moment. He respectfully kneeled down, saying, “Greetings, Madam!”

Ling Han sighed in his mind. He hadn’t wanted to meet the wife of the Great Saint, yet he had still ended up coming across her.

He turned around to face her. She was a beautiful woman, though her beauty wasn’t breathtaking and worthy of sacrificing cities for. At the very least, the beauty of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was streets ahead of her.

“You dare to remain standing after seeing me?” Upon seeing Ling Han, the woman immediately turned her attention away from her bawling son. A look of anger flashed across her face.
