Chapter 1804: Paper Human

“I don’t believe you!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head.

The young man snickered, and said, “I’m Nangong Ting, the Holy Son of the Lunar Sect!”

He was telling Ling Han to consider the consequences of becoming enemies with him.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Isn’t Bei Xuanming the Holy Son of the Lunar Sect?”

“Hmph, that trash!” Nangong Ting scoffed. His expression was filled with disdain, and he said with a frown, “Enough with the nonsense. Hurry up and hand the White Demon Tree over!”

He had set his eyes on the demonic tree since a long time ago. However, the previous time that he had come, he hadn’t had any confidence in defeating it at all. This time was different. Firstly, he had already advanced from the third severance to the fourth severance, meaning that his battle prowess had increased by several times. Secondly, he had borrowed a treasure that would allow him to suppress the White Demon Tree.

He had initially been brimming with confidence, and he had believed that apart from kings among kings such as Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng, no one else could defeat and obtain the demonic tree. However, upon arriving, he discovered that the demonic tree had already been taken by someone else.

Even though he hadn’t met all of the Holy Sons, Holy Daughters, and successors of the three-star forces, he possessed all of their general information. As such, he knew that Ling Han wasn’t one of them.

Thus, even though he was slightly apprehensive of Ling Han, he was confident that he could definitely deal with him. However, since Ling Han was relatively strong, he didn’t attack straight away. He didn’t want to waste his time and energy on Ling Han. If he could resolve this with words, why would he choose to battle instead?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “In my eyes, you’re no better than Bei Xuanming!”

“Impudence! You actually dare to compare me to that trash?!” Nangong Ting shouted in rage. That trash had actually been defeated by someone at the same cultivation level as him! At the same time, his marriage with the Fu Clan had also seemingly fallen through. As such, Nangong Ting viewed him with utter contempt and disdain.

How was such trash worthy of being a fellow Holy Son?

“Are you intent on seeking death?” Nangong Ting asked with a sneer. He slowly pushed his palm upward.

Boom!

A wisp of flames burst to life in his palm before quickly growing into a large fireball that was pulsating with symbols of the great dao.

“Don’t you know that I’m a fire element cultivator? If we fight here, my battle prowess will increase by at least twofold!” he said in a haughty voice. “However, the battle prowess of others won’t increase by a single bit. Instead, their battle prowess will be suppressed!

“Are you sure you want to fight with me?”

The Empress stepped forward, and said in a cold voice, “Piss off!”

Nangong Ting was infuriated. This woman actually dared to tell him to piss off? Just how audacious was she? He was just about to scold the Empress, yet upon glancing at her, his words instantly became stuck in his throat.

‘T-t-this... How can such a stunningly beautiful woman exist in the world?’

He had seen Bewitching Maiden Rou before, and he had been astonished by her breathtaking beauty at the time. He had viewed her as the most beautiful and most charming woman in the entire world, and he had thought that her beauty couldn’t possibly be surpassed. However, the heavens always performed miracles, and an even more beautiful and noble woman had now appeared before him. Her beauty was such that one would want to bow down and kowtow to her.

“Hahaha!” He suddenly burst into laughter, and killing intent wantonly radiated from his body.

He hadn’t wanted to fight with Ling Han just then, and he had simply wanted to take the White Demon Tree from him. After all, Ling Han was definitely a powerful cultivator. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to defeat and obtain the demonic tree. Thus, it was best that they could resolve things peacefully.

Now, however, he had changed his mind.

He wanted this woman. He definitely had to obtain this woman!

Ling Han saw the greed in his eyes. This was an expression of extreme lust. He involuntarily shook his head. This person was seeking death.

“Die!” Nangong Ting roared as he unleashed the fireball from his palm. He would kill Ling Han and then capture the Empress. As for the large black dog, Nangong Ting completely ignored his presence.

Ling Han also raised his hand toward the sky.

Boom!

Flames burst to life in his palm, and a fireball similarly formed in his hand. This fireball was twice the size of the one that Nangong Ting had summoned.

Nangong Ting’s eyes widened with shock and disbelief.

‘You can summon more fire particles than me?!’

With a gentle push, the fireball in Ling Han’s hands burst forward.

Boom!

The two fireballs collided, instantly sending wisps of flames into the surroundings. This was a violent collision, and after a brief moment, Nangong Ting’s fireball suddenly started to collapse. It transformed into hundreds of shards that flew into the surroundings. Meanwhile, only one-third of Ling Han’s larger fireball had been consumed as it continued to hurtle toward Nangong Ting.

Nangong Ting’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly jumped aside to avoid being struck head-on by the fireball.

He was indeed powerful, and he managed to just barely dodge Ling Han’s fireball. However, dodging the first attack didn’t mean that he could dodge all of the subsequent attacks. Right after landing, his entire body immediately curled up in pain. At the same time, he howled in wretched pain.

Just then, the large black dog had already teleported over to wait for him.

“Sh*tty brat, you dare to underestimate Grandpa Dog?!” the large black dog said in a smug voice as he loosened his bite. With a crunch, he immediately snapped his jaws down again.

“Sh*tty dog, let go!” Nangong Ting roared in fury.

Boom!

Flames burst from his body, and symbols of the great dao started to pulsate around him.

Being the Holy Son of a sect, he was naturally extremely powerful and talented. These flames were immensely destructive and terrifying, so much so that the large black dog had no option but to let go. Activating a teleportation technique, he immediately returned to Ling Han’s side.

Nangong Ting’s face was twisted in anger and agony. In his mind, everything should have gone smoothly and easily. He should have killed Ling Han with ease before capturing that stunningly beautiful woman. Now, however, he hadn’t obtained anything at all. Instead, he had been bitten by a rabid dog.

“You people... have successfully enraged me!” he said in a cold voice. He retrieved a pouch and took something out from it.

This... was actually a paper human!

Ling Han had initially thought that Nangong Ting was going to retrieve some incredible treasure, yet he had simply retrieved a paper human? Was this his trump card?

“Hmph!” A pained expression flashed across Nangong Ting’s face. This was a treasure that he had borrowed from an elite in his sect. It was a consumable treasure, and it could only be used a limited number of times. He had initially planned to use it during more crucial times, yet for the sake of the White Demon Tree, he was willing to use it right here and right now.

In fact, he had initially planned to use the paper human to suppress the White Demon Tree anyway.

Upon tossing the paper human into the air, rays of brilliant light instantly burst forth from it. The paper human then started to expand, eventually transforming into a normal-sized person. Its upper body was covered in symbols of the great dao, and each symbol was as profound as could be. These were symbols that one could lose themselves in.

“Kill him!” Nangong Ting commanded as he pointed at Ling Han.

The paper human immediately locked its gaze onto Ling Han. With a flash, it then instantly charged toward him.

This paper human... was extremely powerful!

Ling Han launched a fist at the nearing paper human, yet he was immediately sent flying backward, with several bloody gashes appearing on his skin.

“Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier!” the large black dog exclaimed. “Little Han, be careful!”

The paper human was extremely quick as it pursued Ling Han, and as it raised its right hand, the symbols of the great dao transformed into a spear that viciously stabbed down. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ling Han’s fighting spirit involuntarily soared. What did it matter that his opponent was a Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier elite?

He activated his Lightning Flash as he started to exchange strikes with the paper human.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

The paper human was extremely nimble, and it was able to block Ling Han’s attacks regardless of how quickly he launched them. In fact, it was even able to occasionally counterattack. Moreover, its battle prowess was superior to Ling Han’s, so each of its attacks was able to wound him slightly.

Pseudo-Dividing Soul Tier—this meant that the paper human already possessed a portion of the battle prowess of ordinary Dividing Soul Tier elites.

In reality, cultivators couldn’t reach such a level. They would either be at the peak stage of the fourth severance, or they would be at the Dividing Soul Tier. However, created treasures and tools could reach such a level.

The paper human unleashed its full might. Its power was such that it wouldn’t trigger a backlash from the violent aura of the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. At the same time, however, it could easily crush all of the Severing Mundane Tier cultivators in the mystery realm. In some sense, it could be viewed as an invincible opponent.
