Chapter 3391: Injured by the Demon Race

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han walked up to Gu Xiangming, and spoke indifferently.

Eldest Baby had already gone to help Huan Xue. Suppressing the two Blood Transformation Tier Imperial Guards was naturally a piece of cake.

“Ling Han, how dare you beat up an Imperial Guard? You’re courting death!” Gu Xiangming said through gritted teeth.

Ling Han chuckled, and pulled Gu Xiangming out of the wall.

“Ah!” Gu Xiangming screamed. He had broken many bones. It was fine if he did not move, but the moment he moved, the broken bones pierced into his flesh.

It was so painful that he broke out in cold sweat and could not help but scream. “A man like you can’t hold on after suffering such a small injury?” Ling Han smiled, and casually threw him to the ground, looking down at him from above. “You came over so early in the morning, are you running for your funeral?”

You’re too sharp-tongued.

Gu Xiangming could not imagine that a martial arts prodigy with two grandmaster-level titles, who was also known as the second Hong Tianbu, could speak so viciously.

“Ling Han, how dare you beat up an Imperial—” he cried out.

“Stop, stop, stop. You’ve already said it once. Aren’t you tired of it?” Ling Han interrupted him. “So what if it’s an Imperial Guard? Can’t he be beaten?”

Gu Xiangming was dumbfounded. Are you kidding me? Do you know what the words ‘Imperial Guard’ mean?

The emperor’s close subordinates!

What was the difference between beating up the imperial guards and humiliating the Holy Emperor?

This was clearly a matter of courting death, but Ling Han just had a nonchalant expression on his face, as if he had just accidentally stepped on a small ant, and didn’t need to take it to heart at all.

He was going crazy. This was completely different from what he had imagined.

In his opinion, with the pressure Ling Han was currently under, his mentality was definitely on the verge of collapse. When Ling Han saw him come over, he would definitely cry bitterly.

How could this be? How could this be?

“Don’t play dead, and don’t talk nonsense. Why are you disturbing my cultivation?” Ling Han asked.

I’m disturbing your cultivation?

Gu Xiangming really wanted to cry. He had been ordered to escort Ling Han, so why would he care if he cultivated or not?

However, when he met this fierce person who did not play by the rules at all, he was only depressed.

“I’m under the orders of the Lords to escort you—” He gritted his teeth and said.

Pa!

Before he could finish speaking, he was slapped. However, this time, it was not by Ling Han, but by Third Baby.

“To escort my father, are you courting death?” Third Baby said coldly.

“That’s right!” Fourth Baby put her hands on her waist.

“That’s right!” Fifth Baby was not to be outdone.

Gu Xiangming felt that he would be too ashamed to face anyone in the future. Not only had his face been drawn messily by the children, but he had also been slapped by a little girl. This was extremely embarrassing.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Are they finally going to make a decision?”

He thought for a moment and said, “Alright, let’s go take a look.”

“Lead the way.” Ling Han picked Gu Xiangming up.

He strode forward and saw that two Imperial Guards were “planted” in the ground near the door. Their heads were stuck in the soil up to their necks. Beside them was a smiling Eldest Baby, looking like she was appreciating a masterpiece.

“Don’t suffocate them to death,” Ling Han reminded.

“It’s fine. I’ll pull them out regularly to take a breather,” Eldest Baby said.

“En.” Ling Han nodded.

Gu Xiangming was stunned. Why didn’t you try to persuade her any further?

Crazy. Everyone here was crazy.

He was extremely regretful. This time, he had really suffered a huge loss. How could he have expected Ling Han and his children to be so lawless?

Ling Han called for Sixth Baby to follow him. If they revealed their true malicious intentions, he would forcefully break out of the encirclement. Then, he would enter the Essence Nurturing Gourd and let Sixth Baby bring him away.

Before he took this step, he also wanted to try his best to persuade them.

Ling Han carried Gu Xiangming and walked towards the Imperial Palace.

He used his movement technique. How long would it take to reach the Imperial Palace at twice the speed of sound?

After arriving, he slowed down.

“Who dares to trespass into the forbidden grounds of the Imperial Palace?” Immediately, a royal guard stepped forward and shouted.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “I’m Ling Han, and I’ve come as ordered. Here, this is your Captain Gu.”

“Captain… Captain Gu!” After the imperial guard saw Gu Xiangming clearly, he couldn’t help but be shocked.

Oh my god, what was going on? Why was Captain Gu so badly injured?

Gu Xiangming was just about to expose Ling Han’s evil deeds when he heard Ling Han beat him to it. “Your Captain Gu encountered the Demon Race halfway and was severely injured.”

Demon Race your sister, you were clearly the one who beat me up!

Gu Xiangming cried out in his heart, but when he saw Ling Han’s smiling face, he could not help but feel a chill in his heart. There was an indescribable fear, and that was that Ling Han might really kill him.

Hence, he didn’t dare to say a word. He could only save this grievance for when he met the Council Chairman and the rest.

Thus, when the imperial guard looked over with an inquiring gaze, he nodded in agreement with Ling Han’s words.

The Imperial Guard let them pass.

Ling Han headed towards the Conference Hall. Along the way, he naturally encountered other Imperial Guards, but they were all dismissed by him with the same excuse. This also made Gu Xiangming nod so much that even he was about to believe that he had actually been injured by the Demon Race.

However, they finally arrived at the Conference Hall.

Ling Han walked in with large strides.

The hall was very lively today and many people were seated.

Council Chairman Yang Bai sat at the head of the table, while Grand Tutor Hong and the Four Great Generals sat on either side. Just by looking at their armor and their imposing manner, one could guess their identities.

There were also the Third Prince, the Sixth Prince, and the Seventh Prince, whom Ling Han recognized. In addition, there were also a large number of princes that Ling Han did not recognize. Because they were wearing the same clothes, he could also guess their identities.

Before Chen Fengyan went into seclusion, he entrusted the state affairs to Yang Bai. Therefore, even though a few important princes had arrived, Yang Bai still took the main seat. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Greetings, Lords!” Ling Han threw Gu Xiangming to the ground and cupped his fists in greeting.

Pa, Gu Xiangming fell hard. He had already broken more than ten bones. This injury added to his injuries, causing him to shout loudly.

Grand Tutor Hong flew into a rage, and immediately stood up, shouting, “Ling Han, how dare you injure even the Imperial Guards? Don’t think that just because you’ve made some small achievements, you can disregard His Majesty!”

“How audacious!” Chen Jingye said coldly.

“Ignorant fool, you’re courting death!” Chen Shengjie also sneered.

These princes had all suffered at Ling Han’s hands, and now that they finally had a chance, they naturally began to mock and ridicule him.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “On the way here, I met the Demon Race. In order to protect me, Captain Gu was unfortunately severely injured. I am very grateful.”

F*ck, are you addicted to relating that theory?

Gu Xiangming quickly endured the pain and said, “It’s not like that. This is clearly—Ah!”

He let out a blood-curdling scream, and was already kicked out of the hall by Ling Han.

“Ling Han!” Grand Tutor Hong’s hair and beard fluttered in his fury. This brat was truly too arrogant. Of course, he would dare to commit violence in front of him.

Ling Han spread out his hands, and said, “My Lords, haven’t you summoned me to discuss matters regarding the Demon Race? In the face of the threat of the Demon Race, do you still need to care about such a small matter? Lord Hong, don’t be disregarding your priorities.”

F*ck!

Upon hearing this, Gu Xiangming fainted from anger..
