Chapter 2036: Clash of decrees

These seven years could be considered the most agonizing seven years of Guo Ming’s lifetime. If it were not for Liu Xueyan’s sake, he might have long since committed suicide.

Even if Liu Xueyan had stolen the Undying Pill for him, it was only capable of keeping him barely alive. Whatever suffering he had to sustain, he would still have to endure, which would allow him to live for a few more years before being tortured to death by the Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike.

…A poisoned injury would always need a specific medicine to be cured.

And now that he had been saved from the hellish abyss by Ling Han, just how strong was Guo Ming’s hatred towards Ruan Dongxiang? However strong his hatred was towards Ruan Dongxiang, that was how strong his gratitude was towards Ling Han.

Ruan Dongxiang’s expression was incredibly dark. He had not killed Guo Ming on the spot, because he hated this person too much, and wanted him to endure as much torture as possible before finally dying.

Yet now he was standing right in front of him, looking like he had completely recovered. This was unacceptable to him.

“Passerby, not only do you like to meddle in other people’s business, you are also too nosy!” Ruan Dongxiang said menacingly, his killing intent blazing.

“Oh.” Ling Han nodded, breaking into a grin. “Going by that account, I do indeed quite like to meddle in the business of others. If you don’t like it, come bite me!”

“Sharp tongue!” Ruan Dongxiang humphed coldly. With a shake of his right hand, a rolled up scroll appeared in his hand.

This was a precious treasure his great-grandfather had bestowed on him for protection, and it was a decree that this seventh elder had personally forged himself. The moment it was opened, it would send out an attack on the level of peak-stage Heaven Soul. Precisely because he had this decree, Ruan Dongxiang was still filled with overwhelming confidence, even though he had just been sent flying with a single punch from Ling Han.

Of course, he, too, wished to possess a stronger device, but the Star Moon Sect was just a three-star force, and the fact that they were able to give him this decree was already very impressive.

“You wish to use this bit of scrap paper to scare me?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Benefactor, be careful. This is not a piece of scrap paper, but a decree!” Guo Ming hurriedly pointed out.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel exasperated. Did the other party really think that he was very ignorant?

Ruan Dongxiang, meanwhile, laughed loudly. “That’s right. This is a decree, capable of killing all Dividing Soul Tiers! In terms of battle prowess, you are indeed just that bit stronger than me, but in terms of treasures, there is no way you can compare to me.”

“Idiot!” Fu Yue shook his head.

“En?” Ruan Dongxiang looked over, involuntarily showing a sliver of anger in his expression. Why was there always someone appearing repeatedly to cause trouble and oppose him?

“You are really an idiot!” Fu Yue also drew out a scroll. “I, too, have a decree here, so let us compare.”

Because he had been apprehended with a single move from Ling Han previously, he had not even managed to reveal his trump card.

…As the only male descendant in three generations of the Fu Clan, how could he not have some powerful treasures in his possession? Ultimately, it was Ling Han that had moved too quickly earlier, and Fu Yue had not expected that he would also encounter danger in United Link City.

Ruan Dongxiang couldn’t help but scoff. They were just a bunch of trash, so what treasures could they take out? They had to be just trying to scare him off.

“If you people are so determined to seek death, I shall oblige!” He flew into rage out of humiliation. Just think, he was a person that could oppress and tyrannize as he liked in the Star Moon Sect, but here he had actually been mocked repeatedly, and had even sustained a punch. His killing intent blazed at this.

He immediately opened the scroll. A shadowy line spread out, forming multiple seals, but not a single seal could be recognized.

These were seals of great dao, a script belonging to the heaven and earth.

When the scroll was completely unfurled, all the characters shattered, and then formed a massive black beast. It had the head of a tiger, body of an ox, tail of a scorpion, and a singular horn sprouting from its head. With a twisted expression, it roared, and the surrounding space suddenly shattered in an instant.

Ling Han moved, channeling the Regulations of Space, and stowing away all the power of Regulation that had seeped out. Otherwise, this small village would be instantly shattered to smithereens.

Ruan Dongxiang saw this, and was not overly shocked. That was because this was just a sliver of might from the decree, so it was very normal that Ling Han managed to block it.

“This is practically weak beyond description!” Fu Yue said in disdain. He, too, broke open his scroll.?Weng, silvery light shot out in a blaze. It was just light that was exuding out now, and when it shone on that massive black beast, this monster began to crumble like it was a buildup of snow that had encountered fire.

“What!?” Ruan Dongxiang paled in shock.

The decree was his strongest, as well as his last, resort, but its might had not been fully unleashed yet, and it had already been destroyed. His heart almost exploded at this.

A decree was definitely a manifestation of the power that a force had.

The logic was very simple. Compared to such treasures like Celestial Tools and Pseudo-Celestial Tools, the method of construction of a decree was considerably much simpler. One only had to use the hide of an Immortal Beast that was up to standard as the paper, and the blood of an Immortal Beast as ink, and when one had reached the Severing Mundane Tier in cultivation level, anyone could easily create a decree.

The stronger the might of the divided soul, the higher the requirements were for the materials used to create the decree, such as using the fur and blood of the Dividing Soul Tier level, or Immortal Palace Tier-level beasts, but the creator would also have to be a Dividing Soul Tier or Immortal Palace Tier elite.

Though these materials were not cheap, either, compared to other objects, this was indeed the most easily created item.

He had already taken out a decree that had been created by an Immortal Palace Tier elite, possessing the attack power of the Dividing Soul Tier, yet it could not even hold up to a streak of light from the other. Just how wide was the gap here?

A complete domination from superiority by a major tier!

Being able to draw out a decree that had Immortal Palace Tier’s attack power, what kind of concept was that?

The other definitely had an Immortal Palace Tier elite behind him, or even Ascending Origin Tier!

Ruan Dongxiang’s feelings of superiority immediately crumbled. If the other party was the heir of a four-star force, then he would really have met his match. He would be dead before he even knew it.

“I admit defeat!” he called out hurriedly.

This decree had just been unfurled a little, and it was already so terrifying, so just how frightening would it be when it was fully unfurled?

He had no wish to die!

“Just because you say you admit defeat, I have to spare you?” Fu Yue jeered, and unfurled the entire scroll without the slightest hesitation. Immediately, silvery light blazed brightly.?Xiu, a sword light flew out from the scroll, and slashed towards Ruan Dongxiang in a flash, passing him quickly.

The sword light surged past, and Ruan Dongxiang’s whole person also disappeared completely.

The might of this decree was comparable to an Immortal Palace Tier, and for an Immortal Palace Tier to make a move on a Dividing Soul Tier, what would be so strange that the latter would completely disappear without a trace?

F***, this was a waste.

Ling Han shook his head. Even killing a piece of trash like Ruan Dongxiang, he had to use an Immortal Palace Tier-level decree. He really had cash to burn. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, in any case, it wasn’t Ling Han’s cash that was being burnt.

Fu Yue sent a reserved smile at Ling Han. This attack was mainly shown for Ling Han’s benefit, expressing the fact that he was actually very strong as well. Of course, he personally was the type to be easily touched, and also bore the intention of venting his anger on Guo Ming and his wife’s behalf.

Pa!

The back of his head immediately sustained a smack, as he heard Hu Niu say, “Ugly, what kind of expression and look do you have there? Do you want to rebel?” The force of this strike was extremely strong, and he stumbled from the impact.

Fu Yue couldn’t help but feel depressed. He only wanted to show off a bit. Did she have to treat him like this?

“B-Benefactors, you have gotten into trouble.” Meanwhile, Guo Ming was stunned silly. That was the fourth-generation grandchild of the seventh elder of the Star Moon Sect, and now he had died here. This would cause a huge commotion.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “What does it have to do with me? I wasn’t the one who killed him.”

Meanwhile, Fu Yue smirked arrogantly. “So what about it? Does the Star Moon Sect dare to come and seek me out for vengeance?”

The Fu Clan was a four-star force, so how could a mere three-star force actually dare come to seek their own destruction? Moreover, even if their positions were exchanged, wouldn’t the Fu Clan still have a Celestial King backing them up?

Ling Han shook his head. “Let me tell you a bit of bad news. Though you have used a decree, you did not manage to kill that Ruan guy.”
