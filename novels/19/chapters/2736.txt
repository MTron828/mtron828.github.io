2737 A great battle without comparison

Wu Haoyang was truly like a lingering ghost.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The sounds of battle could be heard all the way over here. Ling Han frowned, and immediately rushed out.

The Rain Emperor, the Empress, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the large black dog were all trying to stop Wu Haoyang, but faced with his physique, none of them could achieve this.

Hence, Wu Haoyang forged his way all the way here, and no one could stop him.

“Ling Han!” When he spotted Ling Han, Wu Haoyang’s eyes immediately lit up, his fighting spirit soaring.

“Humph!” Ling Han ignored him completely, directly rushing forwards and attacking.

Touching his family and friends was his peeve. No one could touch them.

Wu Haoyang naturally was unafraid, and similarly brandished his fists and clashed with Ling Han.

By now, there were no longer any nine ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around him, which meant that he, like Ling Han, had also advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two great prodigies immediately took their battle to the skies, and then unleashed their respective battle prowess. They were both clashing with Heavenly Venerate Techniques.

After advancing to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, they both possessed an ability that true Heavenly Venerates possessed, the unrestricted use of a Heavenly Venerate Technique. Thus, though the increase to their standard battle prowess was not great, if the Heavenly Venerate Techniques were accounted for as well, they would be too terrifying.

The commotion caused by this battle was very loud, drawing many people out to check what was going on. When they discovered that Ling Han and Wu Haoyang were battling intensely, everyone’s expression changed.

However, both of them had advanced, setting foot in the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier at the same time, and the increase in their strength was more or less equal. Thus, like during the previous battle in the Heavenly Venerate Tool, they were still in a situation wherein neither could defeat or subdue the other.

This time, however, Ling Han was unwilling to stop. He did not fear being challenged, but Wu Haoyang had actually fought his way to his home, and almost wounded the Empress and the others. This was something he could not accept.

He was going to crush this bastard.

The battle continued, and even the two Heavenly Venerates that were standing by here had no plans on interfering to stop them, because it was useless even if they did. They could not stop the duo at all.

The present Ling Han and Wu Haoyang were no longer inferior to true Heavenly Venerates. Furthermore, Wu Haoyang was so strange. If he turned around to wound them instead, just how embarrassing would that be?

One day, two days, 10 days, a month, and the two great prodigies continued their battle incessantly. The battle was constantly and incredibly intense. Neither of them made any mention of stopping; they both had a reason and determination to defeat the other completely.

The people beneath them were all astounded. They were two Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, but had maintained Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess for a month straight; just how terrifying was this?

Tu Shi, Tie Binghe, and the other super rookies could only shake their heads. It seemed like they could only contend for glory with these two after they had become Second Tier Heavenly Venerates.

They had no choice but to submit.

When they had fought until the second month, a sharp scream suddenly interrupted their “peace.”

“Enemy attack!”

Enemy attack, Hysteria’s troops launched an assault again.

Everyone hurriedly made their preparations. Those that should be on the city wall went upwards, and those that should not stayed on the defense below, preparing to deal with those that escaped through the net.

But Ling Han was still fighting with Wu Haoyang. By now, no one else existed in their eyes. All they could see was each other.

Boom! Hysteria’s troops had already arrived.

The city wall immediately glowed, blasting out an attack. By itself, this was a great weapon.

Group after group of ground troops collapsed, and even the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could not withstand a single blast.

However, there would be those that managed to escape through their net and charged over to this side of the wall. Some fell into the city, while some charged into the skies, launching an offensive at Ling Han and Wu Haoyang.

After being attacked, Ling Han awoke from the state of violent fighting spirit he had sunk into. His eyes swept over his surroundings, and saw the troops that were tightly packed beneath him. They covered mountains and plains, and went as far as the eye could see.

He had changed his mind. “Wu Haoyang, we will fight later!”

Xiu! He descended, and rushed into Hysteria’s troops. Throwing out both fists, he began a massacre.

“Stop!” Wu Haoyang immediately set off in pursuit.

The two of them had fallen into Hysteria’s troops outside the city at the same time. It was like they were lambs that had mistakenly wandered into a pack of wolves. Immediately, they were surrounded and attacked.

“Scram!” Wu Haoyang had fallen behind by a step, yet he was at least several dozen kilometers away from Ling Han, and just how many troops of Hysteria lay across this distance? He roared furiously, and charged towards Ling Han. Peng, peng, peng! Using both fists, he destroyed all the troops of Hysteria that blocked his way one after another.

Ling Han’s speed was not low, either. His left hand used the Five Elements Lightning Technique, while his right hand held the Divine Demon Sword, which was boosted with the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. He was attacking even more fiercely.

These weren’t lambs that had fallen into a pack of wolves, but rather two ferocious lions that had pounced into a flock of sheep. It would only be they that would be causing a massacre.

They were really too strong. Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates actually weren’t even worthy of taking a strike head-on from them.

This was natural. In the first place, their battle prowess was capable of sweeping aside 99% of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and now, further boosted with Heavenly Venerate Techniques, they would definitely be even more awesome.

Weng! Waves of light from the city wall surged over. Instantly, group after group of Hysteria’s troops fell like they were wheat being harvested. Furthermore, this light wave did not differentiate between enemy and friend. Both Ling Han and Wu Haoyang were within attack range.

Wu Haoyang turned into light, and as the wave of light surged past, it did not have any effect on him. Ling Han was not much inferior. He channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and multiple golden seals formed on his body, allowing him to withstand this attack. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The wave of light that was capable of insta-killing Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates did not cause the slightest bit of damage to the two of them.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and continued his massacre. The Divine Demon Sword delivered Sword Qi that was several thousands of meters long. This destructive power was not much weaker than the city light. With a single sweep of his sword, at least a dozen monsters were sliced in half.

It was only over a dozen because these monsters were too massive. If they were only the size of a normal human being, a single strike would kill several hundred to several thousand of them.

Even so, Ling Han had also turned into a god of death.

“Competing in the number of kills?” Wu Haoyang looked defiant. “I will not lose to you in anything!”

He was still chasing after Ling Han, but his focus was now placed on his enemy kills, wanting to compete with Ling Han in this manner.

Both of them were so crazy, yet it caused the people who were on the city wall to be dumbfounded. Even the two great Heavenly Venerates couldn’t help but twitch. If it had been them in the duo’s place, their battle prowess would not be inferior to that of Ling Han or Wu Haoyang, but their defense would definitely be outmatched. Very soon, they would be attacked so hard that they would have no choice but to flee back behind the city wall.

Yet Ling Han and Wu Haoyang both possessed above-average defense, which was completely capable of withstanding the siege of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, accomplishing battle merits that even Heavenly Venerates could only stare at.

Seven days later, the army retreated.

“Ling Han, come and fight me!” Wu Haoyang was again howling, charging towards Ling Han.

Ling Han naturally would not retreat. Turning around, he began to battle Wu Haoyang once more.

Crazy, they had both really gone crazy.

The people in the city were all numb with shock. They had endured such a great battle, and all of them felt weary, both mentally and physically, desperately wanting a good rest. But Ling Han and Wu Haoyang had previously been fighting right in the depths of the enemy troops, so they would definitely be even more tired, yet now they were actually fighting with each other again. How could everyone accept that?

These two freaks!

However, what was even more shocking was the fact that when the recent leaderboard was once again updated 11 days later, Wu Haoyang had directly charged his way up the recent leaderboard.

In a single battle, he had climbed into the recent leaderboard!

It should be known that this was adding up all the battle merits over a timespan of 1,000,000 years.

Wu Haoyang was ranked at the 362nd place, having killed 986 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates and 38,427 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings!

What was even more terrifying was Ling Han. He naturally was still number one, but the number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates he had killed soared past 13,000, and as many as over 50,000 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had perished in his hands!
