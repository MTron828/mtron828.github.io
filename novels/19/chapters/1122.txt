Chapter 1123: Final Trial

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The ninth level was the last level, and as with the previous several levels, there were two stone statues standing in the middle of the room.

They were the two brothers, “hit me” and “I’ll hit you”.

Sure enough, Empress Luan Xing chose the “hit me” stone statue. Meanwhile, Ling Han chose the “I’ll hit you” stone statue. This caused a sense of grief to well up in his heart. However, whom could he blame for not having five Mountains and Rivers yet? Whom could he blame for not reaching the pinnacle of the Mountain River Tier yet?

Anyhow, the fact that Empress Luan Xing was actually able to pass the eighth trial through her offensive power was extremely astounding.

Ling Han involuntarily looked over. He wanted to witness the might of this empress with his own two eyes.

Weng!

Four heavenly bodies materialized behind Empress Luan Xing’s back, each of them exuding a profound and ancient aura.

“Excellent, excellent! You’ve reached a state of perfection for both the Sun Moon Tier and Mountain River Tier. Although you’ve yet to form your fifth heavenly body, your strength has already reached nine stars!” The Invincible Paragon Saint couldn’t help but praise Empress Luan Xing.

Ling Han was stunned. ‘The empress is actually this freakishly talented?!’

People often said that five-star geniuses only existed in the legends. However, the power of this empress had already surpassed nine stars. As a result, her battle prowess also surpassed at least nine stars. In fact, it was even possible that it surpassed more than nine stars.

If one wanted to battle against someone who was one major tier above them, however, they would need a power of 10 stars, not a battle prowess of 10 stars. Thus, she was still no match for elites at the Eternal River Tier—at least not now.

There was still hope, though, as she could form another heavenly body and reach a state of perfection in the Heavenly Body Tier.

“It’s very strange, however,” the Invincible Paragon Saint continued. “Although I can sense the fact that you should have five Mountains and Rivers, as well as five Suns and Moons, your power isn’t as powerful as I imagined!

“I was the one who constructed this tower and the trials within it, and it should be easy to pass as long as one has a power that can surpass eight stars. Your power can clearly surpass nine stars, yet you struggled to even pass the eighth trial. I wonder why that is?”

The Invincible Paragon Saint appeared to be extremely curious. The fact that even a Saint like him was curious showed just how astonishing a secret Empress Luan Xing hid within her body.

However, this was all understandable. Empress Luan Xing had suddenly risen to power one million years ago, establishing the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire and conquering one-third of the land on the Joint Peace Planet. However, before she became one of the three rulers of the Joint Peace Planet, it was as if she had suddenly appeared from out of nowhere. No one knew where she had come from.

There was definitely a huge secret hiding behind her meteoric rise.

Empress Luan Xing didn’t answer the Invincible Paragon Saint’s curiosity. She didn’t restrain her domineering aura, either, even though she stood in the presence of a being who had once been a Saint. She simply channeled the power of her heavenly bodies and pressed her hand toward the stone statue. A tangle of intertwining divine patterns appeared before her, yet at a rough glance, there were only 4,000 or so.

Possessing 4,000 or so divine patterns could only be regarded as relatively powerful. However, it was still a long way off the pinnacle of the Heavenly Body Tier, which was 9,999 divine patterns. Indeed, Empress Luan Xing was still a long way off from reaching a power of nine stars.

‘Did the Invincible Paragon Saint observe wrong? Perhaps Empress Luan Xing hasn’t reached a power of nine stars yet? However, how is that possible? Although he’s a “D*ckhead Saint”, his observation skills shouldn’t be this weak. Otherwise, he might as well find a block of tofu and smack himself to death.’

It was clear that Empress Luan Xing was preparing a powerful attack. The aura of Primal Chaos around her swarmed, and the cloak that draped behind her billowed even though there was no wind. Her hair also fluttered, and she appeared both mighty and seductively beautiful.

Casting one’s gaze over the world, perhaps she was the only person who could combine these two starkly different dispositions so perfectly.

Apocalyptic scenes flashed across the empress’ eyes. However, it was a pity that her face was hidden by the aura of Primal Chaos, preventing Ling Han from seeing this sight. However, the Invincible Paragon Saint could clearly see through the aura of Primal Chaos. He faltered for a moment before saying, “Huh? Why do I suddenly feel like I’ve seen that before? However, I can’t seem to recall where I saw it.”

Ling Han was astonished. Elites wouldn’t suffer from bad memory, as their divine sense was incredibly powerful. Thus, their memory was naturally amazing. However, the Invincible Paragon Saint actually said that he couldn’t recall something? How long ago must that event have occurred?

Was it a memory from when he was a child? Otherwise, once one started to cultivate, their memories definitely wouldn’t go hazy.

Boom!

Empress Luan Xing struck out with her jade-like palm, and it was as if the heavens were about to collapse. Even though they were in this closed-off space, it still seemed as if a black hole that desired to swallow everything had appeared above their heads.

‘Her strike is far too powerful! Is this power that surpasses eight stars?’ Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Peng!

The “hit me” stone statue fell, but wasn’t sent flying.

“Haha! What overwhelming power! Excellent, excellent!” the Invincible Paragon Saint praised. He then turned to Ling Han, and said, “Brat, it’s your turn now.”

Ling Han felt extremely vexed. One person had struck a stone statue, while one person would be struck by a stone statue. Their experiences would be completely different.

He sighed, and then walked before the “I’ll hit you” statue.

‘Come at me. I’ve accepted the fact that I still haven’t reached a state of perfection for my cultivation level yet.’

The stone statue immediately started to attack Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng!

The offensive power of the stone statue was even stronger this time, and all Ling Han could do was protect his handsome face while being relentlessly and mercilessly beaten.

A ball of fire welled up in his heart this time. After all, this was different from when he was on the eighth level. Right now, the empress was also watching him from the sidelines.

However, Empress Luan Xing didn’t look down on him.

Could any ordinary person take a beating like this?

However... this didn’t quell her killing intent.

The hourglass quickly trickled to a stop. The “I’ll hit you” statue finally ceased beating Ling Han, and it retreated to the side and became unmoving as if it were just another ordinary stone statue.

“Where are our rewards? Hurry up and let us leave this place!” Empress Luan Xing urged. She naturally wasn’t interested in the reward. Rather, she was itching to leave this place so she could kill Ling Han.

Ling Han hurriedly smiled, and said, “There’s no hurry, no hurry at all! Why don’t we sit down for a cup of tea?”

“Hahahaha!” The Invincible Paragon Saint roared with laughter, and said, “Very well, very well indeed! One possesses a most powerful offensive ability, and one possesses a most powerful defensive ability. You two are the ideal match!”

“Ideal match?” Ling Han murmured. Then, he raised his voice in protest and said, “Oi, oi, oi, don’t say things that can cause misunderstandings.”

“Hehe, hehehehe!” The Invincible Paragon Saint laughed heartily.

“Oi, what the hell do you mean?” Ling Han asked.

The Invincible Paragon Saint kept laughing for a while before saying, “Next up is my reward for you two!”

He paused for a moment, seemingly eager to hear Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing’s curious questions. To his disappointment, however, neither of them responded to him.

‘F*ck!’

The Invincible Paragon Saint had been snubbed, so he could only continue, “I’m going to accept the child of you two as my disciple and raise them to become the most powerful person in the world!”

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered loudly. ‘Are you f*cking retarded?!’

However, the Invincible Paragon Saint appeared to be extremely excited, and he said, “When the most powerful offensive ability and most powerful defensive ability combine, the child that they create will definitely possess both of these great abilities. As such, this child will be the most suitable candidate for becoming my disciple.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Oi, oi, oi, stop talking to yourself. There’s no way that’s going to happen!”

Meanwhile, a devastating killing intent surged from Empress Luan Xing’s body. The Invincible Paragon Saint actually wanted her to have children with Ling Han? Was he seeking death?!

“Haha! If I want you two to have children, you two will have no choice but to have children!” The Invincible Paragon Saint chortled in glee, and continued, “Otherwise, you two can just stay here in here forever! Whenever my disciple is born is when I’ll let you two out!”

‘F*ck!’
