2783 Appearance of a Heavenly Venerable Seal

Yuan Yinglong had initially thought that this would be a competition between the elites of the second level. Unexpectedly, however, even elites from the third and fourth level had been drawn over.

“We underestimated the appeal of Heavenly Venerable Seals,” Yuan Yinglong said with a sigh.

This was indeed the case. Even elites from the third level and fourth level had come, and these people were all high and mighty in the eyes of those from the second level.

“However, this is the second level, and there’s also the suppression from heaven and earth. To say nothing of them, even the lords from the sixth level will be suppressed if they come here,” Yi remarked.

!!

Everyone nodded in agreement. If they battled here, even Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t enjoy any advantage.

Ling Han’s gaze wandered around, and he asked, “Is there some sort of power suppression here? Why are all these people standing around and not entering?”

“Let’s ask.” Yuan Yinglong asked the people around them, and it wasn’t long before they received an answer.

As it turned out, there was huge pressure at the entrance of the cave, and the deeper one ventured, the greater this pressure would become. This pressure wasn’t something that First Tier Heavenly Venerates could withstand. If they forcefully entered, they would simply be seeking death.

Thus, everyone was waiting outside. Since this mystery realm had appeared, it signified a change in the environment of heaven and earth. In other words, they could definitely enter this cave at some point.

Yuan Yinglong had been here for a long time, and he had gone to the third level, the fourth level, and even the fifth level before. As such, he recognized most of the people here, and he introduced them to the others one by one.

This time, at least half of the people ranked in the top 100 on the recent leaderboard of the second level had come. The highest-ranked person was seventh, and it was someone called Geng Xuandan. He had already been in the second level for over seven trillion years, and he had already refined his First Tier cultivation to a pinnacle level. In terms of battle prowess alone, he could certainly compete for the top spot.

There were also powerful elites from the third and fourth level, and even if their cultivation was suppressed, their strength was still not to be belittled.

However, Ling Han was fearless. Even if their cultivation weren’t suppressed, he still wouldn’t be afraid of Third Tier Heavenly Venerates, let alone in the current situation.

“I’ll check out the situation,” he said as he strode forward, becoming the first person to walk to the source of the waterfall. This was a humongous cavity in the side of the mountain from which countless broken shards of worlds could funnel out without any obstruction. This was evidence of just how gigantic this cave was.

Upon seeing Ling Han fly in, many people scoffed in disdain, feeling like Ling Han was overestimating his own strength. So many elites had already tried, yet he was still unwilling to back down?

He was merely trying to show off!

“Who is this person? He thinks far too highly of himself, no?”

“Oh, I think you’re underestimating this person?”

“How so? Are you trying to tell me that he’s some famous and impressive person?”

“Ling Han, heard of him before?”

“Hmm? Don’t tell me he’s that Ling Han from the first level?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“That’s right, he’s already become a Heavenly Venerate, so he’s gone to the second level.”

“So it’s him… However, so what if it’s him? Even Second Tier Heavenly Venerates will be crushed to death in that place, and we’ve all had our cultivation suppressed as well. Even Third Tier Heavenly Venerates have no option but to wait until that pressure disappears.”

“Heh, he’s young and full of vigor, so he naturally wants to achieve that which others can’t. He just wants to win some renown.”

“Hmph! Does he truly believe that he can rival Wu Haoyang?”

Many people shook their heads. Ling Han had already fallen behind the other top-level prodigies, with Lin Youlian, Wu Haoyang, and Xin Qihu all being Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates now. Meanwhile, Ling Han had only just advanced to the First Tier. How could he compare?

Ling Han flew above the waterfall, and after entering the mountain, the waterfall had already become a river. This was a river even wider than a sea, its breadth so great that one couldn’t see its edges. Even with his vision as a Heavenly Venerate, he could only just make out the mountain walls on the two sides.

After a short while, Ling Han felt a tremendous pressure surge over him, obstructing his advance.

This force had already reached the pinnacle level of the First Tier. Thus, the vast majority of First Tier Heavenly Venerates who arrived here could only look on and sigh, unable to advance any further. If they stubbornly pushed forward, they would likely be mercilessly crushed into pieces.

However, Ling Han remained calm and unfazed, with the boundless Power of Dimensions surging through his body, and allowing him to advance as if he were walking over flat ground. His speed wasn’t affected at all.

As Ling Han continued to advance, the pressure crushing down on him also continued to increase.

This place was where the fourth spatial level and the second spatial level had overlapped all those years ago. Thus, there were many places that were filled with the power of heaven and earth of the fourth level, a power that targeted Third Tier Heavenly Venerates. This pressure far exceeded that which targeted those at the First Tier.

Normally speaking, this was something that couldn’t be overcome. When Third Tier elites came here, their cultivation level would also be suppressed back to the First Tier. That being the case, how could they overcome Third Tier obstacles?

This was unless Sixth Tier or even Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates came over to help. They would indeed be able to resist the pressure of heaven and earth and forcefully overcome this barrier.

However, Ling Han’s power came from within, so he was naturally also an exception to this rule. He continued to advance, and after seven days, he saw the true origin of the black waterfall. What appeared before him was a colossal lake that had a crack in the corner. It was the water flowing from this crack that formed the humongous black waterfall.

This was simply inconceivable! Just how large was the black waterfall? Yet, it was actually formed by water flowing from a crack in a lake?

Ling Han hovered above the lake, and he felt like there was a boundless murderous aura surging up into the sky, causing even him to feel some pressure.

This was the aura of Third Tier Heavenly Venerates.

During that past event, the corpses of countless elites had been buried beneath this lake, right?

Ling Han descended, wanting to enter the lake. However, he quickly stopped in his tracks. The water pressure was far too devastating.

He could rival those at the Third Tier, and he could, in fact, even defeat most of those at the Third Tier. However, just how many Third Tier Heavenly Venerates had been buried under this lake? Even if they had already lost most of their power, their quantity still more than made up for it once combined. With tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of them, the murderous aura that they created indeed wasn’t something that Third Tier Heavenly Venerates could withstand.

Ling Han had no option but to retreat. He stood above the lake and continued to observe.

Several days later, waves suddenly rippled across the surface of the lake.

Boom!

This wave was far too large, and it reached hundreds of thousands of meters in height in just an instant, violent as it crashed through the lake.

Ling Han was forced to retreat. Otherwise, if he were struck by this wave, it would be equivalent to facing a combined strike from hundreds or even thousands of Third Tier Heavenly Venerates. Even as powerful as he was, he would still be smashed out of shape.

The lake became tumultuous, with boundless ferocious waves crashing back and forth.

No waves would exist without wind. Why had the calm lake suddenly become tumultuous?

Ling Han carefully observed the situation. When the waves finally calmed down, a golden glow suddenly shimmered at the bottom of the lake.

It was a symbol!

Ling Han focused his gaze, yet he immediately shook his head. The lake still had yet to fully calm down, and this caused the golden symbol to distort and waver, making it extremely hard to decipher. Moreover, he had a feeling that this symbol was being blocked by something, with only a third of it revealed.

A Heavenly Venerable Seal!

Ling Han was certain about this. Even though it was extremely fuzzy, its reflection in his mind still made him feel like his communication with the power of heaven and earth had sped up a little.

Sure enough, there were genuinely Heavenly Venerable Seals in this place.

...

Ling Han hesitated at this moment. Should he bring the Empress and the others over? However, he immediately shook his head. The pressure here was far too great, so one would at least need to be at the Third Tier to withstand it. Thus, what would it matter even if he brought them over?

He continued to observe the Heavenly Venerable Seal, aiming to comprehend and master it.

However, it was a shame that the symbol was not only fuzzy, but also disappeared soon after.

After remaining here for half a year, Ling Han finally managed to decipher a pattern. Only after the lake became tumultuous would the symbol materialize and remain for approximately an hour.

However, there was no set time for the lake to become tumultuous. Sometimes, it would only take a single day, while at other times, it would remain calm for more than a dozen days.

After another half a year, Ling Han decided to leave this place first. This was because he had already mostly comprehended this symbol. He had already seen and comprehended all that there was to see and comprehend without entering the depths of the lake.
