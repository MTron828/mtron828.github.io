Chapter 938: Invincible Defense?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The fight progressed very quickly.

Being confined to a small platform left no room for movement techniques to be brought forth. In a matter of a few moves, contestants were already locked in combat at close quarters. It was but a little over half an hour, yet only three people were left on the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire’s side, and there was not much difference on the two other sides, either.

Facts proved that apart from Ling Han, this kind of monster that emerged occasionally, the three Majestic Empires’ reserves of top-rate talents were more or less the same.

When Ma Xing was also defeated, Ye Chengyun stepped forth to fight. He picked four opponents from the two Majestic Empires to firstly force the leader of the team from the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire out.

It was a woman.

She was of a slender frame, with features so beautiful they were like art and long hair that fell straight down, touching her rear. Her style of dressing was also very refreshing: her top was extremely short, and actually exposed a small stretch of her waist, which was fair as ivory and smooth as fine jade.

Her bottom, on the other hand, was clad in a pair of leather pants, which were cut off below the knee, revealing a pair of flawless porcelain-like calves, forming a stark contrast with the black color of the leather pants, which made them even more prominently snowy.

Her figure was really too perfect—she had a curvaceous plump rear the shape of ripened peaches, so tempting that one just wanted to take a bite off it. The light reflected off her pants made her **** appear even more profoundly stirring.

“Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, Yue Rong’er.” She cupped her fists in greeting.

Ye Chengyun revealed traces of a stunned expression as he reciprocated the gesture, and in return greeted, “Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, Ye Chengyun.”

“Please!”

“Please!”

As soon as the formalities were over, Yue Rong’er immediately launched an attack, her figure leaping forth while giving rise to a stream of light. Her speed was extremely swift, appearing in front of Ye Chengyun in a fraction of a second as she pressed her palm forward.

Ye Chengyun was taken aback—this speed was beyond anything he’d expected. Nevertheless, she was the leader guarding the frontier of the opposing party, and he had expected that her strength would be formidable. In any case, he was also someone with battle prowess of 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, and his strength was astonishingly powerful. He immediately clenched his fist and slammed it towards his opponent.

Peng!

The fist and palm strongly collided, however, Ye Chengyun was immediately sent flying by the force from the impact, and landed outside the platform.

Unexpectedly, he was not on par with his opponent at all!

Ling Han’s eyes brightened. The battle prowess that this woman displayed was only of 21 Stars and slightly above, not even 22 Stars yet. However, she also did not draw on any secret techniques at all, which showed that her battle prowess had definitely surpassed 22 Stars, or had even possibly already reached 23 Stars.

With Ye Chengyun’s defeat, it was the Jade Drop Majestic Empire’s turn to send forth their leader.

“Jade Drop Majestic Empire, Zhong Hai.” He was a man with an extremely odd figure—his stature was not short, yet he had a stooped back, and his back was akin to a tortoise’s. Not only was it flat, but it was also carrying a semi-circular form.

A descendant of the Black Tortoise... It could indeed possibly not be just mere hearsay.

The two then engaged in a fierce battle. From the offense aspect, Yue Rong’er had the upper hand, but Zhong Hai had also inherited the tortoise’s defensive capabilities. No matter how strong the offense that came his way, he only needed to turn his back around, and that tortoise-like back could easily receive any strike.

The only way to injure him would be to draw near and fight him at close range, without giving him time to turn around.

But to fight at close range would be too dangerous; it was also not suitable for a cultivator of Origin Power—it was the offensive tactic of a cultivator of Body Arts.

Yue Rong’er’s strength evidently went beyond this. She exclaimed softly, “Peacock’s Numerous Plumes, Shatters the Cosmos!”

Suddenly, a beautiful spread of plumes appeared on her back, akin to a peacock fanning out its tail in a splash of colors. Next, the total of 72 plumes all shot out directly towards Zhong Hai at the same time.

There was no such thing as an absolute defense in this world, only an offense that was not powerful enough.

Zhong Hai actually smirked and turned his body around as before, but this time around, his back suddenly bulged, tearing his clothes apart to reveal an oval black tortoise shell. On its surface were divine patterns that were at that moment already interwoven and emitting light.

He was obviously at the Shattering Void Tier only, yet he could activate divine patterns. Although it was only a mere few, their power naturally was incomparably formidable.

This was precisely his bloodline letting him possess a bit of the power of Immortal level in advance.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu , numerous plumes shot out at the tortoise shell, evoking a dazzling burst of light rays.

Numerous plumes swept past, yet Zhong Hai was unscathed.

“Hahahaha!” Zhong Hai moved to fight back, but he did not attack, and just used his tortoise back as a shield and rammed towards Yue Rong’er.

His objective was very obvious: he wanted to knock Yue Rong’er off the platform. Then, he could win without a fight.

It was very underhanded, but it was very effective.

The defense ability of the tortoise shell was too terrifying. Furthermore, there were divine patterns on it. A Shattering Void Tier cultivator being slammed with it once had to be absolutely in a world of pain. When Yue Rong’er was forced into a corner, it was also tantamount to proclaiming her defeat.

She was knocked down from the platform.

Yue Rong’er was seething with anger. In terms of real battle prowess, she definitely was not inferior to Zhong Hai, but she was at too much of a disadvantage fighting on a tournament platform, and her powerful attack strength was practically useless.

With this turn of events, the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire would be ranked third this time, and could only sit on the sidelines to watch the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire and Jade Drop Majestic Empire contend for the first place.

Zhong Hai’s manner of attaining victory drew forth a lot of hissing sounds from the spectators. Beauties originally would attract more spectators anyways; now, everyone naturally had sided and was in support of Yue Rong’er. They were all too eager to boo Zhong Hai off the platform.

But, Zhong Hai’s face was as thick-skinned as his tortoise shell, and he stood on the platform without any traces of shame. Instead, he turned towards Ling Han and hooked a finger at him, a downright provoking stance.

“Senior Brother Ling, eliminate him!” Those from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire were all furious—he was too cocky.

Ling Han smiled faintly, slowly walked to the front of the platform, and ascended the stairs, appearing to be unhurried and calm to the extreme.

“Hurry up! After defeating you, we shall be number one,” Zhong Hai said arrogantly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ling Han did not hasten, nor did he slow down. His spirit was firm; how would he be confused by others? He stepped onto the platform, and greeted perfunctorily, “Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, Ling Han.”

“Jade Drop Majestic Empire, Zhong Hai. Please!”

“Please!”

Similarly, right after the greetings were done and over with, Zhong Hai immediately revealed a hideous grin. Brandishing a fist, he charged towards Ling Han.

Ling Han casually moved his hand in a slashing arc, and drew out a flash of Sword Qi, effortlessly countering this fist.

“You do have some strength.” Zhong Hai coldly sneered; his fist just now was merely to test the waters. His expression then showed focus, while his fists clenched tightly. The originally black and white of his eyes had now changed to a deathly white.

“Furious Sea of Fists!” he roared, and abruptly his fists struck simultaneously. Immediately, sounds of waves erupted, and the shadow of a tidal wave appeared striking towards Ling Han.

‘Battle prowess of 22 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, almost close to 23 Stars,’ Ling Han assessed in his heart. But, how much had his own battle prowess reached now?

“Go!” He rushed out, striking forward with a palm. A golden brilliance surged forth, directly splitting open the tidal wave, and continued to strike towards Zhong Hai.

A look of shock immediately crossed Zhong Hai’s face. What exactly was this attack of his opponent, actually being able to so easily break through his Furious Sea of Fists? He promptly turned around—this was to play the same old trick, taking advantage of his innate defense ability to get the upper hand.

Hong!

Ling Han’s palm pressed onto the tortoise shell; both figures were seemingly frozen in their positions, with only the flickering of the divine patterns on the tortoise shell seen.

Blocked yet again?

The audience were all disappointed. They were, of course, hoping that Ling Han could emerge victorious—even for those of the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, it was no different.

Ka , a crisp and clear sound rang out, and a crack could actually be seen appearing on the tortoise shell. Next, it spread out akin to a spider’s web, and in an instant already covered the whole tortoise shell.

Then, piece by piece, it broke—just like porcelain.
