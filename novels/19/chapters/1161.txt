Chapter 1162: Don’t Let This Dog Go Crazy Again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This middle-aged man was called Wei Zecheng, and he was at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. He was extremely renowned in the Majestic Heaven Sect.

Even at the Majestic Heaven Sect, there were only 24 Heavenly Body Tier elites.

However, an elite like him had actually been sent flying by a single strike! Who could believe this?

Not only that, but the person who had achieved this feat was actually a mere Mountain River Tier disciple!

This was far too astonishing.

As powerful and as prodigious as Yang Hao was, he could only battle against those at the Sun Moon Tier. Could he challenge Heavenly Body Tier elites? No way!

The onlookers had felt their heads go numb with shock when they witnessed Yang Hao being defeated by a single strike. Yet, right now, even Wei Zecheng was defeated by a single strike. The onlookers were transfixed with shock, and they were so stunned that even their souls almost left their bodies.

Wei Zecheng grimaced as he crawled up from the ground, a look of pure shock on his face. He had thought that Hu Feiyun only possessed a spiritual mark of Empress Luan Xing. As such, her power would at most be a fraction of that of the Heavenly Body Tier. However, by the looks of it right now, her power was far above just a fraction of the Heavenly Body Tier.

If a fraction of the empress’ power was this already this strong, then this empress had definitely reached the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier!

Wei Zecheng suppressed his anger, and said, “I have to admit that your strength is astonishing. However, this is the Majestic Heaven Sect!”

Empress Luan Xing took no heed of his words. She clasped her hands behind her back, and said, “Don’t let your dog run loose. If he goes crazy and attacks people again, I’ll make sure to knock all of his teeth out!”

Yang Hao felt utterly humiliated. He had been compared to a dog!!

However, did he dare to jump out and speak now?

That was Empress Luan Xing!

Which ruler wasn’t bold and wise? Which ruler wasn’t supremely talented and at the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier?

Yang Hao was indeed an outstanding prodigy. However, if he wanted to surpass Empress Luan Xing, that would take him at least tens of thousands of years. In fact, it might even be impossible to surpass her.

After all, how many Eternal River Tier elites did this galaxy have?

One!

Yang Hao could only swallow this humiliation.

There was a look of deep hatred in his eyes as he glowered at Ling Han. It was because of this person that he had been humiliated before everyone! Although losing to a Heavenly Body Tier elite wouldn’t smear his reputation much, it was still extremely embarrassing to have so many others witness his pathetic defeat.

Ling Han cracked a smile at him. This was his wife, so it was only natural that she stepped out to help her husband.

‘Who told you to pick on me first?

‘If our cultivation levels were the same, who would be afraid of whom?’

A look of fury flashed across Wei Zecheng’s face. However, his might was significantly weakened due to Empress Luan Xing’s domineering aura, and the threats that were at the tip of his tongue wouldn’t come out no matter what.

This was the difference between elites and king tiers.

“Remember my words!” Empress Luan Xing swept her gaze over Yang Hao before shutting her eyes. When she reopened them, her formidable aura receded like a falling tide. Her domineering aura was gone, and it was replaced by one of innocence and ditziness.

She had naturally reverted back to being Hu Feiyun.

“Huh? Why is everyone staring at me?” the ditzy woman said. There was a puzzled look on her pretty face. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The others couldn’t help but grimace. Who would’ve thought that this “unremarkable” woman actually had such a terrifying background?

This “unremarkable” wasn’t referring to Hu Feiyun’s looks, but rather her performance after she entered the sect. She hadn’t done anything astonishing or worthy of notice. Thus, she was naturally unremarkable when compared to the other similarly talented seed-level prodigies.

However, there was actually the spiritual mark of a supreme elite imprinted into this unremarkable woman’s body. This almost frightened them to death. Thankfully, they hadn’t picked on her before. Otherwise, they would die without even knowing how they were killed.

Although Empress Luan Xing had “left”, Wei Zecheng still didn’t dare to touch Hu Feiyun. He glanced at her one last time before grabbing Yang Hao and striding down the mountain peak.

Although Yang Hao hadn’t been killed by Empress Luan Xing’s attacks, he had still suffered extremely grave wounds. In fact, his wounds were definitely a dozen or even two dozen times more severe than Ling Han’s.

This revealed the empress’ attitude—if you beat my people, I’d return the favor 10 times over!

“How domineering!” Ling Han murmured to himself. “No wonder she wants me to reach the Genesis Tier before allowing me to marry her. Otherwise, based on her strong temperament, she’ll definitely be the one riding on top of me. Say, it’s not like I can’t accept that position.”

After this incident, none of the seeds felt like continuing their discussions anymore. Thus, everyone started to take their leave.

Anyhow, they all had wild ambitions to reach the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier after witnessing the battles of the king tier prodigies. Otherwise, what would it matter even if they advanced to the Sun Moon Tier? They would most definitely lose if they were to battle against king tiers at the same cultivation level!

They were all prodigies among prodigies, and thus it was only natural that their aim was to become an invincible king tier.

“Brother Han, I’ll contact you in a few days,” He Tao said with a smile. He then waved and bade farewell.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Sure, let’s talk later.”

“Senior Brother Han, do you know of someone called Ling Han?” Shao Sisi and the others all walked over and stared at Ling Han.

Like Ling Han, this man also possessed a terrifying physique. However, they refused to believe that there existed two such freaks in the world. Moreover, this person was called “Han Lin”, and wasn’t the reverse of this “Ling Han”?

Ling Han knew that they were already suspicious of his identity. Thus, he didn’t plan to hide it from them any longer. Anyhow, he trusted that they weren’t bigmouths who would go around telling everyone. He smiled, and said, “Guys, it’s been two years. You all look quite well, huh?”

Shao Sisi and the others were all moved. ‘F*ck! It really is him!’

“I was thinking it was you! However, I wasn’t really sure, as you were only at the high extreme two years ago.” Su Jing sighed with emotion, and continued, “It’s only been two years, yet your cultivation level has already surpassed ours. That’s unbelievable!”

“I was just lucky,” Ling Han said.

“F*ck! You’re showing off! I can’t get used to this!”

“Drag him along for a drink. We have to get him drunk!”

“Agreed! We definitely have to get him drunk!”

They dragged Ling Han to go drinking, and the Rain Emperor and Ding Ping naturally tagged along. To Ling Han’s surprise, Xia Wuque also went along with them. He couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. They had once been enemies, yet Xia Wuque’s attitude toward him had seen a massive change.

There was a small town under the Majestic Heaven Sect, and it had restaurants, bars, and all the other necessary services. They paid for a private room, then started to drink to their heart’s content.

Ling Han mentioned the Mystery Realm that He Tao had invited him to enter together, and to his surprise, a lot of them already knew about this.

“You’re probably referring to the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm.” Shao Sisi nodded, and continued, “That’s an ancient Mystery Realm, and it’s one where Venerable Trinity personally broke open the outer layer of restrictive formations. If he hadn’t done so, no one would be able to enter.”

“However, Venerable Trinity himself isn’t able to enter this Mystery Realm. According to rumors, doing so will either result in his death or result in the destruction of the entire Mystery Realm.”

“There are numerous ancient treasures inside, and there are also some high-grade Godly medicines. It’s extremely attractive to cultivators.”

“However, only those at the Mountain River Tier can enter, so many people purposefully suppress their cultivation in order to stay at this tier. Their aim is simply to enter this Mystery Realm a few more times. They wish to accumulate enough resources and comprehension for their future cultivation.”

Su Jing and the others all chimed in to explain the situation. They all had powerful backgrounds, and thus they were naturally more informed than Ling Han when it came to such secrets.

“However, I’ve heard that some powerful clans go even further. They specifically have some Sun Moon Tier elites sever their cultivation level and act as guards for their juniors.”

“I’ve also heard about such practices,” Xia Wuque said. “Moreover, even though they’ve severed their cultivation level, they can still raise their power by ingesting some forbidden alchemical pills. Coupled with their comprehension that’s already at the Sun Moon Tier, an increase in power naturally means that they’re also able to wield higher-tier Regulations.

“Which means... they may as well still be at the Sun Moon Tier!”
