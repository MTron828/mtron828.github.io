Chapter 2134: Repeated defeats

However, that person had just been sent flying when another person came to block his way. Yet this time, it was an Immortal Palace Tier.

Immortal Palace Tier against Dividing Soul Tier meant an absolute domination, and there was no one that could be exempted.

Thus, this person stood with his arms crossed behind his back, looking as confident as if he had everything under control.

“Young Master Ling, was it? Why are you in such a rush to leave? With Lady Imperial Empress being so concerned about you, perhaps you may become our Young Imperial Emperor in future. Our Four Seas Palace is a first-class force in the Celestial Realm. This kind of honor and wealth is something that others would not even dare to dream of, yet it is within arm’s reach for you. I am really dying of envy.”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Are you getting lost or not? If you aren’t, then if I ever become that so-called Young Imperial Emperor, the first head I will be cutting off would be yours. Would you believe me?”

‘F*ck!’

That Immortal Palace Tier’s face involuntarily twitched, with him feeling like he had shot himself in the foot. Immediately, the confidence in his expression had completely vanished.

Indeed. With how highly Shang Zhiwei prized Ling Han, even if she did not appoint Ling Han as Young Imperial Emperor, the title of Holy Son or something of sort was definitely possible. And the other man was just a mere Immortal Palace Tier, and could just barely be considered an elite in the Four Seas Palace.

If Ling Han really wanted to make life difficult for him, who would be able to speak up on his behalf?

Then, should he just step aside?

But what if the crime of letting Ling Han flee was placed on him, and Shang Zhiwei blamed him? Would he be able to bear the consequences?

Involuntarily, he was trapped in a tight spot, and felt incredible regret. If he had known, then he would have settled the matter just by knocking the other party out. Now that he had thrown out these words, he had also tossed the difficult problem in front of him.

Taking advantage of the opening when this person was hesitating, Ling Han immediately channeled a movement technique, breaking into a run and fleeing.

“Young Master Ling, you had better stay!” This person moved, grabbing out at Ling Han’s shoulder.

He had made his decision. Even if Ling Han wanted to make things difficult for him, it would only happen in the future, but if he allowed Ling Han to escape, then Shang Zhiwei’s punishment would be close at hand. He could only hate himself secretly for being so nosy and determined to run out, leading to the presently difficult situation.

“Yi?” He faltered slightly because the space within 3,000 meters of him had all warped, as if it had become multiple mirrors, and there was a Ling Han in every single mirror.

He knew that these had to be false images, but these false images were too real. Whether it was appearance or aura, there was not the slightest bit of difference from the original, reaching the point where he could not distinguish which one was the real one at all.

“Quite interesting, but don’t you know that the gap in cultivation level between you and me is really too wide!” The Immortal Palace Tier humphed, and stretched out his right hand. A seal that looked like a fierce tiger lit up on the back of his hand.

Boom

, a shock wave rippled out.?Peng, peng, peng. The warped space crumbled, and the Ling Han that was in them only trembled before shattering. It was only the time for a single breath, and the 3,000 meters wide Mirror Space had completely collapsed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As for Ling Han?

That Immortal Palace Tier realized, much to his shock, that this brat had actually appeared 1,000 miles away in the distance, moving so fast that he was about to run out of the range of his vision.

What was going on?

Right under his nose, Ling Han had actually managed to escape and flee?

With a battle cry, the man’s figure moved, and set off in rapid pursuit of Ling Han. In a few steps, he had already caught up with Ling Han. He once again stretched out his hand to grab him, intending to capture Ling Han.

‘I won’t believe this. A great Immortal Palace Tier, and I still can’t capture a Dividing Soul Tier?’

Ling Han used the same trick again, using Void Space once more. Countless mirror images appeared. There were millions of him, and it was impossible to distinguish which one was real at all.

“I get it now!” That Immortal Palace Tier laughed loudly.

Ling Han’s Void Space actually surpassed the range of 3,000 meters, but Ling Han had deliberately limited its size, yet placed his true self outside of this range. Then, the opponent would be fooled by his first impression, and think that Ling Han was within this range. Then, even after he crumbled this space, he could still do nothing against Ling Han.

‘Good one, brat, to actually use secret techniques as nimbly as this, what a prodigy!’

He had also gained the desire to cherish talent, yet knew very well that he was not qualified to take Ling Han as a disciple at all.

…Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King regarded Ling Han as very important, so what place did that leave him?

WIth a burst of Celestial power,?pa, pa, pa, pa, the Mirror Space was immediately shattered once more, and while he was faltering, he saw that Ling Han had again appeared 1,000 miles away.

‘F***, F***, F***!’

Being fooled once was forgivable, but he really should not have fallen for the same trick again.

Was he an idiot?

That Immortal Palace Tier couldn’t help but feel a sliver of anger. Ling Han had not changed his tricks at all. Yet, the 6,000-meter-wide Mirror Space he had spread out now was still not his limit. Thus, he had once again managed to successfully deceive him.

‘But would you be capable of escaping?

‘Just how much weaker is the Dividing Soul Tier compared to Immortal Palace Tier? Even if you used all your techniques, so what? You still will not be able to escape from the palm of my hand.’

His figure streaked out again, and caught up with Ling Han for the third time.

He stretched out his palm, and he did not change his strategy of attack, either. This was also a kind of pride.

Ling Han smiled, and Void Space was spread out again. This time, it encompassed an area of 12,000 meters.

“I have already seen through your tricks!” that Immortal Palace Tier declared proudly.?Boom, his large hand spread out, enshrouding a total of 24,000 meters in space.

‘This is your limit, isn’t it?’

The large hand pressed down, and all the images were immediately shattered. However, Ling Han’s true self still did not appear.

The Immortal Palace Tier’s expression immediately became incredibly dark, as if someone had delivered a harsh slap to his face. That was how embarrassing it was.

Ling Han… was still 1,000 miles away.

This brat could actually unfold his Mirror Space for more than 12,000 meters!

The Immortal Palace Tier was really stunned. A mere Earth Soul actually could control the Regulations of Space over such a large area. This was too unbelievable.

“Old Qian, just how many times have you moved? And you actually haven’t been able to take down a mere Dividing Soul Tier yet?” Someone laughed derisively. This was a colleague from the Four Seas Palace, but their usual relations really could not be considered very amicable.

Old Qian humphed, and with another step, he caught up once more with Ling Han, pulling him down with a hand.

‘Come on then, I refuse to believe that your Mirror Space can have an even wider range than my attack range.’

However, he miscalculated.

This time, Ling Han did not cast his Mirror Doppelgangers, but instead used the mirrors to advance rapidly. Added with a burst from the Regulations of Lightning, his speed reached a level that even Immortal Palace Tiers would be moved at for an instant.

Xiu, he fled before Old Qian’s attack landed, escaping by a hair’s breadth.

This time, even those Ascending Origin Tiers cast their eyes over, locking down on Ling Han.

This Dividing Soul Tier was truly a little freakish.

“Holy Daughter An Ran is only like this as well, right?”

“I thought that Holy Daughter An Ran would definitely become the next Imperial Empress, but if this brat joins our Four Seas Palace, with how freakishly talented he is, and added with how the Imperial Empress prizes him, it would definitely have a major impact on Holy Daughter An Ran.”

“There is definitely going to be a good show to watch.”

The members of the Four Seas Palace all conversed spiritedly. The battle had essentially been decided. There were only a limited few that were still stubbornly resisting, allowing them to have enough free, leisurely time to interact.

Ling Han did not flee any longer. Though he had successfully escaped from the hands of an Immortal Palace Tier four times, and could do so even five or 10 times more, there would ultimately be a time when techniques could no longer be used.

Hide into the Black Tower? That was a question. There were hundreds of Celestial Kings here, and when Shang Zhiwei got a hand free, the power of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was even more unpredictable.

“Old Qian, do you just have this little bit of power?” He laughed loudly, beginning to mock Old Qian.

Old Qian’s face was flushed red, feeling like there were countless eyes directed on him, and making him want nothing more than to find a hole that he could bury himself in.

He moved once more, grabbing out towards Ling Han.
