Chapter 399: White-Robed Sword King

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Shen Zhong Cheng sat upright and still, and said indifferently, “I never spar with an already defeated opponent.”

“Shen Zhong Cheng, you’re scared, right?!” Luo Da’s voice floated over from outside.

Shen Zhong Cheng picked up his wine bowl, took a sip, and said, “I dislike people like you who don’t know their own limits, so if you force me to fight, I definitely won’t hold back.”

“Haha, all the better, I want to see how your strength has improved,” Luo Da said, but his laughter was extremely gloomy, showing extreme displeasure.

Shen Zhong Cheng stood up, reached for the sword on the table, and walked with large strides out of the tavern.

Hong , the crowd instantly surged out. This was a fierce fight between two figures that ranked towards the front—who wouldn’t want to witness it?

“Let’s go check it out too,” Ling Han said smilingly.

Hu Niu nodded. With one hand grabbing onto the corner of Ling Han’s clothes—while the other hand didn’t forget to grab some dried meat to chew on—she left the tavern together with Ling Han, leaving the stronghold and arriving at an open area outside.

At this moment, Shen Zhong Cheng was standing opposite of a twenty-four to twenty-five year old youngster. That youngster’s physique was tall and sturdy, probably taller than normal people by two heads, and instantly made Shen Zhong Cheng look like a child.

This person was obviously Luo Da. Such a stalwart guy’s choice of weapon was actually not the brute-force type like a rod or an axe, but rather a sword as well—and it was two short swords, which were like embroidery needles when held in his hands. He looked extremely incongruous.

However, no one laughed; Luo Da was forty-second place on the prodigy roll, and that was definitely not earned by joking.

“Draw your sword!” Luo Da said loudly.

“If you can force me to draw my sword, I’ll naturally draw it,” Shen Zhong Cheng said indifferently. Those words were pretty pretentious, yet the girls that watched the battle in the vicinity shot out smitten radiance from their eyes.

“Arrogant!” Luo Da attacked brandishing both short swords; martial intent burst forth, forming white silk lines that convolved around Shen Zhong Cheng.

Ling Han couldn’t help but nod. Luo Da certainly was a Spiritual Pedestal Tier elite, he just hadn’t stabilized his cultivation at mid stage of the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. These silk lines were concentrated from Sword Qi; he obviously cultivated a strange sword art that could actually turn Sword Qi into silk lines without it scattering, which was certainly somewhat impressive.

Being able to be listed on the prodigy roll, could he even be a mediocre person?

Shen Zhong Cheng used his fingers as swords and shifted his feet, waving his fingers to unleash Sword Qi.

Sword Qi—why was it called Sword Qi? That was because it needed a sword to compound the sharpness of a treasured sword before being used; however, when shot out with fingers, the sharpness would be largely decreased. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Why wasn’t Fist Qi sent out instead? That was because the power of fists was in the power of the strike, and not in effects of slicing, cutting, or dicing.

Now, Shen Zhong Cheng used his fingers as a sword, and the power of the Sword Qi was naturally much weakened. If the sword in his hand were a fourth tier or even a fifth tier Spirit Tool, then the effects would naturally lower even more.

Everyone involuntarily cried out. Shen Zhong Cheng was truly talented and bold—being clearly lower than Luo Da by a large tier, he still dared to act so arrogant, not even drawing his weapon.

However, Shen Zhong Cheng wasn’t wildly arrogant, but genuinely talented, moving his fingers as if playing a lute. Xiu, xiu, xiu , he fired flash after flash of Sword Qi, just enough to neutralize Luo Da’z attacks.

The two... actually tied!

However, Luo Da was a large tier higher and using weapons. The two short swords were clearly Spirit Tools on which were shining vein-like lines. Under the situation of having such a large advantage, he could only tie with Shen Zhong Cheng when in fact he already suffered an overwhelming defeat.

Hu Niu’s eyes began to light up, staring at Shen Zhong Cheng’s figure and revealing a bellicose expression.

Ling Han also somewhat itched to fight as he was also a sword user.

“As expected of the White-Robed Sword King, too strong!”

“Being able to match Luo Da who is at the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier while himself being at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier... If he advances into the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, his estimated battle prowess should rocket to nine stars or even ten stars.”

“Yeah, there’s still four months’ time; Shen Zhong Cheng can definitely advance into the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. It’ll be a good show at the year-end prodigy battle with yet another anomaly.”

Everyone nodded one after another, giving complete approval of Shen Zhong Cheng’s strength.

“Ah!” Luo Da roared, unable to accept such a result despite having clearly advanced into the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. He had been assuming that he could rely on the advantage of a large tier to suppress the powerful opponent before him, but still ended up empty handed.

His eyes turned red as he decided to use a few trump cards; he definitely couldn’t lose in public.

“Hahahaha, are these the so-called experts on North Region’s Prodigy Roll?” A youngster arrived in a streak. Hong , the presence of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier overflowed without restraint, instantly suppressing everyone to the point of gasping for breath.

Everyone was shocked. This youngster was only twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, yet he was a high level Spiritual Pedestal Tier warrior and definitely had shocking battle prowess, however, no one recognized his identity.

Such a genius should be a well-known figure on the prodigy roll.

Shen Zhong Cheng and Luo Da immediately stopped their fight, looking at the youngster simulatenously.

“Truly disappoints me, so weak that I can’t bear to look!” The youngster shook his head, disdain across his face. “Trash like you guys have the nerve to rank on some prodigy roll? It really makes me laugh my head off.”

“Who the hell are you?” Luo Da said in anger. This guy basically looked down on all one hundred people on the prodigy roll.

“Me?” The youngster leapt out, pressing his left hand towards Luo Da while firing a fist towards Shen Zhong Cheng; he actually challenged two outstanding figures on the prodigy roll at the same time.

Luo Da immediately slashed with his sword while Shen Zhong Cheng hesitated. With a qiang , his long sword was unsheathed; shua, shua, shua, seven flashes of Sword Qi instantly struck towards the youngster.

Peng! Peng!

With two suppressed sounds, Luo Da and Shen Zhong Cheng were both sent back, dripping blood from their mouths and suffering a loss on this exchange.

Hiss , everyone couldn’t help but be dumbstruck.

One against two, fighting two prodigies, he not only won completely, but also injured the two—his strength was truly shocking. Although high level Spiritual Pedestal Tier certainly should show such a performance, this youngster was only twenty-four to twenty-five years old; it could be said as very fair.

No wonder he dared to act so arrogantly, he certainly was very monstrous.

“Who are you exactly?” Luo Da cried out in surprise.

Shen Zhong Cheng took off his bamboo hat and showed an average-looking face. However, his eyes were like dazzling stars, making people stare at them uncontrollably, unable to free themselves. His bellicosity soared through the sky as he was holding his long sword in front of him and emitting waves of a profound aura.

Ling Han shook his head slightly. The tier was a shortcoming, but if Shen Zhong Cheng advanced into the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, he would qualify to battle with that youngster. But now? He didn’t!

...That youngster was at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and from this attack earlier, his battle prowess should be around twelve stars or thirteen stars, not too freakish. However, to crush Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors, the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier was more than enough.
