Chapter 1879: Causing trouble

Not only was the Alchemist Pavilion the place to authenticate alchemists and alchemist trainees, it was also the largest pharmacy of every level that sold alchemical pills.

How could Ou Kan possibly think that Ling Han was here to take the test for alchemists? In his eyes, he had to have come to buy Celestial pills.

As a Holy Son, Ou Kan had special privileges. If he couldn’t even decide who could buy the alchemical pills, this title would really be too useless.

Ling Han ignored him, and continued on ahead, his speed very fast.

Ou Kan hurriedly set off in pursuit with large strides. As he saw it, Ling Han wanted to throw him off his tail, and then go to purchase alchemical pills.

Ptui, in his dreams!

Behind him, four guards appeared and followed closely behind.

The distance of a few hundred metres was nothing to a Severing Mundane Tier. Though there were protective formations here, which largely restricted the speed of traveling, that was only a few breaths’ time. Ling Han thus entered into the great pavilion.

The first floor of this great pavilion sold alchemical pills. Multiple pill drawers were lined up, and there was no end in sight. Furthermore, they were rows upon rows, and their exact number was unknown.

Even in a Celestial King Tier-level force, it was still “mortals” below Severing Mundane Tier that were the majority, and Alchemy City was naturally no exception, either.

Thus, the majority of alchemical pills here were sold to mortals, and the largest number was targeted at Immortal level. There were also very few that were meant for the Shattering Void Tier and below. That was because citizens of the Celestial Realm were born powerful. The majority was already in the Shattering Void Tier by birth, so would there still be any need for alchemical pills for Spiritual Ocean Tier or Heaven Tier?

Ling Han began to walk around. A Celestial had a limitless lifespan; at least it was fine to waste one or two days’ time.

Ou Kan followed him all the way, and wherever they went, the attendants behind the pill cabinets would pay their respects to him.

A Holy Son was high and noble!

A hint of pride appeared on Ou Kan’s face. The previous blow that had wounded his confidence was currently recovering.

‘See, that is how awesome and amazing I am.’

Ling Han deliberately stopped, and asked for the pricing of the alchemical pills.

Ou Kan stood behind him, and directly said, “No sale!”

The attendant showed a troubled expression. What logic was there to pushing customers out the door in a business? But this Holy Son had already spoken, and no matter how brave he was, he did not dare go against his will.

“Customer, many apologies. This pill is not for sale,” he said with slight anxiety, fearing that he would lose his job, but what he feared more was that Ling Han would hold a grudge against him. After all, he was only in the Heavenly Body Tier.

Ling Han chucked, and continued on walking ahead.

Whatever pill that he stopped to ask about the price of, the vendors all directly told him it was not for sale under Ou Kan’s overbearing pressure.

After walking around for a good while, Ling Han indeed could not possibly purchase a single alchemical pill.

“How about it? Do you now know the consequences of going against my will?” Ou Kan asked proudly, and then his tone turned cold. “Furthermore, though Alchemy City forbids murder, do you know that some people could possibly disappear inexplicably? I heard you have two beautiful wives too. Tsk, tsk. You can’t be hoping to make them into widows, right?

“Women are really too unreliable. Possibly not even grass has sprouted on your grave, and they are already playing coy in the arms of another man.”

These words were very malicious and filled with threat.

Instantly, Ling Han’s expression darkened. ‘If you want to play around, I’ll play with you, but you actually direct the spearhead at my wives.’ Ling Han could not tolerate that.

‘Who do you f****** think you are?’

Ling Han turned around abruptly. Pa, he grabbed Ou Kan’s collar and picked him up. Though the latter was a peak stage fourth severance king tier, in front of Ling Han, he couldn’t even fight back in the slightest.

This was completely one-sided suppression.

“If you are so determined to seek death, fine, I’ll oblige you!” Ling Han patted Ou Kan’s face with his palm. “Just hold on. If I don’t kill you, then my name isn’t Ling Han!”

Very quickly, he released his hold. This was the Alchemist Pavilion, and if he made a move on an alchemist, especially one that was a Holy Son, that would be too unwise.

Ou Kan still shivered in fear. That previous look in Ling Han’s eyes possessed a very frightening aura, causing his heart to feel lingering fear. Even now, he had not regained his composure, but he immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation.

In Alchemy City, in the Alchemist Pavilion, Ling Han actually dared to threaten him!

This was his territory!

‘How dare you!’

He was so furious it felt like his chest was close to bursting. However, while Ling Han had indeed picked him up just now, he did not make any further more, so he could not flare up.

Firstly, it would make him seem too narrow-minded, and secondly, Ling Han’s reputation was not weak at all in recent times. If he could not take hold of Ling Han’s weakness, and use it to compel him to join him, then he definitely would be targeted by Lu Xianming, and pay an exorbitant price.

His face was livid. ‘Do you really think that I can’t do anything to you?’ Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ou Kan quickly set off after him. He had already made up his mind. Today, he would not let Ling Han buy a single alchemical pill, even if it was the very lowest grade of alchemical pill! And after today, he would send out assassins to get rid of Ling Han.

Just like he had said, in Alchemy City, some people could possibly disappear for no reason. As long as no bodies were discovered, who could say for sure that they had died?

Ling Han walked to the end of this great pavilion, and was immediately halted.

“Visitors stop here. From the second floor onwards, it is not open to visitors!” A guard immediately lowered the long spear in his hands, blocking Ling Han’s way forwards.

Ou Kan crossed his arms over his chest behind him, watching coldly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I want to undergo the test for alchemists.”

Pu!

Immediately, Ou Kan spluttered, the expression on his face indescribably strange.

‘You want to take the test for alchemists? You have got to be joking, right? You are f******* just a prodigy of martial arts. Could it be that you think that you are an all-round prodigy?’

The guard faltered slightly. Going by the rules of Alchemist Pavilion, this was indeed allowed.

He said, “Then, please wait. Allow me to make a report.” He had a Sound Transmission Stone, which could allow for instant communication across a short distance. Of course, this short distance was referring to the whole space of the fourth level of Alchemy City!

After a while, a young man that looked like an alchemy apprentice walked out through the passage. When he saw Ling Han, he calmly asked, “So you are the one that would like to be authenticated as an alchemist?”

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded.

“Lord, Lord Holy Son!” This alchemy apprentice had just discovered Ou Kan’s presence, and quickly paid his respects.

Ou Kan waved him off dismissively, indicating that the other needed not have any reservations.

This alchemy apprentice thought that Ling Han was deliberately brought over by Ou Kan, and the prideful expression on his face immediately disappeared. He cordially said to Ling Han, “Are you already a high-grade trainee now?”

“No.” Ling Han shook his head.

“Then, a middle-grade trainee?”

“No.”

“Beginner trainee?”

“No.”

After asking for three times consecutively, and getting three negative answers in a row, the alchemy apprentice couldn’t help but grit his teeth. ‘Then where did you get the pride to actually declare that you want to take the test for alchemists?’

“According to the rules, the test must begin from the lowest grade of trainee. Only high-grade trainees can test for the status of alchemist,” this alchemy apprentice said carefully, fearing that he would anger Ou Kan.

“Fine.” Ling Han nodded. It was only a matter that would take more twists and turns—simple enough.

Ou Kan merely smirked coldly by the side, but did not correct him. He wanted to have Ling Han be praised here, praised so much to a lofty position, and then he would kick him off the pedestal with a single move so that he would be completely shamed.

The alchemy apprentice led Ling Han to the second floor, and then began the procedure for testing.

Because the first step was only becoming a beginner trainee, there was only a middle-grade trainee as witness.

“Greetings, Lord Holy Son!” That middle-grade trainee hurriedly paid his greetings when he saw Ou Kan. He immediately “understood”. Ling Han had to have a powerful background as he was qualified to have Ou Kan accompany him. Even if he was as stupid as a pig, he would be lenient, and allow him to pass.

After all, it was only a beginner trainee. There would not be any investigations done.

“Have him concoct the Green Rainbow Pill,” Ou Kan suddenly spoke up.

“Ah!” That middle-grade trainee was instantly shocked. That was because the Green Rainbow Pill was the hardest to concoct among beginner grade alchemical pills. In fact, it could be compared to middle-grade alchemical pills.
