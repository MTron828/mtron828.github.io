Chapter 1166: Stunned Han Huo

One day under the Reincarnation Tree was equivalent to one year in the outside world!

Seven days passed, and Ling Han made his first attempt to refine the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill. He naturally failed.

Reality and expectations still differed by quite a bit.

Ling Han didn’t immediately make a new attempt. Instead, he chose to meditate for two days.

In other words, he spent two years analyzing the reason for his failure. Only after this did he start a new attempt.

He failed again.

However, Ling Han only spent a few hours analyzing his failure this time. He started his third attempt.

Success!

However, he only managed to concoct two pills.

Theoretically speaking, one cauldron could yield a maximum of four Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills. Ling Han had successfully refined two, so he was already halfway to success. This was an outstanding result. However, he was extremely dissatisfied when he observed these two pills more closely.

This was because they were of relatively low quality.

In fact, Ling Han felt an urge to throw these two pills away. He was the Alchemy Emperor, so what face did he have to give these pills to others? However, he slowly lowered his raised arm.

He was too poor!

Regardless of their quality, these two pills could still be sold for tens of thousands of True Origin Stones. It would be a pity to throw them away just like this.

“Sigh, why am I so poor?” Ling Han rubbed his chin, and then looked at his Divine Demon Sword. How much money would he need to spend in order to raise the level of his Divine Demon Sword?

‘However, I’ll receive a God Tool that truly belongs to me. So, it’s all worth it in the end!’

The Black Tower was indeed impressive, yet he could only use it as a Spatial God Tool. He couldn’t unleash its powerful offensive abilities.

Thus, it wasn’t necessarily better to have a high-level God Tool. What was more important was how much of the God Tool’s power one could unleash.

‘I’ll refine more!’

Ling Han had purchased enough ingredients to refine five cauldrons of pills. He had wanted to buy more, but he was strapped for cash, so he could only settle with this amount.

His fourth attempt yielded three Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills, and during his fifth attempt, he finally achieved a perfect yield of four pills. Although his improvements seemed incredible, he had needed to reflect and analyze under the Reincarnation Tree after each attempt. It was through this process that he was able to correct his mistakes.

Thus, the quality of the pills in the fifth cauldron also saw a marked improvement. In fact, they were bordering on perfection.

Ling Han smiled, and mused to himself, “Will Manager Han be stunned when he sees these pills?”

Only a month had passed, yet he had already refined nine Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills. Moreover, four of them were of perfect quality.

Successfully refining a cauldron of Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills took five days. This refinement time was typical for Level Five Divine Pills. However, it was rumored that Divine Pills above level nine would take at least half a year to refine. A tiny error could destroy months or even years of hard work.

“My cultivation level hasn’t gone up by much, but my divine sense has become far stronger,” Ling Han murmured to himself. He had been refining pills for the past few weeks, so he naturally didn’t have any time to cultivate. As such, his Origin Power remained on roughly the same level. However, alchemy was extremely taxing on one’s divine sense, and it could be viewed as a kind of tempering.

‘Let me sell these pills first. I need to earn enough money to raise this Divine Demon Sword to level four.’

This was Ling Han’s short-term goal. Raising the sword to level five could be left for the future, for he still hadn’t broken through to the Sun Moon Tier yet.

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, only to hear Fan Ru say that messengers from the Gao Faction had already visited several times. However, Ling Han had been cultivating in seclusion, so they could only leave in discontentment. It was rumored that Gao Huang had become furious, even releasing a statement saying that Ling Han had to personally beg for an audience with the Gao Faction. The time limit for this... Yesterday was already the last day.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Is he a dumb c*nt?”

He ignored the matter and left his palace.

He arrived at the town at the foot of the mountain, and then headed to the Mo Clan Establishment.

“Young Master Ling!” Han Huo just so happened to be on the ground floor, and he faltered for a moment upon seeing Ling Han. Then, a puzzled expression appeared on his face. ‘Why has this prodigy come again?

‘Has he given up after studying the pill recipe and realizing that he can’t possibly refine it? Has he come to exchange the level five pill recipe for an easier pill recipe?’

In his mind, this was reasonable and fair.

Ling Han retrieved a vial of pills, and said, “Manager Han, could you please sell these pills for me?”

Han Huo didn’t think much of this. He accepted the vial of pills, and asked, “Young Master Han, are these still Mysterious Azure Pill? Oh, that’s right, the pills that you handed me last time have all sold out already. Moreover, they made quite a big profit!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “No, these aren’t Mysterious Azure Pills. They’re Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills.”

Pu!

Han Huo instantly spluttered loudly before coughing non-stop. His entire face became red.

‘Is he joking?

‘It’s only been a month, yet he’s successfully refined the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill already?

‘Impossible! Definitely impossible!’

Although this was a Level Five Divine Pill, it was extraordinarily difficult to refine. In fact, even level six alchemists would avoid refining this pill. However, Ling Han had successfully refined it in just a mere month? Was this some kind of joke?

“Young Master Han, you’re quite the joker!” he said with a chuckle.

Ling Han also chuckled, and said, “Indeed, I do enjoy joking around.”

Han Huo breathed a sigh of relief before curiously asking, “Then what pills have you refined this time?”

He was slightly puzzled. Wasn’t Ling Han studying the pill recipe for the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill? Why was he suddenly refining some other pill?

He opened the vial and poured several crimson-red pills into his hand. To his astonishment, it felt as if these pills were burning. Not only were they radiating heat, but one could also see the flames that were licking over their bodies.

If he were an ordinary person, a hole would have been instantly burned into his palm—the temperature of these pills was insanely high. Perhaps even those at the Flower Blossom Tier wouldn’t dare to touch these pills.

However, Han Huo was at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, so this level of heat was naturally no problem for him. Even so, the astonishment on his face was more pronounced than if his palm were to be burned.

How could he not be astonished?

These were f*cking Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills!

“Young Master Han, are you sure you’re not joking around with me?”

Han Huo’s face twitched, and it looked as if he were going to faint at any moment.

Ling Han laughed loudly as he patted Han Huo’s shoulder, and said, “Manager Han, you need to work on your sense of humor.”

Although their age differed by tens of thousands of years, Ling Han’s cultivation level was above that of Han Huo. Thus, according to the rules of the cultivation world, he was actually Han Huo’s senior. As such, it wasn’t demeaning for him to pat Han Huo’s shoulders.

Han Huo examined the pills carefully. He was an expert appraiser, and he immediately determined that the nine pills were freshly refined.

The Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill had a unique attribute—the fresher it was, the greener the flames on its surface. As it became older, these flames would gradually become blue, then red, and then eventually purple-black.

When the pills became purple-black, it signified that they were already too old, with much of their effects having already been lost. In other words, the pills would be as good as useless.

Han Huo was almost about to cry. ‘These are genuinely Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills! And fresh ones at that! Has Ling Han truly succeeded?

‘What kind of freak is he?!’

“Young Master Han, did you truly succeed?”

“No, what you’re seeing is just an illusion,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Han Huo finally understood his sense of humor this time. “Young Master Han, you almost shocked me to death. It’s only been a month, yet you’ve already refined the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill. This is a peerless feat with no precedent!”

Although he was purposefully flattering Ling Han, his words weren’t all that exaggerated. After all, if Ling Han didn’t have the Reincarnation Tree, he would have definitely needed a dozen or so years to fully comprehend the pill recipe.

When cultivators reached the Immortal level, their lifespan would increase significantly. However, attempting to comprehend secret techniques, formations, pill recipes, and such could easily take them hundreds of years as well. This was especially astonishing.
