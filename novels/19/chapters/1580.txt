Chapter 1581: Clash of celestial techniques

Ling Han smiled faintly and asked, “Still want to fight?”

“Yes!” Zheng Mo gritted his teeth. He had only broken one right arm, and though this would affect his battle prowess, he did not need to give Ling Han any more handicaps. After drawing out the distance between them, he could use all his techniques; how could it be that he would still be unable to win with that?

“Come!” Ling Han crooked a finger.

“Humph!” Zheng Mo raised his left hand. Weng, a divine light enshrouded him. His face was filled with seriousness, and he suddenly pressed his hand down on Ling Han. “Heavenly Clouds Piercing Mountain Hand!”

Boom!

The giant hand descended, and there were Regulations of great dao entwined around it. It was as if the heavens themselves were raging, and a hand of divine retribution descended, planning to erase everything in this world.

Ling Han nodded internally. The other party’s power was not inferior to his, and in terms of Regulations, his level was higher. Furthermore, he was using some kind of secret technique now, which pushed this man’s battle prowess to a very high level. He was truly very strong.

However, how could it be that he did not have a stronger technique?

Ling Han flicked a finger, and a flash of sword light surged out. Immediately, it transformed into innumerable flashes of sword light, sweeping out towards that giant hand at an extraordinarily fast speed.

Lightning Sword Technique!

Now that he had merged the Regulations of two Realms, the might of the Lightning Sword Technique had also improved to a new level because this was not just the Regulations of one Realm, but the Regulations of two Realms. Creation and destruction formed a cycle, as if it was world creation.

He couldn’t help but feel enlightened. In truth, neither the present Demon Masters nor Saints were the Genesis Tier in the true meaning of the word, because the Genesis Tier meant simultaneously including the two Source Regulations of both Creation and Destruction.

Shua, shua, shua. Sword Qi swept out towards the Nine Heavens unhindered!

The present Lightning Sword Technique was incredible. It was based on speed, and had merged with the power of heavenly tribulation, added with Tide of the Ages. Furthermore, it was Ling Han’s own creation. If he was the one using it, its might would naturally be maximized.

The large hand that Zheng Mo had pressed down with was instantly torn apart. When it arrived, it had actually lost all its might long ago. Not even a corner of Ling Han’s robes had been lifted.

‘So powerful!’

All the king tiers also raised their brows slightly. No matter how much they looked down on Ling Han, they had no choice but to acknowledge Ling Han’s abilities when they were faced with such a scene.

Though it was claimed to be a battle of equal cultivation levels, Zheng Mo actually had a very big advantage. In terms of Regulations, he was at the advantage, and even if one of his arms were broken now, his advantage should still be overwhelming, but they were both equal with this one strike. This was too shocking.

A hint of seriousness finally appeared on Zheng Mo’s face. Previously, even if his arm had broken, he was still confident, and thought that Ling Han only had a slightly stronger physique. But now, he withdrew this kind of underestimation.

In a battle of equals, this was a strong enemy, an opponent that could even defeat him.

This made him very defiant. As a top-grade king tier and a supreme prodigy, he would not allow himself to lose to anyone in a battle of equals. His eyes shone, and multiple streaks of energy rose up from his body, turning into a mist that entwined around him.

Boom, his aura suddenly burst further.

It was clearly that only 10,000 stars were shining, yet his power seemed to have suddenly risen to a new level.

“The unique celestial technique of the Zheng Clan, Mist Technique!”

“Not only can it greatly increase one’s battle prowess, it will turn into a mist that will surround you that none can penetrate.”

“I never thought that his trump card would be forced out so quickly.”

“There is no other option. From the start of the battle, Zheng Mo has not had the upper hand at all. He would be too embarrassed.”

“If it was any other person, he would also feel shame.”

With a battle cry, Zheng Mo suddenly charged towards Ling Han. With a tremble of his hands, he shot out two streaks of bright red clouds that turned into two divine spears that rapidly flew towards Ling Han, poised to stab him. There were multiple divine patterns entwined around the spears, and the light of great dao was flickering on them.

This strike was clearly stronger than the attack before.

Ling Han nodded internally, but he was not afraid in the slightest. Competing with him in celestial techniques? ‘Come, let’s see who has more celestial techniques.’

Boom, endless darkness surged out of his body, and instantly enshrouded everything.

The Darkness of the Paramount Night, a celestial technique that he had used about 1,000 years to learn through these three months.

Being enshrouded by complete darkness, everything had vanished.

Nothing could be seen, touched, or heard. It was as if the whole world had vanished from existence, or he himself no longer existed.

“Yi, why can’t I see through this kind of darkness?” someone exclaimed in surprise. That was an Eternal River Tier pinnacle level elite. Though he had only formed over 1,000,000 stars, and his power was considered the weakest among all the king tiers, he was much stronger than Ling Han, yet he actually could not see through this darkness. What was going on here?

Everyone looked here and there, and then their eyes focused on Zhang Ting, Ye Quan, and Liu Dang. They were the only three freaks out of all of them that had formed 3,000,000 stars, but these three people all shook their heads with grave expressions.

Hiss, even they could not see through it!

Everyone turned their eyes away and turned to look at the three Demon Master-level prodigies—Ouyang He, Leng Xiaoran, and Gou Hai. As for Gu Feng, they were not familiar with him, so it would naturally not be suitable for them to direct their queries at him.

Ouyang He was the most approachable of them, and he said, “This should be a celestial technique that can block the senses. If one’s cultivation level is equal to his, you will be influenced. It is only a matter of whether the influence will be more or less. Only if one surpasses him in terms of a major tier will they be capable of being completely unaffected.”

What he implied was that Demon Masters would not be affected by Ling Han, but as long as Ling Han advanced into the Genesis Tier, then even Heaven Demons would be affected, though the effect would not be very strong.

This ant actually could use a celestial technique?

Could it be that he was not a country bumpkin, but had originated from some Forbidden Land himself?

In the darkness, Zheng Mo did not move recklessly. He realized that his vision, hearing, and divine sense had been confined to a very small range. He was in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, after all, so though the Darkness of the Paramount Night could affect him, it could not possibly completely block his senses.

But he did not even know where Ling Han was, so how was he supposed to defeat Ling Han?

Ling Han grinned, and stretched out his right hand to grab out at Zheng Mo.

Flying Dragon Shadow Hands, another celestial technique!

Boom, his right hand formed a golden dragon’s paw[1] that was incredibly and extraordinarily fast. Otherwise, how could it be called flying shadow? It was so fast that even a cultivator of the same cultivation level would only be able to catch sight of a flying shadow.

Zheng Mo’s expression changed drastically. In the Darkness of the Paramount Night, his reaction would be considerably slower than usual in the first place, yet such a fast attack was actually directed at him, so he was naturally in a sorry state.

“Again!” Ling Han grinned. His right hand was still channelling the Flying Dragon Shadow Hands, while his left hand was using the Lightning Sword Technique. This, too, was a technique focused on speed.

It should be known that the Tide of the Ages was also embedded in the Lightning Sword Technique, and these were four celestial techniques.

Just ask the whole Netherworld now, who else could use four celestial techniques at the same time?

Even if they could learn four celestial techniques, who would be capable of using all four of them at the same time?

Only Ling Han could!

Of course, the Empress would definitely be more powerful in the future because she had nine doppelgangers. Theoretically, she could also use 10 celestial techniques simultaneously, and the mere thought of that would terrify others.

Zheng Mo was tiring from continuously parrying the incoming attacks. He was endlessly hit, and as multiple flashes of power streaked over him, they left behind one wound after another on him. If it was not for the fact that he still had a black plated armor which was indestructible, it would not be only his limbs and face being injured.

“Ah!” He released a roar of rage, and suddenly blew out a breath with all his might, which actually blew away all the darkness by force.

Stars shone resplendently as more than 2,000,000 of them shone at the same time. In the end, he had still broken his word, and channelled the power of all his stars.
