2952 Endless Battles

Ling Han’s luck began to turn for the better. He unearthed a great many raw stones that contained Great Herbs, which caused his cultivation level to finally begin to improve at a decent rate.

Thank you readers!

At this rate, he would only need several hundred thousand years to reach the peak stage of the Fourth Tier.

The question was: were there so many Great Herbs here?

Whatever, he would just try his best to mine all of them.

The Empress and Hu Niu both fully supported Ling Han. Their growth had already reached the limit, and the Fourth Tier was the end of their line—perhaps they could advance to the Fifth Tier, but that would be a matter of who knew how many years. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

!!

Hence, the Great Herbs that they mined would all be handed over to Ling Han so that he could break through to the Fifth Tier as soon as possible.

Just like that, Ling Han’s cultivation level slowly increased. After more than 2,000,000 years, he finally reached the late stage of the Fourth Tier, and was one step closer to the peak stage.

However, right at this moment, the spatial passageway leading to this place had also been discovered. A great many elites barged in. They were not just limited to the Heavenly Venerates of the Flaming Frost Realm; there were also Hysteria’s subordinates among them.

“Ling Han!” He had been discovered again. Seven of Hysteria’s creations appeared, and every single one of them was exuding a terrifying aura, stronger than even Ling Han.

Sixth Tier, they were all at the Sixth Tier, and they were all peak-stage Sixth Tiers at that.

Hysteria had created a considerable number of Sixth Tiers, but there were definitely not many that had reached the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, and those that still possessed intelligence were even rarer.

Ling Han knew that Hysteria was truly wary of him. Previously, there had been three Sixth Tier monsters, and now there were four more. It was clear that Hysteria was determined to kill him.

He immediately put away the Empress and Hu Niu. Faced with Sixth-Tier battle prowess, the two women would not be of help at all.

With a shout, seven Sixth Tier monsters charged over, all of them showing off their terrifying aura, and wanting to crush Ling Han into dust.

“With just you guys, that is still a little bit lacking!” Ling Han exchanged blows with these monsters.

He knew that he was outmatched, but this was a rare opportunity for him to train. Even if he could not gain inspiration, he could still temper his own battle prowess, and that was not too bad, either.

However, the battle had not gone on for too long when Ling Han felt a tremendous pressure.

Not only were Hysteria’s monsters at the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, but they were also proficient in techniques, and even had second-grade combination seals!

If it was first-grade seals, Hysteria should have bestowed them all on Meng Dong, Huangfu Dongyue, and the others. Even if it was the strongest in the world, it could not possibly develop new first-grade seals as easily as that. It would definitely need a very long time.

Thus, in order to make its creations strong enough to kill Ling Han, it could only equip these monsters with second-grade combination seals.

This actually was also a kind of risk. Without its spiritual mark, the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates that had developed intelligence would definitely come to slow realization, and form their own free will. They would walk their own paths, and break free from Hysteria’s control.

…What Heavenly Venerate would be willing to submit to another? What more when it was a peak-stage Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

However, in the short term, these Sixth Tiers couldn’t possibly break free from Hysteria’s control. In order to kill Ling Han, it would spare no expense.

Ling Han parried, but his enemies were too strong, and they had the absolute upper hand in terms of numbers. Naturally, he could only parry. Furthermore, danger was everywhere, and he was constantly wandering on the border of life and death.

It could not be helped. His battle prowess was very strong, but his body had only been tempered by the three fundamental powers, after all. The toughness of his body was far from being comparable to what Sixth Tiers boasted.

Even so, Ling Han was still fighting with his full strength. Unless it was a time when he really couldn’t hold on any longer, he would definitely not retreat.

After battling for over a dozen days, Ling Han finally withdrew.

The seven monsters hurriedly set off in pursuit, but Ling Han used the terrain here to continuously throw them off his tracks.

He had already been here for 2,000,000 years. Even if he did not know every single place like the back of his hand, there was absolutely no problem with tricking these newcomers who had just arrived. There were seven great monsters pursuing him, and three of them had actually been severely wounded by the energy storm. If it were not for the fact that there were still four of them, Ling Han would really have wanted to turn around and fight.

After escaping, Ling Han went into seclusion again.

Using 30,000 years, Ling Han digested the comprehension he had obtained through this battle. At the same time, he also used the resonance of the Heavenly Venerable Seals to create another seventh-grade seal.

If he could go on like this, perhaps he would only need 100,000,000 years to create all the seventh-grade seals.

He came out of seclusion, and continued to search for raw stones. However, he didn’t expect to encounter Xin Qihu again.

This vengeful spirit simply would not disperse. Ling Han really suspected that he had some kind of enmity with him in his last life. Why was Xin Qihu always targeting him?

There was nothing much to say; the only thing left to do was fight.

Ling Han presently possessed the raw power of the late stage of the Sixth Tier, which was only slightly inferior to Xin Qihu’s. This completely qualified Ling Han to fight Xin Qihu equally.

The two of them fought fiercely. Though Xin Qihu was still at a slight advantage, the gap was really not too big.

If Ling Han could advance to the peak stage of the Fourth Tier, then he would not be inferior to Xin Qihu at all. In fact, it would not be strange even if he had a slight upper hand.

They both unleashed their full power, and their battle was incredibly intense.

Ling Han had formed several hundred dimensions, which he released together to suppress his opponent. Even Sixth Tier elites would be affected by them. Xin Qihu, on the other hand, possessed first-grade combination seals. This was similarly extremely domineering, and as his attacks landed, nothing could escape destruction.

They battled for quite a few months, and finally a Sixth Tier from the Flaming Frost Realm appeared, joining the battle to attack Ling Han together.

“Xin Qihu, let’s fight again next time!” Ling Han retreated. “However, next time, I’ll make you cry.”

“Sharp tongue!” Xin Qihu said coldly. He gave up after a short chase.

The terrain here was complicated, and without a large advantage in speed, neither of them would be able to catch up to the other.

Heavenly Venerates at the same cultivation level were hard to kill. These weren’t just empty words.

After shaking off Xin Qihu, Ling Han naturally began his seclusion again.

Though Xin Qihu was very annoying, as an opponent that could help Ling Han temper himself, he was quite a good candidate. In a one-on-one situation, only Xin Qihu, Wu Haoyang, Lin Youlian, and a few others could put so much pressure on Ling Han at present.

What a coincidence. When Ling Han came out of seclusion, he very quickly met Xin Qihu again. There was nothing much to say, and the two of them battled again.

Compared to the previous battle, Ling Han had made great improvement, but as a supreme prodigy, how could Xin Qihu not have improved as well?

It was still Xin Qihu who had the upper hand, but his advantage was also getting smaller and smaller.

“You really have grown your wings!” Xin Qihu said harshly.

“Unfortunately, there is no cure for regret in this world,” Ling Han stated calmly, his fists waving even more quickly.

“Humph, when I advance to the Sixth Tier, killing you will be a piece of cake!” Xin Qihu declared.

“Of course. And if I advance into Sixth Tier, killing you will be like a father spanking one’s son,” Ling Han countered.

The two of them not only fought fiercely with their hands, but also fought fiercely with their mouths. Ling Han had long since developed a sharp tongue with the large black dog. He had not thought that Xin Qihu was actually not a pushover, either. His verbal skills were completely not inferior to Ling Han’s at all.

This battle continued for close to a month’s time, and only then did the two of them call a ceasefire reluctantly.

It was not that someone had barged in and interrupted their battle, but rather that they had used all the moves that they could use. If they continued fighting, it would just be nothing but repetition. They could not do anything to their opponent at all.
