Chapter 879: Slashing the Eye of Heavenly Dao Again.

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Shua , Ling Han swung the ax in a slashing movement, and pa , the space immediately shattered into fragments like crystal shards.

The destructive power of this ax was terrifying—it directly smashed the Void. On the other side, the heaven and earth of the Immortal Realm had already appeared.

Weng , the Eye of Heavenly Dao emerged. Its mission was to stop all those who destroyed the balance between heaven and earth. If it also had sentience, it would have to be extremely depressed. It had been beaten up twice, and the sky had been split twice. Was it an unlucky year?

As Ling Han had caused great damage, it naturally couldn’t wait any longer. The gigantic eye immediately shot open, launching a beam of prismatic light straight at Ling Han. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han effortlessly blocked it, and said, “If you stop me, then I will slash you! But if you pledge your allegiance to me, and become an auspicious protector of the Great Ling Empire, I can guarantee that you shall exist for all eternity!”

Hong!

Responding to Ling Han were multiple divine chains of regulation, intending to coil around and trap him.

“Hmph! Since you are stubborn, then I will just have to slaughter you!” With a cold glare, Ling Han smashed out with the ax, and pa , a gash immediately appeared on the Eye of Heavenly Dao, all across from top to bottom and a meter deep. Blood immediately gushed out violently.

The world suddenly descended into an all-consuming sadness; everyone had the urge to cry.

Hua , the wound of the Eye of Heavenly Dao burst wide open, and an endless stream of blood gushed out at Ling Han, completely drowning him.

“Paltry tricks!” Ling Han casually swiped the ax. The blood stream was immediately slashed open by him, and like blood-red satin, flowed to either side of him. His gaze fearsome, he slashed once more with the axe.

Pa , the wound on the Eye of Heavenly Dao expanded a little, almost splitting it into two halves.

“Too strong!”

Below, everyone cried out in surprise. They only knew that Ling Han was very strong and monstrous. This was clearly proven when he had slaughtered Ao Jian one year ago. However, only a few would know the greatness of Ao Jian’s strength, after all. On the contrary, the image of Ling Han that had been the most deeply rooted in the hearts of the people was his identity as a Heaven Grade alchemist.

But now, everyone knew that Ling Han was incomparably strong.

Before, how great of an effort had Ma Duo Bao expended just to cut down the Eye of Heavenly Dao? Yet Ling Han had done it easily, and appeared still full of energy.

In the distance, the seven Kings nodded in unison. It had to be admitted that Ling Han had already surpassed their boss. It was no wonder that Ma Duo Bao held Ling Han in such high esteem, and even passed on the heavy responsibility of splitting open the sky to the latter in the end.

“Be sure to succeed so as to console Boss’ spirit in heaven!”

“That’s a given, otherwise how can we go behead those vile five sects and the Ao Clan?”

“That’s right!”

If they didn’t split open the sky, then they would only remain trapped within the Lower Realm. Even if they wouldn’t be refined into the Realm Pill, they would eventually die of old age. Therefore, in order to avenge Ma Duo Bao, their only way was to split open the sky and ascend into the Immortal Realm. Only then would they be qualified to slaughter the five sects and the Ao Clan.

The Eye of Heavenly Dao was going mad, and more divine chains of regulation shot out from the eyeball, spreading into a great net. Also, the pointed edges of the chains were sharp beyond comparison, just waiting for an opportunity to pierce through Ling Han’s body.

In theory, the Eye of Heavenly Dao should be able to suppress Ling Han as the latter had yet to comprehend the Power of Regulation. But, Ling Han’s power was indeed too strong, so strong that it could crush the Power of Regulation, which caused the Eye of Heavenly Dao to be helpless against him.

What was more, Ling Han had yet to utilize his powerful physique. ‘Otherwise, you may hit it, but could you penetrate the defense of my body that is on the level of Godly metal?

Using one hand, Ling Han suppressed the Eye of Heavenly Dao, while his other hand was brandishing the Mountain and River Axe to split open the sky. He clearly had to divide his attention and energy, yet the Eye of Heavenly Dao was sent flying with an effortless punch and slap, and with a casual swing of the ax, he slashed a wide opening in the sky. The empty Void emerged to the greatest extent.

Everyone became dumbfounded as they watched. He was much stronger than Ma Duo Bao by a great leap!

Splitting open the sky... there was hope for success!

Everyone was getting more and more anxious. They had now pinned all hopes on Ling Han. Defeating the Eye of Heavenly Dao, and even shattering the Void was nothing. The biggest obstacle would come from the Immortal Realm!

It was precisely due to this that Ma Duo Bao had died with resentment. What about Ling Han?

Shua, shua, shua , Ling Han kept on slashing with the ax, and the tear in space kept on getting bigger as well. On the opposite side, the indistinct silhouette of the Immortal Realm once again appeared before everyone.

The Eye of Heavenly Dao was going crazy. It had already detected that the sky would be split open and it’d cease to exist.

Of course, it desperately threw out more divine chains of regulation. The whole eye had turned black, and frightening Qi began spreading.

“Hmm?” Ling Han’s eyes flashed. ‘How could there be Demonic Qi?’ One ought to know that this small world of theirs was inclined towards the Immortal Realm. It would only ascend into the Immortal Realm, and not the Netherworld, once the sky had been split open. Yet, why were there signs that the Eye of Heavenly Dao was becoming demonic?

Was it someone meddling from the Netherworld?

“Then you won’t be allowed to stay anymore!” Ling sneered coldly. He wielded the Revere Life Sword on his left hand, and activating the 10,000 Techniques Return to One, slashed out. The tip of the blade had been boosted with Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, and as the sword slashed, blazing white lighting was unleashed.

Pu!

Lightning streaked across, and the Eye of Heavenly Dao was suddenly cut into two pieces right down the middle. The divine chains of regulation were swaying about in a disorderly state as large amounts of blood poured out, and it fell down from the sky. It burned rapidly as it fell, not leaving any trace of it in this world.

Before reaching the ground, the Eye of Heavenly Dao had already been completely burned to ashes.

Blood rained upon the whole world. Everyone was filled with a strong sense of sorrow—this was the grief of heaven and earth. But, simultaneously, the majestic sound of a horn reverberated through heaven and earth—this was a praising hymn to the hero.

Ling Han put away the Revere Life Sword, and concentrated on swinging the ax.Shua, shua, shua , as battle prowess of twenty-three Stars of Shattering Void Tier smashed madly, the sky of the Immortal Realm drew closer and closer.

Shua , at this moment, the strike from the tip of a three-thousand-meter-long Sword Ray came from the Immortal Realm.

No one was surprised by this.

Had there been no response from the Immortal Realm, then that would the strangest thing.

Ling Han raised his left hand and pressed it down on the Sword Ray. Pa , he had caught onto the blade’s tip with his left hand that was imbued with a golden light and lightning. He had utilized two Mystical Powers to achieve this.

In fact, he could have used his physique to take it head on, but he did not want the five sects to know that he possessed this trump card up his sleeve. Perhaps the other side might have a more powerful trick, which would be capable of targeting his physique. Thus, it would be considered a secret weapon.

With the battle prowess of twenty-three Stars of Shattering Void Tier to counter this move, Ling Han was forced to retreat over three dozen meters in the end, and the action of the splitting open the sky was instantly slowed down.

In the Immortal Realm, there emerged again that middle-aged man grasping a long sword. He bore a somber demeanor, but his facial expression was that of amazement. This had really shocked him—only a short period of one year had passed, and another character of the Lower Realm who could split open the sky actually appeared, incredible!

What was happening with the Lower Realm?

However, in any case, these insignificant beings had better not think that they would succeed in splitting open the sky. They had no idea of the disparity in strength between humans and the Immortals.

“Your Majesty!”

“Sire!”

Everyone shouted in shock. Finally, the most crucial moment has arrived.

Ling Han chuckled lightly as he gestured with a middle finger towards the Immortal Realm, and said, “Today, I am splitting open the sky, how could it be possible that I have come unprepared? If your strength is only so, then what right do you have to prevent me from splitting open the sky?”
