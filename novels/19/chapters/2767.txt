2768 Return to the Celestial Realm

Ling Han and others soon came to the Two Realm Passageway.

There was a seal left by Zhou Heng here. It wasn’t very powerful, but functioned as a serious warning. It was laid by a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Who would dare to cross over this drawn line?

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and pressed it on the seal.

A flicker of divine sense stirred, and chi, the seal instantly combusted on its own and disappeared.

“Let’s go.”

They entered the Two Realm Passageway. Although there had been a surging tide of energy here at the beginning, it had naturally calmed down by now. It was now serene without so much as a ripple here.

Very quickly, the group passed through.

Although the war had subsided, as the saying went, “once bitten, twice shy.” Furthermore, how long had Foreign Realm been fighting against the Celestial Realm? About 20-30 epochs. Therefore, even if the war had fizzled out, there were still guards here.

“Who’s there!” Seeing someone coming from the Two Realm Passageway, the seven guards who were of the Ascending Origin Tier immediately shouted, raising their weapons one by one.

Hit by the familiar smell, Ling Han raised his head to look up at the sky. Although the aura here was the weakest among all the dimensions that he had traveled, it made him feel the most amiable; he really felt like he was back home.

It was just unfortunate that the heaven and the earth immediately reacted. Clang! A flash of lightning appeared, slashing violently towards Ling Han and the Empress.

This was the weakest dimension in the entire Genesis World, and the heaven and earth here had the least tolerance for transcenders, so when a Heavenly Venerate and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate openly walked about, they would be targeted.

Seeing this scene, the guards of Ascension Origin Tier were all shocked.

They couldn’t see through the cultivation level of Ling Han’s group, but it didn’t matter. Wasn’t it clear from the fact that the heavenly tribulation unleashed its divine might?

With such mighty power, if any of them was even struck lightly, they would be turned to dust.

They rushed to issue a warning; this was far beyond what they could handle.

The Empress became furious. Couldn’t they get over this already? She glared at the sky angrily, filled with the urge to exterminate it.

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said with a smile, stretching out his hand to take hold of everyone. Xiu! All of them disappeared.

The first stop was to find the core of the dimension.

This was a piece of cake for them, and they very quickly found the place. Ling Han simply stretched out his hand to probe it, and the unique power of the Celestial Realm was extracted by him and fused into one of his cells.

Furthermore, Ling Han also gave a slight “threat,” and the heaven and earth naturally dared not target him and the Empress again.

They exited, and went to look for their parents and various friends.

WIth Ling Han leading the way, they arrived at their destination almost immediately.

An epoch had passed, and this place had changed a lot.

Originally, it had been just a barren hill, but later developed into a market, then a small town, and finally a huge city now.

“Ling City.” Everyone looked at the two big characters on the city gate. At a glance, one could see that these were carved by an elite, exuding an air of boundless deterrence.

Ling Han couldn’t help smiling. “This is the handwriting of Elder Brother.” He nodded. “When Elder Brother wrote these two words, he should have been a Third Heaven Celestial King, but I’m not sure how he is doing now.”

They entered the city, and paid a Star Stone as a fee for entering the city.

Due to such a long time passing, there were so many changes here that it was overwhelming, so they didn’t go directly to seek out Feng Po Yun and the others, and instead went to find an inn first, where they ate and drank while making queries about the current situation.

Soon, Ling Han had it figured out.

The city was now divided into three factions: the Cheng Clan, the Feng Clan, and the Murong Clan, who jointly controlled Ling City.

The Cheng Clan was of course Ling Han’s younger sister Ling Yueyan’s lineage as her husband was surnamed Cheng. Now their children had grandchildren, the grandchildren had children, and this continued on for who knew how many generations, so now they had many descendants.

The Feng Clan was the descendants of Feng Poyun. Unexpectedly this elder brother had found himself a wife and had children. Meanwhile, the Murong Clan was of course the descendants of Murong Qing.

The three major forces each had a large number of members, but there was no unity among them. Instead, they were fighting for power, causing the relationship among the three to become extremely strained.

Ling Han couldn’t help shaking his head; this had certainly not been Feng Poyun’s and Murong Qing’s original intention. However, after the line had continued for countless generations, the friendship would of course fade away.

He inquired about it, and true enough, both Feng Poyun and Murong Qing were cultivating in seclusion. It was said that they were already Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings, and were aiming to break through to the Seventh Heaven. They hadn’t shown up for tens of millions of years.

Hence, their descendants began to have disputes.

Ling Han shook his head. This was a common problem of all major clans. No matter how great the first generation was when they established a clan, when the line continued for generations, the future generations would gradually deteriorate.

“Big news! Big news!” someone suddenly shouted. “I just got the news that the Feng Clan and the Murong Clan are going all out in battle!”

“What’s going on?” everyone asked, alarmed.

Two major clans were going all out in battle; were they not afraid that the Cheng Clan would pick up the spoils?

“I heard that it was due to a Blood Ginseng, which is a superb celestial medicine that can help an Ascending Origin Tier become a Celestial King!” said the man.

Gasp!

Everyone gasped. How astonishing was it to have a Celestial King produced out of thin air?

The Feng Clan and the Murong Clan might each have a Sixth Heaven Celestial King, but beneath them, the two clans had only one Celestial King respectively; furthermore, they were still First Heaven Celestial Kings, so the significance of having one more Celestial King than the other was great indeed as it could give the clan an overwhelming advantage over the other.

Why did the two clans ignore the Cheng Clan? This was because the Cheng Clan didn’t even have one Celestial King.

Precisely due to this, it had always been a big mystery that the three major clans could stand side by side because no matter how one would think about it, the Cheng Clan didn’t have such qualifications.

Now that a Blood Ginseng could help one of Ascending Origin Tier break through to become a Celestial King, this naturally made the two clans become covetous, and in any case, they didn’t need to care about the Cheng Clan anyway.

After Heavenborn came into being, the Celestial Path had slowly disappeared. Now, there was no need for someone of the Ascending Origin Tier to go through the Celestial Path to break through to become a Celestial King. Things had gone back to how it had been in the ancient times.

Ling Han immediately turned around and stood up. The descendants of Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing were no different from his own descendants. No matter how unworthy the descendants were, he couldn’t stand by and watch them kill each other.

They came to the residence of the Feng Clan.

In the fight for the Blood Ginseng, the Feng Clan had temporarily gained the upper hand, and managed to snatch the Blood Ginseng. However, Murong Clan’s elites had blocked the pathway and surrounded the Feng Clan. They wanted the Feng Clan to hand over the Blood Ginseng, or they would face each other in battle.

Both sides had dispatched elites; it was a situation wherein a battle could happen at any moment.

Ling Han strode forward and walked into the crowd.

...

“Who are you?” When the people on both sides saw the appearance of someone unrelated, they all turned to look at Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “Your ancestors and I are brothers. Stop fighting. Being a family and yet engaging in internal strife, do you want others to see all of you make fools of yourselves?”

Seeing Ling Han’s aged and experienced attitude, everyone became furious. How dared you, an ordinary-looking guy, pretend to be their elder?

‘So what now, you say you are the brother of our ancestors, and expect us to address you as ancestor?’

“Where did this madman come from?”

“Hurry up and drive him away!”

Immediately, someone stretched out a hand to grab at Ling Han. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han shook his head, stretched out his hands, and the heaven and earth instantly reacted. Infinite Spiritual Qi gathered, and hundreds of ginseng plants could be seen to be growing out of thin air from the ground, growing stronger at a visible speed, and the roots exposed on the ground were as red as blood.

“B-Blood Ginseng!” everyone exclaimed, and the person who made a move against Ling Han also stopped in his tracks.

Currently, Ling Han was forcibly extracting the power of the heaven and earth to create the celestial medicine and make it grow rapidly.

This was a heaven-defying act, but unfortunately, the current Celestial Realm wasn’t as powerful as Ling Han, so it could only be pushed around by him.
