Chapter 3511: Old matters from two thousand years ago

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What do you want me to do, Milord?” Xuan Tianling did not dare to be arrogant at all.

The large monkey scratched its head, then said, “Sever your own arm, and get lost!”

Xuantian Ling gritted his teeth, and said, “All right!1‘

He raised his right hand high, and looked like he was going to slash down on his left arm, but his hand had not even landed, when he had already turned around and fled rapidly, running as fast as he could.

“What a joke. Old Sun has already spoken, so is there any room for you to escape?” With a leap, the large monkey somersaulted, and instantly appeared in front of Xuan Tianling.

Are you f****** cheating? How could you be so fast?

Xuantian Ling’s expression was dark, but there was absolutely no way he could sever his own arm. That would mean that he needed Saintly medicine for his flesh and bones to be regrown, and how could he possibly obtain it with his Cauldron Forging Tier cultivation level?

He attacked with all his might, attacking the large monkey.

The large monkey replied with a punch of its own. It was obviously also in the Cauldron Forging Tier, and there was no power that surpassed this cultivation level flowing from its every move, yet it was still able to easily suppress the Xuan Tianling.

In less than ten moves, Xuan Tianling’s left arm was grabbed by the large monkey. With a strong pull, blood splattered, and his left arm was forcefully pulled off.

The large monkey very casually tossed Xuan Tianling onto the ground, and said, “Scram!1‘

Xuan Tianling did not even dare to protest, and hurriedly fled in panic.

“Brother Monkey!” Only then did Ling Han jump down from the golden bull and call out to the large monkey.

The large monkey bared its mouth in a grin, “Brother, are you blaming Old Sun for not killing that guy?”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “How could that be? I still have to thank Big Brother for giving me a chance to exact revenge on my own in future.”

“Haha, as expected of Old Sun’s brother!” The large monkey laughed, “Come, Old Sun will wait for you in the valley.”

When he had finished speaking, the large monkey’s figure trembled, and his powerful aura instantly disappeared like the ebbing tide.

It shuddered, and glanced at Ling Han. Immediately, it bared its two rows of white teeth, and said, “Second Leader!”

Ling Han’s expression darkened, “Don’t call me Second Leader!”

“Then what should I call you?” The large monkey scratched its ears and cheeks, appearing to be very confused.

“Whatever. In any case, you can’t call me Second Leader,” Ling Han said.

“Then, Second King?” the large monkey probed.

Ling Han sighed. This was the disadvantage of being ranked second. No matter what title he was given, he would always exude the aura of second place.

“All right then.”

This was still better than Second Leader.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao followed the large white monkey. They entered the Monkey Valley, and arrived at the place where Brother Monkey was being crushed.

More than a year had passed, and Brother Monkey was still the same as before. There were wild weeds on his head, yet he did not mind at all.

“Brother Monkey,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Second Brother.” Brother Monkey also bared his mouth in a grin, exuding an air of tyranny, capable of overturning even heaven and earth.

“Greetings, Senior.” Princess Bixiao also curtsied gracefully.

Brother Monkey glanced at this princess of the Demon Race, and said with a smile, “Second Brother, you have good taste. You have chosen a woman of our Monkey Race as your good partner.”

Ling Han was just about to explain, when he heard Princess Bixiao say with a smile, “Senior, you flatter me. I’m afraid that Bixiao is not worthy of Big Brother Ling.”

‘Holy f*ck! You can even bring yourself to call me Big Brother Ling?!’

Ling Han felt that he had underestimated this princess of the Demon Race. When she actually deigned to be shameless, she could compare to him, couldn’t she?

“The Six-Eared Macaque Race and Old Sun have some relations. For the sake of my Second Brother, I’ll give you a hand!” Brother Monkey suddenly spat out a breath at Princess Bixiao. Instantly, Princess Bixiao’s body was covered with auspicious red clouds, as if she was about to ascend and become a celestial.

Ling Han didn’t need to ask to know that Princess Bixiao had obviously obtained great benefits.

“Old Sun has helped this child improve her bloodline,” Brother Monkey said.

F***, just blowing out a breath could help others improve their bloodline?

Brother, you are awesome.

Ling Han never knew how to be polite. He said with a smile, “Brother Monkey, help me upgrade my bloodline.”

Brother Monkey shook his head, “This child is also a member of the Monkey Race like Old Sun, so Old Sun can help her improve her bloodline. You are a pure human, so Old Sun does not have that kind of ability.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. Bixiao, this little girl, had finally benefited.

“Furthermore, Second Brother, your bloodline, natural talent, and bone structure may seem ordinary, but when Old Sun looks closely with my Fiery Golden Eyes, there is an indescribable perfect balance. Unless it can improve in all aspects, if it can only improve in one aspect, it would be better not to. It would only lead to the opposite effect,” Brother Monkey said seriously.

Fine, this was Brother Monkey’s evaluation.

Ling Han thought that since he had come out of the Divine Stone, there must be some kind of amazing thing about him. It was impossible that he was a real mortal. He thought for a moment, then released all the Calabash Brothers.

“Yi, a furred-faced person.”

“He really looks like a monkey.”

“Hehe, fun.”

The toddlers had no taboos, and immediately said laughingly.

Brother Monkey was not angered. He looked at the seven children, and revealed a hint of realization, as he said, “Second Brother, your luck is really not too bad.”

“What?” Ling Han asked in confusion.

“When the time comes, you will naturally find out,” Brother Monkey said, smiling.

“Yi, it really is a fur-faced monkey.”

“You even know Father?”

“He’s been crushed at the foot of the mountain. How pitiful.”

The toddlers all shook their heads. Only Second Baby said, “This fur-faced monkey is very powerful. I can’t even see his cultivation level clearly.”

“Yo!” The seven children all took a step back, as if they were very wary.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “This is Brother Monkey, my sworn older brother. You all call him Uncle Monkey.”

“Uncle Monkey,” the seven children all said in childish voices.

Brother Monkey gladly accepted, then said to Ling Han, “Younger Brother, why are you being hunted?”

Ling Han recounted the sequence of events, but when he was talking about Chen Fengyan, Brother Monkey suddenly interrupted.

“You said that this person’s name is Chen Fengyan?”

Ling Han nodded, “That’s right — Brother Monkey, do you know this person?”

“Hehe,” Brother Monkey laughed loudly, “When you see Chen Fengyan in future, you don’t have to be reserved with him. If he dares to have any objections, just say that Old Sun will spank his behind when he comes out!”

Ling Han was surprised. Judging by Brother Monkey’s tone, the two of them seemed to know each other. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Brother Monkey, could it be that you are an existence from the last generation?” he couldn’t help but ask.

Brother Monkey nodded, and replied, “That’s right.”

“What exactly happened at that time? Were you suppressed here by those people who massacred the Celestial Sea Planet.?” Ling Han had already held himself back for a long time. It wasn’t easy for him to meet someone who could possibly know the truth, so he instantly blurted out all the questions.

“Are you sure you want to know?” Brother Monkey asked.

Ling Han nodded.

“Over two thousand years ago, the Celestial Sea Planet was ruled by a Royal Empire, and was the subject of another Great Majestic Empire.” Brother Monkey began to speak, “However, this Royal Empire developed too quickly, so fast that even the Majestic Empire couldn’t sit still. Hence, they found a false charge, and sent out an army and countless elites, crossing the galaxy to come here.”

“After a great battle, the Royal Empire of the Celestial Sea Planet, was destroyed, and the majority of elites were killed. Some forces surrendered, and all their clans and sects relocated, heading towards that planet where the Majestic Empire is located.

“It was also at that time that Old Sun was suppressed at the foot of this mountain.”

“After another period of time, that Majestic Empire treated the Celestial Sea Planet like a prison, imprisoning some people who had committed crimes but had powerful backgrounds, and did not dare to kill them.”

“When this great formation channels, it extracts the power of the Celestial Sea Planet, as energy. Thus, from that moment onwards, this planet declined, and is no longer suitable for cultivation..”
