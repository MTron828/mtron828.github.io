Chapter 1449 Fighting Gu Daoyi

Gu Daoyi was furious.He’d initially been a prodigy of the Celestial Realm. Though he had now “fallen” to the Immortal Realm, he still had a very high opinion of himself, and had a very powerful superiority complex. In his eyes, the Immortal Realm... was a backward, primitive place.

This feeling of superiority was just like how the prodigies of the Immortal Realm felt towards the cultivators that came from a small world.

And now, an ant of the Lower Realm actually provoked him repeatedly. It was like a mortal challenging the might of the heavens, so how could he not be enraged?

Erase!

He humphed, an air of Primal Chaos encircling his whole body. There were images of heavenly bodies appearing behind him, and he stood proudly like a god as if he could shatter a star with a single stamp of his foot.

“Ignorant ant, you actually dare challenge my authority!” He stretched out his hand, and tapped out a finger. A frightening power of Regulations was condensed in his Origin Power, which took the form of a finger, but this finger was a 300-meter-long and 90-meter-wide one, and it grandly pressed down on Ling Han.

One after another, divine patterns appeared on this colossal finger, exuding an aura that had completely surpassed the level of the low extreme and the medium extreme, and had even reached the level of the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier.

It should be known that all of their cultivation levels had been weakened to the early stage of the low extreme, but the might of this attack of his had reached the high extreme. How many stars of battle prowess had he surpassed?

When this strike was unleashed, everyone was astounded.

How could he possibly be so powerful?

From the early stage of the low extreme to the high extreme, even if it was similarly the early stage, that had also breached a gap of a whole eight stars of battle prowess. This was something that should not have happened, unless it was being suppressed by the pinnacle level, but how could that be possible now?

This was exactly who Gu Daoyi was, the greatest prodigy for all eternity!

How could Ling Han block that?

Even if Ling Han managed to block it, how could the floating rock beneath his feet be saved? There was absolutely no way to resolve this attack.

Everyone shook their heads. Being able to enter into the first team, these 10 people were all undoubtedly kings among kings, but compared to Gu Daoyi, they would pale in comparison. They were on completely different levels.

“He’s finished. If he doesn’t want to die, he can only give up the floating rock beneath his feet, or there would be nowhere he could dodge to.”

“Who asked him to be so determined to challenge Gu Daoyi? If he’d kept a low profile, and drawn out the distance between himself and Gu Daoyi, even if he could not have ascended to the top, he would’ve at least been able to get a place that is closer to the top.”

“...It was Gu Daoyi who provoked him first, right?”

“What kind of person is Gu Daoyi? He is naturally qualified to be arrogant. If Ling Han had more self-awareness, he should choose submission, and not a head-on confrontation.”

“So this is what he asked for.”

“He has to start again from the beginning!”

A considerable number were making cynical remarks. They were communicating through their divine sense. This could be done very quickly. Otherwise, Gu Daoyi’s attack would have reached them in the time they’d taken to open their mouths.

But Ling Han’s actions caused everyone to be surprised. That was because he did not save himself by jumping off the floating rock. Instead, he raised his hand, and pressed down on that giant finger.

‘He’s f*cking crazy!’

Seeing this scene, this thought appeared in everyone’s heads.

This was absolutely not something the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier could press down on. If he took it on by force, that was courting death.

A great many people were shaking their heads. Ling Han was really too foolish. He was actually showing off his courage at such a time. This was not merely an attempt to seek death anymore. He would be killed by his own foolishness.

Boom, that attack of Ling Han, which seemed like a speck of dust, met the colossal finger, and it was visible that the giant finger was beginning to deteriorate at an astonishing pace. When it truly reached Ling Han’s body, it had already collapsed on its own.

‘What?!’

Seeing this scene, everyone’s mouths were gaping. They were rendered completely speechless.

This... Previously, they had said that Gu Daoyi’s attack was definitely not something that could be matched by anyone in the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, but just in the blink of an eye, Ling Han had used reality to slap their words back into their faces.

He had easily dispersed the attack!

So many years had passed, and Ling Han had continued to cultivate underneath the Reincarnation Tree. He had also drunk who knew how much Reincarnation Tea, and had boosted his mastery of the Tide of the Ages to a well-practiced extent.

Even without the bloodline of the Ding Clan, he had definitely surpassed a great majority of the members of the Ding Clan in terms of his use of Tide of the Ages.

Gu Daoyi also looked surprised. Though this finger had not been comprised of his full power, who was he? He was a prodigy of the Celestial Realm, and now he was also a Divine Fetus that had been produced from his nine lives. The strength of his battle prowess should be invincible among his peers in the Immortal Realm.

“This is... the power of time!” He carefully recollected, and the look of surprise on his face involuntarily became even stronger.

Though Ling Han’s mastery of the power of time could only be considered superficial, an ant of the Lower Realm was actually capable of touching the height of the Regulations of time. This was inconceivable in his eyes.

Even in the Celestial Realm, aside from the inheritance of bloodline, only those that had advanced into the Severing Mundane were qualified to touch this kind of supremely high Regulations.

Could it be that Ling Han possessed the bloodline of the Celestial Realm, and had been expelled from the Celestial Realm just like him?

‘That’s right, that’s right. Otherwise, how could he possibly know of the existence of the Celestial Realm?’

No wonder he dared to oppose him. As it turned out, he was also from the Celestial Realm!

“Humph, you just have a slightly superficial grasp of the power of time, and you dare think you can stop me?” Gu Daoyi asked maliciously, disdain clear on his face, but a feeling of vigilance rose up in his heart.

The power of time was extraordinary. In a battle between equals, he had to show his true abilities.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “You’ve been asleep for several billion years, and you really have a lot of nonsense to spout.”

Gu Daoyi’s expression darkened involuntarily. He really had a vicious tongue! He had cultivated to his 10th lifetime, so his way of thinking had also become young, and he was also more easily provoked. His eyes narrowed involuntarily, and his killing intent soared.

“You are so determined to seek your own death!” He maneuvered the floating rock and charged towards Ling Han. He tapped out another finger, the tip of his finger as bright as blood and incredibly blinding. “God of Blood Finger!”

Ling Han still did the same thing, and sent out another Tide of the Ages. However, he immediately discovered that the might of the other’s attack was incredibly dense, just as if it was a mountain that had been condensed into the size of an egg. Thus, the “surface area” that was being affected by the Tide of the Ages had also become very, very small.

Hence, when this finger was endlessly having its outer shell peeled off, until there was only a small point left behind, the might of the Tide of the Ages had also completely vanished, yet this tiny point was bursting with the most frightening destructive power.

Boom, this attack landed on Ling Han’s body, and forced him backwards a few thousand meters, but when he arrived at the boundary of the valley, his figure stopped. An invisible barrier had stopped his retreat.

Gu Daoyi revealed an expression of pride. Did he think that he had no way to deal with this superficial-level power of time? What a joke! He had grasped who knew how many powerful secret techniques, and they were all Celestial Realm-level, so his support base was unimaginable strong.

But in the next instant, the arrogance on his face suddenly transformed into surprise.

That was because Ling Han had moved about his bones and muscles, looking like he had not been harmed in the slightest.

If this attack had been aimed directly at the floating rock beneath his feet, Ling Han would definitely have fallen, but as it was an attack aimed at him, then sorry, how could power on the level of low extreme possibly cause him serious injury?

Even if it was a technique from the Celestial Realm, it was still impossible. That was because the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had similarly originated from the Celestial Realm, and its level was even higher!UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
