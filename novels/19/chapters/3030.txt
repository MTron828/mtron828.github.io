3031 Kneel

“I am Blue Flame,” the short elder said. He looked at the inn, and the entire inn trembled under the heavy pressure.

He had shown mercy. Otherwise, this inn would have fallen apart with just a thought.

Seeing that Ling Han and the others still didn’t dare to come out and fight, some Celestial Kings thought that they had chickened out, knowing that they weren’t a match for Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame.

Therefore, they jumped up, and shouted, “Hurry up and come out. Don’t let Lord Blue Flame wait too long!”

“This is Lord Blue Flame!”

“The people inside, come out and kneel!”

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame placed his hands behind his back, revealing a cold smile.

He didn’t believe that Ling Han and the others would be able to endure being insulted by a group of Celestial Kings.

However, what puzzled him was that no matter how loudly those Celestial Kings called out, no one came out of the inn.

‘What the hell?’

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame was very cautious. He was only in the First Tier, so he didn’t have much of an advantage against other First Tiers. Thus, he called for a fight outside, wanting to confirm the identity of his opponent first.

There were only a few Heavenly Venerates in the world, and apart from a few extremely low-key ones, he knew every single one of them, or at least had seen them before.

However, the other party did not appear for a long time, which naturally made Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame suspicious.

Could it be that the other party wasn’t a Heavenly Venerate, but a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, so he didn’t dare to come out and face him?

That was very likely. In that case, the other party might be preparing to escape by now.

Of course, Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame was still a little puzzled. If these people were only Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, why would they be so daring as to cause trouble at the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment? Could it be that they were foolish enough to go to the extent of inciting the fury of a Seventh Tier ultimate elite in order to become famous?

It was precisely because of this confusion that he didn’t dare to move for a long time.

Being able to become a Heavenly Venerate, how could he not have patience?

However, after waiting for half a day, he finally couldn’t take it anymore.

‘We can’t go on like this, can we?’

He looked at a Celestial King, and said, “You, go in and take a look.”

“Me?” That Celestial King couldn’t help but shiver in fear, thinking to himself, ‘You big shots are fighting, so what does that have to do with me, a mere minor character?’

“Aren’t you going?” Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame said calmly. Although his voice wasn’t sharp at all, it exuded a terrifying chill.

The Celestial King didn’t dare to say anything else, and he hurriedly walked toward the inn.

It wasn’t like Blue Flame had not killed anyone before. He didn’t want to be slapped to death immediately.

In the beginning, he was still striding forward, but as he walked, his speed slowed down, and he seemed hesitant.

He wanted to stop, but a cold snort from Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame rang out from behind him, causing him to have no choice but to step forward again and walk into the inn.

But there was no more sound from him.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame frowned. Why was there no reaction?

What was going on?

“You, go in.” He pointed at another Celestial King.

That Celestial King was on the verge of tears. The Celestial King from before had gone in, and there was no more sound. If the second one went in, it was hard to say if he would survive.

He wanted to shake his head, but when he saw Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame’s expressionless and cold face, how could he dare to say no? He could only walk forward.

One step, two steps, and he slowly entered the inn.

After that, there was nothing else.

F*ck, what the hell was going on in there? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame was deep in thought, while all the Celestial Kings quietly walked backwards, wanting to leave.

“Before I speak, whoever dares to leave will have to bear the consequences,” Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame said coldly, instantly causing those who had just lifted their feet to put them down again.

Who would dare to ignore the threat of a Heavenly Venerate?

“You, you, you, and you…” Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame indicated four people in one breath. “Go in together.”

The four of them had no choice but to brace themselves and walk towards the inn.

After they entered the inn, it was as if they had entered a bottomless pit. There was no more movement.

There was no sound, no signs of fighting, and even their aura was gone. It was as if they had vanished from the face of the earth.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame stared fixedly at that inn. Could this be a tiger’s den?

“Go together!” He waved his hand.

Although the Celestial Kings were unwilling and reluctant, under the tyrannical might of a Heavenly Venerate, they could only listen to orders.

They all stepped forward and entered the inn through the doors or windows.

Then, just like before, there was no more movement.

The surroundings were quiet. It was clearly a sunny day, but it felt like a den of ghosts.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame frowned. What was going on?

This was too strange. He really regretted agreeing to make this trip. Was a relation with a Seventh Tier so easy to establish?

He sighed inwardly. He had already made up his mind.

‘Go!’

He strode forward. Boom! His essence, Qi, and spirit instantly rose to their peak. He was already prepared for a great battle.

Xiu! A black shadow flew out of the inn.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame raised his head to look, and instantly revealed a look of surprise because this was a wine cup.

‘A wine cup?’

What was the opponent doing? Was he throwing a cup as a signal and planning to gang up on him?

Before Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame could finish his thought, the wine cup had already fallen from the sky. He snorted coldly, and was about to shatter the wine cup with a punch.

Weng! A terrifying power emanated from the wine cup, as if countless heavenly bodies were pressing down together.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame instantly felt a tremendous weight on his back, and he couldn’t help but hunch. Then, his legs couldn’t withstand the power of the eternal heavens, and pa, he knelt down.

‘What?!’

He was both shocked and furious. A dignified Heavenly Venerate actually knelt down in the middle of the street. How could he endure this? However, he was even more terrified. The people inside didn’t even appear, and they only threw out a wine cup, yet it was enough to suppress him. What kind of ability was this?

Pa, the wine cup fell and landed on the top of his head, firmly standing.

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame was unable to stand up. This wine cup was incomparably heavy, and even if he possessed the unique Power of Dimension, he was unable to resist it. He could only continue to kneel like this, unable to fall or stand up.

The difference in strength was like the difference between heaven and earth.

He sighed in his heart. He was definitely going to suffer this setback.

Who asked him to run over dumbly without even investigating the full details?

Fortunately, the other party only asked him to kneel, and didn’t kill him. Otherwise, he would definitely be dead.

Hua, right at this moment, a large number of Celestial Kings walked out of the inn, their faces filled with confusion.

When they entered the inn, they stepped into a dark and boundless space. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t find the exit.

It wasn’t until just now that they suddenly saw a ray of light. Then, they walked toward the light, and for some reason walked out just like that.

But at the same time, they all gasped.

F*ck, what’s going on?

Heavenly Venerate Blue Flame was actually kneeling at the entrance of the inn!

Hiss, hooh, yi… They let out various sounds in shock.

Just a moment ago, this guy had still been full of arrogance, as if he had been the number one elite in the world, but now he actually knelt down just like that?

Inconceivable.

They were all aghast. They had clearly entered an inn, yet they were completely unaware of the change in space, and a Heavenly Venerate had even knelt down. This was enough to prove how powerful the people in this inn were.
