Chapter 2626: Killed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Miao Yingwei wore an expression of disdain as he said, “I myself am invincible, so do I need to rely on my father or whatnot?!”

His words were filled with pride and arrogance.

“Oh?” Ling Han was slightly astonished. He genuinely hadn’t come across someone as confident as Miao Yingwei in this place. This was unlike those second-generation young masters who harbored an inner sense of inferiority while being haughty. This was because they were nothing more than prisoners.

‘Perhaps…?’

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You’re an outsider who’s come here to train, am I correct?”

Miao Yingwei’s expression involuntarily changed.

Even though he was brimming with confidence, he only possessed a cultivation at the Sixth Heaven. At most, his battle prowess could only reach the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven. Thus, if faced with Eighth Heaven and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, his only fate would be death.

If his identity as an outsider were exposed, he would definitely be hunted by everyone in the Celestial King Graveyard. At that time, his only option would be to hide in some unknown corner.

“Utter nonsense!” he spat in a baleful voice. He lashed out again, not giving Ling Han the opportunity to speak.

Ling Han laughed upon seeing this. He knew that he had guessed correctly.

He casually counterattacked, easily blocking Miao Yingwei’s attack. At this moment, would he still need to care about attacks at the Seventh Heaven?

Miao Yingwei was relentless as he unleashed attack after attack. However, he became increasingly astounded. Ling Han was only replying with casual counterattacks, yet his defenses remained as sturdy as could be. He appeared extremely relaxed as he blocked his attacks.

Miao Yingwei could only concede that this person was no weaker than him.

However, how could such a freak appear in the Celestial King Graveyard?

A thought occurred to him, and he exclaimed, “So you’re also an outsider!”

The myriad worlds were brimming with countless prodigies. It was because of this that there could exist those who were more freakish than him.

Ling Han replied with a faint smile. He then extended his right hand, grabbing at Miao Yingwei.

He channeled the Divine Fluid Raging Lightning, treating Miao Yingwei as his training dummy. He would use him to familiarize himself with this secret technique.

Miao Yingwei unleashed his full power. These arcs of lightning that were enveloped inside the Regulations of Water were far too terrifying. If he held back, he might truly be killed at any moment.

It had to be said that even though Miao Yingwei’s battle prowess wasn’t too impressive, he was still a monarch star, after all, so there were things that Ling Han could learn.

Ling Han suppressed his power, lowering himself to a level equivalent to his opponent. Rather than crushing his opponent, this could maximize the results of his training.

As such, the battle between them instantly became intense and evenly matched.

Ling Han attained comprehension after comprehension. He started to fuse the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning and Divine Fluid Raging Lightning together.

All five elements possessing lightning was the true power of this secret technique.

Borrowing this monarch star as a training dummy, Ling Han rapidly deepened his understanding and comprehension of this secret technique.

How could Miao Yingwei not realize this? However, Ling Han’s attacks were like a tsunami that surged toward him wave after wave, not giving Miao Yingwei any time to rest. Otherwise, the latter would immediately be killed.

Miao Yingwei felt as stifled as could be. As a mighty monarch star from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, and as someone who had the talent to become a paramount Heavenly Venerate in the future, he was actually being treated as a training dummy? How could he not be enraged?

However, had he not brought this upon himself?

“Who in the world are you?” Miao Yingwei roared in rage. Countless prodigies had converged to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, so it was naturally difficult to guess his opponent’s identity.

“You’re only thinking of asking who I am now?” Ling Han said in a cold voice. This person was clearly lusting after the Empress, so Ling Han had already sentenced him to death.

“As fellow disciples of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, is there any need to take things so far?” Miao Yingwei said. For him to utter such words, it was clear that he had already admitted defeat. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, how could Ling Han stop now? He replied in a calm voice, “I’ll suppress my cultivation to your level. If you can last 100 exchanges, I’ll spare your life.”

“You’re underestimating me!” Miao Yingwei replied in rage. He conceded that he was indeed inferior to Ling Han. However, failing to last 100 exchanges against someone at the same battle prowess? Just what kind of joke was this?!

Ling Han replied with a faint smile. He unleashed a palm strike, with his might instantly increasing several folds.

He had already fused the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning and Divine Fluid Raging Lightning together, forming the Lightning of Water and Wood.

With three Regulations fused together, just how terrifying would this be?

Miao Yingwei was instantly suppressed. Regardless of how prodigious he was, how could he possibly rival the techniques of a Heavenly Venerate?

To say nothing of Miao Yingwei, perhaps even the successors of Heavenly Venerates would be unable to rival this.

Why was this?

Perhaps there was no concept of ranking among Heavenly Venerate Techniques. However, not all Heavenly Venerate Techniques were suitable for Celestial Kings to practice. For example, even the Imperial Void Celestial King, a domineering Ninth Heaven Celestial King, found it difficult to use the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s Dragon Fish Technique. That being the case, it would naturally be impossible for lower-level Celestial Kings to channel this technique.

As such, even though the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll and Lightning of Water and Wood might not necessarily be top-notch Heavenly Venerable Techniques, they were definitely supreme techniques among those at the Celestial King Tier.

Miao Yingwei was extremely disheveled at this moment. Even with the same battle prowess, it was inevitable that he would fall into a disadvantage against the might of a Heavenly Venerate Technique.

“Trying to suppress me within 100 exchanges? In your dreams!” he shouted.

Being at a disadvantage was one matter, and being defeated was another matter. He was confident that he could last 300 exchanges or even more.

“Is that so?” Ling Han said with laughter. He started to channel the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.

Two Heavenly Venerate Techniques!

If he counted the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll as well, Ling Han now possessed a whopping three Heavenly Venerate Techniques. Even though only the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was complete, it was still a terrifying notion that a single person had grasped, and could channel, three Heavenly Venerate Techniques.

Miao Yingwei let out a muffled groan. With the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll buffing Ling Han’s attacks, it instantly elevated his battle prowess by three or four-fold. This made him even more invincible.

100 exchanges… would be extremely difficult to withstand.

Miao Yingwei shed blood. With the help of two Heavenly Venerate Techniques, Ling Han’s battle prowess became far too terrifying. If this continued, he would die.

He gritted his teeth before suddenly turning around to flee.

Whoosh!

Activating the Regulations of Space, Ling Han instantly appeared before him, blocking his path.

“Hmph! You’ve already drawn on power that surpasses mine!” Miao Yingwei chided. Otherwise, Ling Han couldn’t have caught up to him.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and replied, “The condition was that you wouldn’t flee!”

His condition had been a fair battle between the two parties. However, since Miao Yingwei had broken this agreement, Ling Han naturally didn’t need to limit himself anymore.

“As a fellow disciple of the martial academy, is there any need for you to back me into a corner like this?” Miao Yingwei said, changing his tune.

“Begging for life with such indignity… Do you not feel embarrassed?” Ling Han retorted with a cold chuckle. He didn’t hold back anymore, with his hands like deadly axes as he unleashed attack after attack. With him channeling two Heavenly Venerate Techniques in unison, his might was profound and unstoppable.

Miao Yingwei defended with all his might, yet how could he possibly rival Ling Han? Even fleeing was impossible, so it wasn’t long before he was mercilessly killed.

Ling Han felt no pity. If someone crossed his bottom line, they could only suffer a single fate—death.

As he looked at the Empress, his gaze instantly became gentle.

Right now, the Empress had already drawn her Divine Sword. She was extremely relaxed as she faced heavenly tribulation, and it was clear that he didn’t need to worry at all.

The Celestial Kings were all stunned. As it turned out, Ling Han and Miao Yingwei were both outsiders who had come here to train!

Their gazes instantly became menacing. As prisoners, they wholeheartedly detested those who came here to train. It was only because Ling Han was far too powerful that they could only suppress this feeling.

However, once Ling Han left, they would immediately expose his identity as an outsider who had come here to train. They would call upon countless elites to hunt down and kill this detestable person.

One day later, heavenly tribulation dissipated, and the Empress descended from the sky. There were five ribbons of iridescent light around her slender body, and she radiated with a powerful aura.

“Let’s go!”

Ling Han didn’t pay any heed to the surrounding people. He was inching closer and closer to the Sixth Heaven, so he was unafraid even if his identity were truly exposed.
