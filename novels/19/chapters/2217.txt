Chapter 2218: Intervention of a Heavenly Venerate

Heavens, it was a Heavenly Venerate that was moving. To say nothing of the fact that Ling Han and his group were only mere Dividing Soul Tiers, even if they were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, what could they do? Would they be able to block this blow?

What could they do? Just wait for death?

In this plain, time was incredibly strange. It could be astonishingly rapid, but it could also be overwhelmingly slow, and even a Heavenly Venerate would be affected!

When this Divine Sword struck out, it looked to be shockingly fast, yet still streaked a boundless distance in the skies, and it had still not fallen.

In this process, the seals on the Divine Sword were also dimming, as if it had experienced an endless period of time, and was about to be destroyed by age.

Instantly, understanding dawned on Ling Han. This Heavenly Venerate was not of the same time period as them. Originally, there was absolutely no way that they would have encountered each other, but who asked them to have entered into the Time Mystery Realm, and this was what led to their encounter.

Before the Divine Sword struck its target, it would disappear on its own because it could not overcome the power of time.

However, Ling Han and his group were all astounded. Having delivered an attack that could mess up time for so long before finally disappearing, just what kind of great power was this?

Heavenly Venerable Tier had transcended Regulations, and it was indeed no joke.

If it were not for the fact that the Heavenly Venerate could not surpass heaven and earth, the might of this strike would have been even stronger, being capable of ignoring time, and ultimately killing them.

Yet why had this Heavenly Venerate made a move on them without any notice?

In the skies, that sole eye narrowed slightly, a bloody scar appearing in the silvery white of the eye, yet it was silvery blood that dripped out.

Even if a Heavenly Venerate could move, being contrary to time, he ultimately would have to suffer a penalty from the heaven and earth.

There were some rules that even a Heavenly Venerate could not exceed, or he would still have to suffer a lashback. However, Heavenly Venerable Tier was too strong, so even the heaven and earth could not do anything to them. Otherwise, if it had been another person, even if it was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, they would probably have been completely eradicated.

“I have seen your vague figures downstream of the Timestream, and I cannot allow you to live!” This slit eye sent out a blurry message. It was really too far off, so the sound was vague and unclear.

It should be that this Heavenly Venerate just happened to enter into the Timestream at some point in history, and caught sight of Ling Han and his group passing by. Then, he used a great mystical power, saw some aspects of their future, and thought that it was possible that they would affect himself in the future. Thus, even if it meant moving contrary to time, using the past to kill the present, and even if he would suffer a backlash from heaven and earth, he still did it.

Ling Han laughed loudly. This meant that there was definitely one among them that had become a Heavenly Venerate, and only would this incite wariness from a Heavenly Venerate. Otherwise, even if they had all become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so what? They wouldn’t even be worth a mention.

However, this Heavenly Venerate was really petty. Could it be that he could not allow others to be his equal?

Moreover, since this Heavenly Venerate had discovered the threat their group posed in history, why had he not moved in the present flow of time? Could it be that he had long since died?

Impossible!

If he had already died, then he would not have considered their group a threat.

Could it be that this Heavenly Venerable Tier had moved despite the order of time, and had thus suffered a lashback from the heaven and earth? Then, after leaving, he would no longer keep this memory? Otherwise, it could not be explained.

“So what if time separates us? So what if I will have to endure the backlash of karma? If I want to kill someone, even the heavens cannot stop me!” The slit eye sent out his divine sense.?Boom, he exploded with an even more powerful aura, as if the heaven and earth itself would have to prostrate in front of him.

Weng, the slit eye sent out a paw this time. It was black as ink, and pressed down on Ling Han and his group.

This paw was entwined with boundless seals, and as it struck out, even this Mystery Realm that did not exist in the heaven and earth would tremble on the verge of collapse.

Compared to the previous Divine Sword, the might of this attack had soared 100 times over!

Boom, the black paw struck over, its speed extraordinarily fast. Even boundless time could not stop its might.

Ling Han and his group wanted to flee, but no matter how fast their feet ran, their figures were completely motionless. In this heaven and earth, the flow of time was incredibly bizarre. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Could it be… that they would be dying here?

Ling Han’s heart was icy cold. To say nothing of the fact that they were only in spirit form now, even if they had physical bodies, and could hide inside the Black Tower, so what? When a Heavenly Venerate moved, even the Tower of Three Realms could only flee. If it dared to stand off against the Heavenly Venerate, it would definitely be destroyed.

But was there really no solution?

Shua, right at this moment, a dim light streaked out, striking that paw, and forcibly sending it into retreat.

Who had moved now that had actually blocked the strike of a Heavenly Venerate?

The slit eye blinked slightly, and looked behind Ling Han and his group. Looking downstream of the Timestream, that dim light had come from downstream.

“So it is you!” The slitted eye released a cold laugh. “I have seen you in the Timestream, and after boundless years, you are no longer in existence!”

Ling Han and his group were all numb from hearing this.

To be able to move in spite of time, that would have to be a Heavenly Venerate, but would a Heavenly Venerate die?

Ling Han suddenly understood which Heavenly Venerate would move at this moment, and would also have disappeared in history.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable!

The master he had never met.

The five of them all looked downstream of the Timestream, and saw a figure was striding over, feet stepping on the river waters. A black tower floated above his head, and there would be occasional streaks of golden light surging out, exuding an aura that would suppress the heavens and shake the ages.

It was the Tower of Three Realms!

Ling Han naturally recognized it, and was completely sure that this was the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had entered here from a different shard of time, and discovered Ling Han. He had also discovered that he was his future disciple, and had thus moved resolutely when he had encountered danger.

“As it turned out, this little guy is your disciple from a different era.” The slit eye looked into the distance of the Timestream, and showed an expression of dawning realization. “I really cannot afford to underestimate your line. To think that two Heavenly Venerates would actually emerge!

“However, the future is not unchangeable. As long as I kill him here, then even the future would also be rewritten!”

“Just try!” The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had already walked to the source of the Timestream, and stood ahead of Ling Han. His tall, broad figure stood in front of Ling Han and his group, protecting them completely.

He looked at the skies proudly. “Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, do you dare battle me? See if I won’t kill you, and turn you into history!”

How domineering, being so confident even faced with a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han stuck out his head slightly, surveying the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

He was an extremely handsome man, broad and tall in figure. He had thick black hair, each strand seemingly carved from beautiful jade, exuding a gentle luster. His face was also seemingly carved from jade, with clear-cut features and a smooth, bright complexion.

The most astonishing was naturally his aura of dominating the whole world, recognizing no one else but himself.

The slitted eye stared at the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable for a while, and then involuntarily smirked coldly. “You are already a dead man, so what need do I have to risk severe injury just to battle you? Moreover, if it actually stirs up time, who knows how it may change history, and it is possible that you may be granted a sliver of hope of survival. Hehe, do you think I would be so stupid?”

“Cowardly rat!” Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable merely mocked coldly.

The slitted eye involuntarily widened slightly, and said, “However, you are right. I am determined to kill these juniors. Their future is filled with fog, and even I cannot distinguish it clearly. Without eradicating them, I would not be able to rest easy!”

He had no interest in battling the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, yet wanted to kill Ling Han and his group.

Was it difficult?

Not at all. If a Heavenly Venerate wanted to kill someone, then even another Heavenly Venerate would find it very difficult to protect them..
