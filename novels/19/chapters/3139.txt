3140 Young King Tier

If this large snake had stayed hidden in the pool, even king tiers of Twelve Meridians would frown and have no confidence of killing it.

That was because it was only a Ten Meridians, and had just advanced into the ranks of king tiers.

“How about this…” The old woman spoke up, “We don’t have many years left to live, so why don’t we give this opportunity to the younger generation?”

“What do you mean?” Ji Yuanlong asked.

“The older generation can’t make a move. Let the youngsters do it. Whoever can kill this vicious creature, the Volcanic Fruit will belong to him. How about it?” the old woman said.

This tempted a great many people, because once a fight broke out over the Volcanic Fruit, it may cripple or even kill the king tiers of their own forces.

To sacrifice a king tier for a king tier-level fruit was naturally not worth it.

However, if it was a competition between juniors, and the one that would be killed was a giant python at that, they would naturally be able to avoid this problem.

“I agree.” Sun Jianfang was the first to nod.

“Sect Master!” Gu Tang and He Guan called out at the same time. They were naturally worried about leaving such an important contest in the hands of Ling Han and the other juniors. The Volcanic Fruit was a treasure that even they valued highly.

Moreover, if Ling Han, Nie Yang, and the others really obtained the Volcanic Fruit, how could they bring themselves to ask for it?

“I’ve made up my mind!” Sun Jianfang showed his decisive side, not giving Gu Tang and the others any chance to speak.

Gu Tang and the others could only shut their mouths reluctantly. Who asked them not to be the top king tiers of Twelve Meridians? They were no match for him.

“All right, I also agree.”

“This way, there would be no need to hurt the harmony between us, all right.”

“That’s it then.”

All the forces agreed. Since there were no members of the older generation participating, they were all filled with confidence in the members of the younger generation that they had brought.

“The four of you have to work together and unite!” Sun Jian said solemnly to Ling Han and the others.

“Yes.” Ling Han and the others all nodded. The meaning behind Sun Jianfang’s words was naturally because there was an external enemy in front of them, so they couldn’t have internal strife.

The four of them stepped out, and the young people from the other forces also walked out one after another. There were ten forces, and there seemed to be about more than thirty people.

This was a Ten Meridians king tier, and furthermore, it was a Demonic Beast. Ordinarily, it would not be a problem for it to match two to three human Ten Meridians king tiers.

One of them looked towards Ling Han and said, “What is it? After Li Changdan became the Dao Child, he is now putting on airs? Only the few of you are sent out. Aren’t you just here to help?”

This was a disciple of Ji Yuanlong. By the looks of it, their branch had been led astray by Ji Yuanlong.

Another person said, “So what if Li Changdan was here? He is only a Nine Meridians!”

This was a tall, slender man, his face filled with pride.

Only a Nine Meridians?

Tsk, tsk. Judging by his tone, it was as if he were a king tier of Ten Meridians.

Seeing that everyone was looking towards him, this person said proudly, “I am Blue Feather City’s Sima Rong. Greetings, everyone!” He clasped his hands in greeting, seeming to be very polite, but the pride on his face clearly showed his arrogant nature.

Brother Sima, in your eyes, Nine Meridians doesn’t seem to be much, right?” someone said to Sima Rong.

“Hehe.” Sima Rong merely laughed, then looked towards that giant python, “Those who have not reached Ten Meridians should obediently step aside, and not seek your own death!”

Hiss, everyone was shocked. From the meaning of his words, it seemed like he really was a Ten Meridians.

But, how could this be possible?

Over the past hundred years, aside from the earliest batch of people, who didn’t need to be in their sixties or seventies to be able to open ten meridians and advance into king tier? However, Sima Rong looked to be only twenty-four to twenty-five years old, and he had already become a Ten Meridians?

If this were true, then he had undoubtedly set a new record.

“You guys should go out and travel more. Who knows how big the outside world is!” Sima Rongsaid proudly, sweeping a disdainful gaze over the masses. Then, with a battle cry, he charged towards the large snake.

He was really fierce. Against a Ten Meridians king tier-level beast, he actually dared to charge out alone. At least, this courage was worthy of admiration.

Shua, the giant python also began its attack. Its thick and long tail whipped over, bringing with it a whistling wind.

This snake was as thick as a bucket, and its length was about 30 meters. Its weight was probably a few thousand kilograms. How terrifying would it be for it to lash out with about 50,000 kilograms of strength of a Ten Meridians?

Peng!

The attack landed, and Sima Rong’s whole person was instantly sent flying. However, the giant python had also lost a considerable number of scales, as well as blood. Though this was negligible for the colossal body of the giant python, it was enough to show how strong Sima Rong was.

This guy was definitely a Ten Meridians elite!

Seeing this scene, everyone was speechless. No wonder Sima Rong was so overbearing. Such a young Ten Meridians indeed had the right to be arrogant.

But how was this possible?

How exactly did this guy cultivate?

Could it be… that he had eaten the Volcanic Fruit before?

“Hahahaha!” Sima Rong laughed loudly, and charged back. The force of the python’s strike only sent him flying, but did not cause him any injury.

“Let’s go!” The others looked at each other, and made their moves.

Since Sima Rong was the main force, they only needed to add insult to injury. This was a competition to see who could kill the giant python, and not who would have the greatest contribution towards the kill.

There would be a chance.

However, they had clearly underestimated the python’s battle prowess. It merely turned around and lashed out. Boom, a terrifying gust of wind assaulted them. Peng, peng, peng! Immediately, seven or eight people were sent flying. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Power was released, and there was no need for it to come physically close to them at all.

Ling Han could clearly see that the effective distance for Ten Meridians to release their power was about three feet. If it was any further, the power would begin to dissipate, and when it was around ten feet, it would no longer be a threat.

Thus, it might seem that Sima Rong had exchanged a blow with the giant python, but in truth, there was no real contact. Instead, they exchanged blows with the force that they had released.

But in a situation when they could not release their power, how could the others possibly be a match for the giant python? The power gap was too wide, and the body of the giant python was a super weapon. As its tail swept out, there was no one that could match it at all.

If one didn’t have the power of the Ten Meridians, he could only rely on the sea of people to exhaust the power of this python if he wanted to defeat it.

After all, king tiers had limited power, and it was impossible for them to expend it endlessly.

“Bunch of trash!” Sima Rong had previously maintained a modest attitude, but now, he completely looked down on everyone. He rushed over, brandishing his fists furiously, “All of you get lost, don’t get in the way!”

Peng, peng, peng! As he charged over, the strong winds he created sent those around him flying, showing his overwhelming power.
