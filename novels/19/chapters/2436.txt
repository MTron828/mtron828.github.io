Chapter 2437: Undead Sea

It didn’t take long for the Empress to extract the mark from the first Celestial Seed, handing it over to Ling Han to refine alchemical pills with.

Celestial Seeds that had been “transferred” could only be used to refine alchemical pills. They couldn’t be used for anything else.

The four of them took a horse-drawn carriage again, slowly ambling on toward the next city.

The huge size of the Celestial Path far surpassed Ling Han and the others’ imagination.

“The Imperial Void Celestial King sealed his son so that he could obtain a profound opportunity on this Celestial Path,” Ling Han said as he recalled Yu Wudi’s words. He continued to speculate, saying, “To facilitate this, he was sealed away for a good number of epochs. Say, just what kind of opportunity might this be?”

“The Celestial Path allows one to become a Celestial King. That being the case, this opportunity is most likely a flawless Celestial Seed,” the Empress said.

“Mm-hm.” Bewitching Maiden Rou nodded in agreement.

Hu Niu yawned in reply, showing no interest whatsoever.

“A flawless Celestial Seed, huh?” Ling Han murmured to himself. He then smiled, and said, “Then let’s fight for it as well.”

After ambling on for three months, their carriage was finally forced to a stop.

A vast expanse of sea appeared before them. A carriage naturally couldn’t carry them across.

If this had only been an ordinary sea with ordinary water, the carriage could have, in fact, carried them across with no problem. However, it was a pity that this sea was raging with tumultuous waves. They could see the flashing light of the great dao, which could easily kill Immortal Palace Tier elites.

“This is the Undead Sea,” their coachman said. His face was filled with respect and apprehension. “Even though it’s named the Undead Sea, nine out of 10 people who enter aren’t able to make it out alive. It’s riddled with fatal dangers. Good lords, I truly don’t dare to enter this sea.”

Ling Han didn’t want to force him, so he nodded, and said, “Very well. You can return now.” He tossed the coachman a few Star Stones. Star Stones were extremely rare on the Celestial Path, so this was suitable payment for his services.

The coachman accepted the Star Stones and thanked them profusely. However, he didn’t dare to linger around the Undead Sea for too long, so he hurriedly left on his carriage.

In fact, they were still quite some distance away from the Undead Sea. Moreover, because of the landform, they could only see a corner of the sea. However, the roaring of the waves could already be heard. It was as if there were an earthquake, and it was as if there were a collapsing mountain. This was a deafening sound.

They set off for the sea. After walking for five or so kilometers, a vast expanse of blue sea instantly appeared before them.

This sea was boundless, and they couldn’t see the other side even with their powerful Pseudo-Celestial King Tier vision. From time to time, however, they would see enormous waves that measured more than 300 meters in height. This was simply astounding.

Casting their gazes to the shore, they could also see a gathering of many cultivators. Some were pushing newly built rafts into the sea, while others were doing battle with the roaring waves that were crashing toward them. In fact, these waves would transform into weapons and humanoids, and their battle prowess was surprisingly great.

Ling Han could see the situation clearly. After entering the sea, the newly built rafts would quickly fall apart and be eaten away by corrosion. Meanwhile, their occupants would fall into the sea. After a short time, these people would resurface with their bellies facing up, as dead as could be.

This was utterly terrifying. This seawater possessed a deadly power.

However, once a person died, other cultivators would immediately leap onto their corpses. They would then unleash their power at the seawater, pushing the corpses forward and using them as a vessel.

This was incredibly strange. Wooden rafts were unable to resist the corrosion of the seawater, yet these corpses could act as vessels with no problem at all.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. No wonder so many people were waiting on the shores. They were waiting for naive idiots to build wooden rafts and set out to sea, after which they would die and provide a suitable vessel.

The cultivators on the shore had most likely come from Celestial King Tier clans. It was because of this that they understood what to do.

“This is the origin of the Undead Sea?” the four of them asked in curiosity.

They walked over, immediately attracting the uncanny gazes of many people. They were like wolves staring at a flock of sheep.

In their eyes, Ling Han and the others weren’t humans at all. Instead, they were vessels to cross the sea with.

Ling Han swept his gaze over them, asking, “Who wants to target us?” He wore a faint smile, and he didn’t appear angry at all.

Some people recognized him, and they immediately turned around to leave. However, there were always those who didn’t recognize Ling Han. They crossed their arms before their chest as they walked forward with disdainful expressions.

“Brat, you’re bringing three ladies with you, and they’re even three extremely beautiful ladies. Are you treating this place like your own backyard?” someone said in jealousy. They didn’t mind killing Ling Han and tossing him into the sea to use as a vessel.

Ling Han glanced toward the person who had spoken. This was a man with red hair. In fact, even the hair on his body was red, and it was as if he hadn’t evolved properly. He appeared as wild as could be.

“What kind of beast are you?” Ling Han asked.

The red-haired man was enraged, and he bared his teeth, revealing his two sharp fangs. “Don’t provoke me. It won’t do you any good at all,” he said in a threatening voice.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “It’s always me who says this to others. Now that I’m on the receiving end, it truly feels a little strange.”

“After killing you, I’ll carve the word ‘fool’ on your corpse!” the red-haired man roared. He resolutely lashed out, aiming to kill Ling Han. He would use this person’s corpse as a vessel to cross the sea. In fact, he wouldn’t mind taking the Empress and the others as his concubines, either.

Ling Han simply replied with a cold glare. A terrifying burst of cold intent burst forth, causing the red-haired man to involuntarily shudder. His attack ground to a sudden halt.

The red-haired man felt like his heart was booming like thunder, and this terrified him greatly. How was this person’s gaze so harrowing? With a single glance, he had almost petrified him so much he wetted his pants!

However, he pumped himself up, convincing himself that Ling Han had definitely cultivated some kind of secret technique that allowed him to possess a terrifying gaze. With a shake, he instantly transformed into a red wolf. His fur was like metal, and it was as luster as could be.

He bared his fangs, releasing a violent aura. At the same time, the projection of a giant wolf materialized behind him, reaching 30,000 meters in height. It radiated with a boundless might.

“Oh, so you’re a wolf pup,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Screech!” Little Terror couldn’t help but bare its fangs with an angry expression. In its eyes, this red-haired wolf was challenging its status.

“Go ahead,” Ling Han said with a smile. He grabbed Little Terror from Bewitching Maiden Rou’s arms before throwing it at the red wolf.

The red wolf was enraged. This person was attacking him with a small beast! Just how belittling was this?

However, when Little Terror bared its frighteningly sharp teeth, the fur of the red wolf involuntarily stood on ends. Only at this moment did it understand the might of Little Terror. It looked harmless and adorable, yet in reality, it was a terrifying killing machine.

He hurriedly activated his bloodline, causing red to flood the sky. This giant wolf projection also unleashed a howl, opening its mouth and spitting a blood arrow at Little Terror.

Little Terror completely ignored this attack. Its physique could rival Ling Han’s, so it had the right to act with such arrogance.

Peng!

The blood arrow arrived, yet Little Terror didn’t even shudder. It continued to charge at the red wolf.

With a quick lunge, it had already engaged with the red wolf.

The roar of beasts reverberated through the sky as the large and small beast engaged in a fierce battle. However, this didn’t last long, as Little Terror quickly gained an advantage, and bit its opponent’s neck.

The red wolf continued to struggle, and this enraged Little Terror even further. It forcefully snapped its jaws shut, and with a few shakes, the red wolf quickly became limp. It ceased to move anymore.

Everyone inhaled a sharp breath upon seeing this. This adorable and innocent-looking beast was actually a terrifying killing machine!
