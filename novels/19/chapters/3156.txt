3157 Counterattack

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Though this guy was a Ten Meridians, his battle prowess was completely comparable to an Eleven Meridians, even a peak stage Eleven Meridians. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Who could believe this?

They all looked towards Ling Han. This young man looked to be a few years younger than even Zhu Lang, but his battle prowess was so strong that he practically looked like a monster.

“Good one, Captain Ling!”

“Good fight!”

There was a scattered cheer. These were the five people who had witnessed Ling Han’s terrifying power on the warship. Previously, they had not dared to shout, fearing that they would be beaten to death by their companions, but now that Ling Han had sent Zhu Lang flying, they naturally had no more reservations.

It was a shame that they hadn’t been able to transfer to Ling Han’s team. Otherwise, they would have been even more proud.

Zhang Honglang’s expression was filled with shock. For a moment, he couldn’t wrap his head around it.

Wasn’t this deputy captain locked in a fierce battle with him? How could he manage to send Zhu Lang flying with a single punch?

What was going on? This was incomprehensible.

“Idiot, the deputy captain was lenient towards you at that time.” A member of Team Seven lightly smacked the back of Zhang Honglang’s head.

Only now did Zhang Honglang come to his senses. When he looked at Ling Han again, his eyes were filled with deep respect.

His abilities were clearly far superior, but for the sake of his pride, he actually deliberately tied with him. Tsk, what an exceptional captain.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and withdrew his fist, “You speak so boldly, yet the result is that you are not the slightest bit durable!”

The entire Xuanqing Banner fell silent for a short while, then suddenly erupted in a thunderous roar.

This was too satisfying!

This new deputy captain was too awesome.

‘Great, just beat him to near-death. Who asked him to be condescending and arrogant?’

The other two soldiers from Yunmo Banner also started to panic. What was going on?

They immediately said, “How shameless, using an elite of Twelve Meridians to suppress him!”

They didn’t believe that a Ten Meridians or Eleven Meridians could defeat Zhu Lang with a single strike—even the prodigies ranked in the top ten in the city couldn’t do it. Yes, perhaps the monster in the first place could, but it definitely couldn’t be the person in front of them.

Ling Han appeared calm and unruffled, “You can eat whatever you like, but you can’t speak irresponsibly!” He charged out. Peng, peng, two punches landed, and the two sturdy men were also sent flying.

With his full power channelling, every meridian in his body emitted a faint glow, a total of ten of them.

His cultivation level of Ten Meridians was clear at a glance.

The members of Xuanqing Banner all became excited. Some roared at the sky, some raised their weapons high and brandished them repeatedly, while others danced around in joy.

On the other side, Zhu Lang finally got back to his feet slowly. Although he had been sent flying, he hadn’t suffered any serious injuries. It was just that he couldn’t think straight for the moment, so he continued to lie on the ground.

How had he lost?

“Who are you?” he asked.

“Xuanqing Banner, the deputy captain of Team Seven, Ling Han,” Ling Han said calmly.

Deputy captain?

That would have to be an Eleven Meridians, at least. In fact, in some teams, it wouldn’t be strange for a Twelve Meridians to be the deputy captain.

And to be able to send him flying with a single punch, that definitely had to be the power of Twelve Meridians.

‘F*ck! A Twelve Meridians was bullying him with his advantage of a higher cultivation level?’

He was defiant!

“Your Xuanqing Banner is really too shameless. You actually sent a Twelve Meridians to sneak attack me!” Zhu Lang said through gritted teeth.

Pu!

Everyone’s expressions were filled with disdain, giving Zhu Lang a merciless mockery.

Twelve Meridians?

Just now, Ling Han had already publicly announced that he was a Ten Meridians, just a Ten Meridians!

If he couldn’t win, he couldn’t win, but he still had so many excuses. He really was a sore loser.

Zhu Lang couldn’t help but find it strange. ‘What’s with your expressions? You’re clearly using an elite of Twelve Meridians to suppress me, but why am I the one who looks like an idiot?’

“Ling Han! Ling Han! Ling Han!” The people of Xuanqing Banner all shouted loudly. In this moment, they had completely accepted this deputy captain.

Hence, it was really very simple to win respect, as long as one had enough strength.

Everyone was startled. What did Ling Han mean by asking this question?

Someone who had quick reflexes immediately came to his senses, and said, “Deputy Captain, are you planning to challenge Yunmo Banner?”

“Of course. Reciprocity requires reciprocation. How could they be the only ones to cause trouble?” Ling Han said calmly.

“I’ll take you there!”

“I’ll bring you there too!”

“I’m going too!”

All of a sudden, everyone was excited, as if they had been pumped full of adrenaline.

All this while, it was the three great banners that had come to cause trouble, while Xuanqing Banner was forced to accept the challenge. Most of the time, they had to swallow the bitter fruit of defeat, and allow their opponent to humiliate them as they liked.

It could not be helped. There really was no elite-level prodigy to turn the tide.

Now that Ling Han said he was going to launch a counterattack at Yunmo Banner, it naturally ignited the emotions that had been suppressed in everyone’s hearts.

Everyone raised their arms and called out, wanting to work alongside Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Liu Jing sighed inwardly. It was only an instant, and the members of Team Seven had all become Ling Han’s loyal supporters. His position as deputy captain was already firm and unshakable.

It had to be said that even he had been impressed by Ling Han. Following such a young, promising, and heroic deputy captain should be very enjoyable.

“Charge!”

Everyone was shouting, as if they weren’t going to Yunmo Banner to challenge them, but going to war.

Ling Han led the way, and almost all of Xuanqing Banner’s troops were mobilized. Over eighty people surrounded Ling Han, as if he was Xuanqing Banner’s Banner Lord.

Really, aside from Lian Xuerong, what other captain would have such prestige?

“Er… where should we go?” Ling Han had just walked out of the base camp when he stopped and asked the person behind him.

This question almost caused everyone to fall to the ground.

‘F*ck! Right now, everyone’s mood is hot as fire. However, your sudden question is far too demoralizing, no?’

However, hearing this, everyone laughed out loud.

This deputy captain seemed to have a natural talent for jokes.

“Let’s walk to the left first,” someone said as they led the way.

Ling Han continued to lead the way, and the others followed behind him. Behind them, Zhu Lang and the other two men from Yunmo Banner also followed. They were still a little dazed. What had gotten into these people from Xuanqing Banner today that they would actually dare to be so insolent at the base of their Yunmo Banner?

The encampments of the four banners were distributed in the four corners of the city. Thus, no matter which part of the city was in turmoil, there would always be an elite troop that could move out quickly to suppress the unrest.

Thus, there was still some distance from here to Yunmo Banner. After walking for about an hour, Yunmo Banner’s army camp was finally within sight.

They discovered the camp, and the people in the camp also discovered them.

Of course, there were sentry posts here. Otherwise, if they encountered the barrage of attacks from Demonic Beasts, wouldn’t they die without even knowing that they were going to die?

Instantly, the camp sounded the alarm.

F***, a dark mass of people surged over. This line-up was really too big, wasn’t it?

In a short while, a large group of people rushed out of the camp’s entrance. Some of them weren’t even dressed completely, looking extremely disheveled.

Yi, weren’t these the people of Xuanqing Banner?

Have you all come to fight a war?
