2692 Admitting defeat

When Ling Han’s words fell, every single member of the Liu Clan was silent.

Some were only intimidated by Ling Han’s aura, and did not dare speak, but there were others that were really reflecting on the errors of their ways. Their grand elder’s sacrifice had indeed won honor and glory for the Liu Clan, but they were simply using the tactics of a bully to squander away the reputation and prestige of their grand elder?

Liu Yanghe took a deep breath. “10 pieces of Divine Metal!”

“Not enough!” Ling Han still shook his head.

’10 pieces of Divine Metal was still not enough? What in the world do you want?’ Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Just exactly what does Grandmaster Ling want in exchange for resolving this grudge between us?” Liu Yanghe sighed.

“Open your treasure chamber, and allow me to take my pick,” Ling Han said.

“Woof! Woof! Woof!” The large black dog immediately charged over from the distance. “Treasure chamber, treasure chamber, treasure chamber.” He was extremely excited. They would really be making great profits if they could rob the treasure chamber of a Heavenly Venerate.

“Impossible!” Liu Yanghe immediately shook his head in refusal without a second thought.

Ling Han raised the Divine Demon Sword. “Then I can only start a massacre here, right until there is no one who will stop me.”

He was determined to beat these great forces to the point that they developed a healthy fear of him, and would never dare to trifle with him again in the future. Otherwise, they would keep causing trouble for him; how irritating would that be.

Liu Yanghe was furious, and wanted to immediately fight a battle with Ling Han, but when he saw the Divine Demon Sword in Ling Han’s hand, he swallowed the words that were just on the tip of his tongue.

It was possible that the Liu Clan would be obliterated if they fought.

Though killing Ling Han would be just like child’s play when the grand elder of Liu Clan returned, how could Liu Yanghe bring himself to watch as the Liu Clan that had flourished for several epochs declined in his hands?

“Lord Clan Leader, since it’s a fight he wants, let’s give him one.”

“We of the Liu Clan do not fear death!”

“That’s right. We are the descendants of a Heavenly Venerate. We definitely cannot bring shame to his prestige!”

The members of the Liu Clan were all calling out. These were basically all young people, filled with youthful vigor and hot-blooded, but even more of them maintained their silence. The threat that Ling Han posed was genuine. If it was only for the sake of their pride and some material objects that the Liu Clan was destroyed, that would really be too dumb.

To speak of nothing else, if Ling Han eliminated all the members of the Liu Clan, would he not be able to calmly open the doors of their treasure chamber, and take everything that was contained within?

That would make their bloodshed even more insignificant.

“Agreed!” After a very long time of silence, Liu Yanghe finally spat out this word, and after he said this, it was as if he had aged a few decades in an instant. He no longer had any of the pride that he had once had.

Today, the Liu Clan had suffered such a great humiliation, and as clan leader of Liu Clan, it was natural that he would feel it the most.

“Clan Leader!” A considerable number of the members of the Liu Clan fell to their knees, tears streaming from their eyes. They were bawling and weeping like no tomorrow, as if countless people had died.

Ling Han did not feel the slightest bit of compassion. Whose fault was it when it was the Liu Clan who had trifled with him first?

Furthermore, if it were not for the fact that Ling Han had impressive strength, he would probably be working in turns in the various clans by now, forced to concoct alchemical pills. Who would be sympathizing with him then?

Ling Han and the large black dog entered the city, and after Liu Yanghe opened the treasure chamber, they immediately began to rake in their spoils.

According to the large black dog, he would throw caution to the wind, and rob this place clean, but Ling Han was not as greedy. He only chose the most valuable items, such as Celestial-King-Tier Great Herbs, Divine Metal, and… the natural treasures that were needed for the cultivation of the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique.

As expected of a supreme noble clan, they truly had astonishing wealth.

Ling Han was very pleased. After making a whole round, he walked out, and said, “Clan Leader Liu, goodbye.”

“We will come back frequently in the future.” The large black dog followed up with a parting shot, which caused Liu Yanghe to grab his chest in agony, so pained that he could not even speak.

The man and dog left the Liu Clan, and met back up with Wally. Ling Han tossed a few pieces of Divine Metal to Wally as payment for his service.

They set out again, and continued their raid.

Zhao Clan, Li Clan, Sun Clan… one after another, Heavenly-Venerable-Tier forces bowed down in submission to Ling Han. Without a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier powerhouse in their clans, how would they be able to stop the present Ling Han?

After raiding the sixth clan, Ling Han had reaped a good harvest. If the remaining three clans would also provide such profits, he would be just about able to upgrade his physique to Indestructible Divine Metal Physique.

“The next one is… the Yun Clan.”

Several days later, they arrived at the Yun Clan.

The Yun Clan was not on the ground, in the mountains, or out at sea, but rather at the top of clouds. Multiple grand palaces were borne by fluffy white clouds, floating in midair. They shone with dazzling golden light. This was truly an amazing sight.

However, when Ling Han and company arrived, the Yun Clan was also prepared. The doors of every palace were tightly closed, seemingly expressing that they did not welcome Ling Han at all.

As per usual, Wally did a preliminary clan to check out the real situation.

“There is a living being with Vitality Index that has surpassed 14,000,” Wally stated.

14,000!

No matter how strong a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was, their Vitality Index would only be over 13,000. There was no way that they could break through the great barrier of 14,000.

“Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” Ling Han exchanged a look with the large black dog, and both exclaimed at the same time.

“Iron body, are you sure you did not see wrongly?” the large black dog asked Wally.

Wally’s expression was filled with disdain. He refused to answer this kind of question that was merely a waste of his energy.

“Little Han, let’s retreat,” the large black dog said to Ling Han again. This was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. That was a being that no Celestial King could be comparable to.

In theory, 10 peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were enough to match a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and Ling Han alone had fought more than 30 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to the point that they fled in a panic. In that case, if Ling Han were to face off against a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, it should be Ling Han’s absolute victory.

But this comparison could not be done in such a manner.

The fact that Ling Han could suppress so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings was due to the fact that he had a Heavenly Venerate Tool in his possession. No Celestial King could possibly match that, and they could only be suppressed by Ling Han. But it was different for Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. Though they, too, could not stand against a Heavenly Venerate Tool equally, it would not be a completely one-sided battle, either. After all, the Divine Demon Sword had only reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier in terms of quality. Its might was still too far off from that level.

On the other hand, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had the advantage in power and speed, and this was completely enough to cancel out the advantage that a Heavenly Venerate Tool gave Ling Han.

To have Ling Han fighting a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate now, even if he had the help of the Divine Demon Sword, was still quite tough. He should only be able to escape. Because he was outmatched in both power and speed, he could only be beaten passively. No matter how great the power of the Divine Demon Sword was, what was the use if it could not hit its target?

“We fight!” Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared.

“How are we supposed to fight? Wouldn’t that be just delivering ourselves up to be defeated?” The large black dog hurriedly pulled Ling Han back, not wanting him to deliver himself up to be defeated.

Ling Han shook his head. “You and Wally retreat first. I want to try myself out in battle.”

Firstly, he indeed wished to see just how far off he presently was from Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. In the future, when he faced He Yufeng again, he would also have some idea. Secondly, he was only a slight bit away from Ninth Heaven. He only needed a trigger to be able to cross over this new threshold. Perhaps that would be a little bit of pressure.

This was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; that was enough to exert pressure on him.

“Brat, take care then. Grandpa Dog is leaving first.” The large black dog had absolutely zero concept of the idea of loyalty, and he patted Ling Han’s shoulder. “If you die, Grandpa Dog will come and pick up your body.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. With a tap of his foot, he directly soared into midair, where he stood. “Since the Yun Clan still has a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, what is the need to hide and cower? Come out and battle me!”

“What a truly brazen brat!” A relaxed voice rang out, and a figure walked over through the air. This was a young man in green robes. He was handsome and dashing, bearing an intimidating charisma.

“How do I address you, sir?” Ling Han asked smilingly. With his present strength, though he was still no match for a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he was not too far off, either. He was completely capable of speaking as an equal to a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.
