Chapter 2382: A person hung on the flagpole

Ling Han stopped, turned back round with a smile, and asked, “What is it? You want a spar with us?”

How could the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe dare? Hurriedly, he smiled and said, “Don’t misunderstand, don’t misunderstand. Luan Xing is one of our clan members, after all. She has just acknowledged her ancestors and returned to her clan, so it would be better that she stays for a few days longer in the clan.”

Whether it was Ling Han or the Empress, they were both unbelievably freakish. If they could stay in the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe, that would be equivalent to having gained a powerful backer.

Ling Han shook his head with a smile. “Old man, don’t you think it’s a little late to say this now?”

If the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe had resolutely maintained his stand previously, Ling Han would not have let them go to so much trouble for nothing, either. But then what? He had not done anything, and had wanted to detach himself from the matter completely, yet now wanted to take advantage of them. How could there be such a good thing in this world?

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe couldn’t help but look embarrassed, yet he could say nothing to refute. He could only shake his head sheepishly.

Ling Han and the Empress called the other women over, left the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe, and then headed towards Three Cloud City.

Since they had already formed a grudge with the Kong Clan, Ling Han would settle the matter once and for all. Furthermore, he was also very curious about how over 100 Ascending Origin Tiers had emerged from the Kong Clan all at once. This was very inconceivable.

…The Ascending Origin Tier was actually already very awesome. It was the strongest beneath the Celestial King Tier, and to have so many Ascending Origin Tiers surge forth all at once without the support of a Celestial King was very illogical.

Ling Han and his group did not travel very quickly. Roaming and traveling, they reached the Three Cloud City. Before even entering the city, they could see a flagpole that was stuck in front of the city gates, but there was no flag hanging from it. Instead, it was a person.

This person’s limbs were drooping, and they were twisted at an unusual angle at that. It seemed like it should be a corpse, but Ling Han could sense that there was actually a weak fluttering of divine sense from this person.

This clearly was not a provoking action done by some opposing force of Three Cloud City, but rather a certain force in Three Cloud City exhibiting their power, and making an example.

Thinking further, there was only one most powerful force in Three Cloud City, and that was the Kong Clan.

This person should have committed an offense against the Kong Clan, and that was why he had been hung on this flagpole. Yet he had not been killed, but rather left to survive on his last breath. The purpose of this was to serve as a warning for others, that they should never become enemies with the Kong Clan, or becoming this person would be their future.

Ling Han was just about to take a step and continue onwards, but then suddenly stopped, and turned to look at that flagpole again.

He sensed… that there was something familiar about this person.

It was not appearance, but rather divine sense.

Who could it be?

“What is it?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han was still looking at the person hanging from the flagpole, and asked, “Don’t you guys think that we seem to have met this person before?”

The Empress studied him carefully, and then shook her head. With her incredibly proud personality, how could she possibly bother to remember people she had met?

Understanding suddenly flashed in Ling Han’s head, and he exclaimed, “I remember now!”

When his words fell, he immediately waved a hand. A powerful gust of air swept out, and the ropes that were tied around that person split apart. Instantly, that person fell towards the ground. Ling Han stretched his hand again, picked the person up, and then laid him evenly on the ground.

“How dare you!” There were guards at the city entrance, and when they saw how Ling Han actually dared to rescue him, they were instantly enraged. They all rushed over. There were only eight of them at the city entrance, but with a series of shouts, another team of guards rushed out. There were more than 30 of them now.

Ling Han ignored them, and instead placed a palm on the shoulder of that person. As Regulations of Wood activated, filled with vitality, that man’s injuries were being healed.

He frowned slightly. The Kong Clan were really ruthless in their actions. They had first caged this person’s power, and then planted some kind of secret technique which was devouring this person’s vitality, causing incredible agony for him.

Yet this person could not die in the short term, and it would last at least tens of thousands of years. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

What grudge or enmity was there between them that they had to go to such cruel lengths?

“I was talking to you!” a guard shouted. Brandishing the spear in his hands, he stabbed it towards Ling Han’s shoulder.

Hu Niu abruptly roared, which turned into a deafening dragon’s roar.?Pa, the spear in the hands of that guard was instantly shattered. Even the space between his thumb and forefinger split apart. Releasing a pained cry, he slid back continuously.

The guards immediately looked like they were facing a powerful enemy as they all raised their weapons, aiming straight at Hu Niu.

Hu Niu naturally would not be concerned. Instead, she giggled, and said, “Whichever of you are feeling an itch, Niu will come to deal with you!”

Ling Han stimulated the Regulations of Wood, helping the wounded man heal. He had previously possessed the Source Powers of heaven and earth. Though he had given them up of his own volition, they had still left a brand behind on him. This naturally was extremely powerful, and the secret technique in that person’s body was also being erased bit by bit.

Because he could not injure this person, Ling Han progressed at a very slow speed.

Fortunately, he stimulated the Regulations of Time, and time acceleration effects immediately took place. In only over a dozen minutes, the secret technique in that person’s body was already unraveled, and with the nurturing and revitalizing effects of the Regulations of Wood, the person also recovered considerably. His eyelids trembled slightly, and then snapped open.

“F*ck, indeed never anything good happens when I see you, brat,” the person said.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “I have saved your life, and you’re not even going to say thanks?”

This person was the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire. In the past, he had set out on his own the moment they had entered into the Celestial Realm. He had not anticipated that they would reunite at this time and place, and that he would be so badly off to the point of almost dying.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire forcibly sat up, and looking at the surroundings, he couldn’t help but frown. “Not good. This is still Three Cloud City! Let’s go, once the Kong Clan rushes out, we will be in big trouble!”

“It’s fine. If we are really caught up with by your enemies, I will hand you over to them. In any case, it has nothing to do with me,” Ling Han joked.

“Humph, it is already too late for you to know fear now!” A cold laugh rang out, and a young man was seen walking out of the city. He was dressed in rich robes, and actually even held a folded paper fan in his hand. He was waving the fan with every step, very much a show-off.

Ling Han ignored him, and asked, “So you have a grudge with the Kong Clan? Great, I too want to seek them out, so we’ll clear your debt as well while I’m at it.”

“No!” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire hurriedly shook his head. “Though your natural talent in cultivation is extraordinary, that is only limited to the Ancient Realm. Once we have entered into the Celestial Realm, there are many, many other more outstanding prodigies than you here.

“The Kong Clan has over 100 Ascending Origin Tiers, and you have only cultivated for several million years. How could you be a match for them?”

Even if it was he who was re-cultivating from the beginning, he had just advanced into the Immortal Palace Tier now. The gap was astonishingly wide.

Even he was this way, what more when it was Ling Han.

Ling Han put on an act of displeasure, and demanded, “Are you looking down on me?”

“F*ck, let’s flee quickly. Anything else, we can talk later!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire urged. He had no wish to hang on the flagpole again.

“Want to flee?” The young man in embroidered robes smirked coldly. His nostrils were spurting flames in his fury. Not a single member of Ling Han and his group actually gave him any regard, and they were still openly and brazenly talking about fleeing. Did they think he was dead?

“Anyone who becomes enemies with our Kong Clan will never have long to live!” he declared menacingly.

“And who are you?” Ling Han asked.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire couldn’t help but moan. There was such a wonderful chance for them to run, which Ling Han was not using, but was actually spending it on bickering.

The young man in embroidered robes humphed, and declared, “I am Kong Xiang!” He paused, swept a glance over Ling Han and his group, and then demanded proudly, “If you kneel down now and beg for mercy, I can consider sparing your lives.”

Ling Han laughed, turned his head, and commented, “I discover that the members of the Kong Clan really have a natural talent at jokes.”

The women also gave him face by laughing lightly.

Kong Xiang was enraged. He drew a long spear, and suddenly rushed towards Ling Han rapidly. He delivered a sweeping strike with his spear, which exuded formidable might.
