2963 You all wait for an hour

“Ling Duanyun!” Gou Li immediately shouted.

“What are you screaming for? This young master is right in front of you, and I’m not deaf.” Ling Duanyun picked his ears, bearing an expression that was simply asking for a beating.

Ling Han merely smiled. He was already being bullied by people right at his doorstep, so did he still need to be polite?

This brat had got some guts. He was also clever and ruthless with his words. He really possessed the demeanor of Ling Han in his younger days, which caused him to take a liking to this brat.

“I’ll teach you for an hour, and I guarantee that you can beat up this big ugly guy,” Ling Han said. “How about it, watching someone fight or fighting with your own hands, which one would be more enjoyable?”

“Senior, are you sure you’re not joking?” Of course Ling Duanyun didn’t believe it. How could he catch up to and surpass the Eternal River Tier in just an hour?

He was just toying with him, right?

Ling Han smiled faintly. “You only have one chance. You can choose whether or not to grasp it.”

Ling Duanyun hesitated slightly, then gritted his teeth suddenly, and bowed to Ling Han. “Please teach me, Senior!”

This brat wasn’t too bad. He was decisive when he needed to be, and didn’t dilly-dally in the slightest.

Ling Han nodded, and lifted Ling Duanyun with his hand. “Stand up.” He had never liked this kind of custom; respect for a person should come from the heart, and not simply as a perfunctory act.

He looked at Gou Li and the others again. “All of you wait for an hour.”

Of course Gou Li didn’t want to wait, yet even though Ling Han and the others didn’t reveal their aura, they had gained the upper hand by a show of strength. When he couldn’t even glimpse the Empress’s strike previously, he knew that his own strength was far behind.

Therefore, when the other party said to wait, he didn’t dare to go against that request. Furthermore, he absolutely didn’t believe that Ling Duanyun would be completely transformed merely in an hour.

Pei! Not unless he consumed celestial medicine.

Ling Han casually took out a few medicinal pills, and threw them towards Ling Duanyun. “Eat them.”

There were even Celestial pills?

Ling Duanyun couldn’t help his heart beating wildly as he stared at these few gray-colored alchemical pills.

Appearance-wise, they looked terrible. Were they really edible?

What if he had diarrhea after eating them?

However, upon seeing Ling Han’s completely indifferent expression and feeling the strong desire to beat up the burly young man with his own bare hands, he gritted his teeth, popped all three pills into his mouth, and immediately consumed them without thinking twice.

“Hahaha!” Seeing this scene, Gou Li and the others laughed.

The higher-level the alchemical pill, the more remarkably dazzling its appearance would be. A Divine Pill was naturally extraordinary.

He got to be kidding.

They knew that they were no match for Ling Han and the others, but it wasn’t a problem to bully Duanyun.

Ling Han pressed his finger on Ling Duanyun’s forehead. He didn’t need to use any great power at all. He simply drew out the supreme Regulations and accelerated the flow of time around Ling Duanyun.

He was so powerful as a Heavenly Venerate that the regulations were no longer applicable to him, but Ling Duanyun was merely a Heavenly Body Tier, so the acceleration of time was of course useful.

2,000,000 times faster!

What kind of concept was this?

An hour had passed in the outside world, but it had been more than 200 years where Ling Duanyun was.

Wasn’t this awesome enough?

Ling Han didn’t directly raise Ling Duanyun’s cultivation level. On the contrary, he disintegrated Ling Duanyun’s cultivation level, then rebuilt the foundation, and cultivated it back step by step.

In the outside world, time passed on without any notice.

However, Ling Duanyun knew what he had experienced, and he couldn’t help but be shocked. Just what kind of means did this senior have to rebel against the heaven and earth—to disintegrate his cultivation level, rebuild the foundation, and cultivate it back?

He found that more than 100 years had passed quietly, and yet the movements of those people outside had slowed down to the extreme, as if their movement had ceased.

This was a different flow of time.

Ling Han just casually pressed a finger on him, and without using any kind of formation, made the flow of his time speed up countless times, and yet Gou Li and the others didn’t realize it at all. This strength was extremely amazing indeed.

Ling Duanyun met an elite, a noble person.

He quickly drew back his divine sense and concentrated on cultivating. If such a good opportunity was missed, there might not be a next time.

“This is the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, remember it well.” Ling Han sent out a message through divine sense, which resounded loudly in Ling Duanyun’s mind.

Ling Han’s strength was now at the Sixth Tier. Passing on the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was of course not a big deal, but whether Ling Duanyun could comprehend it was another matter altogether. It could be said to be extremely difficult and challenging.

He helped to build Ling Duanyun’s foundation, and created a celestial body with Godly bones.

…Possessing the highest Regulations, and holding on to three types of fundamental powers of the Genesis World, wasn’t achieving this not a big deal?

An hour passed by quickly.

Ling Han drew back his finger, and said, “Go and fight.”

“Yes, Senior,” Ling Duanyun spoke with great respect. Gou Li and the others might not have noticed it, but he was very clear about how powerful this senior was. He was so exceedingly powerful that it was unimaginable.

Gou Li and the others sneered. Both of you really knew how to put up an act together. Would you be able to create a supreme elite just by pressing your finger onto him like that?

Hehe, really hehe[1].

“Brat, come quickly. I’m getting impatient,” the burly young man urged.

“Watch how I am going to beat you up!” Ling Duanyun shouted lightly, and took the initiative to charge towards him.

“A mere Heavenly Body Tier!” the burly young man said disdainfully as he clenched his fist, and blasted a shot towards Ling Duanyun.

Peng! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The two of them exchanged blows, and an incredible sight could be seen. Both of them retreated more than 10 steps consecutively.

Ling Duanyun wasn’t the slightest bit inferior!

What was this?

Gou Li and the others were too shocked to speak.

How could this be possible? It was impossible!

In just an hour, with just the pressing of a finger, a person’s strength could become completely different?

Ling Duanyun was obviously still a Heavenly Body Tier, and his cultivation level didn’t improve in any way, so how could he suddenly become so powerful to such an extent?

All of them looked at Ling Han. It was all naturally because of Ling Han.

Just what kind of existence was this? The power of one finger could actually be so terrifying?

At the same time, they were also filled with envy. Why didn’t such a good opportunity fall upon themselves?

“Those medicinal pills!” Gou Li and the others finally came to a realization.

“Those must be celestial medicines to make people completely transform.”

“They ought to be Saintly medicine for building a foundation. Obviously there is no change in cultivation level, but the strength has increased countless times.”

“This is millions and millions times or a trillion times more precious than directly improving one’s cultivation level.”

One could only improve one’s cultivation level by so much, and it was a one-off deal, but it was a matter of a lifetime to consolidate the foundation, which could benefit one forever.

“Come fight again!” The burly young man came charging again. So what if Ling Duanyun’s strength could match his? His iron fist had been tempered by godly metal and spiritual herbs ever since he was a child, and possessed the characteristic of being impenetrable by any matter.

Just let him beat this brat to death.

Peng, peng, peng! He waved both his fists, and delivered punches to Ling Duanyun.

Seeing the opponent’s attack like rain, coupled with the fact that his strength had just improved, Ling Duanyun still subconsciously believed that the Eternal River Tier was something he couldn’t match right now, so he dodged quickly, not daring to confront him head-on.

This made Gou Li and the others nod in agreement. A Heavenly Body Tier was merely a Heavenly Body Tier, after all.

Ling Han shook his head. “What’s there to be afraid of, don’t you dare to fight?”

Ling Duanyun involuntarily felt a surge of pride. Thinking back to when he had previously met the burly young man’s attack head-on, wasn’t he not the slightest bit inferior?

“Come on!” He stopped flinching, and met the strike with a hard punch.
