Chapter 2482: Bearing Down

Ling Han and the others continued to advance, conquering another two of the Dark Frost Celestial King’s camps. Now, the Dark Frost Celestial King only had a line camp remaining. However, this was also his most valuable camp.

Sitting in this final tower, the Dark Frost Celestial King wore an ice-cold expression. In fact, it was so dark that it was as if water were about to drip from his face.

Ever since attaining Dao, when had he faced such a difficult situation before?

He was a Third Heaven Celestial King! Yet, he had actually been forced into such an awkward situation.

Fortunately, he had only snuck out in secret. Initially, his goal had been to prevent others from noticing that he had left so that his main camp wouldn’t be attacked by others. Now, however, he had managed to conceal a great embarrassment. He had already targeted them himself, yet he was still unable to suppress a few First Heaven Celestial Kings. If others learned of this, would he not become a huge joke?

However, he couldn’t help but frown when he recalled the battle prowess of Huo Furong.

Celestial Kings with Celestial Tools truly possessed a completely different battle prowess. This was also the reason why so many Celestial Kings wanted to obtain a Celestial Tool no matter what.

He didn’t reckon that he could suppress Huo Furong even if he fought her again.

Fortunately, the 12 different forces had already reached an agreement a few days ago, forming an alliance to target anyone who dared to think about attacking any of the 12 towers. If one tower was attacked, the others would all send reinforcements.

In other words, even if Huo Furong and the others attacked him, he could easily call for reinforcements. However, to call for reinforcements to defend against a few First Heaven Celestial Kings… was far too… embarrassing…

No!

He shook his head upon thinking of this. However, a glimmer immediately appeared in his eyes.

Right! Why couldn’t he invite the Celestial Kings from the other forces over? He could use the excuse of holding a meeting! That way, if Huo Furong and the others attacked, he was certain that the other Celestial Kings would also step forward to help him. At that time, he could drag all of these Celestial Kings to his side.

......

What a brilliant plan!

He immediately sent invitations to the leaders of the various forces.

They all gave him face, and before long, 19 Third Heaven Celestial Kings arrived one after another.

Why were there 19 of them?

Because some Third Heaven Celestial Kings hadn’t reached the peak stage yet, they had already been in teams of two when they had arrived at this central region.

Being as sly as he was, the Dark Frost Celestial King didn’t let slip any information about Ling Han and the others. He maintained a demeanor of calm, and he continued to engage in fruitful conversations with the other Celestial Kings. However, he was secretly hoping that Ling Han and the others would arrive as quickly as possible. This was because he couldn’t keep the 19 Celestial Kings here forever. After all, they weren’t the only Third Heaven Celestial Kings on the Celestial Path.

This was also why they had to form an alliance. Otherwise, what did it matter regardless of how many Second Heaven and First Heaven Celestial Kings there were? Did they need to be afraid?

The Dark Frost Celestial King didn’t need to wait for long before Ling Han and the others arrived.

“L-Lord!” an Ascending Origin Tier elite exclaimed as he ran over with a flustered expression.

The Dark Frost Celestial King could naturally guess what was happening. However, he kept his emotions in check, and he instead chided in anger, “Why are you acting all flustered?!”

“Lord, some people have charged over, and they say they want you to… to…” The Ascending Origin Tier cultivator wanted to continue, yet he didn’t dare to keep going.

“Speak!” the Dark Frost Celestial King said with a frown.

The Ascending Origin Tier cultivator mustered his courage, and said, “They want you to clean your neck and go out to accept death.”

“Oh? Who dares to be so audacious? They actually dare to seek the life of Brother Dark Frost?” a Third Heaven Celestial King said with a smile. He was extremely short, yet he was also astonishingly plump at the same time. This caused him to look like a round ball. His earlobes were also massive, and they hung all the way down to his shoulder. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Dark Frost Celestial King smiled coldly, and said, “It’s most likely just a few clowns.”

“Dark Frost, that’s no way to speak. Since they dare to come here to challenge you, they most likely have some strength. Why don’t we head over to meet them?” another Third Heaven Celestial King said. He was the polar opposite of the Celestial King who had spoken just then. He was tall and skinny, and he looked much like a length of bamboo.

“That’s right, let’s go out to meet them,” the other Celestial Kings all said.

“With all of us heading over, let’s hope that we don’t frighten them to death.”

They all joked and laughed as they headed out. On the Celestial Path, they were most likely an invincible group of people. Thus, they were naturally fearless.

It wasn’t long before they arrived at the foot of the tower, only to see the guards collapsed and unconscious. Meanwhile, a group of youths stood tall and proud, radiating with an extraordinary aura.

This tower wasn’t one that specialized in defense or offense, and it was because of this that it had been breached so easily. In fact, this was a tower that specialized in tool refinement.

“Hmm?” The Ninth Descent Celestial King hummed in surprise. This was because he saw Ling Han in the crowd. This was the youth for whom he had done a favor in the past. At that time, Ling Han had only been a Pseudo-Celestial King.

However, even though he had only been a Pseudo-Celestial King, he had already possessed the power to suppress a First Heaven Celestial King. Now that he had become a Celestial King, just how much had his battle prowess risen?

Perhaps he could suppress Second Heaven Celestial Kings? Could he perhaps rival Third Heaven Celestial Kings?

If it were anyone else, the Ninth Descent Celestial King definitely wouldn’t ponder this. After all, wasn’t this a silly daydream? Who didn’t understand the insurmountable gulf between each Heaven? How could a measly First Heaven Celestial King challenge a mighty Third Heaven Celestial King? Was this a joke?

However, this person was Ling Han. He had already displayed his freakish abilities while at the Pseudo-Celestial King Tier.

Moreover, without enough confidence, would Ling Han have charged over?

Mm-hm, he would stand aside to observe the situation. In any case, Ling Han still owed him a favor. As such, the initiative was in his hands.

“Dark Frost, I’ve come to collect your head!” Ling Han roared. This time, he didn’t allow Huo Furong to charge in before him. In fact, he had also seen the jittery excitement of Ji Wuming, the Rain Emperor, Hu Niu, and the others, so he immediately stepped forward first. Otherwise, this opportunity would have been stolen by his battle-hungry companions again.

The obese Celestial King stepped forward, and said, “A bunch of naive youths.”

His title was Buddhist Cloud, and he didn’t rank highly among the Third Heaven Celestial Kings. He was only at the early stage of the Third Heaven. Thus, he had occupied a treasured tower with another Celestial King of similar strength. However, this was only a group of First Heaven Celestial Kings that he could dispose of with a casual wave of his hand, so he naturally didn’t feel worried at all.

Ling Han wore a faint smile as he looked at the obese Celestial King, saying, “This matter has nothing to do with you.”

“But I want to interfere. Do you have any complaints?” the obese Celestial King said with a loud laugh. These outsiders were far too arrogant. Did they think they could look down on everyone just because they were monarch tiers or monarch stars?

More than just cultivation aptitude, cultivation level was also important.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “So you insist on poking your head forward for a beating. You’ve asked for this yourself.”

“Impudence!” the Buddhist Cloud Celestial King roared.

Boom!

Boundless divine light erupted from his body, and a Buddhist Halo also materialized behind his head. It was as if he had truly transformed into a Buddha that was going to subdue spirits and eliminate demons.

“Hmm?” Ling Han turned around to glance at Ji Wuming. He was the ancient ancestor of Buddhism.

However, Ji Wuming remained calm and uninterested. Instead, it was Shi Chanzi who whispered, “Oh, three epochs ago, a disciple of ours entered the Celestial Path, yet never exited again. As it turns out, he didn’t die. Instead, he was trapped here and even became a Celestial King.”

In other words, the Buddhist Cloud Celestial King was truly a disciple or grand-disciple of Ji Wuming.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. Even though Ji Wuming hadn’t spoken, he still decided to show some mercy. This was to give Ji Wuming some face.

“Come!” Ling Han said as he gestured with his finger. He and Ji Wuming viewed each other as competitors, so he was now viewing this Buddhist Cloud Celestial King as a junior, even though the latter’s cultivation level was higher.

“You’re truly trying to defy the heavens!” the Buddhist Cloud Celestial King said, laughing with rage. He leaped up, genuinely appearing like a Buddhist cloud as he descended toward Ling Han. Boundless divine light shone into the surrounding. He was going to crush Ling Han to death without launching a single attack.
