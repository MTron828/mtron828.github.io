Chapter 3591: Spiritual Spring, Formation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s natural talent as a disciple was too freakish. Thus, the Primordial True Lord intended to hold an incredibly grand disciple recruitment ceremony to announce to the world that it was not only the Nine Spirit True Lord that had recruited an incredible prodigy, Hong Tianbu.

This saved Ling Han some trouble, because it would be too awkward for him to presently pay his respects and take the Primordial True Lord as Master.

One month’s time.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. This was enough time for him to roam around the Primordial Sect a few times, find treasure chambers, and so on. Then, he could make his move and flee.

As for Can Ye… of course, he would completely disappear from now onwards.

Perfect.

Though he was going to be a thief, Ling Han didn’t feel any mental pressure at all. This world originally belonged to the people of the Celestial Sea Planet. The Primordial True Lord and the others were all outsiders. Just because they had spent two thousand years in prison, they were qualified to take control of the famous mountains and great rivers, as well as celestial medicines and ancient sites?

But speaking of which, it was quite strange. These people had escaped, so why did they not flee quickly?

The Azure Dragon Majestic Empire had suppressed them here, and no one had come here all this while. It must be that they thought that this prison would be able to last for a very long time. This place was in a state of extreme poverty, so there was naturally no need to send anyone here to live in poverty?

However, it was impossible that the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire would not send anyone over forever. Then, when this envoy arrived, and discovered that the prison here had been opened, and the environment of heaven and earth had recovered, it would definitely lead to a war, right?

On the surface, the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire had a few great elites at the level of Sect Master, and secretly, there was also a Venerate Tier overseer. How could they possibly be matched by Spirit Transformation Tiers?

Thus, Ling Han couldn’t understand why the Primordial True Lord and the others hadn’t left in a hurry. Instead, they were establishing sects here.

—Putting aside the fact that there was no way to leave, Niu Fang, a Spiritual Transformation Tier cultivator, could deliver Niu Jianhua over, so how could it be that the Spirit Transformation True Lords themselves would not be able to traverse the universe?

“There must be profit to be made, and this profit is extremely large, large enough for them to take risks!” Ling Han murmured, “This is none other than supreme cultivation techniques, such as precious scriptures of Sect Master-level, or even Venerate Tier-level and Saint-level.”

“Or it would be a supreme Celestial Plant.”

“It is said that the grade of the Celestial Sea Planet is not high, and that is why it has been bestowed on the Chen Clan. That is because the Celestial Plants here have all been transplanted from other planets, and the highest grade is only Four Stars. But more than two thousand years ago, a considerable number of Sect Master-level great elites appeared here, which means… perhaps there is Five Star Celestial medicine here, and the quality of the planet could possibly surpass the assessment.”

“These Spiritual Transformation True Lords are staying here because they want to obtain the High Level Celestial medicine?”

“In fact, could there be a mother tree here?”

A bold idea suddenly flashed through Ling Han’s mind. A planet could only have one Celestial medicine, the Mother Tree, but not every planet could give birth to the Mother Tree. It had extremely high requirements of the planet itself. Logically, it was impossible for the Celestial Sea Planet to give birth to the Mother Tree. There was too wide a gap in grade.

But the ancestor of the Chen Clan, Brother Monkey and the others had all rushed up to the level of Sect Master, and that left a variable in all of this.

There was one thing that was certain. More than two thousand years ago, the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire destroyed the Chen Clan Royal Empire, and must have searched the whole world, but did not find the mother tree or any higher grade Celestial medicine. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Was this because the time was not up yet, so the Celestial medicine did not manifest?

Or perhaps it wasn’t as complicated as this at all, and the Spirit Transformation True Lords were all waiting for an ancient site to open, making a profit before leaving?

Ling Han felt a headache coming on. The information he had obtained was too little, and was completely insufficient to piece together the truth.

Forget it. Whether or not these Spirit Transformation True Lords are going to leave after making a profit, I will definitely make a profit and leave.”

Ling Han started to roam around the Primordial Sect. With his status as the future disciple of the Sect Master, no one would dare to stop him no matter where he went. However, there were three places that were an exception.

At night, he put on the hide of the Void Beast, and explored these three places one by one.

One of them was the Spiritual Spring. In this place, the power of heaven and earth was incredibly dense, and had all turned into mist. And with the support of the Spiritual Spring to concoct alchemical pills, the effects could be increased by a considerable amount, or even double.

Ling Han’s eyes burned with desire. This spiritual spring could be used to concoct Celestial Pills. Though he had not advanced into Celestial Path yet, and was not qualified to concoct Celestial Pills, this day would not be too far off.

However, there was really very little spiritual spring. The spring was only the size of a bottle’s mouth, and there was only about half a gourd’s worth of liquid inside. Only after half a day would a drop be produced.

Ling Han didn’t immediately move. He had to take a look at the other two areas first.

However, it wasn’t easy for him to enter the second location. There was a Foundation Building elite standing guard, and he could easily see through Ling Han’s disguise. Thus, Ling Han could only head to the third location first. Although there weren’t any elites standing guard, the formation’s radiance was flickering, and there was no way to get close at all.

Was there a treasure chamber hidden inside the formation?

Ling Han tried to decipher it, but this was a Celestial Path-level formation, so how could he simply do it just by looking at ita few times?

He thought hard, then compared it with what was contained in the Void Beast hide, wanting to find a way to break through the formation.

A night passed, and Ling Han reluctantly withdrew.

There was no hurry. There was still a lot of time.

Early in the morning, he cultivated as per usual, but in the middle of the day, he rested. His mind was completely filled with that formation. He had activated his Eye Technique, and saw a great many things.

He would go at night.

After three days, he finally had some idea.

This formation wasn’t laid out by the Primordial True Lord or someone else, but rather existed in the first place.

—Formation Master was an extremely rare profession. The general trend of heaven and earth was extremely complex, and without natural talent in this area, one wouldn’t be able to grasp anything even if they spent their whole life.

The people here were all originally suppressed in the prison. If there was a Formation Master here, would they still be able to be imprisoned?

Thus, Ling Han didn’t believe that this formation had been laid down at this moment. Instead, it had existed for a long time. It was just that it hadn’t been activated before.

This world had experienced too many changes. The great power of heaven and earth must have changed drastically, and formations were based on the use of the power of heaven and earth. Thus, a flaw would definitely appear in this formation now, and it would not be as perfect as it had once been.

“It can definitely be broken.”

Another four days later, though Ling Han was still unable to break through the formation, he was welcomed with another upgrade to his level of being. He once again opened nine apertures, and his rate of cultivation increased explosively.

“I heard that others can only open one aperture every time, but I can open nine apertures. I am indeed awesome!” Ling Han mumbled to himself without the slightest modesty.

After opening nine more apertures, Ling Han immediately realized the importance of Enlightenment Tier.

If the speed at which he absorbed the power of heaven and earth in the Inscription Tier was 10, then after opening nine apertures, this speed became 15, and now it was 20.

With such a comparison, it could be seen how the number of apertures would affect one’s ability to cultivate.

He had only opened 36 apertures, yet he had already broken through. In terms of cultivation speed, how much was the gap between the second and third tiers?

Furthermore, this was an eternal gap.

“There are also Hidden Apertures, so the gap would be even larger.”

Ling Han was even more determined to open the Hidden Apertures. This was not just the matter of increasing his battle prowess by a little bit, but had incredibly far-reaching significance.

“I’ll study the formation again..”
