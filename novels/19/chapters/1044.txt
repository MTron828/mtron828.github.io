Chapter 1045: Bad News

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han decided that they would return after Shui Yanyu successfully endured her heavenly tribulation.

They had already killed enough pirates, and the pirates had all become afraid of their guerilla tactics anyway. Now, all of the pirate ships would have at least one Sun Moon Tier elite guarding them. This deterred Ling Han from attacking them as the gulf in power between those at the Sun Moon Tier and Mountain River Tier was far too great. Just small mistake could get him killed.

Even the Black Tower and Cloud Piercing Shuttle wouldn’t be able to help him much. Moreover, how could he expect fortunate coincidences—like Xi Cheng stabbing his Absolute Beginning Stone—to happen every time?

Shui Yanyu wasn’t Ling Han, and she certainly didn’t possess a freakishly powerful physique like him. Thus, although she passed her heavenly tribulation, it was still fairly difficult, and left many scorches and burns on her body. She looked extremely disheveled and in a very sorry state.

This was already because Ling Han had used the Absolute Beginning Stone to help her. If it weren’t for this, her condition would have been even worse.

However, the benefits that she received far outweighed the difficulties that she suffered.

After reaching the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier, one would possess a lifespan of 200,000 years. This meant that her appearance wouldn’t age for at least another 50,000 to 60,000 years. In other words, her appearance would remain at the golden age of around 20 years old.

To beautiful women like her, this was one of the most valuable things they got out of cultivation.

Moreover, with her talents, and with the help of Ling Han’s pills, perhaps she would be able to reach the high extreme in another several hundred or several thousand years. If that were the case, her beauty would be maintained for another tens of thousands of years.

The happiness she derived from this fact even exceeded the happiness that she derived from gaining more strength. This made Ling Han sigh with emotion. ‘Men and woman have very different mindsets indeed.’ He couldn’t help but check himself out in a mirror. He found that the person who looked back at him looked even younger than 20.

There was nothing he could do about this. The speed of his cultivation was insanely fast in this life, so his appearance was still far from becoming mature.

Ling Han involuntarily sighed, and said, “Sigh... I look too much like a youth.” He had been over 200 years old in his previous life, and although he had still been far from reaching old age, he at least looked like a mature young adult of around 25 to 26 years old.

It wasn’t like now, where he looked so young that he could barely accept it himself.

Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at him, and said, “Are you dissatisfied because I’m too old?”

“Hehe, how are you too old, wife? Your skin is so soft and delicate, and I can’t get enough of it even if I gaze at it hundreds of times a day.” Ling Han had finally learnt some flowery words, though the most important skill he possessed was still his kissing skills. He leaned over and kissed Shui Yanyu until her eyes became hazy and her body became limp.

“Damn pervert! So be it if you kiss me normally, but why do you have to suck on my saliva? That’s filthy!” Shui Yanyu continued to scold him, and said, “And your hands as well! Why do you have to grab my breasts?”

“Oh.” Ling Han nodded, and moved his hands down a little, placing them on her firm bottom.

Shui Yanyu was about to go crazy. ‘Are you doing this on purpose?!’

“Damn pervert!” She slapped a label onto Ling Han’s behavior.

“What an unjust accusation! I’ve got to put my hands somewhere when I kiss you, right? It’s only normal that I put them where I like most.” Ling Han immediately acted as if he had been wrongly accused, and said, “This is my favorite, and this is my second favorite place.”

He pointed at Shui Yanyu’s shapely breasts and bottom, respectively.

Shui Yanyu flushed red with embarrassment, yet she felt a slight sense of pride. She was also extremely happy with her development in these two areas. However, it was a shame that they would end up pleasing that damn pervert more!

The two of them set off for the Imperial Capital.

They weren’t in a hurry to return, and Ling Han would also refine a large number of Heavenly Pearl Pills each day. He would sell them when they got back, and then use the money he made to buy more materials so he could start refining the Level Three Divine Pill—the Jade Heaven Pill.

The higher the level of a pill, the more time was needed to refine a cauldron of it. At the same time, the profit would also increase dramatically. However, although this seemed simple, there weren’t many people who could actually refine higher level pills. Most alchemists were extremely ordinary, and would only be able to refine Level One or Level Two Divine Pills in their entire life.

Thus, there were far more Level One and Level Two Divine Pills, and their prices were also the lowest. Starting from Level Three Divine Pills onwards, the price of each pill would increase significantly.

Right now, Ling Han was merely earning his school fees.

They took half a month to arrive back at the Imperial Capital, and they entered the city gates using their identity token from the Scarlet Heaven Academy. Shui Yanyu returned to the Shui Clan first, but she still needed to return to the academy later to report that she had advanced to the medium extreme. It was time for her to move to the Medium Extreme Division.

In the meantime, Ling Han returned to the academy by himself.

He tried to stay extremely low-key. However, he was famous throughout the Scarlet Heaven Academy, and was even famous throughout the entire Imperial Capital. So, how could he remain low-key? Numerous people came to visit him the very next day.

For example, the delicate and princess-like Li Weiwei came, and his good friends in Lin You and Ma Xing also came. There were also those who dreamed of becoming famous through one battle, and came to challenge him to a duel.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Challenge me to a duel? No problem! I’ll go if they can pay a fight fee of 8000-9000.”

Some of the challengers were unhappy about this, and grumbled, “Wasn’t it only 10 True Origin Stone before? This is absolute bullsh*t. How can the price suddenly inflate by so much?”

“I wasn’t this famous before, so my appearance fee was naturally lower. However, the situation is completely different now. If I weren’t this famous, you guys wouldn’t be lining up to challenge me, either, am I correct? If you can’t afford it, then go away and stop annoying me. Otherwise, prepare 10,000 True Origin Stones and line up to register your challenge.” Ling Han turned to the Asura Demon Emperor, and said, “Little Asura, help me record their details.”

“Woof!” The Asura Demon Emperor was in a puppet wolf’s body right now, so he obediently barked in reply. What was dignity? Could dignity fill one’s belly?

The challengers were all seething with anger. Some people even rushed over and tried to use force, yet they were all easily suppressed by the Asura Demon Emperor. He had a battle prowess at the late stage of the consummate level, so there weren’t many students in the academy who could defeat him in a fight.

“Stupid blockhead, you left for so many days! Do you still remember me, your master?” Li Weiwei was extremely tsunderish. She crossed her arms before her chest, which she was trying very hard to push out.

It was a shame that she was fairly flat-chested. Although she tried very hard to emphasize her chest, there was only a very small effect.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Congratulations on reaching the Mountain River Tier!”

Li Weiwei instantly became happy upon hearing this, and said, “That’s right, I’ve already refined all of the Mountain River Stones and reached the middle stage of the low extreme!” However, her mood immediately fell again, and she said, “It’s a shame that I still haven’t been able to comprehend the true secrets of the Mountain River Tier yet.”

“Don’t beat yourself over it,” Ling Han consoled. “There’s still quite a while before you reach the peak stage of the low extreme, so you can take your time to comprehend it. Anyhow, you’re already at the Mountain River Tier, so it should be much easier to work back on your comprehensions.”

Li Weiwei shot him a glare, and said, “So what you’re trying to say is that I’m stupid for still not being able to comprehend it?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ling Han was rendered speechless. ‘If you truly want to twist my words like that, there’s really nothing more I can say.’

If it were Shui Yanyu, he would still try to coax her a little. However, he had no intention of furthering his relationship with Li Weiwei, so he naturally had to remain a little more distant. He had absolutely no intention of flirting with this princess-like woman.

“That’s right!” Li Weiwei’s expression suddenly became serious, and she said, “I’ve got some bad news for you. Zhao Lun has broken through to the Sun Moon Tier!”

“So fast?!” Ling Han was slightly surprised. Even for a prodigy like Zhao Lun, advancing one minor level still required at least several dozen years of cultivation. As such, it would be even harder to advance one major tier.

‘How did he break through to the Sun Moon Tier so soon?

‘This is extremely abnormal.’

Li Weiwei clicked her tongue, and said, “I heard Father say that Great General Zhao obtained some kind of Supreme Divine Pill after risking his life and entering an ancient ruin. Great General Zhao was severely wounded as a result, and even our great empress was alarmed.”

Ling Han stroked his chin in thought. This was indeed very bad news.
