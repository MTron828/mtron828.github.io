Chapter 851: Demon Servants

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They came so quickly!

Hong, long, long , chaotic heavy footsteps sounded within the gorge. Judging from this point alone, it was a motley crew.

Ling Han and the others immediately came out of their tents, and looked towards the gorge. Hundreds of humanoid beings could be seen at the forefront, but their entire bodies was enveloped in a black current, and their countenance couldn’t be seen at all—even their height and sex were indistinguishable.

Behind them was a dense crowd of people, who clearly used to be normal people, but were now bound by black demonic Qi, making their appearance terrifying. They were emitting an intense atmosphere of blood lust.

“They were converted into the underworld’s low-level demon servants.” Yi Shuang Shuang started to talk. “Somewhat similar to Corpse Soldiers, unaware of pain, and unafraid of death, but their physiques are far inferior. However, they still maintain considerable intelligence, and aren’t necessarily easier to kill compared to Corpse Soldiers of the same level.”

“Then what about those people in front?” Ling Han asked.

Yi Shuang Shuang nodded, and said, “They can be counted as high-level demon servants.”

“Shattering Void Tier ones are only high-level demon servants?” Ling Han was shocked.

Yi Shuang Shuang rolled her eyes at him, and said, “The divine beings are divided into five levels, and every large level is subdivided into four small levels; even small levels are almost insurmountable, equivalent to twenty levels. These guys haven’t even advanced to the divine level, could they even be called demon generals or demon kings?”

... That made sense.

Judging from the level of the vast lands, these high-level demon servants were already peak stage existences, but in the underworld, they weren’t even close to the edge of being an expert.

“Resisting against the underworld is every divine being’s responsibility, and this lady is no exception!” Yi Shuang Shuang’s expression was stern. “Today, this lady will fight alongside you, these demon servants must be eliminated!”

“Hahahaha, I didn’t come late, did I?” With a laughter, a lonely man with a lanky figure descended from the sky, holding a wine gourd in hand, stubble all over his face. He looked extremely old.

“Big Brother!” Ling Han was pleasantly surprised, and immediately went to greet him.

It was Feng Po Yun!

They hadn’t seen each other for a few years, and Feng Po Yun had already advanced from Shattering Void Tier third layer to the fifth layer. Such an improvement was truly great. Presumably, it should be because he cultivated out Sword Heart Illumination, which could cut the demons within his heart, so his improvement in tier became relatively easier.

This was definitely a helping hand. Although Feng Po Yun hadn’t reached Shattering Void Tier’s ninth layer, Sword Heart Illumination should have extremely great destructive power towards these demons.

“Younger Brother, long time no see. Your cultivation’s improvement speed truly astonishes me!” Feng Po Yun laughed loudly. At the time they met, Ling Han was only at the Flower Blossom Tier, and now, he was about to cross into the Shattering Void Tier.

“Big Brother, you can come under my empire temporarily, and I’ll bestow you with the title of a king, allowing you to utilize the power of the nation to improve battle prowess,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Okay!” Feng Po Yun agreed with a smile.

Originally, with his tier and status, he obviously wouldn’t deign join under someone as some king, but to resist against the underworld’s invasion now, he was obviously able to distinguish which was the the more important between the great cause and his reputation.

Besides, it wasn’t anything bad to work for his younger brother.

Ling Han actuated the totem, and said, “This Emperor now bestow’s Big Brother Feng Po Yun with the title of this court’s ‘Feng Yun King,’ and hereby proclaims it to the nation!”

Hong , the totem instantly operated, transmitting this appointment to every corner of Great Ling Empire immediately. Above the imperial city, a golden name was added onto the black tower totem’s body.

“Feng Yun King, Feng Po Yun!”

This represented Great Ling Empire’s official conferment; he could accept the mental power of millions of subjects through the totem and operate the power of the nation.

Now, Great Ling Empire had a total of three kings—the Rain Emperor, Mu Rong Qing, and Feng Poyun, who was just conferred his title.

Feng Poyun immediately operated the power of the nation, and couldn’t help but be pleasantly surprised. He said, “My power actually increased to the level of Shattering Void Tier eleven stars! Unfortunately, my physique isn’t tough enough, or else it could still increase a little bit more.”

Under the blessing of the power of the nation, his power increased by four stars, but the increase of his actual battle prowess should be more than that.

“Brat, give this lady the title of a king,” Yi Shuang Shuang said. Although she was a divine being, suppressed by the realm’s power, and her tier dropped straight to the Shattering Void Tier’s ninth layer, it didn’t mean that her power couldn’t reach Shattering Void Tier twenty stars.

Thus, the power of the nation would also have an addition effect on her.

Ling Han nodded, and conferred Yi Shuang Shuang the title “Wu Shuang King” through the totem.

“This lady’s battle prowess only increased by three stars?” Yi Shuang Shuang couldn’t help but be gloomy.

It couldn’t be helped. The stronger one’s strength, the weaker the power of the nation’s blessing. ... Unless she was the country’s master, who could receive infinite power blessing—so long as the body could withstand it and the mental power of the subjects was strong enough.

“However, it’s still enough to suppress that alluring woman!”

The alluring woman obviously meant the Lunar King, whom she constantly had in mind. It was obvious just how great of a shock Lunar King’s charm brought her at the time.

“Human, hurry up and surrender, This King can grant you guys eternal life!” In the gorge on the opposite side, those high-level demon servants already walked out. A hundred Shattering Void Tier elites stood there, emitting terrifying presence, even seeming to shake down the firmament.

“A mere demon servant dares to boast shamelessly!” Ling Han sneered.

“Outrageous, how dare you speak to This King in this way!” a high-level demon servant whose figure was the tallest shouted, raising his hand and spreading out a silver ray of light, which immediately enlarged infinitely, turning into a great silver spider the size of a mountain.

This great spider moved its eight legs that were like heavenly axes, and looked down at all living creatures with a contemptuous look.

Reaching the tier it was at, changing its own body was obviously a piece of cake.

“Kill!” That high-level demon servant that claimed itself to be the king pointed at Ling Han. The great silver spider immediately sprung with its eight feet, and charged towards Ling Han.

“Haha, I’ll be your opponent!” Feng Po Yun laughed loudly, brandishing his sword and charging out. The fact that his tier could increase so fast also had to do with this great spider, which was continuously impelling him to get stronger.

Now, with the blessing of the power of the nation, Feng Po Yun was obviously going to vigorously fight a great battle.

Peng!

The two elites exchanged blows, and instantly fought from the ground to the sky—their fight was extremely intense.

Ling Han took a glance, and discovered that Feng Po Yun’s current battle prowess wasn’t inferior to the great silver spider’s, instantly feeling relieved. He said indifferently, “I am Great Ling Empire’s Emperor Ling Han, who are you people? State your names!”

The king of demon servants sneered. “A mere Heaven Tier warrior dares to claim kingship, what a gargantuan joke! This King already abandoned his previous name. You people can call this king... Demon King San Mi!

Yi Shuang Shuang couldn’t help but burst into laughter, and said, “A mere demon servant dares to claim to be a demon king? How shameless do you have to be? Come, come, come, fight this lady three hundred rounds and see if this lady won’t tear apart your thick face!”

“Are you seeking your own death?” The king of demon servants sneered, reaching out its hand to snatch Yi Shuang Shuang.

“This lady isn’t wanton, don’t touch her with your dirty hand!” Yi Shuang Shuang swatted with her hand, and the hand of the king of demon servants was instantly sent flying.

The king of demon servants smiled grimly, waved its large hand bound by Demonic Qi, and said, “Kill them all!”

The large army instantly charged towards Great Ling Empire’s troops.
