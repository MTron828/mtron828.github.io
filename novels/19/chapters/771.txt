Chapter 772: Interception

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The barrier wall was invisible, and it was just like air if it wasn’t touched, so Ling Han’s eyesight obviously wasn’t affected.

Xu Xiu Ran, Dong Ling’er, Jia Ming, the five great sects’ younger generation of geniuses who were almost qualified to rival the strongest ones of the current age. The other party had a total of five people, standing alongside each other equally, and what did this show?

Those two that weren’t recognized by him were definitely Small Sword Emperor, Zhang Mo, and the Son of Lightning.

These two people were easy to recognize. Small Sword Emperor carried an unadorned long sword on his back and the Son of Lightning was bound by cyan lightning, and as his gaze swept by, it was like a thunderbolt, extremely terrifying.

Although the Son of Lightning was more renowned, Ling Han was more interested in Small Sword Emperor, who was rumored to have formed Sword Heart. Despite being separated by the region barrier, Ling Han could still feel that intense sword intent on Small Sword Emperor as if even the region barrier could be torn open.

Ling Han suddenly came to a realization. No wonder the west region could unite so quickly—it was the five great sects’ handiwork.

“Ling Han, you really are daring to the extreme, establishing a nation!” Xu Xiu Ran said coldly. He held the Absolute Saber in hand, his eyes each had a saber shape, and his presence and spirit were reserved, seeming a lot more powerful.

Ling Han said indifferently, “If I don’t establish a nation, how could we escape from the murderous scheme of the five sects?” He now openly stood against the five great sects, and obviously had no more qualms.

“Crazy ravings!” Dong Ling’er reproved. She was beautiful and striking, not inferior to Azure Phoenix Divine Empress. She wore a long dress, her skin was white like snow, and her features were as pretty as a painting—she was unmatched in beauty.

“Those aren’t ravings, you guys clearly know in your hearts!” Ling Han snorted.

JIa Ming took one step forward, and said, “I knew long ago that you’d definitely choose the west region pushovers, so the five of us kept watch here. Don’t you think about advancing the slightest bit further. Might as well tell you, the east region is immediately dispatching soldiers to attack the north region to seize your home!”

As the west region’s powerful figures listened, they couldn’t help but reveal an annoyed look—they were calling them pushovers! They didn’t dare to say anything, because the five great sects were too strong, and the five people here represented the strongest battle power amongst the younger generation—even they could only bow to them.

Ling Han was calm and unhurried. The imperial city had Yi Shuang Shuang keeping watch, so nothing would go wrong. Moreover, as long as they didn’t establish a nation, it didn’t matter that east region attacked, for they could only take the territory and not rob him of the power of the nation—wouldn’t it be fine to just reclaim it in the future?

He said, “Why’s there only the five of you? Did the experts of the five great sects all die?”

JIa Ming couldn’t help but snort, and said, “With the five of us together, is there anyone below the Shattering Void Tier that can’t be killed?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “The five great sects probably can’t draw out Shattering Void Tier elites. I suppose Purple Moon Emperor Court’s eight kings have all come into the world, restraining all your Shattering Void Tier warriors.”

The expressions of the five changed. It was just like Ling Han said, Purple Moon Emperor’s Court was now extremely powerful, and although there were only eight Shattering Void Tier elites in the latter’s ranks, each one was at the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier and harnessed the power of laws, so one of them was easily capable of going against more than ten opponents on similar level.

Even though the five great sects were forced to awaken every single ancient almighty in advance, a hundred Shattering Void Tier elites still weren’t enough to slow down the pace of advancement of the eight kings. Now that Purple Moon Emperor’s Court’s territory was becoming larger and larger and they gained more subjects, as a king’s court, the more terrifying the blessing of the power of the nation they had become. It was tantamount to nourishing their strength through fighting, and now the eight kings were truly powerful to the point of being unstoppable.

Otherwise, drawing out any Shattering Void Tier elite to suppress the so-called Great Ling Empire would be no effort at all.

“Hmph, you can hardly fend for yourself, and you still have the leisure to be concerned about others?” the Son of Lightning said. Thunder was drawn the moment he spoke, turning into a sea of dark clouds rolling in the sky intertwined with azure lightning.

Ling Han unleashed the Revere Life Sword, and said, “Alright, the squabble is over, let’s cross swords!”

He pushed open the barrier wall.

“Kill!” Great Ling Empire’s elite army yelled.

Peng, peng, peng, the Rock Spirit was the first to charge out. Hu Niu rode on its shoulders, looking like she couldn’t contain her excitement. Inside her heart hid a fierce tiger that thirsted for slaughter and blood, and the scene of such a great battle was most suited for her.

The little girl flashed and turned into lightning, peng, peng, peng , and the west region’s army immediately suffered great casualties.

Her battle prowess shockingly reached the Heaven Tier, which was obviously equal to being invincible in the west region, where the Deity Transformation Tier was the apex. The little girl bathed in blood and had already become a demon, with her eyes shooting out lightning; with the sweep of a glance, a large field of elites were immediately turned into ashes.

The Son of Lightning couldn’t help but be greatly intrigued, and said, “I’ll handle her!” He also turned into lightning and charged towards Hu Niu. As he glared with his eyes, two exceptional treasured swords rushed out and slashed towards Hu Niu.

“Niu’s wind and fire fist!” Hu Niu roared, and carried out a fierce battle with the Son of Lightning.

Ling Han only needed to let the Spiritual Infant Tier elites pass through since the others wouldn’t be affected by the region barrier. He held the Revere Life Sword in hand, and said, “You four attack together!”

In reality, no one could block these four except for him.

Xu Xiu Ran smiled sarcastically, and said, “Against you, do the four of us need to join hands?” He didn’t awaken the Absolute Saber, because once the Absolute Saber was awoken, the sword in Ling Han’s hand would definitely also wake up, and no one would be able to kill Ling Han then.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “So much self-confidence... then I’ll speak no more. Bring it on!”

Xu Xiu Ran swung his saber as he charged over. He didn’t awaken the Absolute Saber, but the saber was still all-conquering; with the slash of the saber, even Ling Han’s physique couldn’t completely withstand it. This saber’s sharpness had already surpassed the level of tenth-tier Spirit Tools.

Weng , a strange feeling shrouded Ling Han, making him feel unable to swing his sword.

Saber Heart!

Ling Han was deeply moved inside. He and Xu Xiu Ran came to grips a total of two times. The first time was the clash of strength, but Xu Xiu Ran’s grasp of the Saber Heart definitely wasn’t this strong; at least, it couldn’t influence him... The second time didn’t count, since it was simply the clash between the Absolute Saber and the Revere Life Sword, and Saber Heart wasn’t of any use at all.

But this time, Xu Xiu Ran’s grasp of the Saber Heart improved even more, and could even affect him.

Ling Han adhered strictly to his heart and operated the Revere Life Sword with his left hand, slashing towards Xu Xiu Ran.

Ding, ding, ding, the two of them exchanged blows, releasing ceaseless rays of light.

Xu Xiu Ran became stronger again, not only having initial mastery of Saber Heart, but also having improved greatly in all aspects—his was definitely a high-level Heaven Tier’s battle prowess!

Ling Han was unafraid, executing the Desolate Hell Sword with the Revere Life Sword in the right hand 1 while operating the Earth Overturning Seal with the left hand, spreading out golden light. This could also pose a great threat to Xu Xiu Ran, who, after all, wasn’t a physical cultivator. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, Ling Han was still no match for him. Xu Xiu Ran already crossed into the Heaven Tier—this guy who could cultivate casually and view bottlenecks as nonexistent was kickass as expected, improving surprisingly fast.

He was only in the first layer of the Heaven Tier, but his battle prowess reached Heaven Tier ten stars, crossing nine stars of battle prowess—too terrifying.

It was only a few dozen moves before Ling Han’s body had many wounds, but compared to his physique’s toughness and recovery ability, it was no big deal, looking like he was hurt, but was not really.

At this moment, Ling Han, however, felt chills all over his body, sensing a great imminent danger.
