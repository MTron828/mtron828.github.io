Chapter 2350: Divine Desolate Mountain

Because Ling Han said he would go with Huai Jian to Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, Yuan and Qi Shuang naturally had no further right to refuse him, and could only send Ling Han on his way with eyes filled with envy.

But what made them even depressed was the fact that even the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou ran off with him.

Two of them were Monarch Stars, and would be able to gain further honor for Hundred Battles Academy in future.

Yet did they dare to contend with a Heavenly Venerate over them?

Ling Han and his group set out. Huai Jian naturally knew the way, and led their group.

On their journey, they used Transfer Formations to cover the distance. Wally still took the form of an ornament hanging from the corner of Ling Han’s robes. He had also used the Heaven Deceiving Technique, his skill of concealing himself having improved greatly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

About seven years passed, and they finally arrived at their destination.

This was an incredibly majestic great mountain, so tall that one could only look up at it. There were clouds of various colors entwined around the mountain, exuding a boundless air of majesty and austerity, and making others only want to fall to their knees in worship. It was like there was a Heavenly Venerate seated there.

This was Divine Desolate Mountain, and also the place of enlightenment of that Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity.

Heavenly Venerates varied in their personalities. Some Heavenly Venerates kept an incredibly low profile; it was not even impossible that no one knew that they existed. Some Heavenly Venerates kept a very high profile, and their reputation spread far and wide, intimidating the rest of the world.

Not only did this Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity keep a high profile, he was also very fond of accepting disciples. He had more than 30 disciples under his name, but it was like there was a curse. The Heavenly Venerate could not give rise to another Heavenly Venerate through his teachings.

Every Heavenly Venerate in history had walked the path of the strongest with their own power, and for those disciples of Heavenly Venerates, their highest accomplishment would only be limited to Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King, though it was possible that they would be incredibly strong and very close to the height of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Of course, prodigies would never admit defeat.

Take Huai Jian, for example. His goal was definitely to become a Heavenly Venerate, yet why would he then take the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity as a master?

Because he was confident that he could break the curse!

Actually, every single Monarch Star had that kind of confidence, but there had ultimately been none that could break this curse. They only increased the weight of this curse further and further.

Ling Han naturally did not believe it, either. Otherwise, why would he have come?

Only one thing was clear, and that was that attaining Heavenly Venerable Tier was really, really difficult.

They ascended the mountain. Ling Han and his group had long since learned the newly modified Heaven Deceiving Technique. According to Wally, not even a Heavenly Venerate could possibly see through it. Meanwhile, Little Terror had not grown at all in these years, still looking dumbly cute.

However, its battle prowess had increased considerably. Now, it was mere child’s play for it to chew through Seven Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal, and faced with Eight Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal, it could still manage to create a mark.

The moment they entered the mountainous area, they had lost all sense of direction. They felt like they were surrounded by fog everywhere, and could not even see the fingers on their own hands. Not only was it sight, even their hearing and divine sense had been sealed altogether.

Huai Jian took out a small pendant, but the moment he took it out, it expelled the fog, and they could now see in a limited range of at least 30 meters.

“This is the token bestowed by Lord Desolate Eternity,” he explained to Ling Han and the others.

“Hmm?”

Thye were just about to set out when they all stopped, and Little Terror, who was in Bewitching Maiden Rou’s arms, bared its teeth, exposing its ferocious nature.

“I am Huai Jian, and have come to pay a visit by the command of Lord Desolate Eternity!” Huai Jian cupped his fists in greeting.

“So you are Huai Jian.” A voice rang out from ahead of them, but they could not see the speaker. The other was more than 30 meters away from them.

“Though Master has plans to take you as a disciple, why have you brought a group of people that have no business here?” that person continued, carrying an overbearing tone.

Huai Jian replied, “This man’s name is Ba, and he is the first place holder of the Elite Leaderboard of the Thousand Academy Tournament this time. He is astonishingly talented in cultivation. I know Lord Desolate Eternity is most fond of nurturing the especially talented members of the younger generation, and have thus deliberately brought him here for Lord Desolate Eternity to take a look.”

“First place of the Elite Leaderboard?” The person on the opposing side released a scoff. “A tournament that we, the heirs of a Heavenly Venerate, have not taken part in is nothing but child’s play, and you actually have the face to make such a declaration?”

He paused, and continued, “Huai Jian, don’t think that you can forget yourself just because Master has taken notice of you. It should be known that you will only be one of the 37 disciples that Master has taken.

“Moreover, you are not a disciple yet!”

Huai Jian couldn’t help but look furious, and said, “Whether Lord Desolate Eternity wishes to take Ba as a disciple or not is naturally to be decided by Lord Desolate Eternity. Is there any need for you to make the decision here?”

“How dare you!!” The person on the other side finally showed himself. This was a youth of the Demon Race. He had four horns on his head, which just happened to point in the four directions of north, south, east, and west. They were more than a foot long, which was extremely interesting.

Hu Niu couldn’t help but set her eyes on his horns, clicking her tongue in amazement as she continued staring.

That member of the Demon Race was displeased by her gaze, and couldn’t help but shout, “What are you looking at?”

“Looking at how ugly you are!” Hu Niu exclaimed.

‘F*ck!’

Killing intent immediately appeared on that demon’s face. With a wave of his right hand, a battle spear six meters long appeared in his grasp. Wielding the battle spear, he stabbed it right at Hu Niu without a second word.

This spear strike was fast, accurate, and ruthless, bearing terrifying killing intent and might, which was enough to kill any ordinary Ninth Lotus elite.

Because he was a Ninth Lotus First Leaf Monarch Star, he had the battle prowess of the peak stage of a Ninth Lotus Second Leaf.

Hu Niu had not even moved when Little Terror released a roar, and darted out of Bewitching Maiden Rou’s arms, biting out at that battle spear.

This was its mistress, and now that someone had made a move to attack her, it, as a loyal “dog,” naturally had to charge out in the lead.

…Now that it was on the topic, this mistress kept drooling as she stared at it. It actually did not very much want to leap out, but who asked it to be so loyal?

With a clamp, Little Terror bit the battle spear, and was not letting go.

Dumbfounded, the demon on the other side couldn’t help but watch with shock.

He was a Monarch Star, a Ninth Lotus First Leaf Monarch Star, and those that could suppress him, aside from Ancestral Kings, would only have to be someone with battle prowess on the level of the Ninth Lotus Third Leaf. But no matter how he looked at it, this newly born battle cub could not possibly be that kind of existence.

However, his battle spear had fallen into the mouth of this little beast that looked so incredibly cute, and it was like it had grown roots. It could not be moved in the slightest, and no matter how hard or strongly he pulled, it was still useless.

Hiss, this little beast’s power was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Little Terror showed its might. With a crack, it forcefully ripped through the battle spear.

That demon took several steps back, his face filled with shock. It should be known that this battle spear was Seven Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal, practically close to the toughness he had when he was on full-power defense, but Little Terror had still forcefully bitten through it. Just how unbelievable was that?

Even if Little Terror had the upper hand, it had no plans to spare the opponent. It pounced one more, and launched a powerful offensive at that demon.

The demon hurriedly parried, but because of his wariness of the sharpness of Little Terror’s fangs, he actually did not dare to parry head-on, and could only continuously retreat as he battled.

Huai Jian couldn’t help but feel shocked. That demon was a Ninth Lotus First Leaf, just like him. Though he was a supreme monarch star, and the demon might not be, the latter had cultivated a much longer time on the level of Ninth Lotus than Huai Jian had. Thus, the battle prowess of the two of them was actually more or less the same.

In other words, if it had been him, it would probably have been the same result.

So this was that Battle Beast egg?

Even if Huai Jian had always believed firmly in his own strength, he couldn’t help but show a sliver of envy. Originally, it had been prepared for him, yet now it had become Ling Han’s Battle Pet.

This thought merely flashed past in his mind before disappearing. He was filled with confidence in himself once more. As long as he erased the Dao injury in his body, a great boost would take place in his battle prowess, and he would definitely be capable of suppressing Ling Han.
