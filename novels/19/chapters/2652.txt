2653 Desolate Moon’s True Identity

“Aaah!” Xiao Yingxiong roared in rage, with all of his veins bulging and his black hair billowing into the sky. He could already channel the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, which caused his battle prowess to become petrifying.

However, how could a complete Heavenly Venerate Technique be used for an extended period of time?

Even as powerful as the Imperial Void Celestial King was, he could only activate the Dragon Fish Technique for a limited amount of time. Meanwhile, Xiao Yingxiong wasn’t even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so he naturally couldn’t activate the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll for very long. Moreover, it took a huge toll on his body.

Pa, pa, pa!

Some of his veins directly exploded, drenching him in blood. However, this blood transformed into numerous symbols that aided him, causing his battle prowess to increase even further.

Boom!

His Celestial Spear was like a divine dragon as its murderous aura soared into the sky.

At this moment, Xiao Yingxiong was unbelievably powerful, turning the tables and suppressing Ling Han instead.

This was a complete Heavenly Venerate Technique, so unless Ling Han also activated a complete Heavenly Venerate Technique, how could he possibly rival it?

Ling Han’s gaze was intense as he mulled over whether he should activate the Five Elements Lightning Technique. However, if he used it against Xiao Yingxiong, how would he deal with Desolate Moon afterward?

Even though Desolate Moon hadn’t revealed his power yet, Ling Han was certain that the former was incredibly powerful.

Moreover, if Desolate Moon woke all of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings here, Ling Han would have no option but to flee. Only with the Five Elements Lightning Technique would he be confident that he could carve out a bloody path.

However, Xiao Yingxiong wouldn’t consider so much. Right now, there was a black gleam expanding in his eyes. Eventually, it filled his entire eyes.

It was as if he had lost his mind and become nothing more than a tool of slaughter.

Sure enough, this black energy looked like it could increase one’s battle prowess, but it was instead a poisonous pill. Right now, Xiao Yingxiong was tasting the bitter results.

At this moment, was Xiao Yingxiong still himself?

Pa, pa, pa!

Xiao Yingxiong’s skin continued to crack and explode. Even so, he continued to channel the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. However, Heavenly Venerate Techniques couldn’t be channeled forever, or else one would definitely have to pay a huge price.

Right now, Xiao Yingxiong was using a self-harming method to maintain the circulation of this Heavenly Venerate Technique. What he received in return was overwhelming power.

Ling Han had no option but to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. He was still reluctant to use the Five Elements Lightning Technique.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

His body was covered in golden symbols, which caused his defenses to improve exponentially, and allowed him to face Xiao Yingxiong’s attacks without being injured. However, Ling Han could only channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll for around two hours. What would he do after this?

Desolate Moon laughed as he watched on. He was like a passer-by enjoying the show.

Pa!

One of Xiao Yingxiong’s fingers directly exploded into pieces. However, his blood transformed, allowing him to continue channeling the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. At the same time, a wisp of black energy rose from his severed finger, replacing it and making it seem as if the finger had never disappeared in the first place.

Pa!

Before long, another finger burst apart, and was replaced by another wisp of black energy.

Then the third, the fourth… When all 10 of his fingers disappeared, his toes started to explode as well. Then it was his other bones. With each bone that exploded, a wisp of black energy would replace it. This allowed him to maintain human form. It also allowed him to continue channeling the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.

Two hours quickly passed, and Ling Han was unable to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll any longer. The golden symbols on his body started to flash and dim. Meanwhile, apart from the head, Xiao Yingxiong’s entire body had already been replaced with wisps of black energy.

Desolate Moon sighed, saying, “If you continue, you’ll truly become a cripple. Forget about it. Move aside.”

He finished speaking, yet Xiao Yingxiong didn’t obey his command. Instead, he continued to battle.

“Huh?” Desolate Moon was slightly astonished. Even he found this strange.

Boom!

Xiao Yingxiong suddenly unleashed a powerful aura, furiously turning his spear around and thrusting it at Desolate Moon.

This clearly caught Desolate Moon by surprise, and he faltered for a moment before reacting. However, could one falter during a battle between Celestial Kings?

Pu!

The spear pierced through his cloak and exited through the other end.

“Don’t even… dream of… controlling me, Xiao Yingxiong! ” Xiao Yingxiong bellowed in rage. The black in his eyes dissipated as he said this.

Ling Han was also given a start. He hadn’t imagined that Xiao Yingxiong would regain his consciousness at the last moment, also giving Desolate Moon a fatal blow.

It had to be said that Xiao Yingxiong was indeed a supreme monarch star. He was indeed a big shot from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

“Damn it!” Desolate Moon roared in rage.

Peng!

He waved a hand and struck Xiao Yingxiong’s chest. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Peng!

Xiao Yingxiong immediately exploded. Right now, apart from his head, his entire body was formed from black energy. Meanwhile, this black energy was controlled by Desolate Moon, so Desolate Moon was naturally able to shatter it with ease.

Xiao Yingxiong wore an expression of puzzlement. After being struck by his spear, not only had this person not died, but even their battle prowess was completely unaffected?

Whoosh!

He immediately reacted, swinging upward with his spear and instantly knocking back Desolate Moon’s cloak.

‘Huh!’

His expression was as if he had seen a ghost. Ling Han also wore an identical expression. This was because Desolate Moon’s appearance was far too terrifying.

Was this really a human?

Even though he had a nose and eyes, his face was covered in black tentacles. These tentacles weren’t physical matter, but instead were formed with the black energy.

Peng!

Xiao Yingxiong was sent flying, with the black energy immediately receding. All that remained was his lone head.

“Damn it, you actually exposed my true appearance!” Desolate Moon shouted in incandescent rage. The black tentacles on his face billowed, appearing sinister yet repulsive.

Xiao Yingxiong’s head hovered in the air. At his level, as long as his mind wasn’t obliterated, he wouldn’t be killed. Thus, he could still activate some techniques. He was astounded as he gazed at Desolate Moon, and he exclaimed, “You’re Chang Huayun!”

Desolate Moon looked at Xiao Yingxiong, and said in a baleful voice, “Who knew that a junior would actually recognize me?”

“Didn’t you die in the Realm Battlefield long ago?” Xiao Yingxiong asked, unable to conceal his astonishment. After all, anyone would feel torrential waves in their mind after seeing a person of the legends who was already rumored to be dead. Moreover, this person had now become so strange in appearance.

“Indeed, the Chang Huayun of the past has already died in the Realm Battlefield. Now… I am Desolate Moon!” Desolate Moon said. Killing intent flooded his face. This was an expression of disdain and disgust for everyone in the world.

“According to rumors, you only fell into the trap because you were set up by your fellow sect members…” Xiao Yingxiong murmured. His voice became softer and softer.

Ling Han took over, saying, “You didn’t die, but you instead surrendered to Hysteria!” He finally understood why this black energy gave him a sense of familiarity. This was because they were far too similar to Hysteria’s tentacles.

Chang Huayun had fallen into Hysteria’s trap, yet Hysteria hadn’t killed him. Instead, Hysteria had reformed Chang Huayun and taken advantage of his fury with being betrayed to successfully take him in as a subordinate.

Now, Chang Huayun had entered the Celestial King Graveyard with a mission. However, what was this mission?

Ling Han looked at the giant eggs in the surroundings, each of which held a Ninth Heaven Celestial King who was enveloped in black energy. In other words, they were all being affected and controlled by Hysteria. Once they left the Celestial King Graveyard, just how much chaos and destruction would they cause?

The strength of a dimension was in large part determined by the population that it housed. It wasn’t limited to the number of top-notch elites.

After massacring a dimension, these Celestial Kings would definitely weaken the overall strength of the Flaming Frost Realm by a significant amount. At that time, Hysteria would naturally draw another step closer to engulfing this entire dimension.

“Gasp!” Xiao Yingxiong also realized this, with his face becoming as white as a sheet. This was even though only his head remained.
