Chapter 1229: Level Eight!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Lin Yuqi looked around the room, and those present all remained silent.

This woman had a lofty status, so no one dared to talk back to her. It was frightening to even take an extra glance at her—this wasn’t because she was ugly, but rather because she was too seductive and beautiful. They were afraid that they wouldn’t be able to control themselves.

If they lost control, they would die before they even knew it.

“Milady, our business has fallen by at least 20%. The Han Lin Pavilion has stolen these customers,” a protection officer said.

Lin Yuqi, who was resting lazily on a chair, said, “It’s already been so many days. Haven’t you people devised a solution yet?”

“Milady, we lost all of the high-level alchemy matches, and as a result, many customers lost confidence in us. If we want to turn the tables, we must defeat the Han Lin Pavilion in alchemy,” an old alchemist said.

Although alchemists enjoyed a transcendent standing, how could beings of this world break free from the lure of fame and riches?

Lin Yuqi had a powerful background, and thus even the alchemists treated her with utmost respect.

Lin Yuqi waved her hand, and said, “Enough with the nonsense! Where’s my solution?” She appeared especially annoyed.

“There are two solutions,” the old alchemist said. He paused for a moment before continuing, “Number one: the Han Lin Pavilion is completely reliant on the alchemist called Ling Han. If we can convince him to join us, the Han Lin Pavilion will naturally be put back in their place.”

Lin Yuqi nodded, and asked, “What about the second solution?”

“That Ling Han claims to be a Level Seven alchemist. If we can enlist the help of a Level Eight alchemist to have a match with him, we’ll definitely achieve victory, regardless of whether they refine Level Seven Divine Pills or Level Eight Divine Pills.

“However, we don’t have Level Eight alchemists permanently stationed at our pavilion. Even if we immediately ask for help now, it’ll still take them two to three months to reach our city. If they get delayed, it might take even longer.”

Ling Yuqi pondered for a moment before saying, “We’ll try both solutions at once. We’ll persuade Ling Han to join us first, and if he obediently accepts, that will naturally be the best. However, if he isn’t willing to join, we’ll have no choice but to suppress him.”

“Understood!” the old alchemist said with a nod.

Lin Yuqi hesitated for a moment, and then said, “It seems like that Ling Han is fairly skilled in alchemy. So, there’s no harm in promising him more benefits. Mm-hm, treat him as if he’s a Level Eight alchemist.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Understood!”

The old alchemist nodded in understanding. He believed that Ling Han would definitely accept their offer... unless he was retarded.

However, much to his disbelief, he was shooed away by Ling Han’s two followers before he even got to see Ling Han. He reported this to Lin Yuqi, and the seductive beauty naturally became infuriated. She demanded that they get a Level Eight alchemist over as soon as possible. She was going to crush Ling Han once and for all.

Unfortunately for them, the Level Eight alchemist was in seclusion at this moment. He had apparently obtained an ancient pill recipe, and he had placed all of his attention on studying it. Thus, he couldn’t come to the Big Trade City any time soon. The Treasure Forest Pavilion couldn’t do anything about this, and they could only sit by idly as they watched the Han Lin Pavilion grow.

However, that alchemist would definitely come out from seclusion in half a year at most, regardless of whether he mastered the pill recipe or not. After all, he had to take a breather from time to time. When that time came, someone would naturally tell him the news, and request that he come over to defeat Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Ling Han had also entered seclusion to study the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

This kind of pill had been called the “saintly pill of the Sun Moon Tier” during ancient times. Not only did it have astonishing effects, but it was also tremendously hard to refine. Extracting the divine patterns from medicine and intertwining them together was almost as difficult as refining lower-grade Level Nine Divine Pills.

Half a year passed, and Ling Han finally managed to understand all of the steps and procedures.

Now, it was time to put everything into practice.

Ling Han’s heart throbbed slightly. This was because he definitely wouldn’t succeed in one go. However, each failure would mean wasting one Red Rain Divine King Fruit. This represented the loss of one sub-minor level of the Sun Moon Tier.

However, it would be an even bigger waste if he didn’t attempt to refine the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. As valuable as the Red Rain Divine King Fruits were, they only represented wealth, not power.

He began his attempts.

Failure! Failure! Failure! Failure!

Level Eight Divine Pills were indeed very difficult to refine. Even though Ling Han already understood all of the steps and procedures, as well as the intertwining of the divine patterns—he had comprehended these under the Reincarnation Tree, which meant that he had spent over 100 years familiarizing himself with these—he still made mistakes when he refined the pills in real life.

Understanding and putting to practice were two very different concepts.

Ling Han’s heart throbbed. The Red Rain Divine King Fruits continued to decrease, going from an initial 129 to the current 87. This revealed just how many times he had failed.

Only when the Red Rain Divine King Fruits decreased to 46 did he finally succeed in refining a cauldron of Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

However, there was only one pill.

This wasn’t due to his ability. In fact, one could only refine one Berserk Blood Spirit Pill per cauldron. The only difference would be in terms of quality. There couldn’t be any difference in the number of pills.

‘Success! I’ve finally succeeded!’

Ling Han laughed in delight. He wasn’t in a hurry to ingest this pill. Instead, he immediately sat down cross-legged, and began to reflect on the mistakes that he had made during refinement. In fact, it was exactly because of this habit that his alchemy skills were able to improve in leaps and bounds.

With the help of the Reincarnation Tree, he naturally improved even faster.

Two days passed, and he completed his session of reflection. He continued to refine the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

He succeeded again, and this time, the quality of the pill was slightly higher.

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face. If he could ingest these Berserk Blood Spirit Pills one after another, his cultivation level would rapidly advance by two sub-minor levels. Along with it, his battle prowess would also be elevated by two stars.

However, a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill would take three days to digest. Ling Han realized that he had already remained secluded for a long time, so he decided to head out to check on the current situation.

He exited the Black Tower. Just as he opened the door of his room, he saw Zhu Wu Jiu run over. There was a look of delight on his face, and he said, “Young Master Han, you’ve finally come out of seclusion!”

“What’s wrong?”

“The Treasure Forest Pavilion has written another notice of battle. They want to challenge Young Master Han,” Zhu Wu Jiu said. He paused for a moment before continuing, “The notice of battle was issued a little over two months ago. However, Young Master Han was in seclusion, so we didn’t give them a reply. Right now, everyone’s saying that Young Master Han is cowering from the challenge.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle. He’d never took other people’s thoughts to heart. After all, he was living for himself, not others. In any case, what could others think about him if he displayed absolute strength?

“Since that’s the case, let’s go and answer their challenge!”

Ling Han headed to the Han Lin Pavilion. Upon entering, he realized that the number of customers had dwindled considerably. The entire store seemed empty and quiet. Meanwhile, most of the store attendants were walking around aimlessly. There was genuinely nothing for them to do.

By the looks of it, Ling Han’s “cowardice” had brought the reputation of the Han Lin Pavilion crashing down. Few customers visited the store.

“Senior Elder, you’ve finally returned!” Yun Yong Wang’s and Kang Xiu Yuan’s frown finally eased when they saw Ling Han. It was as if they had seen their savior.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “It’s always been them challenging us. Let’s go to the Treasure Forest Pavilion today and challenge them for a change!”

“Agreed!” Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan both nodded in excitement. There was a ball of fire in their bellies.
