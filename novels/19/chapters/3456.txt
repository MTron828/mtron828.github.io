Chapter 3457= Third Extreme

Translator: Henyee Translations , Editor: Henyee Translations

Here it was again.

Ling Han said confidently, and using his Spiritual Power, said, “Six together, all suppressed to Five Inscriptions.

Even if it was an ordinary Inscription Tier cultivator standing on the fifth level of Inscription Tier, he would still be able to sweep aside all opposition. Going by that account, he actually thought quite highly of Jin Junsheng, suppressing the latter’s cultivation level to One Inscription.

Ling Han charged out, barging around like a wild bull.

The power of his punch was too terrifying. Every punch he threw was like the crushing power of a great mountain. Even if the cultivation levels of Jin Sanyin and the others were Five Inscriptions, it was still not enough, especially when Ling Han had grasped the pulsation of each of their attacks. Once that Frequency Attack appeared, who would be able to match it?

“How is this brat so powerful?”

“The freakishness is indescribable.”

“He’s only a Second Extreme!”

The members of the Jin Clan were all stunned. Seven Inscription Tier elites were battling against one Extreme Bone Tier elite, and this was a minor character who was a Second Extreme at that. However, not only had they failed to suppress this minor character, but they had even been beaten to the point of wailing in pain.

What kind of Extreme Bone Tier was this? How could he be so powerful?

Even in the previous generation of civilization, would those Holy Sons and

Holy Daughters have that kind of strength?

The Jin Clan was a remnant of the last generation, and knew some information about the ancient times. At that time, it was the golden age of martial arts. Among the great sects, a great many extremely talented Holy Sons and Holy Daughters emerged, but which of them could reach the height of Ling Han?

“I’ll deal with you guys!” Ling Han didn’t hold back anymore, unleashing a murderous aura as he channeled the Demonic Monkey Fist, each strike fatal.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

One after another, their heads exploded. With the barrage of murderous aura and the Demonic Monkey Fists, Ling Han’s battle prowess was definitely incomparable. Only Jin Junsheng could just barely match him. The rest were mediocre, and even Five Inscriptions were completely inadequate.

In just a few punches, only Jin Junsheng and Jin Sanyin were still alive.

Ling Han looked at Jin Sanyin and said, “Old geezer, you’re truly treacherous. You didn’t dare to kill me yourself, yet you instigated the members of the Lu

Clan to go to their deaths.”

“Unfortunately, they didn’t manage to kill you,” Jin Sanyin said hatefully.

-I promised those people from the Lu Clan that I would send you as soon as possible to reunite with them. Looks like that would be today.” Ling Han charged over and threw a punch. Under the barrage of the murderous aura, Jin Sanyin immediately fell into a dazed state.

This was not a Mystical Power, but its might seemed to have surpassed all Mystical Powers.

Ling Han shot out a punch, and Jin Sanyin forcibly stretched out a hand to parry. However, he still couldn’t avoid the fate of being killed.

Only Jin Junsheng was left.

“How is this possible? How is this possible?” Jin Junsheng asked in a trembling voice. He was a prodigy of the Jin Clan, and everything had always been smooth sailing for him. However, he had suddenly fallen into such desperate straits, and his willpower was about to collapse.

Ling Han showed no mercy, and followed up with another punch. Jin Junsheng also followed in the footsteps of the other members of the Jin Clan.

The light screen appeared again, and Ling Han saw new information in his mind.

“You have obtained victory. This is your reward.”

Weng! A streak of light descended from the sky and entered Ling Han’s body.

The life force surged out, and Ling Han’s cultivation level instantly became restless. A shackle was actually tearing itself apart. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yi, this was very similar to the energy bestowed on him by the Azure Dragon Formation Spirit.

He hurriedly sat down in a cross-legged position, and work together with this energy to improve his level of being.

Pa, pa, pa! One after another, the shackles in his body were torn apart, releasing a loud noise like that of Lei Dong.

Ling Han couldn’t help but moan. Advancing the level of being at Extreme Bone Tier was really too painful, because bone scraps were continuously falling off. This process brought him great pain.

It really hurt!

Ling Han gritted his teeth and persevered. If he couldn’t persist, the advancement of his level of being would cease. Then, similarly Third Extreme, where one had torn through three shackles, while the other had torn through ten, have battle prowess that was equal?

He wanted to become the strongest!

He didn’t want to end up like Jin Junsheng or Jin Sanyin, being surpassed and defeated, or even killed.

If he was going to do it, he would do it as the strongest.

Pa, another shackle was torn open, and Ling Han felt both pain and pleasure. On one hand, he hoped that this kind of pain would end quickly, and on the other, he hoped that the process of improvement could continue forever. However, after more than half an hour, the great advancement of the level of being finally slowed down, and also stopped.

Third Extreme!

Ling Han broke into a grin. Though he was already very close to Third Extreme in the first place, if he were to cultivate on his own, he would need at least a month’s time. Furthermore, he would still need the Treasured Fruit of Life, unlike this streak of light, which could automatically replenish the expenditure of his life force.

“Congratulations, Father. You’ve taken another step forward,” Seventh Baby was the first to say.

The remaining children also offered their congratulations. Third Baby even said, “Although our level of being is extremely high the moment we’re born, and we only need to grow normally, so our cultivation level will naturally increase, but growing step by step also has its benefits.

Second Baby nodded, then continued, “We are born perfect, but for someone like Father, it is possible that he could break through his limits, and attain boundless possibilities.”

“Though the rulers of the universe are basically all kinds of powerful innate Divine Physiques, there are also mortals that have succeeded. Furthermore, if mortals can rush to the highest peak, their battle prowess would definitely be extremely terrifying. Even the innate Divine Physiques would pale in comparison.”

Ling Han nodded. When he had been in the Blood Transformation Tier, he had reached the Seventh Change, and normally speaking, the Innate Divine Physique was equivalent to the Sixth Change. The Seventh Change was really a very unique situation.

Step by step, although it was more arduous and longer than an Innate Divine Physique, it could create endless possibilities.

However, wasn’t it a little too easy to improve one’s cultivation level in this place?

Just fight a few battles?

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel expectant. When would another person come to provoke him and let him level up a few more times? The best scenario would be that he would already be a Mystery Realm Tier by the time he left.

He searched the corpses of Jin Junsheng and the others. He did find a few Spatial Spirit Tools, but there was nothing of astonishing value inside. In fact, Jin Junsheng’s saber was only Enlightenment Tier-level.

Ling Han brought the babies into the tree hollow. This place was extraordinarily open, and did not look like the inside of a tree at all. Instead, it looked more like another world.

However, though this place looked strange, nothing out of the ordinary happened. The group walked peacefully for over an hour, and kept going upwards. A light appeared ahead of them, and then they saw the exit.

Yi?

There was actually a lake outside this exit. It was bright and covered with scales, and the lake waters were extraordinarily clear, but the bottom could not be seen at all. At most, one could only see about fifteen meters beneath the water.

Ling Han used his eye technique, but it was only an additional 30 meters or so, and he still couldn’t see the bottom.

Second Baby also looked at it, then shook her head at Ling Han, “Father, I can t see the bottom either.”

Even Second Baby’s eyesight couldn’t reach the bottom; this lake was obviously extraordinarily deep.

There were many people gathered around the lake, but not a single person went down. It was unknown what they were waiting for, or if they were observing something.

“It’s about to begin!” someone suddenly called out.

Huala, the sound of water splashing rang out, and a whirlpool had appeared in the centre of the lake. It was presently rapidly expanding, and there was a dark hole in the centre of the whirlpool. It was incredibly deep, as if it could reach all the way to the bottom of the lake.

Right at this moment, a change suddenly took place in the lake waters, and it instantly froze over..
