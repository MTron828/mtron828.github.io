Chapter 2631: The greater the wounds, the stronger he becomes

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I’ll beat you up!”

Ling Han’s right hand wielded his sword, but his left hand changed gestures frequently. At times it would be a palm strike, at times he would clench his hand into a fist, and sometimes he would send out a spear of lightning with a wave. Change was only a matter of thought for him.

He had already walked out his own path. His cultivation was no longer limited by form, but would change as he willed it.

Yet Zhang Tianyan felt horrible. Ling Han’s attacks seemed completely chaotic and disorganized, yet were extraordinarily powerful. It looked like Zhang Tianyan had the upper hand in power, but when they actually fought, he fell into a disadvantage, which was something he couldn’t understand.

However, he was still an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, after all. Looking at how Ling Han’s calm face was enshrouded in precious Qi, as if a god was about to walk out of him, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “You have walked out your own path!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He knew very well that if one wanted to become a Heavenly Venerate, the most basic, as well as the most important step, was to walk out one’s own path.

Every single Heavenly Venerate was unique and special. Even if Lin Luo had three Heavenly Venerate disciples, they had all taken that last step on their own. Their master only helped to guide them, but could not make it so that their descendants would follow in their footsteps every bit of the way.

In this instant, Zhang Tianyan was extremely jealous.

Though walking out one’s own path did not mean that one would definitely become a Heavenly Venerate, if the most crucial step had already been taken, the largest barrier for breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier was already swept out of the way.

This kind of person actually came into the Celestial King Graveyard?

“You are courting your own death!” Zhang Tianyan declared coldly. His jealousy was ignited, making him want nothing more than to immediately kill Ling Han.

“You coming here is just an act of suicide, and you even wounded my wife. Even tearing you into pieces is not enough to vent my fury!” Ling Han shouted loudly. He drew his sword, boundless light illuminating the surroundings. He was keeping nothing back anymore, unleashing his battle prowess to the maximum limits.

Zhang Tianyan did not believe that Ling Han could maintain his battle prowess at this height constantly, or that would be too illogical.

Hence, he did not take even half a step back, his every move being a forceful clash with Ling Han. He wanted to blast Ling Han out of this state as soon as possible. By then, he would get Ling Han’s head, and then capture the Empress. His rewards would be astonishing.

Great opportunities naturally came with great danger.

Now, the greatest opportunity was laid out right in front of Zhang Tianyan, so wasn’t it very normal that there would be danger as well?

Weng, he used his trump card.

Spiritual attack!

This was too despicable. Even if Ling Han had long since prepared himself, it was useless. He felt a pain in his head, and he had already been hit by the spiritual attack.

“I have to admit that you are indeed very strong, and also incomparably freakish, but you are too naive, after all. The fact that your cultivation level is too low is a weakness that you cannot change!” Zhang Tianyan took the chance to charge over. With how bountiful his battle experience was, he would attack madly once he got the slightest opportunity, and kill his opponent in a single stroke.

Ling Han smirked, and suddenly sliced out with his sword.

“What!?” Zhang Tianyan paled in great shock. As he thought about it, even if Ling Han’s spirit was not wounded upon being affected by his spiritual attack, Ling Han would be frozen for about half a breath’s time at least. This was enough time for Zhang Tianyan to annihilate his opponent.

This strike was far beyond his expectations.

He wanted to dodge this strike hurriedly with a tap of his foot, but it was already too late.

Pu!?Blood sprayed out.

Zhang Tianyan rapidly retreated 300 meters. He looked at the empty place where his left arm should be. It had been severed from the shoulder down, and there was blood gushing out.

“Good! Good! Good!” he forced out through clenched teeth. He had not thought that he, the hunter, would actually fall into the trap of his prey, and be deceived by his own experience.

“I said I would kill you!” Ling Han leaped out, delivering another strike with his sword.

He was indeed still affected by the spiritual attack, but it could only cause him a slight sting now. It was like how his physical body would hurt after being cut, but he was absolutely capable of tolerating this pain with strong willpower.

Zhang Tianyan released another spiritual attack, while his hands balled into fists, and delivered countless blows as well.

Ling Han felt a storm raging in his mind. It was incredibly painful to sustain spiritual attacks, but the more that was the case, the wilder his fighting spirit would be. He slashed madly at Zhang Tianyan as he pursued the latter, determined to kill his opponent.

Yet Zhang Tianyan did not have such a strong fighting spirit. While he could cause considerable damage to Ling Han with the spiritual attack, Ling Han was also coming close to him. Even if the Divine Demon Sword did not strike Zhang Tianyan directly, the sharp Sword Qi was still enough to cause him great trouble.

More importantly, Zhang Tianyan’s left arm had already been directly severed by the Divine Demon Sword. Endless murderous aura had also surged into his body through this injury, and was now wreaking havoc with wild abandon.

How could the might of a Celestial Tool be underestimated, what more when the Divine Demon Sword far surpassed an ordinary Celestial Tool in power?

It was true that Zhang Tianyan was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, but it was still impossible for him to bear the destructive power of the Divine Demon Sword.

If Zhang Tianyan had the time to sit down and recover from his injuries, he would still be able to expel the murderous aura of the Divine Demon Sword from his body bit by bit, but with Ling Han detaining him now, how could he possibly have the time?

This was using his own injuries to trade for injuries on his opponent. Ling Han threw his mind on the line, letting it come under continuous attacks. Blood was already flowing out of all his apertures, but his own assault did not stop. His fighting spirit overwhelmed the heavens, and also caused massive trouble for Zhang Tianyan. Sword Qi danced wildly, causing Zhang Tianyan to be heavily injured as well.

Their injuries were different, but their severity was more or less the same. It would have to depend on who would be the first to fall.

Zhang Tianyan soon revealed his intent to retreat. He feared that even if he did kill Ling Han, his own injuries would be too heavy, and he would die right alongside Ling Han.

Zhang Tianyan was greedy, but as someone who had reached the height of Eighth Heaven, he naturally could control his own greed. Gritting his teeth, he turned and fled.

There was absolutely no way he alone could take Ling Han down, what more when the Empress’s battle prowess was not to be underestimated as well.

Zhang Tianyan would leave, and find someone to help him. Then, he would return to suppress these two people. In any case, there were two Celestial Tools, which was enough to share.

“Have I allowed you to leave?” How could Ling Han possibly allow Zhang Tianyan to flee? Regulations of Space were unleashed, and space instantly manifested into layers, as if it was a swamp.

“If I want to leave, how will you stop me?” Zhang Tianyan laughed madly. If an Eighth Heaven Celestial King was determined to flee, it would be very difficult for even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to stop him, what more when it was just a mere Fifth Heaven Celestial King that was chasing him.

“Not only will I stop you, I will kill you!” Ling Han used Regulations of Space on himself, traversing the layers of space, and setting off in hot pursuit of Zhang Tianyan.

Zhang Tianyan used Regulations to boost himself. He stood at the height of Eighth Heaven. Merely in terms of Regulations, he would naturally overwhelm Ling Han.

Peng! Peng! Peng!?Zhang Tianyan aggressively barged through the spatial barrier, his speed practically unaffected.

But practically did not mean completely. Ling Han’s speed was already astonishing in the first place. Once Zhang Tianyan was only slightly delayed, Ling Han immediately caught up with him, and swept out with the indestructible Divine Demon Sword.

“Damn it!” Zhang Tianyan had no choice. He could only turn around, and continue exchanging blows with Ling Han.

It was still trading injury for injury. The injuries of the two of them also became more and more serious. One was injured from the inside out, and the other was injured from the outside in.

Now that things had reached this point, it was actually a contest of willpower now. Whoever had the stronger willpower would be the last one standing.

Peng!

A punch landed on Ling Han, and Zhang Tianyan was also blasted by the Lightning of Water and Wood. Both of them were throwing up blood endlessly.

However, in the next instant, the two of them began a new exchange of blows.

Peng! Peng! Peng!?The two of them bled endlessly, their injuries becoming gradually heavier.

Zhang Tianyan discovered that his fighting spirit was becoming weaker and weaker, but on the other side, not only did Ling Han’s battle prowess not weaken in the slightest, it was even increasing.

This caused great shock to Zhang Tianyan. This kind of guy that would become stronger as his injuries became heavier was really too hard to deal with, especially in a situation when they were equally matched. The more you fought, the weaker you became, but your opponent would become stronger as the battle progressed. It was like cheating. How could you continue fighting then?

“I said I would kill you!” Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared directly into the clouds. His martial intent surged, and could not be stopped.
