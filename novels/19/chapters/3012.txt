3013 I Don’t Agree

Ning Haixin and the woman in azure were both given a fright.

Who was this?

They looked over, only to see a hunch-backed elder walking over from behind a stone archway. His hair was white, and he was exuding an aura of age and decay.

Ning Haixin’s expression instantly changed. This was one of her father’s two loyal warriors. His name was Zuo Yi, and he had just advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier not long ago.

Such a powerful elite naturally wouldn’t have come here by coincidence, and it was clear that he was here for just one reason—to keep an eye on her.

An intense sense of grief suddenly welled up in her heart. Her father was truly invested in her marriage, and he had even anticipated that she would try to flee beforehand. Because of this, he had specially sent out one of his most powerful warriors to keep an eye on her.

“Young Mistress, please return,” Zuo Yi said calmly. There wasn’t a hint of emotion in his voice.

“Mr. Zuo, I want to take a walk outside the mountain,” Ning Haixin said, attempting to put up a final resistance.

“Sect Master said that Young Mistress should stay in her room to cultivate for the next few months. You shouldn’t do anything that will bring shame to yourself.” Zuo Yi’s words appeared respectful, yet it was clear that he didn’t feel an iota of respect toward Ning Haixin.

Ning Haixin bit her lip and slowly turned around.

It was impossible to resist, especially since she was only a measly Severing Mundane Tier cultivator. How could she possibly rival an Ascending Origin Tier elite?

She started to walk back, and tears were already rolling down her cheeks. However, before she could even take two steps, a figure suddenly appeared in her vision. This was the young man who she had “rescued” from the lake.

She suddenly recalled Ling Han’s words at this moment, that she could ask him for help if she came across any trouble.

She suddenly felt the urge to call out, yet she quickly chuckled at herself in a self-deprecating manner.

He had needed her to rescue him, so just how powerful could he be?

Could he change her father’s decision? Could he defeat Zuo Yi?

Thus, what was the point of asking him for help?

She gradually quickened her pace. Only when she couldn’t see Ling Han anymore did she suddenly feel a slight sense of puzzlement. Why did she always see this person no matter where she went?

Ling Han watched Ning Haixin quickly walk away. However, he didn’t step forward to help her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He would leave everything up to fate. If she believed him, he would naturally help her. If she didn’t believe him, however, why would he stick his nose into someone else’s business?

However, Ling Han’s interest in Ning Haixin wasn’t simply because she had “rescued” him once. Instead, he felt a mysterious sense of friendliness toward her, and this was something that made him want to understand her a little more.

After Ning Haixin returned to her room, she was immediately placed under strict guard.

During this time, both of her older brothers had come to visit her once. However, they didn’t care about whether this marriage was right or wrong, and they instead coldly asked her to be a good wife and loving mother. In addition, they reminded her to always remember her family and to always think about them if there were any benefits to share.

This caused Ning Haixin to become even sadder. In the eyes of her family, she was nothing more than a tool that could bring them benefits.

There were a few times that she thought of Ling Han, but she would immediately shake her head and dismiss this as a thought of desperation. After all, how could this person help her?

Three months passed by in a flash.

The Azure Sky Sect hosted a grand wedding, and they invited numerous powerful figures. This was a marriage with a Celestial King’s son, after all, so those who were invited all felt extremely honored. They all came to attend the wedding.

Ning Haixin felt completely hopeless and dejected at this moment, and she numbly allowed the others to help her put on makeup and wear her red veil. With the help of her maidservant, she then arrived at the wedding hall.

In order to demonstrate the grandness of the situation, they would hold a wedding here before holding another wedding after returning to the Lu Clan.

In this sense, the Lu Clan was indeed giving the Azure Sky Sect a lot of face.

Because of this, Ning Daolan wore a beaming smile, appearing as happy as could be.

His two sons were both dressed formally for the wedding, and they both helped him welcome the guests to the ceremony. After Ning Haixin married into a Celestial King clan, the status of her two brothers would naturally rise to new heights as well.

Meanwhile, Lu Yang lazily sat around, not hurrying about to welcome the attending guests. As the son of a Celestial King, he was naturally arrogant and haughty. Thus, it was beneath him to interact with these “low-level people.”

Of course, Celestial King An Teng wouldn’t be attending, either. He naturally wouldn’t condescend himself to attend such an ordinary wedding.

“It’s almost time; begin the ceremony,” Ning Daolan ordered.

The musicians immediately started to work, blowing, banging, and strumming their respective instruments, playing delightful tunes on this grand occasion.

Ning Haixin was like a soulless puppet as she allowed the others to lead her around.

Her heart was already dead.

“Not so quick!” someone suddenly said. This voice was completely unexpected.

“Who is it?”

Everyone looked toward the door, only to see a burly man standing there. Strangely, he was actually wearing a round shield on his back. Looking closely, it was as if this round shield were a part of his body.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Ning Xiuwei, Ning Daolan’s second son, immediately roared as he stepped forward, pointing at the burly man.

“The meaning is… I don’t agree with this marriage!” the man replied loudly.

‘What?!’

Everyone fell silent, and they all stared at the burly man.

Perhaps this person was Ning Haixin’s lover? And now that Ning Haixin was about to get married to someone else, he had especially run over to stop the wedding?

If this were the case, then he was truly a love-stricken person.

“Who are you? And what right do you have to disagree?” Ning Xiuwei asked. The burly man was only at the Dividing Soul Tier, so there was naturally no need for his father or older brother to get involved. Otherwise, they would lose face.

He was quite puzzled at the moment. Someone among the guests actually had some kind of intimate relationship with his younger sister?

He had never heard about this before! Otherwise, they definitely wouldn’t have sent an invitation to this man.

Moreover, his younger sister had almost never left the Azure Sky Sect before, so how could she have become acquainted with this burly man?

The man grinned, and said, “I’m Gui Hou, and I’ve come here with a single aim today—to stop the wedding.” He pointed at Lu Yang, and continued, “This brat isn’t worthy of her!”

Lu Yang immediately stood up, a furious expression on his face. ‘F*ck! You actually dare to say that I’m not worthy?’

If they hadn’t been interested in Ning Haixin’s unique ability, would he have wanted to marry her?

“Son-in-law, don’t take this to heart. Let Xiuwei deal with this crude man,” Ning Xiuwei said with a smile. On this grand day, he naturally couldn’t allow the groom to deal with such problems.

Lu Yang nodded, and said, “I don’t want to see this kind of person.”

He sat down after saying this, and it was as if he had issued a command.

Ning Xiuwei glanced at his father, and after seeing him nod, he immediately waved a hand, and said, “Guards! Shoo this impudent lunatic away!”

Two men immediately stepped forward, and replied, “Understood, Second Young Master!” Then, they both bore down on Gui Hou.

They were both at the Dividing Soul Tier, and since they had the advantage in numbers, they were naturally confident that they could deal with this man.

Gui Hou cracked a grin, appearing extremely calm as he hooked a finger, and said, “Come at me!”

“Leave!” the two men roared as they attacked Gui Hou in unison.

However, Gui Hou simply spun around.

Peng, peng!

The two attacks landed on the shield on his back, instantly shredding his clothes. Strangely, however, it appeared as if this round shield were truly a part of his body.
