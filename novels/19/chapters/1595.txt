Chapter 1596: Visitor from the Celestial Realm

Han Qi stood with his arms crossed behind his back, looking as if he did not take these Demon Masters seriously at all.

In his eyes, these were merely ants. So what if he had defeated them? Was there any need to feel especially proud of it?

Thus, he was also merciless in his strikes. With a tap of a finger, pa, a Demon Master’s head immediately exploded into bits, and his spirit was also ground to nothing at the first instant.

“I despise this place.” As he withdrew his finger, he looked at the gathered masses, admiring the looks of fear on their faces. “Where I originally was, that was a true holy land of cultivation, but the elders in my clan deliberately sent me to this arduous and primitive place to train me.

“I miss my old friends dearly, I wish to return to my original life, but I can only stay in this place and be with such smelly pigs like you all in the same galaxy!”

Han Qi paused, and continued, “I haven’t started complaining yet, so what right do you all have to?”

Pa!

He tapped out another finger, and a second Demon Master’s head tragically exploded. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“However, the heavens have finally seen my plight.” He turned to look at Empress Luan Xing. “They gifted an exquisite beauty to me, as well as a Celestial medicine! Haha, then I will gladly accept!” He stretched out his hand, grabbing out at the Empress.

“Small Tower!” Ling Han said softly in his mind.

Weng, suddenly, a frightening energy surged out of his body, immediately pushing his cultivation level up to the consummate level of the Genesis Tier. He moved, his fist rushing towards Han Qi’s palm. Peng

, that palm was immediately shattered into pieces.

“En?” Han Qi was slightly startled. He raised his hand, and saw that the part of his hand between his thumb and forefinger had split. Blood was gushing out, crystalline like jade. He couldn’t help but look at Ling Han, and said, “You are slightly odd. You are clearly only in the Eternal River Tier, yet suddenly possess the cultivation level of the peak stage of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier... Yi, this aura, you have actually merged the Regulations of the two Realms! You are not from this place!”

The Ancient Realm had already split into two, and the Regulations had also accordingly split into two. It was eternally impossible for anyone to be capable of grasping the Regulations of the two Realms simultaneously and merge them, and open the doors to the Celestial Realm from there.

Thus, there was only one possibility why someone could merge the Regulations of the two Realms—just like him, he had similarly come from the Celestial Realm!

These words were heard by the other Demon Masters, and all of them were filled with hope.

The peak stage of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier? Wasn’t that a peak stage Heaven Demon?

Then, as long as Ling Han was willing to save them, they would not die!

Ling Han released his aura, which rushed towards the white mist. However, this was a secret technique of the Han Clan, and definitely not something that mere aura could oppose. It only allowed Ling Han himself to regain his freedom of movement.

“Hahahaha!” Han Qi laughed loudly. “Since we both come from the Celestial Realm, how could a celestial technique that you don’t recognize as one be something that your aura could overcome? Which city and which clan are you from? Tell me to avoid dying in my hands by mistake.”

He was probing into Ling Han’s identity here. If Ling Han’s background in the Celestial Realm was huge, then he would be merciful. After all, those who were sent to this place to train would definitely not be the abandoned pawns of the clan. Instead, only those prodigies that were definitely prized would get such an opportunity.

The Ancient Realm was damaged, but if one could cultivate Regulations fully even in such a ruined land, his future potential was immeasurable! Moreover, unless they had been truly extraordinarily talented geniuses, his clan would not have possibly spent so much effort to send him into the Ancient Realm.

There definitely had to be some kind of secret technique placed on such a prodigy. If he was killed by another, his clan would be able to easily deduce his killer—unless the killer’s abilities were superior to the person who had performed the technique.

Thus, Han Qi had to first confirm that the force supporting Ling Han was not something that he could trifle with.

He was arrogant, but not stupid at all. Otherwise, he would not have possibly been sent into the Ancient Realm to be trained.

All the Demon Masters were confused by his words. What kind of place was this Celestial Realm? Some powerful organization of the Netherworld?

Ling Han smiled calmly, and answered, “Dark Moon City, Ding Clan.” He did not mind drawing some aggression to the Ding Clan at all.

Han Qi pondered for a while, then involuntarily revealed an expression of disdain, and said, “So it is merely a single star small city!” He did not have any more reservations. Though he had not heard of this Ding Clan before, he knew what grade the Dark Moon City most likely was. Even a Severing Mundane Tier could be called a senior here. It could not be mentioned on equal terms with the Han Clan at all.

However, he was feeling a little curious as well. A Severing Mundane Tier Ancestor would at most only be able to enter himself into the Ancient Realm. He should not be able to send others in... forget it, there was no need to mind. In any case, in front of the Han Clan, even Severing Mundane Tier was insignificant.

“Why don’t you measure your own worth? You actually dare challenge me?” Han Qi smirked coldly. He had confirmed in his mind, so he naturally did not have the slightest bit of reservations any longer. He stretched out his right hand, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han used Darkness of the Paramount Night, and an endless darkness spread out, turning into the purest darkness that blocked all the senses.

The white mist that enshrouded the area immediately dispersed, and was invaded and swallowed by the darkness. However, it did not completely disappear. Instead, it eventually turned into a battle of equals, both occupying half the territory.

“Hmm?”

“Huh?”

Both Ling Han and Han Qi were slightly surprised because neither of them had thought that the other’s power was actually capable of matching their own.

Ling Han soon felt relieved. This was only the power boost from the Black Tower, which allowed him to possess the power and grasp over Regulations that belonged to the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, but in truth, this was not Ling Han’s true strength—he believed that he would be able to be even stronger when he actually reached this level.

Yet Han Qi was truly stunned. Just how powerful was his background? The Han Clan was notable even in the Celestial Realm, and as he was a well-known figure among the younger generation of the Han Clan, his battle prowess should definitely be capable of overwhelming all his peers.

Yet Ling Han actually managed to match him? This was something that he could not accept.

“Just about the same in terms of power and cultivation technique!” He immediately broke out into a cold smirk. Battle prowess was not defined by such fixed figures. Otherwise, what was the point of battle in the first place? They just needed to compare their figures.

Ling Han smiled calmly. This was also what he wanted to say. Possessing such a powerful weapon like the Nine Heavens Flame, in a battle of equal cultivation levels, who would be able to match him?

You at least would have to have the qualifications of a Celestial King!

“All of you, step back. I will guarantee your safety!” he stated calmly. Because Darkness of the Paramount Night was opposing that white mist, those Demon Masters also regained their freedom, and Ling Han’s words were directed at them.

All the Demon Masters felt rueful. At first, there was one Demon Master that had something similar to Ling Han and the Empress. At the time, it was an inevitable and right thing to do in their eyes, yet they had never imagined that not too much time would pass, and the target of these words would be changed to them.

Furthermore, they had to accept this kindness too.

Times changed quickly, really very quickly!

“Humph, whether they step back or not, the result will be the same, and your only destiny is death!” Han Qi declared in objection. He had exposed a secret of the Celestial Realm, and these people were fated to die.

“Ice Mist!” he called out softly. The white mist immediately turned into an eerie air of ice, which posed a great threat even to those in the consummate level of the Genesis Tier.

All around, even if those Demon Masters had Ling Han standing in front of them, they were still shivering. The gap in their cultivation level was a little too wide, so how could they possibly face the consummate level of the Genesis Tier head-on?

Ling Han pressed a hand on Empress Luan Xing, and drew her into the Black Tower. Han Qi was a powerful foe, and he had to ensure that those Demon Masters behind him did not take advantage of an opening to make a move on the Empress.

One should not lack vigilance at any time; he did not want to be filled with regret if anything happened.

‘Cold mist?’

Ling Han smiled softly. The other definitely would not have imagined that he had a Source Power within him which was the Nine Heavens Flame.

Immortal flame!
