Chapter 1812: Encounter

The shadowy figure did not reply, and merely pointed a finger at Ling Han. Weng, Ling Han felt his vision blur, and the space he was in warped. When everything had stabilized, he had already appeared in a different location.

This was a forest of peach trees, and it was not clear how far it extended. At present, the plump blossoms covering the trees were all blooming wildly, creating a carpet of pink. A fragrance wafted in the air, refreshing the heart and spirit.

In the Celestial Realm, all plants would be evolving towards the aspect of size. Typically, they would be giant trees that were several tens of thousands of meters high, and this could only be considered a normal height at that. The real giants were as tall as millions of meters, in fact.

But in this place, the size of the peach trees was very normal. They were only about six meters tall, and with petals that fell and covered the ground completely, they presented an astonishingly beautiful scene.

Ling Han first sensed his own physical state, and confirmed that this was a real location. Then, he strode forwards.

He did not have any destination in mind, and was just walking casually. There was no way that he would be able to distinguish directions in this place anyways.

After walking for a while, he stopped. He had a feeling that if he continued to walk like this, he would never be able to walk out of here in eternity.

The shadowy figure had said that passing the second test, he would be able to gain access to another spot of good fortune.

Was this it?

Great fortune naturally could not be bestowed on one for nothing. This was a test.

Ling Han soared into the skies, and his eyes wandered over his surroundings. However, all he could see was still wide stretches of peach trees. They became a carpet of pink, as if this was a world of peach trees.

‘Hmm?’

His eyes lifted slightly. Though the peach trees were grown very closely together, something different had suddenly appeared ahead. One of the peach trees had bent to one side. Initially, everything was uniform and neat, and suddenly there was one that was bent. This would probably drive a person with obsessive compulsive disorder to death.

Ling Han soared over, and with that spot as the center, he soon found another peach tree that had bent in growth.

He continued to find these “anomalies”. His figure soared, but a whole two days had passed, and he was still going around in circles in this forest of peach trees that seemed to have no end.

“Wait, no!”

Ling Han shook his head. The path to leave, or rather the path towards that location of good fortune could not possibly be as simple as this.

HIs figure descended, and he sat in a cross-legged position. The path that he had walked previously appeared in his mind.

When one had reached the heights that he had, every path he walked would naturally be inscribed in his memory. Immediately, a route map spread out in his mind’s eye. The complexity of the route was shocking.

“There must be a rhythm to it!” Ling Han said to himself. He thought for a while, then directly entered into the Black Tower, and began his calculations underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

Only a day later, his eyes snapped open, and he broke into a smile.

He was sure that he had found the correct path.

“Husband!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden walked over. At present, she was the only one left in the Black Tower. Even the bootlicker, the Asura Demon Emperor, had been tossed by Ling Han at the secondary city of Black Moon City, so she was naturally both bored and peaceful.

Ling Han comforted her for a while. It could not be helped. She had not advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier yet, so there was no way that she could walk around in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

After exiting the Black Tower, Ling Han strode forwards. He had a card up his sleeve.

“Yi?” After walking for a while, he saw an elegant figure in red ahead of him. The back was incredibly beautiful, and definitely could be considered the most exquisite creation by the gods.

“Wife!” he immediately called out.

The Empress stopped, and turned around. A bright smile appeared on her proud, exquisitely beautiful face, instantly causing this forest of peach trees to pale in color. With her perfect beauty there, anything would seem pale in comparison.

Ling Han walked over, while the Empress approached him. The two of them embraced, and felt that though they had only been apart for a few days, it was like they had been separated for a lifetime.

In a certain sense, it certainly was so.

Their divine sense had been cut off through some means, and time had been ignored. They had to focus on comprehending Dao. Ordinarily, they would need millions of years to be able to complete this step. Thus, while it seemed to only be a few breaths’ time, to their spirits, it had indeed been as long as a few million years.

Just like how they comprehended Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree. Though it was said that one day was equivalent to 100 years, their spirits had truly and genuinely passed as long as 100 years. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Absence made the heart fonder, and the two of them immediately kissed passionately, wanting to take in that feeling of familiarity from each other.

“You are not allowed to leave me for as long as this again!” the Empress said in a very domineering tone as she raised her head.

Ling Han solemnly said, “Don’t worry. Even if mountains and oceans separate us, even if a few epochs pass, I will definitely find you again!”

Only then did the Empress bloom into a beautiful smile, indescribably exquisite.

The two of them walked on, hand in hand.

Speaking of the matter, it was really coincidental. The Empress had not found the path to leave this place, but had rather just happened to be walking in the proximity, and thus Ling Han had come upon her. This could only be considered as the two of them having a mental connection.

...Her comprehension ability might not be inferior to Ling Han’s, but without the help of the Reincarnation Tree, how could she compare to him?

The two walked further, and not too much time had passed when they saw a woman with a captivating figure appear once more in front of them.

Her figure was close to perfection, but when compared to the Empress, they were still completely two different types.

The Empress was domineering and noble, and even looking at her back was enough to make one’s heart fill with admiration, wanting nothing more than to kneel at her feet and offer their humble worship. But this woman was different. She gave off an incredibly bewitching vibe.

Upon taking a step, her flaring hips would gently sway. The arc was clearly not very accentuated, but because her slender waist was really too slender, this kind of arc seemed to be very exaggerated. As she swayed left and right, the fabric covering her shapely hips would tighten, and completely outline one side of her plump bottom. She was incredibly bewitching, causing one’s fires of lust to burn immediately.

This kind of seductive beauty belonged to the category of utterly bewitching woman who could, with a single look, drive men to thoughts of bed and to spare no costs just to have one night with her.

There was no need to see her face, and Ling Han immediately thought that this was really a very small world, and everything was so coincidental.

Bewitching Maiden Rou.

“Husband, go!” The Empress’s eyes immediately lit up. She had long since made her decision. If he could court her, then he would. If he did not manage to, they would just have to kidnap her by force. No matter what, this Nine Revolutions Charm Physique could not be allowed to fall into the hands of another.

As for whether Bewitching Maiden Rou was willing or not, or what her thoughts were, the Empress did not take it to heart at all.

Every living being in the world was a mere ant, and she was the noble and dignified Empress, so what need was there for her to concern herself with them?

“Brat, go!” Small Tower actually leaped on the bandwagon as well.

‘Go your sister, if you guys want to go, just go then!’

Ling Han was determined not to submit. Though beautiful women were pleasing to the eye, if he was to marry them, it was definitely not a case of the more, the merrier. He felt that his affection was already stretched enough over these lovers by his side, so how could he incur more debts of romance?

Ahead of them, Bewitching Maiden Rou had also sensed their presence. With how sensitive their divine sense was, there was no need for her to see them with her own eyes.

A sliver of wariness immediately appeared in her gaze. Ling Han and the Empress were too strong, and she could only depend on herself here. If they planned to use force against her, she was definitely in a disadvantageous position.

“So it is the two of you!” Bewitching Maiden Rou smiled beautifully. Even if she was battling, she would still smile delicately and brightly like this. The Purity Sect cultivated charm techniques, and even if they died, they were determined to die with a smile.

“Call me big sister!” the Empress demanded in displeasure.

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but feel embarrassed, and her smile became slightly awkward as she said, “This little sister is really—”

Her eyes swept over the Empress, and her cherry mouth suddenly gaped widely. Added with her delicate, bewitching expression, it would make men think of certain indecent thoughts as they’d wish to shove a certain something into her small mouth, and fill it to the brim.

How could there be such an exquisite woman in this world!
