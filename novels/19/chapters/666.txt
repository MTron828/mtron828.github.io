Chapter 667: The Tenth Eye!

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

True Phoenix!

In the legends, True Phoenixes were on par with True Dragons, and True Dragons were the strongest of divine beasts. Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art, which Ling Han cultivated, used nine dragons as a power standard, and it was precisely because the power of dragons was the strongest.

Divine beasts, blessed by heaven, didn’t need to cultivate at all. At maturity, they possessed terrifying strength, and the power of True Dragons could even shatter the firmament, breaking open the universe, and it became god realm’s measurement standard for power.

Of course, martial artists cultivating could still surpass the power of nine dragons, or else there wouldn’t be the saying of the power of nine dragons.

But here, the power of True Dragons and True Phoenixes was definitely the limit of the extreme. If Azure Phoenix Divine Empress could truly possess the complete power of a True Phoenix, then with an arbitrary slap, this Corpse King would disperse into a pile of bones again.

The five great sects were all based on inheritance from the divine plane, like how Zi Xue Xian was a descendant of a great race related to thunder there, being extremely powerful. Thus, since Azure Phoenix Divine Empress was also extremely likely to be a descendant from the god realm, possessing a shred of True Phoenix Bloodline wasn’t anything strange.

The Nine-eyed Corpse King actually revealed a fearful look. For Corpse Soldiers that weren’t afraid of death and didn’t know pain, this was an incredible thing.

That was also because the Nine-eyed Corpse King’s level was too high, deriving its own consciousness, so it knew how to measure the situation it was in.

However, brutality was all that was in Corpse Soldiers after all. It soon suppressed the fear in its heart, and with a loud roar, qiang, qiang, qiang , bone spikes grew out from all over its body. Each spike was over thirty meters long, making it look like a hedgehog.

The Corpse King charged at Azure Phoenix Divine Empress again. Each bone spike had gray-colored vein-like patterns that lit up, emitting a presence of despair.

Ling Han turned pale with shock, and said, “Not good!”

The thing that Zhu Xuan Er and the others feared the most now was hearing Ling Han say “not good”. Each time he said “not good”, something not good would definitely happen.

“Brother-in-law, can’t you not say ‘not good’?” Li Feng Yu said, shivering.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This Corpse King has just awakened, opening nine eyes simultaneously earlier, and now it grew out bone spikes. I assume it’s still in the process of fusing with those corpses, and hasn’t reached its complete form.”

Qin Lian Yue turned pale with fright, and said, “You’re saying that after it completes the fusion, it’ll become... even stronger?!”

“Inevitably.” Ling Han sighed.

Hiss!

Now, Azure Phoenix Divine Empress was only tied in battle with the Nine-eyed Corpse King. If this Corpse King became even stronger, wouldn’t it mean that even Azure Phoenix Divine Empress be unable to suppress it? Seeing this Corpse King’s appearance, it seemed like it could fuse with more corpses, and if Azure Phoenix Divine Empress was killed and her corpse absorbed as well, then how powerful would it become?

It would probably break through the Shattering Void Tier’s limit and cross into the God Tier.

Everyone’s hands and feet turned cold. If it really turned out so, no place in the entire world would be pure. All would be killed off completely by this Corpse King as it devoured flesh and blood and fused with skeletal remains, evolving into the strongest Corpse Soldier in history.

Ling Han even thought of how this had to do with Thousand Corpse Sect.

This should be an ancient battlefield. The experts from the five sects of god realm descended and fought the ultimate battle here against rebels, and the final end was obviously burying the prosperous martial arts age ten thousand years ago.

The Thousand Corpse Sect was also a great sect in the god realm, certainly having means to escape the refinement of the Pill Realm in the end, so they could secretly tamper with the corpses which should’ve rotted here, turning them into Corpse Soldiers.

With the five great sects keeping watch, they also didn’t dare to act brazenly, and could only do things slowly, resulting in the creation of this monster.

... Probably. Ling Han couldn’t be sure, but he could conclude that this definitely had to do with the Thousand Corpse Sect.

After growing out bone spikes, the Corpse King’s battle prowess increased drastically. Each bone spike was equivalent to a heavenly spear, covered in vein-like patterns, and could even pose a great threat to Shattering Void Tier elites.

Even Azure Phoenix Divine Empress didn’t dare to oppose it directly, and kept moving around to dodge the sharp edges. After all, her physique couldn’t be compared to the Corpse King’s. However, she didn’t dodge randomly, and constantly counterattacked with the long sword, unleashing shocking Sword Rays.

Moreover, her tailpiece was also completely formed by flames, and as it whisked, it also created considerable disturbance for the Corpse King. That was definitely no ordinary fire, its destructive power shocking, and it left burnt marks on the Corpse King’s body when sweeping past it, burning the skeletons into ash.

In the short term, the two elites were evenly matched.

Nevertheless, it was just as Ling Han had said, this Corpse King was actually like an infant that was just born. At the start, it only had pure instincts, which was its natural tendency to kill, so it’d been moving based on its instincts.

However, as the battle progressed, it understood how to use power, and also seemed to grow, becoming more and more terrifying.

This change was extremely evident.

The skeletal corpses on its body were in the process of fusion, and the bones coalescing looked as if they weren’t hard bones, but instead made of sand. In the process of the fusion, the Corpse King’s body also shrank slowly, but its power was increasing.

Ling Han shivered within, and said, “Earlier, it was ten thousand Corpse Soldiers attacking together, but now it’s a thousand, then to one hundred, and lastly just one will be remaining.”

Everyone was smart and immediately understood.

The decreasing amount wasn’t a good thing, and on the contrary, this was the worst of the worst outcome possible.

No matter how ten thousand people worked as one, could the power they unleashed reach the layering of ten thousand shares of power? Definitely not. However, with one thousand people, and each person’s power multiplied by ten, attacking jointly... whose power would you say was stronger?

Not to mention one hundred people, ten people, or when one was remaining, if the power was multiplied by ten thousand, then that would completely equal the power of ten thousand people, not being a single bit reduced.

The Corpse King was in the process of advancing in this direction.

Azure Phoenix Divine Empress evidently also saw it, for her sword strikes became more rushed. Pu, pu, pu , Sword Rays slashed on the Corpse King’s body and kept sweeping away broken bones, but with the Corpse King’s colossal body, this was no big deal at all.

Moreover, as its body shrunk, the Corpse King’s power became stronger, and the defensive area still continued to shrink.

This wasn’t delightful news.

After half a day, the Corpse King’s body already shrunk by half, and was only over one hundred fifty meters tall. The crimson light in its eyes was fiercer by more than one-fold; looking at it could bring pain in one’s heart to the point of bursting.

Pa!

The Corpse King’s movements halted as another eye actually grew out from its forehead.

A tenth eye!

Nine eyes was the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, so what about ten eyes?

It definitely couldn’t reach the God Tier, but its battle prowess increased by at least one star!

The battle prowess of the Shattering Void Tier elites was extremely terrifying to begin with, and to increase their battle prowess by one star was as hard as climbing the skies. Now, the Corpse King fused its body even further, and finally obtained a qualitative change. The aura over its entire body grew explosively, hong , and the entire Ghost Lock Ravine collapsed.

The Corpse King attacked again. Its bone spikes were heaven-shocking, collapsing stars in the sky, just as if world was ending.

Azure Phoenix Divine Empress finally revealed a cautious look, reaching out with her hand to swipe the Heavenly Phoenix Sword, and said, “Open!”

Weng , the vein-like patterns on Heavenly Phoenix Sword lit up again, and was several hundred times more powerful. A giant colorful phoenix flew out from the blade as if a divine spirit descending to earth, emitting endless divine might.

Tool spirit! A tenth-tier tool spirit!
