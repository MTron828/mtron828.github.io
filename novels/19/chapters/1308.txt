Chapter 1309 Battle of the Strongest Physiques

They drew lots, and the result was Ling Han versus the Stone Emperor and Chi Huangji versus the North Emperor.

They didn’t speak any nonsense, and the four of them immediately began to do battle.

“Human, eat my fist!” The Rock Spirit launched a fist at Ling Han. His fist was larger than a wok lid, and it looked as if it were formed from jade, with swirls of light glimmering on its surface. However, one definitely couldn’t make the mistake of thinking that his fist was brittle. In reality, he possessed the bloodline of a Rock Spirit, and thus his most outstanding quality was his sturdy physique.

His physique was as tough as Godly metal of the same level!

Thus, the Stone Emperor preferred engaging in close-quarters combat. In the past, he had battled against a king tier at the same cultivation level, and he had ruthlessly smashed him into a pile of broken flesh with only 10 punches. If he hadn’t shown mercy, even his opponent’s divine sense would have been obliterated.

Ling Han laughed loudly as he replied with a punch of his own.

Peng!

Their fists collided, releasing a burst of devastating light that easily tore space apart, forming numerous black swirls in the air. It was as if even space were about to shatter.

Such an event wasn’t impossible. After all, the Mountain River Tier was the highest cultivation level in this place, so they were all equivalent to Saint Kings in the outside world. If Saint Kings so desired, tearing space apart wouldn’t be a difficult task.

A look of astonishment spread across the Stone Emperor’s face. Ling Han had exchanged a blow with him, yet even his skin hadn’t cracked, to say nothing of his bones shattering.

He knew that Ling Han was powerful, but close-quarters combat was his forte! Take the North Emperor, for example. The North Emperor was just as powerful as him, yet he still wouldn’t dare to engage in close-quarters combat with him.

Prodigies were naturally aware of their own strengths and weaknesses. Taking advantage of one’s own strengths while avoiding one’s own weaknesses was the best way to go.

He had noticed that Ling Han liked to use his fists, so he had hoped that he would be matched up against him. He wanted to experience Ling Han’s fist techniques. However, he had never imagined that Ling Han’s fists would actually be so solid and powerful!

“Wonderful!” The Stone Emperor was extremely excited, and his fighting spirit burned even stronger than before. Just then, he had merely been fooling around. Now, however, he was going to unleash his true power!

Ling Han shook his hand, and said, “Few people can exchange a punch with me and not have their bones shatter. You’re fairly strong.”

“You stole the words right out of my mouth!” The Stone Emperor charged forward, throwing a flurry of punches, and saying, “Human, please don’t cower! Exchange 10,000 punches with me! Whoever cowers is a little dog!” His iron-like fists were invincible, and he had never felt sated when exchanging blows with others. Thus, he was afraid that Ling Han wouldn’t continue to exchange blows with him and sate his appetite. So, he spoke to provoke Ling Han first.

Cold sweat involuntarily formed on Ling Han’s forehead. ‘How old is this Stone Emperor? He actually uttered the words “little dog”?’

He shook his head with a chuckle, and said, “Fine! However, don’t cry if you lose!”

“You think I’m afraid of you?” the Stone Emperor shouted.

“You’re not? Good!”

The two of them continued to exchange blows, not using any fanciful moves. All they used was their two fists. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Faceless and the others all grimaced upon seeing this. Were these two people savages?

How could ordinary people possess such terrifying physiques?

The power of cultivators was limited. If one placed 70% of their power into offense, then they would only have 30% of their power left for defense. However, judging by Ling Han’s and the Stone Emperor’s ferocious attacks, they had clearly placed 100% of their power into offense.

In other words, the physique of them two was freakishly powerful. They didn’t need to use Origin Power to protect themselves.

Could people at the same cultivation level wound them?

Faceless and the others exchanged a glance. They felt that power alone wouldn’t be able to breach Ling Han and the Stone Emperor’s defenses—they had already exchanged 1,000 or so punches, yet neither of them had suffered from broken bones or even broken skin.

They believed that one would have to use the Regulations of flames, ice, or other elements to melt or restrict their physiques first.

Regulations were an innate part of battle prowess, and merely using power to exchange blows like Ling Han and the Stone Emperor was the fighting method of foolish brutes. Generally speaking, elites wouldn’t stoop to such a level.

However, these two supreme king tiers were enjoying themselves immensely.

The smile of the Stone Emperor’s face was like a blooming flower. He was feeling absolutely delighted at this moment. Never had anyone engaged in such a hearty battle with him before. His impression of Ling Han grew better by the second, and he felt that he could completely become friends with him, even though he was a human.

“Human, I’m going to unleash more of my battle prowess!” he said. It was clear that neither of them would be able to breach the other’s physique if they merely exchanged blows using their raw power.

“I was just about to suggest this,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Bright Jade Technique!” the Stone Emperor roared. His two fists had been as smooth as jade before, yet at this moment, they suddenly became completely transparent. Streaks of divine patterns instantly materialized and covered his two fists.

Meanwhile, the blue divine pattern on Ling Han’s fist lit up.

Zi, zi, zi!

Lightning crackled around his fists. This wasn’t ordinary lightning, but divine lightning!

“F*ck!” The Stone Emperor was just about to launch his fist, yet he immediately pulled back.

Even he was apprehensive of the divine lightning from heavenly tribulation.

“You don’t want to fight anymore?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“No, we’ll continue!” the Stone Emperor said stubbornly. He strode forward and threw an aggressive punch.

Ling Han replied with a punch of his own.

Peng!

Their fists collided, and the collision this time was even more devastating. This was because they had both unleashed the power of Regulations. This was not only a collision of power, but also a collision of Regulations.

Zi!

Lightning arced up the Stone Emperor’s fist and toward his arm.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The sleeve on his arm instantly disintegrated into ashes. When the lightning traveled up to his shoulder and tried to course through his body, the treasured robe that he was wearing suddenly lit up and prevented the lightning from traveling any further.

Ling Han and the Stone Emperor both retreated. After unleashing their secret techniques, their battle prowess was naturally manyfold more powerful than before.

The Stone Emperor raised his hand, only to see that his jade-like fist was fractured and bleeding azure blood. This blood smelled especially fragrant.

This was his blood. However, because he was a Rock Spirit—well, he was largely a Rock Spirit, but just not as pure as his father—his blood was actually an extremely rare spiritual liquid. This was an astonishingly beneficial tonic.

The Stone Emperor was stunned. Although he had been wounded before, this was the first time he had been wounded by the fists of someone at the same cultivation level as him.

‘F*ck! This human’s fists are actually tougher than my fists?’

He looked at Ling Han, only to see that his fists were still intact and unscathed.

Ling Han sniffed, then stared at the Stone Emperor’s hand, and said, “That, um... don’t waste the spiritual liquid. Use a vial to collect it.”

The Stone Emperor’s face scrunched up in anger, and he shouted, “That’s my blood!”

“I know! That’s why I’m telling you not to waste it! It’s flowed out anyway, so you might as well give it to me.” Ling Han cracked a harmless smile.

“You bastard!” the Stone Emperor shouted in fury. There was a flash of light, and his fist immediately started to heal at a surprisingly quick speed. He was the descendant of a Rock Spirit, and thus he possessed a sturdy physique as well as an astonishing recovery ability.

“Come again!” he roared as he waved his fists. He refused to believe that he, a Rock Spirit, would lose to a human in close-quarters combat.

“As you wish. However, if you lose, you’ve got to give me a vial of spiritual liquid,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“That’s my blood!” the Stone Emperor stressed.

“I know! Why are you being so stingy? If you want, I can also give some of my blood to you,” Ling Han said casually.

“Fine! If you can defeat me, I’ll give you a vial of my... spiritual liquid!” The Stone Emperor was furious, and his robe that was knitted from Phoenix Blood True Gold started to glow as he swung his fists. Not only could this robe increase his defenses, but it could even raise his power by a certain amount.

After all, this was a robe that was knitted from Saintly Material. Even though it was suppressed to the Mountain River Tier at this moment, it was still incredibly powerful.
