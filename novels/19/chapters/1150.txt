Chapter 1151: Might of King tier

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Wu Zhe shot out a palm strike, and it was as if the sky had collapsed, and like a star had fallen.

Peng!

Su Jing was instantly sent flying. Although he had once been praised as a king tier in the young generation, showed disdain for his peers, and had even managed to trample all over the elites of the Mountain River Tier from the previous generation, against a true king tier, he could only accept his defeat.

After all, Wu Zhe had formed his fifth Mountain River, and this was a qualitative domination. He was really too strong.

However, it was not that Su Jing did not have a chance to catch up, or even surpass his opponent. As long as he, too, could form his fifth Mountain River, anything was possible. But before that, he could only admit his defeat.

“Senior Brother Disciple Wu, I, too, would like to ask for your guidance.” Shao Sisi nimbly walked down into the arena.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel gloomy. Why did everyone have to fight over the chance to fight with him?

‘Forget it, you guys go ahead.’

When no one was left to challenge Wu Zhe, he would make his move.

Wu Zhe looked at Shao Sisi, a stunned light flashing in his eyes.

Beautiful women were a resource, but they were very common. After all, the population of the Immortal Realm was too large, so a few great beauties could still be found somewhere. However, a beautiful woman that had the three merits of being incredibly talented in martial arts world, having potential to become a king tier, and coming from a powerful background was definitely a scarce resource.

This beauty in front of him possessed all those merits, so she naturally would make men fall in love with her. It could be claimed that even if her cultivation level was slightly lower, and her natural talent slightly weaker, she could still make many men willingly fall at her feet.

“Junior Sister, please!” Wu Zhe’s tone was gentle, exhibiting the tender and kind nature of a Senior Brother.

He Tao smirked coldly. He naturally was aware of Wu Zhe’s true nature. However, he did not believe that Shao Sisi would be fooled by a few words from Wu Zhe—how could such a lovesick girl be nurtured and prioritized by her clan?

“Please do not be too strict on me, Senior Brother Disciple!” Shao Sisi bowed delicately, showing off her womanly charms to the fullest. This show of weakness would naturally not engender the disdain of others. Instead, they would only think that she was well-behaved and respectful to her seniors. Their opinion of her would rise accordingly.

A great many men were looking at her, captivated. Only Gan Shiyun was spitting internally, because this was a trick that she, too, liked to use.

True enough, Wu Zhe’s expression became even more indulgent, and his smile widened as he said, “Junior Sister, please.”

Shao Sisi’s hands shook, and she actually drew a long spear. It was as long as nine meters, and when she wielded it, it added a sordierly yet beautiful air to her bearing. Added with the fact that she was extraordinarily beautiful in the first place, she was even more attractive than before.

Even one with Wu Zhe’s mental state could not help but feel his heart throb. The others, who were even more unable to bear it, even swallowed.

“Go!” Shao Sisi wielded her spear, and began her attack on Wu Zhe. The spear spat out lightning, and it was like a dragon of lightning, extremely frightening.

“En?” Wu Zhe was slightly stunned. Her abilities really could not be underestimated. Whoever thought she only had beauty and was a mere pretty face would be making a serious mistake.

The spear pierced towards him, and one lightning bolt after another appeared from the body of the spear. They formed multiple snakes of lightning that spat out the fury of lightning at Wu Zhe.

“Quite interesting,” Wu Zhe commented, smiling.

If he had not formed his fifth Mountain River, then he would really have been flustered by this strike in front of him. This woman could definitely become a formidable opponent to him. However, at present, his abilities were far above hers.

Someone who had not formed the fifth Mountain River could definitely not imagine how powerful this cultivation level was!

He merely pushed out with his right hand. Weng, a navy blue hand of Origin Power appeared, and grabbed out at the spear. A mighty aura rolled out without bounds, and instantly suppressed Shao Sisi’s own aura.

This really was not fearing someone who didn’t know what was what, but fearing to be compared.

When Shao Sisi made her move just now, all were shaken. Who would dare to underestimate this woman? But as Wu Zhe made his own move forcefully, it completely suppressed Shao Sisi’s performance.

This gap was really not just a little bit.

Boom!

The giant hand fell, and the spear’s course was suddenly blocked. Then, it actually twisted as if it could not endure the massive pressure, and was about to break at any moment from the force.

Shao Sisi gave a soft shout, and endless flashes of lighting surged all over her body, her power spiking suddenly.

“Junior Sister’s abilities and talent are extremely impressive. Unfortunately, there is still a large gap between you and me. Without forming your fifth Mountain River, you are ultimately still a mortal.” Wu Zhe stretched out a hand and pushed at empty air. The might of that large hand abruptly rose further, and forcefully pushed back at Shao Sisi.

A frightening power attacked, and Shao Sisi hurriedly shook her right hand. The spear actually broke apart by itself. However, it was not broken, but had rather formed a shield in front of her, blocking this attack from Wu Zhe.

So it seemed that her spear had not been forged out from a single piece of Godly metal, but rather had been formed from innumerable small chains locking together. It could change form according to her will.

Shua, Shao Sisi’s right hand waved, and the shield once again formed a spear, which she brandished towards Wu Zhe.

“Hahaha!” Wu Zhe laughed loudly, not worried in the slightest. The large hand continued to fall, and suppressed Shao Sisi to the point that she had no choice but to admit her defeat in just a few moves.

Du An, Luo Jingren, Xia Wuque, and the others walked down into the arena to challenge him in succession, but they were all easily defeated by Wu Zhe, who showed the might of a king tier to the fullest.

“As expected of Senior Brother Disciple Wu, he is too strong!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“So one could really form the fifth Mountain River in the Mountain River Tier! I have always thought that this was a mere rumor.”

“No wonder Senior Brother Disciple Wu can become a king tier. After he formed the fifth Mountain River, he could practically be considered to have achieved the Sun Moon Tier. It is a definite one-sided domination over other Mountain River Tier cultivators.”

“I don’t know if there is anyone who could take 10 moves from Senior Brother Disciple Wu.”

“What a joke. Have you seen any Mountain River Tier cultivator being able to take 10 moves from a Sun Moon Tier elite? It is definitely impossible!”

Everyone was filled with praise, and did not hide their admiration for Wu Zhe. Indeed, it was really too difficult to form the fifth Mountain River.

Yet Su Jing merely hummed quietly, and said, “If it is merely a question of taking 10 moves, I feel that there is one person who is completely capable of accomplishing that!”

Shao Sisi’s eyes lit up immediately, and quipped, “That’s right!”

Du An nodded as well, and said, “If that person was able to come, then there really would be a possibility that he could force Senior Brother Disciple Wu to use more than 100 moves.”

Everyone was shocked. Who would they be speaking of that had managed to obtain the unanimous admiration of a few seed-level prodigies?

“Oh, and who is this person?” Wu Zhe asked with a smile, but there was a sliver of disdain in the depths of his gaze. What a joke; without forming the fifth Mountain River, who would be able to be a match for him?

“Ling Han!” Shao Sisi, Du An, Su Jing, and the others replied simultaneously.

“Perhaps the battle wouldn’t be resolved even with 100 moves; it may have to be dragged to more than 1,000 moves.” Even Xia Wuque spoke up. It was slightly unexpected that he would actually have such a high opinion of Ling Han.

Wu Zhe couldn’t help but get irritated. The battle wouldn’t be resolved even with 1,000 moves? What kind of jokes were they spouting!?

The Rain Emperor and Ding Ping shared a look. One broke into a slight smile, while the other was incredibly proud.

“Oh, and who could this Ling Han be that he would be described so amazingly by Junior Sister and Junior Brother Disciples? Why have I not seen him come to the sect?” Wu Zhe asked.

Shao Sisi shook her head, and replied, “When the large galactic tomb opened, he had entered with us. He even agreed to reunite with us in the Majestic Heaven Sect, but I never thought that there would be no signs of him after our last meeting. This is really odd.”

“Hahahaha!” All of a sudden, a few seeds laughed loudly. The conversation had carried on for so long, and that person they spoke of hadn’t even managed to enter the sect? Was he even qualified to be considered a prodigy?
