3081 Self-Destruction of Hysteria

Hysteria… was self-destructing!

A column of blindingly brilliant light soared into the air, forcing even Ling Han to shut his eyes lest he be blinded.

In the next instant, however, he immediately started to move.

He flew toward Lin Luo and the others, directly grabbing them and putting them under his protection.

Boom!

Behind him, a devastating shock wave roared over, much like a tsunami wave crashing toward a shore. He was directly sent flying.

Ling Han defended with his full strength, with his Powers of Dimension from tens of millions of dimensions intertwining into a web that blocked the petrifying shock wave behind him.

Hysteria’s self-destruction had ignited a catastrophic explosion.

The entire Genesis World had been engulfed by Hysteria, so upon self-destructing, this was equivalent to the entire Genesis World being ignited at once. Moreover, this was a Genesis World that had been compressed into a single dimension. Thus, the scale of the explosion was naturally even more devastating.

It was clear that Ling Han couldn’t withstand such a powerful explosion. Instead, he could only go with the flow and choose to be sent flying by the overwhelming shock waves of the explosion. If he dared to resist, he would be severely wounded even if he weren’t killed. At the same time, the majority of people in the dimensions inside him would also be killed.

Rumble…

All that remained in the void was a series of deafening explosions and rumbles. As the explosive shock waves ripped through the void, even the void storms were comprehensively reduced to nothingness.

This was no longer a matter of how far Ling Han was sent flying. Instead, it was a matter of how long Ling Han was carried by this explosive shock wave from Hysteria’s self-destruction.

A whopping 100,000,000 years!

Who could’ve imagined this? The humongous explosion caused by Hysteria’s self-destruction had lasted an insane 100,000,000 years! Only after all these years did the energy windstorm finally start to subside.

Ling Han stood still and unclenched his hands, releasing Lin Luo and the others.

“We need to go back!” Ling Han said.

With a stomp of his foot, a giant pair of wings unfurled behind him. It was created by a combination of fundamental power and Powers of Dimension. With a flap of his wings, his speed immediately reached an incredible level, rapidly bringing him back to the location where Hysteria had self-destructed.

Lin Luo and the others quickly followed after him. Perhaps there could exist huge gulfs between the battle prowess of different Seventh Tier elites. However, their speed was something that wouldn’t differ by much. Ling Han was indeed slightly quicker than them, but only by a small margin.

Another 100,000,000 years passed, and Ling Han and the others finally arrived back at their original location.

Following Hysteria’s self-destruction, even the energy windstorms in the void were reduced to nothingness. However, the void was far too large, so it was most likely only a matter of time before the storms of energy from other locations slowly permeated this area again. At that time, everything would return to normal.

Many years into the future, perhaps a new Genesis World would be born again.

Death was the conclusion of life, yet death itself was not an absolute conclusion. Instead, it represented a new beginning.

Where Hysteria had stood before, there was surprisingly a fuzzy door. Looking at this door, it was as if they could vaguely see the world that lay behind it. In terms of what actually existed in this world, however, they were at a complete loss.

Was this… the so-called door that would lead them out of this small pond?

Above this door, there also hovered a golden orb that was spinning and occasionally releasing a beam of light that illuminated the void.

Whoosh!

Extermination, Chong Yan, and the others also flew over. Excitement and anticipation appeared on their faces when they saw the fuzzy door and the golden orb above it.

Were these the things that they were after?

Whoosh!

Another figure flew over from some other direction.

Ling Han turned around, and he couldn’t help but feel astonished. This wasn’t a person, but instead a golden octopus. It was approximately nine meters long, and its eight tentacles swayed under its body.

Hysteria?

This was indeed Hysteria, even though his body was countless times smaller than before. It actually hadn’t died?

“Extermination!!” the octopus bellowed as it glowered at Extermination. Its tentacles flicked through the air, and it appeared as furious as could be.

Extermination swept her gaze over it, and said, “Oh, so you also had a hidden backup plan. You hid your true core inside your colossal body, so even after it was destroyed, you were still able to manifest your true core and stay alive.”

“Hmph! After being destroyed by the Genesis World of the last era, how could I not have a backup plan?” Hysteria humphed coldly.

“Anyway, it’s also good that you didn’t die. Personally killing you will give me a great sense of achievement!” Extermination said. She suddenly reached over, with her target being the golden orb above the fuzzy door.

“In your dreams!” Ling Han shouted as he directly charged over, throwing a fist at the same time.

After going through all this trouble, Extermination’s true aim was most likely this golden orb, right?

He definitely couldn’t let her succeed.

Whoosh!

Hysteria also moved, brandishing its tentacles as it charged over.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The three elites became engaged in an intense battle.

Hysteria had definitely been the most powerful of the three before, yet its dimensional-level self-destruction had naturally changed the situation. Even though its true core wasn’t destroyed, the new body that it had manifested was a million times weaker than before.

In terms of raw power, it was even weaker than Extermination now.

On the flip side, however, it was no longer a dimension.

What did this signify?

This signified that it could use Heavenly Venerable Seals!

Weng!

Only a single symbol lit up on its body, yet this symbol alone was able to increase its power by countless folds. As it lashed out with its tentacles, it was surprisingly able to unleash a battle prowess equivalent to one-tenth of its prime.

Just like Ling Han, it had also mastered all of the Heavenly Venerable Seals.

This was easily understandable. Just how long had it lived for? And just what kind of existence was it? Would it have been difficult to deduce all of the Heavenly Venerable Seals?

However, it was still Ling Han who had the upper hand. His power was the greatest, so neither Hysteria nor Extermination was able to rival his powerful punches.

Peng, peng!

The two ultimate elites were continuously sent flying by him.

Right now, there was no one who could rival Ling Han. He was the undisputed number one elite in the world.

After scheming for so long, was Extermination truly going to end up empty-handed? Were all her efforts truly to no avail?

Extermination unleashed a long cry before dashing toward the golden orb.

“Not so fast!” Ling Han said coldly. He dashed over and threw a punch.

Peng!

Extermination was surprisingly smashed into pieces.

Ling Han was astonished. Even though his punches were powerful, they shouldn’t have been powerful enough to shatter her. After all, that was Extermination!

Sure enough, Extermination’s shattered body continued to dash toward the fuzzy door. With the golden orb at the center, her shattered body then started to knit back together.

“Haha! The secret of the world is mine!” she laughed, with her raven hair fluttering in the wind.

“Extermination!” Chong Yan and the others howled. They were all filled with raging fury.

Before allying with her, it had been agreed that they would also obtain a portion of this treasure. This was a crucial treasure that would decide whether they could advance to the Eighth Tier or not.

“Did you people really think that I would honor my promises and dao oaths?” Extermination asked. She roared with laughter, and continued smugly, “Bunch of fools. If I advance to the Eighth Tier and jump out of this world, will the so-called dao oaths still be able to constrain me?”

Extermination was truly a shrewd and scheming person. She screwed people over no matter who they were. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ling Han charged over, and roared, “If dao oaths can’t constrain you, then let me blast you into oblivion!”

He threw a furious punch at Extermination.

The two of them became locked in a fierce battle again. However, after swallowing that golden orb, Extermination’s power surprisingly started to rise explosively in an exponential manner. Boundless energy rolled through the void, funneling into Extermination’s body.

“Hahaha! Once I absorb the power of this entire void, I’ll obtain the power to shatter that door and enter a new world!” Extermination laughed heartily, with a smug expression on her face.

Everything was under her control, from the beginning to the end.
