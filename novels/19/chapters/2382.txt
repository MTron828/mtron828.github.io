Chapter 2383: Reason for the calamity

In the younger generation of the Kong Clan, Kong Xiang’s natural talent was not too weak. Though he had only been cultivating for just over 100,000 years, he was shockingly already a Fourth Severance. This spear was extremely frightening. As the seals lit up one after another, it seemed capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.

Hu, Ling Han blew out a breath of air, and a gust of wind surged out.

Kong Xiang’s charge immediately came to an abrupt stop. His whole person seemed like he was in slow motion. He was taking steps with great difficulty, and the clothing that he was wearing was also torn to shreds by the terrifying force of the gust, instantly turning him naked.

As the gust swept past, Kong Xiang suddenly stumbled, almost dropping onto the ground.

When he discovered the embarrassing state he was in, he hurriedly moved to cover the spot between his legs, but when he realized that even if he had managed to cover the front, there was nothing covering his back, his grip on the spear couldn’t help but loosen as he used the other hand to cover his behind.

His face was completely flushed red, and he felt that Ling Han was really too immoral to actually use such an underhanded trick.

He was too shameless!

Ling Han laughed loudly. “No need to cover it. It’s not that much bigger than an ant, so there is no need to worry that it would be seen at all.”

“Y-y-y-you!” Kong Xiang pointed his finger at Ling Han, but when he pointed, he realized that he was about to reveal himself again. Quickly, he withdrew his hand, his face bright red as he wanted nothing more than for there to be a hole in the ground where he could bury himself in.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire sighed, and said, “Ling Han, this person is only a Fourth Severance, but the Kong Clan has many elites, so run faster! Will you do it if I call you big brother?”

“I am your big brother in the first place.” Ling Han grinned. He clapped a hand on the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. Big Brother will protect you.”

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was depressed. “I have already warned you. If you are captured, hung up, and beaten, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

“Didn’t I say that I would hand you over if I was outmatched?” Ling Han began to tease him again.

“Scram!” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire rolled his eyes at him.

Kong Xiang quickly took out clothing from his Spatial God Tool which he changed into, and breathed a sigh of relief. He picked up his spear again as he glared furiously at Ling Han. If eyes could kill, Ling Han should have died countless times over.

He did not dare to make any further moves rashly. Though Ling Han had not revealed his strength previously, Kong Xiang had been forced to a stop with just a breath of air from the former, and it even tore his clothes to shreds. This strength was definitely superior to his, and it was not just by a little bit, either.

It should be known that the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was an Immortal Palace Tier, so based on the fact that Ling Han could be friends with him, he, too, should be an Immortal Palace Tier as well.

Losing at the hand of someone like this, there was no need for him to feel ashamed.

As he sent out a signal for reinforcements, he kept his eyes on Ling Han, and demanded, “Who are you? To dare trifle with our Kong Clan, do you dare to announce your name?”

Ling Han smiled faintly. “Originally, a minor character like you would not be worthy of talking to me, but who asked that I am not the type to put on any airs? My name is Ba.”

“Ba?” Kong Xiang mumbled as he searched through his knowledge to see if there was someone who matched that name.

“Yes, good son.” Ling Han nodded.

F*ck, he had been tricked!

Kong Xiang glared at Ling Han furiously, and even his hair stood on ends. He felt that Ling Han was really too despicable. He was clearly an Immortal Palace Tier, yet had actually taken advantage of him, a mere Fourth Severance, repeatedly. How could he do that? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Just how did you make enemies of the Kong Clan?” Ling Han paid no further regard to Kong Xiang. There was really no need for him to take such a minor character to heart.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was glum. ‘Could you find a different time and place to ask this question, you curious brat? I’ve already told you that we need to flee, we need to flee. Why do you not listen at all?’

“Remember how I was hunted, and forced to flee into the Lower Realm?” He still explained, or he would feel uncomfortable.

Ling Han gave an “oh.” “It has something to do with the Kong Clan.”

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire nodded. “That was a matter of several hundred million years ago. I obtained a treasure map, yet the ancestor of the Kong Clan got wind of it, and thus pursued me. Though I managed to fortunately escape with my life, the treasure map still fell into the hands of the ancestor of the Kong Clan.”

This could be imagined. In the past, when the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire fled into the Lower Realm, he was only left with a sliver of divine sense. A great Immortal Palace Tier elite actually needed the Lower Realm to help him gather materials to rebuild his body, which showed how miserable he had once been. The treasure map being snatched away was also within reason.

“Then the reason why you have come here was to take back your treasure map?” Ling Han asked.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire shook his head. “It’s already been so many years, and the Kong Clan must have taken out the treasure by now. Moreover, the Kong Clan had previously just been an ordinary four-star force, with only a single Ascending Origin Tier, yet now there are as many as over 100 of them.”

He paused. “This must be linked to that treasure trove.”

Ling Han agreed. If nothing unusual happened, how could an ordinary four-star force possibly leap to the top tier with a single bound?

A horse couldn’t get fat without an extra ration, and a man couldn’t get rich without an extra income.

Furthermore, he was sure that the Kong Clan would have obtained one to two Celestial Kings by now if it were not for the fact that it was required to walk the Celestial Path to become a Celestial King.

The treasure trove that they had obtained had really been useful!

“I am indeed dissatisfied, but I have not yet cultivated to the Ascending Origin Tier, so I naturally could not have come to deliver myself to death. I merely wanted to observe the situation. However, I mistakenly befriended a vile character, and leaked the secret of my identity. In the end, the Kong Clan captured me, and I suffered great torture. I have already been hung up there for over 10,000 years.”

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire sighed, feeling a coldness from being unable to bring himself to look back on his past.

It had been 10,000 years, and merely being hung on the flagpole, exposed to the elements, and being mocked and ridiculed was not something a proud prodigy could bear, what more when restrictions had been placed on him as he was constantly enduring a great agony.

Ling Han gave an “oh.” This Kong Clan was truly cruel. They were truly the typical standard to kill others for the sake of treasure. But in the greater environment of the Celestial Realm, this kind of situation seemed to be commonplace, and most people would choose this course of action.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?Another few figures appeared. The reinforcements from the Kong Clan had arrived.

This time, a few Immortal Palace Tiers had arrived. Though they were strong, because Three Cloud City was really too big, the journey here would also require a long period of time. Even if they had gotten the news and set out immediately, it was only now that they finally reached their destination.

“Ninth Elder! Eleventh Elder! Nineteenth Elder!” Kong Xiang quickly called out. As he saw so many elites come all at once, his confidence was immediately replenished.

A middle-aged man’s eyes swept over Ling Han’s face as quick as lightning. It was like a bolt out of the blue, capable of causing blindness. He humphed heavily. “Who are you, to actually dare interfere in the matters of our Kong Clan?”

“Can’t it be that I am just intervening because I can’t bear the injustice?” Ling Han smiled, and pointed at himself. “A real man does not change his name. My name is Ba!”

“Ba?” This middle-aged man was also duped. He murmured this word, mulling over this name.

“Good son.” Ling Han nodded.

Only now did the middle-aged man realize that he had been tricked. He couldn’t help but fly into a rage, his expression darkening quickly. “You actually dare to play such tricks in front of me; how preposterous!”

“No need to waste words on him. Let’s just take him down directly, and hang them both at the city gates,” another middle-aged man said. He was short in build, but his aura was considerably astonishing. He was like a wild beast, and one would feel a chill rise up from the bottom of one’s heart with just a look from him.

“All right!” The first middle-aged man nodded. He stretched out a hand to grab Ling Han, and this turned into a giant black-colored hand. The mystical power of Immortal Palace Tier blazed. This blow was extremely terrifying.

He did not underestimate Ling Han, because based on Kong Xiang’s report, Ling Han was definitely in the Immortal Palace Tier.
