Chapter 2586: Hunted by Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King lashed out, grabbing at Ling Han.

Ling Han was extremely powerful and freakish, yet he was still no match for Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings as a Fourth Heaven Celestial King. Each subsequent Heaven was a completely different level. Right now, he could already challenge those three Heavens above him, but this naturally couldn’t be extended without limits.

Fortunately, he had already prepared for this moment long ago. The instant that the colossal hand appeared, he had already grabbed Little Terror and tossed him into his Spatial Celestial Tool. He then stepped forward, activating his teleportation skills. With a flash, he had already appeared in the distance.

Peng!

The colossal hand missed its target. However, it still flattened numerous houses, killing many who weren’t even aware of what was going on.

Some Celestial Kings were fortunate enough to survive, only suffering severe wounds. They groaned as they lay in the ruins, their faces filled with confusion. Just whom had they provoked to bring down such a harsh punishment?

This was the Celestial King Graveyard, where elites could act as they pleased.

“Humph!” There was a cold humph as the Ninth Heaven Celestial King attacked again. Another colossal hand appeared, casting a shadow over the entire Ghost King City.

Could Ling Han still escape?

This was naturally impossible. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King had already lashed out and more so locked his divine sense onto him. Ling Han was indeed quick, yet he was definitely not quicker than a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Thus, with a twist, Ling Han immediately descended to the ground.

Upon landing, he immediately activated the Heaven Deceiving Technique, instantly transforming his appearance and aura. It was as if he had become a completely different person.

He quickly mingled together with the crowd of shivering people. They were all terrified by the grand might of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

This was inside the city, where the terrain was extremely complicated. Thus, Ling Han could hide in any random building.

The Ninth Heaven Celestial King didn’t slam his hand down. After all, his colossal hand was covering the entire Ghost King City this time, so if he truly slammed it down, he would kill at least 90 percent of the residents. Even he couldn’t endure such a heavy loss.

In reality, most wealth was created by ordinary people. Here, moreover, the lower-level Celestial Kings were also involved in another big secret. He couldn’t massacre them as he pleased.

Whoosh!

A figure strode over in the sky, his body surrounded by nine ribbons of iridescent light.

He was none other than Lu Gaoquan, Lu Li’s father. After Lu Li had fled back to him, he had immediately used his divine sense to scan the entire city, quickly discovering Ling Han. He had then wanted to immediately lash out to capture Ling Han.

However, because of the great distance, he was ultimately unable to unleash his full might. It was because of this that Ling Han had managed to dodge his attack. Otherwise, how could a measly Fourth Heaven Celestial King dodge the attack of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Lu Gaoquan stood with his hands behind his back as he scoured every inch of dirt. He was intent on capturing Ling Han.

“My respects to Lord Lu!” the Yin River Celestial King said and clasped his hands as he flew over. He was the disciple of the Azure Ghost Celestial King, and he was also a Seventh Heaven Celestial King to begin with, so he didn’t need to show too much respect and fear before Lu Gaoquan.

Lu Gaoquan nodded, and said, “Where did this young man come from? He was actually able to evade my attack?”

“He’s called Li Long, and he is a traitorous disciple from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy,” the Yin River Celestial King replied. “Not long ago, he displayed his brilliant battle prowess at the Tournament of Death.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

This was all the information he had.

Lu Gaoquan was astonished, saying, “You already rushed over, yet you still couldn’t capture him?” He wasn’t demeaning the Yin River Celestial King. Instead, he was genuinely astounded.

A monarch tier at the Seventh Heaven had actually failed to capture a Fourth Heaven Celestial King? Who could believe this?

The Yin River Celestial King felt his face heat up, and he said, “The culprit had a Celestial Tool, so I didn’t dare to face him head-on.”

Apart from Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, who dared to face Celestial Tools head-on?

However, Lu Gaoquan was still unable to accept this. This was a gulf of three entire minor levels, so it was akin to an adult man bullying a six-year-old child. Thus, victory would still be easy even if the child were wielding a blade. The adult would simply need to be slightly more cautious.

However, the Yin River Celestial King had actually failed to contain Ling Han? This could only signify one thing. Ling Han’s battle prowess was unfathomable.

In fact, this could also be seen from the fact that Ling Han had dodged Lu Gaoquan’s attack just then. That had been an attack of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Several more figures dashed over, all of them surrounded by nine ribbons of iridescent light. These people were naturally the paramount higher-ups of Ghost King City. Just then, they had naturally been alarmed by Lu Gaoquan’s colossal hand that had covered the entire city.

“Lord Tang, I’m afraid that I have bad news for you,” the Yin River Celestial King said to one of the elites. “Your son was killed, and the culprit was none other than his own Blood Martial King. Right now, he’s hiding somewhere below us.”

Tang Mingbo instantly erupted in flames. He was crazy with fury, and he immediately unleashed a violent attack at the ground beneath them.

Since the culprit was below them, he would kill everyone in the surroundings! Innocent people? Did that have anything to do with him?

It was incredibly difficult for Celestial Kings to have offspring. He had already lived for several epochs, and it was only after entering the Celestial King Graveyard that he had finally had his own children. Thus, he naturally doted them to the heavens and back.

However, the other Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings hurriedly stepped forward to stop him.

“Brother Tang, don’t be rash!”

“We naturally have to avenge your son’s death. However, we have to minimize the damage that we cause. Otherwise, we’ll all be in big trouble.”

“He’s nothing more than a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, so we can definitely find him if we dig 10 meters into the earth. Moreover, Brother Tang, don’t you think that it’s too merciful to kill the culprit in a single strike?”

Under their persuasion, Tang Mingbo finally agreed to cease his attack. With a dash, he immediately descended to the ground.

“Come out, all of you! I’ll give you three seconds. Otherwise, I’ll kill everyone still in hiding!” he said in a baleful voice. His voice boomed through the surroundings, reaching every nook and cranny.

One, two, three.

Three seconds passed by in a flash, and figure after figure dashed over from all directions. They were all stern as they stood before Tang Mingbo, and each of them stood relatively far from one another.

This was the Celestial King Graveyard, where each person only believed themself. Thus, who dared to stand too close to another person? Were they not afraid of being suddenly killed?

Being killed here would be completely futile and worthless.

Tang Mingbo swept his gaze over them. They all wore expressions of respect and fear, and there was also a hint of confusion on their faces. They weren’t feeling pure fear. He furrowed his brows, and said, “Confirm your identities with each other. Point at the people that you recognize.”

He was confident that Ling Han would definitely be exposed if he were hiding among these people. After all, none of these people would be familiar with him. At that time, the odd person out would be the culprit that he sought.

However, he had clearly underestimated the cautious nature of these people.

This was the Celestial King Graveyard, so who would make friends and socialize for no reason?

Elites like him were naturally different. People would become his followers, so he could naturally build his own force. However, ordinary people could only rely on themselves and treat everyone else as an enemy. They wouldn’t make any contact with other people.

Thus, only a measly few dozen people confirmed the identities of each other. Meanwhile, the large majority of people remained silent and unmoving.

‘F*ck!’

Tang Mingbo almost swore in frustration. This was his “brilliant plan,” yet it had proven to be a foolish endeavor in the end.

He was just about to speak, yet his expression suddenly faltered. A cold smile spread across his face, and he said, “I told everyone to come out just then. Haha! Did you think I wouldn’t discover you if you hid?”

He ferociously grabbed at a building.
