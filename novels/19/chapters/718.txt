Chapter 719: Formation Sword?

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

After entering the tool pavilion, they were in a hall with stairs leading to the second floor on both sides. Judging from the height of this floor, the tool pavilion was probably five stories tall.

“What weapon do you use?” A voice sounded next to Ling Han’s ear.

“Hmm?” Ling Han was startled, and said to everyone, “Did you guys all hear that sound?”

“I heard it, it asked me what weapon I use,” everyone said.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Sword!”

Xiu , just as he’d finished speaking, his figure disappeared from the hall and appeared in a sealed room. The door was tightly shut, and it seemed that he was directly teleported in here.

For an ancient dynasty, such a method wasn’t unusual.

Ling Han didn’t panic. By the looks of it now, everyone was transported to a different room because of the different weapons they used. However, why weren’t the ones who used swords together?

This probably had to do with their record. The better their record, the more advanced the room they could enter. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He looked around and saw an empty stone room; in the middle of it was a stone table with a sword in a scabbard. Even if the sword was not out of its sheath, Ling Han could sense a terrifyingly vicious Qi hitting his face; it was full of danger.

A swordsman’s weapon!

Ling Han was shocked. It wasn’t like he’d never seen treasured swords—he even had a tenth tier Spirit Tool in his hand, but just from this vicious Qi alone, the Demon Birth Sword was far from being comparable to this sword.

It was like this sword had been made for killing.

Ling Han walked over, but when he was three meters away, this sword popped out of its sheath. Leaving roughly thirty centimeters, and weng , seven sword lights intertwined and charged towards him.

The power of these sword lights was only at the Spiritual Infant Tier, which was the same as his tier. Ling Han was obviously unafraid, and crossed his arms in front of him to take this blow head on.

Pu!

His body was forced back a distance of seven steps, and seven wounds shockingly appeared on his arms, gushing out red blood.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be greatly surprised. What was his physique? It was comparable to eighth-tier rare metals. Theoretically, it was very very hard for even Deity Transformation Tier attacks to deal damage to him, but this was only seven Spiritual Infant Tier sword lights, yet they made him bleed. How could this not be surprising?

Power didn’t represent battle prowess, and represented destructive power even less.

Ling Han knew this very well.

For example, using the same power, if one hit wood with an iron rod, compared to hitting wood with an axe, would damage dealt be equal?

Power was only a part of it.

Ling Han revealed a smile. He wanted this sword, so he had to conquer this sword first?

Interesting.

He was in the Spiritual Infant Tier, so this sword could only display Spiritual Infant Tier power, fighting him on the same tier. However, battle prowess was uncertain. This sword light was filled with destructive power, and if his physique was still at the Iron Sheet Tier, forcibly taking that blow would definitely have severed his arm, or even his entire body.

Like him, at the Spiritual Infant Tier, yet it could kill those in the Deity Transformation Tier!

“Haha, fighting in the same tier? Then let’s compare!” Ling Han charged out. He was quite interested in this sword—could it also be a tenth tier Spirit Tool, being able to strike out such fierce sword light?

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu, flash after flash, sword light shot out, striking him.

Ling Han swung his fists to parry. The sword lights were truly fierce, the power of each reaching peak stage of the Spiritual Infant Tier, and its lethality far surpassed it—even his physique could be injured—but that was all. He cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and his physique was like an indestructible diamond.

He stared at that sword. There were many patterns on the blade, but they weren’t martial intent; they were formation patterns!

Although his formation level hadn’t improved much, it wasn’t hard to make such a judgement.

This wasn’t a Spirit Tool, but a... formation’s eye?

Ling Han was really shocked this time. Could this sword be a formation that was taking the initiative to attack him?

Pu, pu, pu, pu, blood constantly splashed across his body. This formation sword was really too terrifying, cutting him so that he bled ceaselessly and couldn’t get close.

He activated the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven and used the Demon Fairy Step, no longer fighting the sword lights recklessly; this would bring no results. In terms of power, this sword was at the advantage, and he would only be knocked back.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, the sword lights shot out, but Ling Han traveled freely through the gaps between them, steadily approaching the sword.

When Ling Han was only a step away from this sword, the entire blade popped out of its sheath, and a dazzling light instantly soared into the sky, its baleful presence ablaze.

With each sword light repeated seven times, a total of 49 flashes of sword light shot out simultaneously and intertwined into a dense web, forcing Ling Han back again.

Apparently, pressured by Ling Han, this sword also unleashed stronger might.

Its power was still in the Spiritual Infant Tier, but its destructive power increased by a whole lot.

Ling Han’s arm was struck by the sword once again. This time, the wound was much deeper, almost to the bone.

The sword was suspended in the sky as if an invisible hand was controlling it. Then, the sword point pointed at Ling Han and emitted a threatening chill.

“What level formation is this exactly?” Ling Han stared at the blade’s formation patterns. He couldn’t recognize this formation at all, and only two things were certain. Firstly, its power was terrifyingly large, and if it exploded with full power, it could probably kill Shattering Void Tier elites. Secondly, this formation was flawed and incomplete.

Too shocking, an incomplete formation had such power... then how terrifying would it be when repaired?

“I’ll make you submit!” Ling Han felt a rush of haughtiness and unleashed the Demon Birth Sword. Without activating the martial intent within, he executed Mysterious Three Thousand, counterattacking against that sword.

Ling Han was afraid that the two swords would both be fully on if he activated the Demon Birth Sword’s martial intent, and then he would just be an adornment. Moreover, the Demon Birth Sword might not be able to suppress this formation sword, and he’d be doomed if it were the other way around.

As expected, as the Demon Birth Sword didn’t unleash its might, the formation sword still maintained the power of Spiritual Infant Tier, but the sword light’s destructive power was still terrifying. Ling Han reckoned that if the all the students of the Restore Heaven Academy fought together, they would still be annihilated by this sword.

Ling Han’s battle prowess was fully unleashed, with the Eye of Truth and the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven all activated, and his physical strength was also unleashed to the extreme, his battle prowess exploding. It far surpassed the Spiritual Infant Tier, and could even strike down peak stage Deity Transformation Tier elites, but against this sword, it was just on par.

No, to be correct, Ling Han was probably still at a slight disadvantage. After all, this sword suppressed its tier to fight him, and had an innate advantage.

Ling Han refused to accept it. Moreover, the stronger this sword was, the more he wanted to obtain it.

He wielded the Demon Birth Sword with his right hand and slashed out a sword light, using the power of bone symbols along with it. Moving left and right to eliminate the power in the sword light, he continued to charge forth, and even if he was bombarded by a few sword lights, he was going to grab this sword with his hand.

Without a tool spirit, he could put the sword inside the Black Tower—suppressing it would be easier this way.
