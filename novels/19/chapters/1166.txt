Chapter 1167: Forgotten The Warning Last Time?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han laughed, and then seriously said, “Shopkeeper Han, I need you to do me a favor, and that is to gather as much Level Three Godly metal as possible. Use my profits to pay for it.”

“No problem!” Han Huo cleverly did not ask why Ling Han was gathering so much Godly metal, but rather agreed immediately with confidence.

“I shall trouble you then, Shopkeeper Han!”

“I am willing to work for you, Young Master Han!”

Ling Han nodded, and bought some other materials. He still had to refine the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill; that was the source of his income.

Han Huo wiped away his sweat as he accompanied Ling Han in his selection of materials. He had not come out of the shocked state he had previously been in.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Shopkeeper Han, are you regretting our agreement from just now? You take 10% and I take 90%, so you think that it is a great loss?”

“How could that be!” Han Huo shook his head hurriedly. Though he felt great heartache, as an outstanding businessman, he knew that Ling Han could have completely not handed the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills for them to sell on his behalf.

Would they fear that no one would buy such an alchemical pill?

Just give a holler, and it was guaranteed that they would be able to sell as many as they had in their stock.

Furthermore, Ling Han had been completely capable of taking all the profits at first, yet had still deliberately let the Mo Clan Business have 10% share. This was a massive favor.

...Han Huo was naturally clear about that. Could it be that Ling Han did not have a clear understanding of his own alchemy abilities? When he absolutely knew he was able to concoct the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pills, he still let them have 10% of the profits. How many others could have done this?

“I am filled with endless gratitude for Young Master Han’s kindness!”

He did not understand why Ling Han would look after the Mo Clan Establishment so much, though.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “On my way to the Majestic Heaven Sect, someone ambushed me, and I lost my way in the galaxy. Thankfully, I encountered a trade vessel from the Mo Clan, and they did not abandon me, but rather gave me a lift.”

Only now did Han Huo understand. He couldn’t help but clasp in hands in respect, and said, “Young Master Han is really a man of character!”

To the Mo Clan, this was merely an insignificant act of lending a helping hand, yet they had obtained the friendship of a young king tier in exchange. This transaction was really too profitable. Furthermore, this was also because Ling Han knew to repay their kindness. Otherwise, if he fell out with them and became hostile, what could they do?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Shopkeeper Han, please proceed with my request as soon as possible. Don’t worry about the type of Level Three Godly metal. Even if it is old and worn, or impure, it is fine. As long as its quality has reached Level Three, it is acceptable.”

“I will take note. Please come back a month later, Young Master Han. I will definitely give you a pleasant surprise, Young Master Han,” Han Huo said confidently.

He decided to report Ling Han’s matter to the higher-ups of the Mo Clan. In the first place, a young king tier would be worth enticing, what more when it was Ling Han, a man of such character who placed importance on emotion and righteousness? He would report this to the higher-ups of the Mo Clan, and ask them to endlessly gather Godly metal for Ling Han.

Mere Level Three Godly metal was enough to obtain the friendship of a young king tier; this was really too profitable! Furthermore, Ling Han’s achievements in alchemy were really too frightening. He could concoct Level Five Divine Pills in a mere month, and it wasn’t just a single furnace’s worth!

“Hiss, I actually forgot. Young Master Han is still in Mountain River Tier, so how could he manage to concoct Level Five Divine Pills?

“Is forming the fifth Mountain River equivalent to Sun Moon Tier?

“Cultivating both alchemy and martial arts, and excelling in both. Our Mo Clan must definitely not let such a genius slip. Perhaps this young man would be able to rule the whole world. We must spare no expense to be tied to him!”

Han Huo mumbled. Though his surname was not Mo, he was still a member of the Mo Clan because he had married into the Mo Clan. His children and grandchildren all had the surname Mo.

Ling Han walked casually. Now that there was a reliable source of Godly metal, this caused him to be in a very great mood. Next, he should prepare with the matters of the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm, and when the journey to this Mystery Realm ended, he should be about ready to break through to the Sun Moon Tier.

Once he broke through to the Sun Moon Tier, he would set out to find the location of the Five Sects and the Roc Palace. He couldn’t drag things on forever.

‘Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, it’s been centuries since we’ve last met.’ Who knew how she was like now?

When she saw him once again, she would definitely be very surprised, wouldn’t she? Not only was he a dead man revived, the rate at which he advanced through the cultivation levels was practically unbelievable as well. Merely 1,000 years, and he was already in the Sun Moon Tier. This should have surpassed the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Sword Emperor.

Having been bullied by this hateful woman for a few decades, it was about time for his turn to counterattack!

How could he let her off without thrashing her pert bottom?

His son should also be quite grown by now! What about his parents? The little girl, Hu Niu, should be more and more womanly, right? What about Helian Xun Xue, Zhu Xuan Er, Liu Yu Tong, and Li Si Chan?

He sighed. Though not many years had passed in this lifetime, the emotional debts he had incurred had far surpassed those from the two centuries he had lived in his previous life.

On the way to the Majestic Heaven Sect, Ling Han decided to stuff all his romantic debts back to the bottom of his heart. In comparison, nothing was more important than the longing for power. Only with enough ability would he be able to do what he wanted to do, or it was even merely for him to be capable of breathing a few breaths of air freely.

“Han Lin!” A fierce shout rang out from afar.

He looked over, and saw that there were four people standing at the doorway to his palace. All of them looked angered, and he recognized two of them. One was Fu Liangye, whereas the other was Gai Yongsi.

Why were they here again?

“Han Lin, this is your last chance. Young Master Gao has said that if you make your way to Thousand Birds Peak on your knees today, he can forgive your previous disrespect,” Gai Yongsi declared arrogantly.

Ling Han looked at him strangely, and said, “Are you a very forgetful person? Are you asking for another beating?”

“Han Lin!” a middle-aged man spoke up, his voice deep and low like the boom of thunder. The moment he opened his mouth, a terrifying aura was released.

This was not because he was born with a domineering air, but rather because he had used the suppression ability of a superior cultivation level.

Sun Moon Tier!

No wonder Gai Yongsi was braver today. So it seemed that he had gotten a strong helper.

Meanwhile, Fu Liangye smirked coldly. He, too, had joined the Gao Faction, and when he knew that they were going to deal with Ling Han, he immediately took the initiative to ask to come along. That was because he wanted to see how Ling Han was going to yield in the face of superior power.

...It was all right even if he did not yield, as he would definitely be humiliated then!

Indeed, Sun Moon Tier cultivators could not freely make a move on Mountain River Tier cultivators. After all, not everyone’s name was Yang Hao. However, if elites of Sun Moon Tier made some moves secretly, suppressing Ling Han’s cultivation level, and then let other Mountain River Tier cultivators subdue him, who would be able to say anything?

Ling Han walked over, opened the doors, walked in, and then moved to close them.

Pu!

Gai Yongsi and the others almost went mad with fury. What did he mean? Could it be that they were empty air to be ignored just like that?

“Han Lin!!” Gai Yongsi pressed his hands on the doors, stopping Ling Han from closing the doors.

In the Majestic Heaven Sect, there was one taboo that could absolutely not be broken. Without obtaining permission, it was forbidden to enter the rooms of another. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

You could fight at other times—it was all right. After all, cultivators increased their abilities through battle. However, if one’s seclusion was disturbed, that could possibly cripple him!

This was something that the sect definitely would not allow!

Hence, usually, as long as the two sides were of equal cultivation levels, they could fight as much as they liked. There was definitely no one who would stop them, but once they returned to their quarters, which was an absolute sanctuary, none would be permitted to do anything.

Even Yang Hao would not dare to break this kind of taboo. This was the bottom line.

Thus, upon seeing Ling Han walk into his quarters, Gai Yongsi was naturally worried.

Ling Han broke into a grin, stretched out a hand to grab him, and Gai Yongsi was swiftly subdued. “Apparently, you have forgotten my warning from last time, and have come again!”
