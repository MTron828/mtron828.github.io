Chapter 2256: Might of Ji Wuming

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ji Wuming was actually at the Tenth Secret!

This was beyond everyone’s expectations. In their eyes, Ji Wuming was only on the same level as Shi Chanzi and Hong Huang. In other words, he should have only been at the Ninth Secret. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He… had a chance to turn the tide for the Celestial Realm!

However, the cultivators from the Foreign Realm simply chuckled coldly. So what if he was at the Tenth Secret? They had three Monarch Stars at the 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus! Moreover, there was also an invincible 11th layer elite!

If the Celestial Realm had possessed three Tenth Secret elites, while the Foreign Realm had only possessed one, the former could have still achieved victory through continuous battle. However, the situation was flipped around right now, so it was difficult to imagine anything other than a defeat for the Celestial Realm.

An additional challenger would only mean an additional defeat.

“You’re… quite strange!” Sen Luo said as he stared at Ji Wuming. There was a hint of apprehension in his eyes. His opponent was indeed only at the Tenth Secret, which was identical to him. However, standing before Ji Wuming, he felt a slight chill running down his back.

Ji Wuming remained silent, and his gaze was as piercing as arrows. He was brimming with killing intent.

He had fought here in his previous life, and he had done so for countless and countless years. His hatred for the Foreign Realm was deeply ingrained in his very being.

Whoosh!

He directly charged forward, swiping his palm down at Sen Luo.

Sen Luo hurriedly raised his arm to block.

Peng!

Two streaks of light collided.

Theoretically speaking, they were both at the Tenth Secret, so any exchanges between them should have been evenly matched. After all, they were both Monarch Stars, so who would be weaker than the other?

However, this was not the case!

Like a paramount Celestial Tool, Ji Wuming’s palm strike directly slammed down, ruthlessly tearing through Sen Luo’s attack as if it were butter.

Sen Luo was astounded, and he hurriedly jumped back in retreat.

Ji Wuming pursued him, his expression ice-cold as a burning killing intent emanated from his body. It was as if he had transformed into a god of slaughter.

One person fled, and one person gave chase. Sen Luo was actually no match for Ji Wuming?

The cultivators from the Foreign Realm were all shocked upon seeing this. This was far too unfathomable! In a battle at the same cultivation level, they were actually being suppressed?

That was Sen Luo, a Monarch Star!

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm hadn’t expected this, either. Ji Wuming becoming a Tenth Secret elite was already a huge surprise. However, what delighted them more was the fact that he was actually so powerful. He could suppress even Monarch Stars!

Only Ling Han didn’t find this strange. In his previous life, Ji Wuming had already been a top-notch Ninth Heaven Celestial King. As such, his battle prowess among those at the same cultivation level was naturally astonishing. If his battle prowess had remained the same after reincarnating, then what would have been the bloody point of reincarnation?

Simply put, Ji Wuming had most likely already possessed the ability to become a Heavenly Venerate in his previous life. How could such a person not be freakishly powerful after reincarnation?

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm faltered for a brief moment before immediately shouting in joy.

They could win this battle!

Moreover, this was a victory against Sen Luo, a Monarch Star at the 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ji Wuming unleashed numerous powerful attacks, and his battle prowess soared as if there were no limit.

“Huh? Why does he give me such a familiar feeling?” a Celestial King murmured. Ji Wuming’s aura and appearance were extremely unfamiliar, yet there was a strange sense of overlap with a mighty figure in his memory.

“Oh? Brother Qing Lian, you also have such a feeling?” another Celestial King remarked with a surprised expression.

“Has that mighty being returned?” a third Celestial King asked. There was fervor on his face.

In the past, that mighty figure had been far too domineering. One time, he had charged into the Foreign Realm by himself, killing three 17th Lotus elites and one 18th Lotus elite. Not only that, but he had even managed to escape from the relentless hunt of a Heavenly Venerate from the Foreign Realm. That had significantly boosted the morale of the Celestial Realm.

Of course, that mighty being had also paid a heavy price for this. According to rumors, his cultivation had been completely crippled, and he had then vanished from existence. It was said that he was cultivating in seclusion in order to recover his cultivation. No one knew where he was right now.

However, Ji Wuming’s appearance now reminded the nine Celestial Kings of that mighty being. In a battle at the same cultivation level, his battle prowess was invincible!

The Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm were also astonished by his performance. Ji Wuming was far too powerful. If he continued to develop, he would definitely become a nemesis of all Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings! No, he might even ascend to greater heights and transcend above the Regulations!

“This young man… must die!”

“That’s right, we can’t allow him to fully develop. Otherwise, he’ll definitely become a formidable foe!”

They exchanged messages using their divine senses, and they were already in unanimous agreement to kill Ji Wuming no matter what.

Ji Wuming was indeed powerful. After 1,000 or so exchanges, Sen Luo had already suffered broken hands and broken feet. If it weren’t for the interference of a Celestial King from the Foreign Realm, he would have failed to even escape from Ji Wuming’s grasp. His life would have been ended.

Ji Wuming stood still, with his hands clasped behind his back. The gentle breeze caused his robes to flutter, making him appear graceful like a celestial.

Graceful yet powerful. Admiration and adoration instantly appeared in the eyes of many women, who could barely stop themselves from throwing themselves into his arms.

“Ji Wuming!”

“Ji Wuming!”

“Ji Wuming!”

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm cheered in unison. Even the Ascending Origin Tier elites wore emotional expressions, and they willingly offered their knees to Ji Wuming—they were completely won over by him.

If Ji Wuming raised his arms and called for followers, countless people would definitely be willing to join him.

However, Ji Wuming didn’t pay any heed to this. Instead, he simply swept a cold gaze over the cultivators from the Foreign Realm, and said in a baleful voice, “Next!”

“Humph!” A woman from the Foreign Realm stepped forward. She was humanoid, and her skin was also red like her ilk. Similarly, she also had a tail. However, she had three horns on her head, and these horns were all pitch-black like ink. Meanwhile, her hairstyle was as wild as could be, and each strand was much like a braid.

Moreover, her wings were surprisingly only composed of a few bones, and as they flapped behind her, they exuded a mighty and paramount aura.

“Nai You!” the cultivators from the Foreign Realm cheered.

This was Nai You, another Monarch Star at the 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus!

Ji Wuming didn’t speak, and he simply charged forward to attack.

“I’ll send you to the afterlife!” Nai You flapped her wings, and she shot forward like a streak of light.

Peng!

Ji Wuming’s fist transformed into a claw form, and he instantly sent Nai You flying with a swipe. He immediately changed his fighting style.

This completely broke up Nai You’s rhythm. When spectating Ji Wuming’s battle against Sen Luo just then, she had already attained some level of understanding of his fighting style. From this, she had then developed a tactic to target him. In fact, she had even received some secret guidance from the Celestial Kings.

However, Ji Wuming had directly changed his fighting style, and this rendered her plans completely useless.

Moreover, Ji Wuming was indeed powerful, and each of his strikes was forceful enough to make her chest boil and churn. This was an indescribably terrible feeling.

She gritted her teeth and endured, yet after 1000 strikes, she ultimately reached her limit, and had a wing brutally ripped off by Ji Wuming. Broken bones scattered through the air, and warm blood violently sprayed through the sky. She howled in pain, and she was overcome with fury.

However, what did this matter? She was directly dragged back by a Celestial King from the Foreign Realm. If she had continued to battle, death would have been her only fate.

Two consecutive victories!

Thunderous cheers boomed through the crowd of Celestial Realm cultivators. Even though they had achieved two consecutive victories before, that had been completed by two different people—Hu Niu and the Rain Emperor. There was no one who had achieved two consecutive victories by themself.

He was far too powerful; this was far too inspiring.

Meanwhile, the cultivators from the Foreign Realm all wore solemn expressions. Losing to cultivators from the Celestial Realm in a battle at the same cultivation level was the most unacceptable thing in their minds. Their dimension was of a higher level, so maintaining a crushing advantage over their opponent was imperative.

The Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm also radiated with killing intent.

“Should we directly deploy Chi Xue?” a Celestial King asked.

“No, we must achieve victory in a battle at the same cultivation level! Before this, we’ve already lost to that small girl and that man. We have to claim a victory.”

“Then deploy Wu Xin. This Ji Wuming has already fought two battles in a row, so he definitely doesn’t have much power of Regulations remaining. As long as Wu Xin drags things out, he can definitely win.”

“Agreed, send Wu Xin over.”
