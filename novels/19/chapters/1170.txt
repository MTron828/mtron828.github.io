Chapter 1171: Flower’s Fragrance

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Ahhh!”

Yet another agonized wail cut through the air. More and more victims appeared, and without exception, these were all people who weren’t being protected by the light from the jade pendants.

No wonder the Majestic Heaven Sect didn’t pay attention to these “stowaways”. Even after eliminating the ominous aura of this place, those below the Heavenly Body Tier would still be killed if they weren’t suitably protected.

Was the Majestic Heaven Sect brutal? They were knowingly letting these people run to their deaths.

Ling Han shook his head. This wasn’t so much about brutality, but more about whether the Majestic Heaven Sect cared or not. They were the number one force in the galaxy, so did they need to care about other people’s opinions?

What a joke. Of course they didn’t!

Ling Han mulled over this problem as he walked. He had yet to reach the halfway mark, yet all of the “stowaways” had already died.

They were merely at the Mountain River Tier, so how long could they last?

Ling Han felt no sympathy for them. Exploring ancient sites was inherently dangerous, and everyone had to take responsibility for their own safety. If one wasn’t smart enough or courageous enough to do so, then why were they coming to these ancient sites in the first place? Anyhow, Ling Han was curious about what had killed those people.

He knew it was the black aura, but what exactly was that black aura?

He used his mind to communicate with the Black Tower and ask Notionless Saint for answers.

“The Eternal River Tier elite whose body had been laid to rest here probably practiced some sinister cultivation technique,” Notionless Saint said. “As such, the surrounding areas have also been affected. Since Venerable Trinity couldn’t fully eliminate the ominous aura, I can say with certainty that his cultivation level is far below that of the dead elite.”

Ling Han nodded in agreement. One elite was dead, and the other was alive, yet the latter still couldn’t completely eliminate the formations of the elite who was dead. This indeed hinted at a large gulf in abilities.

Everyone said that there were huge gulfs in abilities between those at the Immortal level—this now was proof. Venerable Trinity was merely able to eliminate a portion of the ominous aura. Not only that, but he was only able to do so once every 100 years, when the might of the restriction reached its weakest point. It was only at such a time that he could forcefully open a path for others to enter.

Of course, one couldn’t underestimate Venerable Trinity because of this. After all, he was still the strongest elite of the galaxy.

Regardless of what happened, elites still deserved respect.

Everyone walked slowly as the rate at which the ominous black aura was being removed was incredibly slow. Even Venerable Trinity couldn’t eliminate it any faster.

Half a day passed, and they finally arrived at the foot of the valley.

Venerable Trinity unleashed a supreme Mystical Power and ripped open a fissure in the sky. A dark passageway appeared. Through it, they could see a completely different land, one where the mountains were lush and the waters were clear. It made a stark contrast with the land they were currently in.

More astonishingly, there was a river that was flowing from the sky. Neither its origin nor its end could be seen—it was like a heavenly river. The water of this river seemed eerie, and it radiated with a boundless aura of death. One could vaguely see countless wraiths squirming in the river.

Although there was a passageway between them, Ling Han could still sense the terrifying and sinister nature of the river. ‘Is this the Yellow Spring1?’

“You guys can enter now!” Venerable Trinity said. There was a hint of exhaustion in his voice.

He was an Eternal River Tier elite, yet there was actually a look exhaustion on his face. From this, it could be seen just how taxing eliminating the ominous aura and opening the passageway was.

They all started to enter.

Shua, shua, shua!

The cultivators became a blur as they dashed into the passageway.

Peng!

Someone followed the cultivators, yet they were suddenly blown into smithereens.

It was a Sun Moon Tier elite who had forcefully suppressed his cultivation and tried to sneak in. He was only a step away from entering, and no one had come forward to stop him, either. However, he was killed by the restriction that prevailed through this place.

Those above the Mountain River Tier couldn’t enter—this wasn’t an empty warning.

Ling Han entered with Shui Yanyu and the others, and they all felt a strong chill when they passed through the entrance. It was as if a wraith were whispering in their ears. Meanwhile, crashing waves surged through the Yellow Spring and caused deafening roars to reverberate in the surroundings.

Everyone started to walk along the banks of the Yellow Spring. It was common knowledge that one would never get lost if they followed the banks of the Yellow Spring.

“Fourth Brother, let’s part here.”

The Rain Emperor and the others bade farewell to Ling Han and each set off on their own path. In the end, only Ling Han, Shui Yanyu, and Hu Feiyun remained.

“Let’s go.”

Ling Han held Shui Yanyu’s hand and started to walk off.

“Wait for me!” Hu Feiyun hurriedly ran after them as if she were afraid that Ling Han and Shui Yanyu would leave her behind.

After walking for a while, Ling Han sniffed at the air, and exclaimed, “It smells so nice!”

“Why, you!” Shui Yanyu hit him lightly, thinking that he was teasing her.

‘Why are acting like this now? Can’t you see that the Ninth King is also here? She’s a clone of the empress!’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “You misunderstood! I wasn’t talking about the fragrance from your body, but rather the fragrance from some flower!”

“Really?” There was a hint of doubt on her face. This man would always tease her in new and different ways.

Hu Feiyun hurriedly nodded, and said, “I can also smell it!”

“Let’s go!”

Ling Han turned in a different direction. The Yellow Spring was a huge landmark, and it could be seen from almost anywhere. Thus, they didn’t need to worry about getting lost.

They followed the fragrance, and after walking for a while, they arrived before a small hill. There was a bright blossoming flower atop of this hill, and it was this flower that was exuding the soft and delicate fragrance. This fragrance wasn’t concentrated, yet it could waft to extremely distant locations.

The three of them weren’t the first to detect this fragrance, and two other people had already arrived before them. However, they clearly weren’t together, and they stood opposite each other with the flower between them.

‘Is this a Godly medicine?’

Ling Han didn’t recognize this flower, and judging by the baffled look on Shui Yanyu’s and Hu Feiyun’s face, they didn’t recognize it, either. Meanwhile, what stopped them in their tracks was the piles of white bones that lay around the small hill. Some were humanoid, while others belonged to beasts.

It was evident that many others had noticed this flower before them. However, those who had attempted to pluck it had all died.

Ling Han wasn’t sure about the value of this flower. However, the fact that so many humans and beasts had tried to pluck it gave him a reason to believe that this flower was incredibly valuable. Otherwise, why did so many people attempt to pluck it?

‘Hang on... Is this a trap that takes advantage of one’s intuition?

‘When those who arrive later see that so many others have attempted to pluck the flower, they’ll naturally think that this flower is a rare treasure. As such, it’s extremely likely that they’ll rashly head over.’

“Such a beautiful flower!” There was a dazed look in Shui Yanyu’s eyes, and it was as if she were in a trance.

She raised her leg and was just about to walk toward the small hill.

Ling Han hurriedly pulled her back, a look of astonishment on his face. This flower could actually put one into a trance! However, the severity of this trance-like effect clearly differed from person to person. Neither he nor Hu Feiyun had been affected by it—yet.

Meanwhile, the other two people were already walking toward the flower. There was a glazed look in their eyes, yet their expressions were those of fervent excitement. It was as if they were gazing upon a supreme throne, not a mere flower. If they ascended this throne, they would become the ruler of the world, one who could control even Saints.

Swoosh!

When the two people neared the small hill, a streak of black cloud suddenly rushed out from the hill and swooped toward them. Then, the black cloud instantly scattered and retreated back into the small hill.

As for the two people?

They had already become two skeletons! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Pa, pa!

The skeletons collapsed to the ground, becoming the newest victims that adorned the surrounds of the small hill.

‘So, that’s how the people here have all died!’
