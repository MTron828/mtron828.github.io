Chapter 1953: Bring Me Tea, Massage My Back

Everyone turned their gaze to Ling Han. They were waiting to see how he would reply.

If everything went as they expected, he would go beet-red in the face, and then stomp off in anger and embarrassment.

However, Ling Han’s expression remained calm and composed. At the same time, he couldn’t help but muse at this coincidence in his mind. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This was because he had also started to investigate three-star alchemical pills recently. He was investigating five in total, and one of them was none other than the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill.

‘You’ve gifted this to me on a platter.’

Ling Han purposefully pondered for a moment, and it was as if he were wracking his brains for an answer.

“Fourth Uncle, it can’t be that you don’t even know about the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill, right?” Liu Xing immediately said. This was a vicious blow.

‘Now, hurry up and scurry off!’

Ling Han smiled calmly before finding a seat, and saying, “Before asking your seniors for advice, shouldn’t you offer them some tea?”

‘Tsk! You’re even putting on airs now!’

Liu Xing chuckled coldly in his mind. In his eyes, Ling Han was trying to put him in a difficult spot instead. His intention was to wriggle free from his difficult situation. This was called defending by attacking.

‘You have some skills. However, it’s a shame that you’ve already fallen into my trap! How can I let you jump out?’

“Yes, yes!” Liu Xing answered with an expression of respect. He commanded the servants in the room to pour some tea, which he then brought forward for Ling Han. He appeared as respectful as could be.

‘See? My performance is flawless, and there’s nothing you can complain about.’

More and more people gathered in the surroundings. Some were simply here to see a show, while others were here because they were curious about Ling Han. They wanted to see if he was genuinely a skilled alchemist. After all, he was Xiao Lixing’s junior brother, so he couldn’t be underestimated.

Ling Han crossed his legs before reaching forward with his right hand.

Veins bulged on Liu Xing’s forehead, yet he still gritted his teeth and bowed down as he placed the cup of tea in Ling Han’s hand.

‘I’ll let you be smug for now. In a moment, I’ll see how you cry!’

Ling Han started to slowly sip the tea. By doing this, he wasn’t necessarily trying to mock Liu Xing. Instead, he was also recalling the refinement technique of the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill in his mind.

This was a process of carefully thinking over the problem. After all, he had also just started to learn about this alchemical pill. His understanding of it was astonishing, yet he was still relatively lacking in practical experience. Regarding some detailed problems, he genuinely had to refine the alchemical pill himself before he could get a solid grasp on them.

He was the Alchemy Emperor, so after pondering over this question for a moment, he was already confident that he could give a satisfactory answer. However, he still continued to slowly sip his tea in a leisurely manner. In fact, he appeared so relaxed that many people wanted to punch him.

Others might not know, but Liu Xing was definitely feeling extremely frustrated at this moment.

Ling Han was definitely doing this on purpose. He was forcing him to bow and nod like an obedient servant.

To say nothing of the bulging veins on Liu Xing’s forehead, even the surrounding onlookers were starting to become impatient.

‘You’re just drinking tea, so is there really any need to blow it 10 times before each sip? Will the tea burn you to death if you blow it fewer times? You’re a Severing Mundane Tier cultivator!

‘If you’re truly burnt by tea, then won’t that be a massive joke?’

‘I’ll endure this, I’ll endure this, I’ll endure this!’ Liu Xing continued to repeat in his mind.

As long as he endured this, it would soon be time for Ling Han to make a fool of himself. However, he hadn’t expected Ling Han’s counterattack to be so precise and ruthless. He had forced him to act like a servant in public. This was far too embarrassing.

However, now that it had already come to this, he was naturally even more unwilling to give up. He could only grit his teeth and persist.

After a long while, Ling Han finally finished drinking his tea.

Liu Xing breathed a sigh of relief. The surrounding onlookers also heaved a sigh of relief. Ling Han was far too good at building up suspense.

Ling Han handed the empty cup to Liu Xing, and Liu Xing naturally accepted it with respect. He then said, “Fourth Uncle...”

“My back is feeling a bit tight; help me massage it.”

‘F*ck.’

Liu Xing felt a strong urge to kill someone. Flames were about to erupt from his eyes. However, he gritted his teeth and continued to console himself, telling himself that he couldn’t abandon all of his previous hard work. Otherwise, he would truly become a servant for nothing.

He walked behind Ling Han.

Thump, thump, thump.

He started to massage Ling Han’s back.

The Empress, Hu Niu, and the others were all wearing faint smiles. This person actually dared to challenge Ling Han? Didn’t he know that Ling Han had been trained by the large black dog?

Liu Xing was truly starting to feel some slight regret now. He had yet to humiliate Ling Han, and yet he was already being toyed around with. He was genuinely worried about whether his heart could take this any longer.

However, he had already reached such a point, so how could he give up halfway?

He forcefully suppressed the flames of raging fury in his heart. He was eagerly awaiting the time when Ling Han finally made a complete fool of himself. This was also the motivation that allowed him to endure this humiliation before so many people.

‘Go on! Continue with your arrogance!’

After massaging Ling Han’s back for a long time, Liu Xing forcefully suppressed his anger, and asked, “Fourth Uncle, are you satisfied now?”

“My legs...” Ling Han said in a relaxed voice.

‘F*ck your mom!’

“...don’t need massaging,” Ling Han continued.

Liu Xing almost choked upon hearing this. ‘If you don’t need it, then you don’t need it. What’s the point of specially mentioning it? Are you trying to frighten me to death?’

“Then Fourth Uncle, can you answer my question now?” he asked in a respectful voice. However, he was actually gritting his teeth in anger.

Ling Han coughed, and said, “My throat seems to be slightly parched again.”

Liu Xing’s face involuntarily twitched when he heard this. His fists were clenched, and he could barely stop himself from punching Ling Han in the face. Ling Han looked as detestable as could be.

“Forget about it. You’ve also worked very hard,” Ling Han said.

Liu Xing finally regained some composure upon hearing this. If Ling Han had truly ordered him to bring another cup of tea over, he would have definitely jumped up in arms.

“Okay, let’s talk about the refinement of the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill now,” Ling Han said with a smile. He stopped toying around with Liu Xing. In his eyes, this was only a minigame before the grand celebration. He would use it to pass some time.

His expression became solemn, and he started to explain the refinement process.

In the beginning, everyone was looking on with a faint smile. They were treating this as nothing more than a show. However, as time went on, their expressions gradually became serious.

Ling Han explained profound concepts in simple and understandable terms, and his explanation of the refinement process of the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill was extremely in-depth and engrossing. Everyone nodded as they listened to him, and they felt as if they could immediately succeed in refining the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill if they were to try.

Even Liu Xing’s heart started to thump in excitement. Even though he had asked this question to screw with Ling Han, he did indeed have many confusions about refining the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill. Right now, however, all of his questions were being answered by Ling Han.

Ling Han continued to speak, and everyone’s expression continued to become increasingly earnest. This was because Ling Han’s explanation had already exceeded the realm of simply talking about the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill. Indeed, he was already starting to explain other domains of alchemy.

He was talking about the entirety of alchemy!

Ling Han still had yet to become a grandmaster in alchemy. At most, he could only be considered as a small fry. However, he had already incorporated his own understandings while learning Spirit Refinement, and this had allowed him to forge his own path.

Even though this path was still in its infancy, its foundation was much stronger than what most other people possessed. Right now, he was expounding these most fundamental principles.

Everyone understood the fundamentals. However, few people could gain a deep and comprehensive understanding of them.

“Hurry, come over here, there’s a grandmaster explaining alchemy!”

“Brother Fan, hurry up and come here! Otherwise, you’ll regret this forever!”

“Lin Qian! Hurry up and call your senior brothers and junior brothers over!”

The surrounding alchemists hurriedly retrieved their transmission devices to call their friends and disciples over.

To alchemists, this was definitely a grand gathering that they couldn’t miss. This was an incredible opportunity for them to elevate their skills and understanding of alchemy. This was because most alchemists didn’t need to learn about difficult or profound concepts of alchemy. Instead, they would see bigger improvements by simply reinforcing the fundamentals.

Thus, more and more people gathered in the surroundings, causing the small area to become so packed that not even a drop of water could trickle through.
