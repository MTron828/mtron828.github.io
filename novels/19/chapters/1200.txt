Chapter 1201: Conflict

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han decided to roll with the punches. Although the sect was flooded with rumors that demonized him, those who were objective and intelligent would be able to see through them easily. Ling Han believed that those who were talented enough to enter the Majestic Heaven Sect were all relatively smart people. Thus, such rumors would eventually run out of steam.

He still went to the Mo Clan Establishment as planned, and he sold them a large number of alchemical pills. He also made a copy of a pill recipe. It was an ancient recipe, and it was very likely that it was already lost in the outside world. Thus, he could probably sell it for a good price.

Regarding the Thousand Source True Fluid, he decided to sell it as well.

‘Don’t you really want these, Gao Huang? Well, I’m not going to give them to you, and I’m even going to make you lose face.’

Ling Han genuinely didn’t need these four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid.

They could aid one’s comprehension, but they couldn’t increase one’s cultivation level. Cultivating under the Reincarnation Tree couldn’t improve one’s comprehension, but this could be made up for with time. Perhaps one or two days of comprehension wouldn’t be enough, but what about eight or 10 years of comprehension?

In a sense, the Reincarnation Tree had similar effects to Thousand Source True Fluid. Moreover, its beneficial effects could be used endlessly.

Thus, Ling Han naturally wanted to sell his four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid. That way, he could increase his wealth and purchase more Godly metal to raise the grade of his Divine Demon Sword.

Anyhow, Ling Han was destined to be a poor sod before he evolved the material of his Divine Demon Sword to Divine Metal. All of his money would be spent on the Divine Demon Sword. However, the might of his Divine Demon Sword was already starting to show itself—it possessed a battle prowess that was no weaker than his.

No matter how much he spent, this sword was worth the cost!

Han Huo was stunned upon hearing Ling Han’s offer. He then happily agreed and started to discuss the fine details with him. He decided to hold an auction, and the items for auction were naturally the Thousand Source True Fluid, ancient pill recipe, and alchemical pills that Ling Han provided.

Thousand Source True Fluid and ancient pill recipes were all very valuable items, and thus it made sense to maximize their selling price by holding an auction. As for alchemical pills, they would definitely sell for more thanks to the influence of the other more valuable items.

Those who did business were indeed more skilled at these kinds of things. Han Huo had taken far more things into consideration than Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded in approval, and let Han Huo deal with the remaining matters. Meanwhile, he returned to the Majestic Heaven Sect. He still had to practice the Star Plucking Step and study the new pill recipes.

He arrived at his palace, only to see the old ginseng talking and joking with Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er. He was massaging their shoulders, and a strand of his roots stealthily slid into each of their collars, looking for beautiful “landmarks”.

‘This perverted ginseng... is beyond help!

‘Although you’re in a humanoid form, you’re only as large a child’s arm. What can you “do”?’

Ling Han shook his head as he thought this. Anyhow, what had Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er come for?

“Damn blockhead, you actually dared to keep me in the dark!” Li Weiwei immediately jumped to her feet upon seeing Ling Han enter. This caused the old ginseng to grimace in pain. One of his roots had been on her chest, and he hadn’t been able to pull it back in time. Thus, it was ruthlessly snapped when she jumped up.

Li Weiwei didn’t realize it, yet Ling Han saw it clearly. He secretly smiled to himself. Who told the old ginseng to act so perverted? Anyhow, this root would be good compensation for Li Weiwei.

The roots of this old ginseng were extremely nutritious. Ling Han had only taken one to eat, and he had left the others “stored” on the old ginseng. Li Weiwei had unknowingly obtained one now, and it would definitely be extremely beneficial to her cultivation and physique.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “How did you find out?”

“Hehe, I didn’t believe that Sister Shui was the type of person who’d cheat. So, I kept pestering the Ninth King with questions. It didn’t take long for her to spill the beans,” Li Weiwei said smugly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Sure enough, Hu Feiyun couldn’t keep any secrets.

She was a clone of Empress Luan Xing, and her personality was one that was severed from the empress. Thus, it was inevitable that there would be some deficiencies in her personality. Meanwhile, some of her other traits would be magnified significantly.

For example, the innocence and ditziness of Hu Feiyun were both traits that had been severed from Empress Luan Xing. These had only been a tiny portion of the empress’ personality, yet they were the entirety of Hu Feiyun’s.

“Blockhead, how are you planning to respond? Everyone’s talking about how you killed fellow disciples and stole their treasures!” Li Weiwei quickly moved on from how Ling Han had kept his identity hidden and instead started to worry for him.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s fine. I’ll deal with whatever gets thrown my way. What can’t I deal with?”

“What a bold claim!” Li Weiwei said with a humph. However, she felt much more reassured after seeing Ling Han’s oozing confidence. Ling Han had come from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, after all, and he had come across all kinds of dangers. However, he had overcome all of them.

Feng Po Yun, Ding Ping, and the others also came to visit him. However, they were all reassured and sent away by Ling Han. He would deal with this matter himself.

However, he couldn’t find any time to cultivate in the following several days, with Shao Sisi, Xia Wuque, Su Jing, and the others all visiting him. They all hinted at their willingness to help him as long as he joined their forces. If he agreed to join, they would do everything in their ability to help him.

Ling Han smiled and turned down their goodwill. He had no plans to join any forces. Why was he cultivating so earnestly? Wasn’t it to attain true freedom so he could do what he wanted?

Afterward, He Tao and the other king tiers also came to visit him. Their offers were similar to those of Shao Sisi and the others, and they all hoped that Ling Han could join their forces.

A significant reason for this was Ling Han’s non-existent background. He had come from a small world after opening the sky, and thus he had absolutely no background in the Immortal Realm. As such, they didn’t need to worry about him being a spy for some other force.

Ling Han naturally turned down their offers as well.

It was also around this time that a piece of news suddenly started to spread—the sect was apparently discussing the matter regarding Ling Han killing his fellow disciples. There was potentially going to be a public trial in a few days.

Gao Huang was finally making his move!

On the same night that this news broke, a Sun Moon Tier elite appeared before Ling Han’s palace.

“I’m Zhou Tong!” This Sun Moon Tier elite looked to be around 30 years old, and it was clear that he had already formed two Suns and Moons. His strength was fairly formidable. There was a haughty look on his face, and he said, “I’ve come at the command of Young Master to give you one final chance. Immediately hand the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid over. Otherwise... you’ll become an unforgivable traitor of the sect! You’ll be pinned to the post of humiliation forever!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You could have chosen to be a respectable Sun Moon Tier elite, but no, you had to choose the life of a dog!”

“How dare you!!” Zhou Tong exploded in rage, and divine flames instantly erupted from his body.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Don’t get all angry at me. You’ve merely cultivated for a few hundred thousand years more than me! You wanna make a bet? I’ll be powerful enough to crush you in 10 years’ time!”

Ling Han’s words were extremely bold and domineering. A Mountain River Tier cultivator was claiming that they would possess the ability to crush a Sun Moon Tier elite in 10 years’ time. Who could believe this?

However, Zhou Tong’s pupils contracted when he heard this. Judging by the freakish nature of this brat, it was genuinely possible that he could achieve this. Anyhow, he didn’t believe this claim too much.

He humphed, and said, “If you don’t hand the Thousand Source True Fluid over, you won’t even be able to overcome the challenge before you. That being the case, what future is there for you to speak of?”

Ling Han smiled calmly. He had the pill recipe for the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill, and he also had a Red Rain Divine King Tree in his Black Tower. Thus, he would be able to refine a great deal of Berserk Blood Spirit Pills once he reached the Sun Moon Tier.

One could envisage that he would improve in leaps and bounds during a certain period of time.

“Go back and tell Gao Huang that if he wants my Thousand Source True Fluid, he can prepare enough True Origin Stones and attend the auction that occurs in three months’ time,” Ling Han said. This was a good opportunity to advertise the auction.
