Chapter 2589: Heavenly Venerable Tier Cultivation Technique

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Lu Li accepted the jade seal, and asked curiously, “Uncle, what kind of cultivation technique is this?”

“This is the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll!” Lu Gaojian replied with a serious expression.

‘Divine Scroll!’

Ling Han’s heart jolted upon hearing this. Only Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation techniques could be referred to as divine scrolls. Celestial King Tier cultivation techniques could only be referred to as celestial scrolls.

Lu Gaojian actually possessed a Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation technique? This was simply astounding.

!!

Had he dug up some Heavenly Venerate’s grave?

It was no wonder that Lu Li’s status had suddenly soared. This was clearly thanks to his relationship with Lu Gaojian. Because of this, even Tang Mingbo had been forced to bow his head in submission. In fact, even the Azure Ghost Celestial King was showing favor toward him now. Otherwise, the incident with Niu Da in the tournament grounds wouldn’t have occurred simply because of the Yin River Celestial King’s words.

Thinking back, why had the Yin River Celestial King purposefully targeted Ling Han? This was naturally because of Lu Li. The aim was to suppress Tang Yuan, and Ling Han simply became the victim. Fortunately, he had been powerful enough to resist and kill Niu Da instead.

The source of all this was none other than Lu Gaojian! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Nine Transformations Divine Scroll?” Lu Li murmured. He still hadn’t realized that this was a Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation technique.

“The Nine Transformations Divine Scroll was created by a Heavenly Venerate!” Lu Gaojian said slowly and calmly.

“What?!” Lu Li instantly exclaimed in deep astonishment. His hands involuntarily started to tremble.

This was a Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation technique! Just how paramount and mighty was this?

Lu Gaojian smiled faintly. He was extremely satisfied with Lu Li’s reaction. He nodded, and said, “This Heavenly Venerate was called the Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate. However, he already died several epochs ago.”

“Heavenly Venerates… can actually die?” Lu Li asked in disbelief.

Just how lofty and paramount were Heavenly Venerates? With a single finger, they could easily crush Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to death. Yet, Lu Gaojian was actually saying that such a Heavenly Venerate had died? Just how could Lu Li believe this?

“In this world, there only exists indomitable power. However, there doesn’t exist an invincible person,” Lu Gaojian replied calmly.

Lu Li’s breathing quickened as he asked, “Whom was the Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate killed by?”

“A truly peerless individual,” Lu Gaojian replied, a slight quiver in his voice. It was as if he were feeling apprehension at the mere thought of this person.

“Who?” Lu Li pressed.

Lu Gaojian paused for a moment before replying, “You don’t have the right to know about this right now, so there’s no need to keep asking. You only need to know that this cultivation technique left by the Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate can give you an opportunity to reach the Heavenly Venerable Tier!”

Gasp!

Lu Li’s hands trembled even more violently. An opportunity to reach the Heavenly Venerable Tier? In his eyes, even the Ninth Heaven was but a distant dream. Now, however, his uncle was saying that he could potentially become a Heavenly Venerate? How could he not shake with excitement? This was absolutely unbelievable!

However, Ling Han shook his head upon seeing this. A Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation technique was indeed paramount and profound. However, being able to become a Heavenly Venerate simply by obtaining such a cultivation technique? What an absolute joke! Otherwise, wouldn’t the large black dog have become a Heavenly Venerate long ago?

Wouldn’t the Imperial Void Celestial King, Dongfang Rui, and Xuan Rong all have become Heavenly Venerates?

No, no, no, practicing Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation techniques might even cause one to lose themselves in the fervent pursuit of Dao, resulting in them being stuck at the Ninth Heaven even though they originally had the potential to ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. In the end, it might result in them being ultimately unable to take that most important step.

Perhaps Lu Gaojian had learned of this from someone else, and it was because of this that he believed it without question. After all, this was an opportunity to become a Heavenly Venerate! Which Ninth Heaven Celestial King wouldn’t be wild with excitement, so much so that they forgot all other matters?

However, regardless of this, Ling Han still wanted to snatch this Nine Transformations Divine Scroll for himself. It wouldn’t hurt to investigate it.

As if handling a paramount treasure, Lu Li carefully put away the jade seal.

“This isn’t the entirety of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll,” Lu Gaojian suddenly said.

“Huh?” Disappointment instantly spread across Lu Li’s face.

“Silly child, if this were the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, you wouldn’t be able to comprehend it at all!” Lu Gaojian said with a chuckle. “The Nine Transformations Divine Scroll consists of nine scrolls in total, with each expounding on a different Great Dao and a different Regulation. With each scroll that you grasp, your battle prowess will increase by several folds. When you grasp all nine scrolls and integrate them together, you’ll more so have an opportunity to charge through that barrier and become a Heavenly Venerate.”

Lu Li immediately became excited again, saying, “Then, Uncle, do you have the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll?”

“I don’t,” Lu Gaojian replied with a shake of his head. “However, there’s a mighty figure who’s in possession of the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. As long as we serve him to the best of our abilities, he’ll generously bestow us with more scrolls from the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.”

There were flames of eagerness in Lu Li’s eyes as he asked, “Uncle, can we both become Heavenly Venerates?”

“Definitely!” Lu Gaojian replied with a smile. He gazed up at the sky before continuing, “Moreover, we can definitely leave this godforsaken place as well. From that moment on, we’ll be able to roam free and mighty, not bound by the restrictions of this heaven and earth anymore!”

He paused for a brief moment before saying, “Have a good rest. When you wake up tomorrow, you can start practicing the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. Aim to comprehend it as soon as possible. If you come across anything you don’t understand, don’t hesitate to directly come to me and ask—your cultivation level is still low, and I initially wanted to pass the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll to you only when your cultivation level became higher.”

However, because of the incident with Ling Han, Lu Gaojian had decided to raise the strength of his “nephew.” He didn’t want to feel sorrow and regret for a lifetime.

He took his leave.

Whoosh!

With a flash, he immediately disappeared from sight.

However, how could Lu Li rest at this moment? He was far too excited. He retrieved the jade seal and pressed it to his forehead, absorbing the information inside it. However, he immediately felt a cold chill, which caused him to involuntarily put the jade seal down.

He was overcome with shock. This was because someone had suddenly appeared behind him!

“A—” He wanted to call A’Yuan, yet he immediately recalled that A’Yuan had been severely wounded in the battle during the day. Right now, A’Yuan was still lying on a bed. He was far too accustomed to having A’Yuan protect him, so he had subconsciously tried to call him for help.

Ling Han wore a beaming smile as he said, “You don’t mind giving this to me, right?” He reached over to take the jade seal.

At this moment, how could Lu Li possibly oppose him? He couldn’t do anything at all, and the jade seal fell into Ling Han’s hands.

The gulf in battle prowess between them was a whopping five Heavens. This was no longer just a crushing advantage. This was already a galactic advantage!

“Who are you? Don’t you know that you’re bringing huge trouble upon yourself?” Lu Li said in a quivering voice.

“Oh, so you don’t recognize this appearance of mine?” Ling Han mused. Right now, he wasn’t disguised as Li Long. Instead, he was showing his true appearance.

With a single thought, he immediately reverted to his “original” appearance.

“Y-y-you! It’s you!” Lu Li exclaimed in terror. His face became as white as a sheet. He definitely hadn’t imagined that the intruder was actually Ling Han.

How could he be so audacious? He had only just left in the morning, yet he had already snuck back at night?

“You finally recognize me now?” Ling Han said with a chuckle. He hadn’t imagined that there would be a day when others didn’t recognize his true appearance. Instead, it was actually his false identity that was mighty and infamous.

“Don’t you do anything crazy. My father and my uncle are both Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and my uncle is more so working for a supremely powerful person right now. If you dare to touch even a single hair of mine, you’ll definitely meet a tragic end!” Lu Li said in threat.

Ling Han immediately reached over and tugged, ripping a large handful of hair from Lu Li’s scalp. Lu Li screamed in agony, his voice astonishingly loud.

In fact, he wasn’t truly hurting so much. Rather, he was screaming so loudly in order to give a signal, telling others that he was in danger.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Don’t harbor such futile hopes. I’ve already sealed the surrounding space, so no one will hear you even if you scream your lungs out.”

Lu Li’s face instantly became ashen. Perhaps other Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t be able to block his calls for help. However, if Ling Han said that he was able to, then he was definitely able to. This person was far too freakish.

Lu Li shook in fear, terrified of the fatal threat that stood before him.

In fact, he was the same as Tang Yuan. He was nothing more than a profligate second-generation young master. When he had power, he would act with as much arrogance and haughtiness as he could. However, when he was in an inferior position, he would lose all composure and courage.
