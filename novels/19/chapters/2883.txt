2884 Decision

Meng Dong gave Ling Han another speech, mostly to try and “calm” his emotions. After all, Ling Han had suddenly found out that he belonged to Hysteria’s side. How could he recover so quickly? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After a while, Meng Dong said, “Little Brother, let’s keep in touch in the future. I am very excited to be working with you.”

For a moment, Ling Han considered the possibility of taking Meng Dong down on the spot and forcing his secret out of him. However, after some consideration, he decided to give up on that idea.

He wasn’t sure if Hysteria had any more tricks up its sleeve. What if Meng Dong’s mind were to explode directly under duress? He would then be losing a very valuable source of information.

!!

“Alright. Let’s keep in touch.” Ling Han nodded.

Suddenly, he remembered something and came to a halt. “Was it our Lord’s plan to lead us to that lost dimension?”

Meng Dong had a puzzled look. “I’m not too sure about that, either. Logically, that shouldn’t be the case. While it’s true that the current situation would lead to the deaths of a lot of Heavenly Venerates, there are simply too many resources lying there, which is more than enough to give the surviving ones a huge boost in strength.

“I’ll be able to get clear answers from our Lord once I get in touch with him.

“Well then, I’m going.”

Opening the Void, Meng Dong naturally headed towards the lost dimension. There were simply too many precious materials there. Even a Sixth Tier would see it as a treasured land.

Ling Han was deep in thought. Unknown to him, there seemed to be several different forces vying for superiority.

Hysteria was undoubtedly at the top. Its main body was in the midst of suppressing the Flaming Frost Realm, but it had plenty of tricks up its sleeve. If it was allowed to carry on undeterred, it just might devour the Genesis World one day.

However, with the appearance of a lost primitive dimension, a number of Great Herbs and Heavenly Venerable Seals that shouldn’t belong in this world emerged. They would cause a Heavenly Venerate to quickly increase in strength, and there was a good chance that a new Seventh Tier would be born in the near future.

This was definitely not an outcome Hysteria wanted.

How did that lost primitive dimension get destroyed in the first place? Moreover, it was a dimension overlapping another dimension. Theoretically, this wasn’t possible. What sort of power was capable of surpassing the Seventh Tier and doing such a thing?

Ling Han stood for a long time. He had gathered a lot of information in a single day, and he needed time to properly analyze it.

After 10 days, he tore a rip into the Void, and continued his journey.

He had an unshakeable faith. No matter what Hysteria had done to him in the past, he was still the same person as before, and would not live his life for anyone else’s sake.

In his heart, his family and friends were more important than anything else.

He was definitely going to protect the Genesis World, and would not let Hysteria have its way.

This time around, he didn’t have to worry about Hysteria finding him as he traveled the Void. Firstly, Hysteria assumed that it had no more reason to seek him out, because he had been awakened. Secondly, Ling Han had destroyed the mark that Hysteria had left. Without a “lighthouse,” how was Hysteria going to find him in the vastness of the Void?

Half a year had passed, and Ling Han finally found the lost dimension.

He descended into the dimension.

This was the outermost dimension, and Ling Han did not stop at all. He passed through the ground layer, and headed towards the dimension below.

After passing through the second layer, he returned to base and regrouped with Zhou Heng and the rest. He then told everyone everything about his body and his relation to Hysteria.

He didn’t hide a single thing, because he held no guilt.

The revelation left Zhou Heng and the rest in shock. They never would have thought Hysteria would have such a play.

“Ling Han, this is a grave matter. Please allow me to personally search your spirit,” said Zhou Heng. It wasn’t because he didn’t trust Ling Han, but Hysteria’s methods were simply too cunning. No one knew if it had placed some sort of trap just waiting to be set off in the future in Ling Han’s mind so that Ling Han would fall under its control.

Ling Han agreed. He also wanted to know if he had been able to thoroughly remove all possible threats.

Zhou Heng placed his palm on Ling Han’s head and inserted his divine sense. He gave the latter a thorough check, and he retracted his hand after a while.

“How is it?” both Lin Xiaoyang and Chu Hao asked.

Zhou Heng had a curious look on his face. “This brat has limitless Powers of Dimension inside of him. It was like a giant millstone. My divine sense can’t get inside at all, and was quickly ground to nothing.”

“Is it really so amazing to progress on this path?” Lin Xiaoyang asked in surprise. Seeing the puzzled look on Ling Han’s face, he continued, “Truth be told, my father also once had a similar theory of compressing the Powers of Dimension from the entire Genesis World. However, this wasn’t something that could be put into practice. Even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate didn’t have that kind of capacity.

“The power of 1,000 dimensions was the limit, and even then, this was nothing but a static force. One would not be able to go any further once they reach this limit.

“Hence, my father and his peers came up with another solution, and that was to imbue a small dimension inside of themselves before reaching the Heavenly Venerable Tier. That way, the dimension’s strength would grow along with one’s own power.

“In the early stage, this would not even compare to a Heavenly Venerate with the strength of a few hundred dimensions. However, there was an endless potential for growth.

“Once you reached the Sixth Tier, this method would then prove to be the better solution.

“Youlian and Xin Qihu are prime examples of this.”

…It was no wonder they only took a few million years to reach the Fourth Tier. They didn’t have to gather strength from one dimension at a time. Of course they’d be faster.

“However, you somehow managed to take a different path altogether, and more or less merged both methods into one. If you were to train this to its full potential… Hiss!”

Zhou Heng and the other two gasped at the same time. How strong would Ling Han be then?

“According to my estimation, Ling Han’s potential for development is limitless. Perhaps he can leap out of the Seventh Tier and stand at the same height as Hysteria, or even surpass it,” Chu Hao said.

Lin Xiaoyang also nodded. “Thus, Ling Han will definitely not be controlled by Hysteria. It will definitely not allow any person who can threaten its existence to grow.”

Zhou Heng looked at Ling Han. “Something shocking must have happened to you, causing the control of Hysteria to fail. It also allowed you to accommodate the Powers of Dimension of the entire Genesis World, turning you into another Genesis World with endless potential for development.”

The three of them were certain that Ling Han’s situation was too unique, and definitely not something Hysteria could control.

“The problem now is to find Meng Dong and the others and eliminate them in advance. Otherwise, when they reach Sixth Tier, it will really be difficult to deal with them,” Lin Xiaoyang said solemnly.

“However, we only know one Meng Dong and a Lou Xiyue now. If we act rashly, it’s very likely that we’ll alert the enemy and let the others completely hide their identities. They definitely won’t make trouble unless they’re at the Sixth Tier.”

“Therefore, this matter still has to fall on Ling Han’s shoulders. We will investigate the surviving dregs of Hysteria, and then announce it to the world. Then, we will attack together and eliminate these remnants.”

Ling Han nodded. “I’ll do my best.”

He took his leave. First, he boosted the Devouring Metal in his hand to the highest level. Then, he refined it into a supreme precious tool that was completely inclined to defense.

Even the Devouring Metal had its limitations. The martial intent it could be branded with was limited, so it was good at attack, but not good at defense. After all, it was only a tool.

This was a completely defensive supreme precious tool. Coupled with the toughness of the Devouring Metal, its defensive ability was extremely strong.

Ling Han returned to the first dimensional layer, and moved everyone in the Celestial Guest Residence over. From now on, this would be the new Celestial Guest Residence. Then, he called the Empress and Hu Niu over, and continued to explore for veins of ore.

He had to reach Third Tier as soon as possible. Otherwise, he really wouldn’t feel safe in this chaotic world. Even Xin Qihu could make him flee in a sorry state.

...

If Xin Qihu were to hear this, he would definitely fly into a rage. He was the greatest prodigy of all eternity, not just some nobody.

After so many years, almost all the veins of ore in this dimension had actually been explored, so Ling Han headed towards the land’s heart.

Perhaps there was another dimension below.
