Chapter 2058: You dare deceive me

In the eyes of the yellow-robed middle-aged man and the others, Ling Han was the largest threat, and had to be killed at the first possible moment. Otherwise, not only would it endanger their lives, the Empress and Hu Niu would also have insurance for their lives, and could not be easily gotten rid of.

But if Ling Han was killed first, they would eliminate a great enemy. In that case, not only would they be able to win, it was even possible that they could capture the Empress and Hu Niu alive.

…If they had the chance, they naturally wanted to get intimate with them. After all, these two women were extraordinarily beautiful.

In their eyes, if the six of them worked together, they would definitely be able to take Ling Han down. After all, the gap between the cultivation levels of both sides was apparent.

This was applicable in most situations, but only against Ling Han was it ineffective.

The toughness of his physique had reached a freakish level, and it was not something that any Dividing Soul Tier could penetrate.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Under the combined barrage of six cultivators at the peak stage of Heaven Soul, Ling Han continuously attacked. There were some attacks that he had indeed not managed to dodge, and there were some he did not even bother to. This physique allowed him to be as willful as he liked.

HIs fists pounded repeatedly, so fast that it could not be described with words.

“How’s it possible!?”

“The speed which he punches at is at least three times faster than ours. He alone can completely block the attacks of three people altogether!”

“Freak!”

The yellow-robed middle-aged man and the others were all dumbfounded. It was obvious that Ling Han’s battle prowess was inferior to theirs, yet the speed at which he attacked was astonishingly fast, with him completely blocking the combined attacks of three of their members.

Though there were still three other people whose attacks were effective, some of the attacks would be dodged by Ling Han, and he would take on other attacks head-on. Thus, the six of them ganging up on him was practically useless.

On the other hand, the Empress and Hu Niu were continuously causing damage to them. Though it was not fatal, if their injuries continued to accumulate, it would ultimately cause a qualitative change.

“Forget about this brat. Let’s kill those two women first,” the yellow-robed middle-aged man called out loudly. At this instant, he did not have any further ******. Compared to his own life and future, what were mere women worth?

As long as he was still alive, and as long as he had status, what beautiful woman would not come easily at just a wave of his hand?

He was very clear about his priorities.

The other five all agreed, and changed the target of their attacks.

This time, it had returned to the previous situation. Ling Han was using the Regulations of Space and Time to distribute the force of attack on the two women. However, in this manner, the battle entered once more into a stalemate.

Ruan Dongxiang looked towards Bewitching Maiden Rou, his eyes shining viciously.

He was naturally stunned by Ling Han’s strength. Three mere Yang Souls were actually capable of blocking six Heaven Souls. This was practically inconceivable! But now that things had progressed thus far, what time did he have to be stunned? He was sure that he would lose his life if it was Ling Han’s side that won.

Thus, he had locked onto Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Why had he not gone into battle? That was because he was too “weak”, so even if he did go into battle, he would only be in the way. Then, similarly, the reason why Bewitching Maiden Rou had not gone on stage was also because she was weaker.

If even Ling Han and the others were only Yang Souls, then Bewitching Maiden Rou could only be at Yang Soul too at most.

He was an Earth Soul, and also had the aptitude of a king tier. He could be invincible in this cultivation level. Thus, if he faced off against Bewitching Maiden Rou, he would definitely be able to win easily.

If he captured this seductive woman, Ling Han and the others would definitely lose their cool, and subsequently, it would naturally lead to a complete defeat.

He showed a cold smirk. Don’t think that he could be underestimated just because he was weak. On the contrary, his intelligence was the highest, and they would only be able to win by depending on him.

Xiu, Ruan Dongxiang leaped out, and charged towards Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Immediately, Bewitching Maiden Rou looked pitiful, and said, “Please don’t hurt me. I am willing to do anything for you!”

Immediately, Ruan Dongxiang’s heart beat wildly. Bewitching Maiden Rou was extremely alluring, and when she pleaded with him softly, he could feel his bones practically melt. Furthermore, “anything” caused his imagination to run wildly.

Bewitching Maiden Rou walked towards him in an incredibly seductive manner, her slender waist swaying left and right, showing off an endless grace and sexual appeal.

Ruan Dongxiang was completely captivated. He clearly knew that this was inappropriate, but he subjectively enjoyed this scene incredibly, and had no desire to make any kind of reaction at all.

“Idiot!”

A voice filled with mockery rang out, and Ruan Dongxiang felt a pain in his chest. He hurriedly got out of the way, and shockingly discovered that there was a sharp blade stuck in his chest that had pierced it right above his heart. If he had not stepped slightly to the side when he experienced pain, his heart would probably have burst by now.

To Dividing Soul Tier elites, while the heart bursting would not cause death, it would still cause a great damage because the life force of the cultivator was gathered in the heart’s blood. Any loss would cause great injury.

He was furious and hateful as he harshly exclaimed, “Witch, you dare deceive me!”

Bewitching Maiden Rou showed a regretful expression. At first, she had wanted to pierce the top of Ruan Dongxiang’s head, and shatter his mind, making a fatal strike. However, this position was too sensitive. She feared that the moment she raised her dagger, the other party would immediately become alert, so stabbing the heart bore a higher guarantee of success.

This was also because her charm techniques were not skillful enough. Otherwise, even if she stabbed aiming for his mind, Ruan Dongxiang would probably just wait for death with a smile on his face.

“I am a deceiving witch in the first place, so what?” Bewitching Maiden Rou scoffed.

Ruan Dongxiang’s hand covered his chest. He was presently suppressing his injuries. The other party had used a Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool, and the injury caused by this stab was not something that could be easily recovered from. Even if it had not truly stabbed into his heart, it was still enough to cause his battle prowess to drop massively.

“Even if I am injured, I can still kill you easily!” he shouted, his eyes bloodshot as he charged towards Bewitching Maiden Rou.

“In your dreams,” Bewitching Maiden Rou retorted with disdain. This kind of man that would only bully “delicate” women was the most disgraceful type.

Boom! Boom! Boom!?The two of them also began to fight.

At first, Ruan Dongxiang should have been able to enjoy an absolute advantage, but because he had sustained an injury, his battle prowess had dropped greatly. Thus, even though he still had the upper hand, if he wanted to capture or even kill Bewitching Maiden Rou, it was not something that could be done quickly.

Fires of rage burnt in his heart, and he no longer concerned himself with the situation going on between Ling Han’s group and his six companions. All he wanted to do now was to capture Bewitching Maiden Rou.

He swore that if he captured Bewitching Maiden Rou alive, he was going to ***** her till death. If she died… he was still going to ******* her. Throughout his life, he had never been deceived by any woman before, and he had even sustained a serious injury because of this.

Under his powerful offensive, Bewitching Maiden Rou’s situation became worse and worse. She was completely suppressed, and could not even manage a single counter. Even defending herself was very straining on her.

“Hahaha, let’s see how you will dodge this move!” Ruan Dongxiang finally forced Bewitching Maiden Rou into a corner. He was extremely pleased as he delivered a palm strike right at Bewitching Maiden Rou’s ******. Not only was he going to capture this woman, he was going to ravage her as well.

His palm descended, and when the distance was visibly drawing closer between him and those towering breasts, a grin of satisfaction appeared at the corners of his lips. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His betrothed had run off with another man, and this was a thorn in his heart. Yet now, he could play with the woman belonging to another man, which made him feel a perverse kind of satisfaction.

Squeeze them to the point they burst!

His eyes burned with fire, and his palm grabbed out without the slightest bit of mercy.

Pa, the palm landed.

‘Yi, that’s not right. Why is it completely empty?’

Ruan Dongxiang astonishingly discovered that his wrist had actually been grabbed by someone else, and he had not managed to lay his palm on those impressive breasts of Bewitching Maiden Rou.

The person that had grabbed him was… Ling Han!

Hadn’t this guy been embroiled in an intense battle with the others?

Gasp!

Ruan Dongxiang immediately came to a realization. He turned his head again, and saw that the yellow-robed middle-aged man and the others had already been defeated. Some had been sliced into half, while some into six pieces, and some had even been turned into a pile of mush without even a single complete bone left to be seen.

With a shudder, he felt his legs grow weak.
