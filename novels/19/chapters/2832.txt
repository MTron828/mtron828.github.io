2833 Daughter of a freak

Rong Xinkuan was sent flying with a single strike, and that was not the end of it, either. When he landed, he was throwing up blood continuously, coughing so hard that his whole chest was covered with blood. He looked completely miserable and battered.

He had not been killed or knocked unconscious. Thus, his eyes were wide open as he looked blankly at Ling Xi. How had the latter unleashed such incredibly terrifying power? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The gap between them was like the gap between a child and an adult in battle; how could he possibly match her?

How could a Ninth Heaven Celestial King be as powerful as this? It should be known that he had actually used a Heavenly Venerate Technique.

!!

…This naturally was because Ling Xi had used that small world inside her, which allowed her to possess the strength of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

In truth, she had also done something that even Ling Han had not imagined—not only was she extracting the power of this heaven and earth, she was also feeding back to it, which allowed this small world to continuously grow.

It was just like she was presently a Genesis World herself. However, this world was too solitary and lonely, only having a single dimension. Furthermore, it was extraordinarily tiny.

But this kind of alternative path was still a brave experiment. Who knew, maybe she would be able to pioneer a completely different path of her own.

Hence, Ling Xi’s present burst of power was not something as simple as Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. In fact, it could even be close, or reaching, the level of First Tier.

Why had she been strengthening her foundations all this while? It was because she was nurturing this world.

“Impossible! Impossible!” Rong Xinkuan’s expression was filled with confusion. He could not accept this result. They were both at the Ninth Heaven, so how could the gap between them be as wide as this?

“Owed debts should be repaid, and one who murders should be executed in turn!” Ling Xi stated calmly, but her eyes were filled with absolute determination. “The people of the Ling Clan… will not be insulted!”

These words roused all the servants of the Ling Clan in their surroundings very much. They could tell that not only was Rong Xinkuan a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, his background would definitely be even more shocking, yet Ling Xi actually declared that he would pay for his crime with death, which warmed their hearts.

Even if the person who had died was only a servant of the Ling Clan, the Ling Clan would still seek justice for them. Even if the offender had a powerful background, they would not care.

“Hehe, what bold words from a little girl,” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate finally spoke. He had not moved earlier, because he had been certain that Rong Xinkuan could not possibly die from that one strike. If a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t tell even that, he really should kill himself.

He stood, arms crossed behind his back. He did not need to make a move at all, and merely the bit of aura seeping from him was enough to suppress eternity and restrain the heavens.

A Third Tier Heavenly Venerate was really that strong.

Ling Xi’s expression was grim, but she had Ling Han’s tenacity. No matter how frightening her powerful enemy was, there was no way she would bow her head. She said, “Senior, you have allowed your junior to come to our Ling Clan and cause trouble. May I ask how we have offended you?”

“Take her down!” Rong Xinkuan leaped to his feet, but the strike that Ling Xi had struck him was no light blow. This quick jump instantly caused him to cough repeatedly, blood once more spurting out madly.

Ling Xi was slightly surprised. A Ninth Heaven actually dared to yell at a Heavenly Venerate like this?

Even the son of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate could not be so arrogant. This was a Heavenly Venerate that even the heavens had to respect, so how could a Ninth Heaven be insolent towards them?

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate involuntarily felt killing intent rise up in him as well. This idiot, did he really think that he could command a Heavenly Venerate? However, he had already let the act proceed to this extent, so there was naturally no way he would give up halfway.

Thus, he sneered, “Young miss, are you willing to surrender yourself, or do you prefer to have me act?”

Thoughts raced through Ling Xi’s mind. Her father, mother, and Aunt Hu Niu were all in seclusion, and it was not clear when they would be able to come out. Meanwhile, the Rain Emperor and the others had missed traveling after such a long period of quiet, so they had all gone to roam the world. Presently, there was actually not one Heavenly-Venerable-Tier power that could be mobilized in the entire Ling City.

Who was this man?

It should be known that Ling City was in the center of power of the Lin Clan, and had affable relations with Zhou and Chu Clans. This was a massive, astonishing force. Why had these two people still dared to attack them with hostility?

“This junior boldly seeks guidance from Senior.” Ling Xi curtsied slightly. Because Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had not moved, she also responded calmly and quietly, not showing the slightest bit of anger.

“Humph!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate sneered, a sliver of displeasure flashing through him.

In the past, even Ling Han could only flee from him, yet now he had actually fallen to a level that he was fighting with the former’s daughter.

How humiliating.

To show how proud Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was, one only had to take a look at his title. He was the emperor among cultivators, and every word he said possessed enormous might.

“Then I will have you suffer the consequences of your actions!” He moved. Boom! The air of Primal Chaos condensed, and it was like the world had just been created, turning into a giant hand of dark crimson, which grabbed out at Ling Xi.

Ling Xi’s expression was solemn. With a soft exclamation, weng, boundless light was unleashed from all over her body, her aura instantly rising to the height of the First Tier.

“What!?” Rong Xinkuan immediately gaped, his face filled with disbelief.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King was actually capable of unleashing the Heavenly Venerable Tier’s might?

This was not a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, but rather a genuine First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

‘Impossible!’

Peng!

Ling Xi delivered an attack, piercing a hole in that giant hand of dark crimson. Her body slightly trembled, her beautiful face immediately turning pale, and she appeared extremely captivating, and would touch anyone’s heart.

Even if she had unleashed the battle prowess of the First Tier, a Third Tier was a Third Tier. A casual strike would already surpass the First Tier, which caused her severe injury.

However, this still could not be denied that Ling Xi had created a miracle.

Even Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate’s eyes slightly widened, and he felt disbelief.

Ling Han was already freakish enough, but his daughter seemed to be even more shocking.

…The reason that Ling Xi could be this strong was because not only she had activated the small world inside her body, she was also using a Heavenly Venerate Technique. As the daughter of Ling Han and the Empress, how could she not have learned any Heavenly Venerate Technique?

With her using Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier power to activate a Heavenly Venerate Technique, her battle prowess reaching the First Tier was nothing to be shocked about.

After Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was slightly started a moment, he regained his arrogant demeanor. So what if she was even more freakish? The gap in their cultivation levels was too wide, and she was still completely no match for him.

The people of the Ling Clan were too freakish, and all of them had to be eliminated as soon as possible!

His eyes sharpened, and he moved again. This time, he was not planning to capture Ling Xi, but was instead going to kill this young woman who had boundless future prospects.

Boom! He once again sent out a giant dark crimson hand, which descended on Ling Xi. The power of Third Tier, capable of killing a First Tier elite countless times over in an instant, was completely released.

Ling Xi could not block this.

She retreated, but not only did the giant dark crimson hand follow her closely like a shadow, its speed was even faster, and rapidly narrowed the distance between it and Ling Xi.

Peng, peng, peng! Wherever this giant hand passed, every structure was destroyed as if they had been mowed down.

The power of Third Tier was really too terrifying.

“Young Mistress!” every member of the Ling Clan exclaimed, filled with anxiety. However, they were too weak, and even if they wanted to help, they were powerless to do so.

...

The giant hand assailed her, and Ling Xi could only blast out a full-power attack, and closed her eyes. All else would have to depend on fate.

Boom!

A loud bang resounded, world-shaking in its volume.

Ling Xi was surprised. She did not feel any power blasting into her. She hurriedly opened her eyes, yet there was an extremely beautiful figure standing in front of her, with both her arms raised to hold up the heavens.

“Mother!” she exclaimed, naturally filled with joy.

Clang! The reaction from the heaven and earth was intense. Immediately, lightning blazed wildly, striking madly on the Empress.

“You have broken through?” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate frowned. He could see very clearly that the Empress’s present state showed that she had broken through, which induced a reaction from the heaven and earth. Even if it could do no harm, bolts of lightning were still striking madly on her.

“You dare touch my daughter, you are courting death!” the Empress declared menacingly.
