1533 I“ll Go!

After stabilizing himself, the Tranquil Heart Saint glared at Ling Han, and said, “Cut the nonsense out! Get back!”

What an absolute joke. He hadn’t died yet, so did he need his disciple to step forward to block his enemy for him?

However, Ling Han smiled, and said, “He’s nothing more than a no-name from some small unknown place. What does it matter if I face a single strike of his?”

‘No-name?’

The disciples were all worked into a fervor upon hearing his words. ‘Aren’t you extremely arrogant? Well, we’re even more arrogant!’

“Good on you, Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling, I love you!”

The new disciples all shouted in excitement. They were young, and thus they were all hot-blooded and easily worked up. However, many of the senior disciples were also influenced by this atmosphere, and they also joined into the chorus of shouting disciples. Even if they were killed by Hu Yingmu one by one, they still couldn’t back down and weakly submit.

They could lose, but they couldn’t abandon their dignity.

A cold look appeared in Hu Yingmu’s eyes. These mere ants actually dared to belittle him? He waved his hand, and said, “Come, I’ll make sure to smash you into pieces with a single strike. In fact, I’ll keep all of the broken pieces the same size as well.”

Ling Han waved his hand right back, saying, “Enough with the boasting. In any case, you’re about to be slapped in the face.”

“Haha!” Hu Yingmu roared with laughter. This young man was truly arrogant. Tsk, he was only 100 or so, yet he had already reached the peak stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. His talent was truly quite astonishing. In fact, this talent was already on par with the supreme prodigies of the Forbidden Lands—perhaps even superior.

Killing a prodigy like this would probably give him a great sense of achievement.

“Guy whose child doesn’t have an asshole, hurry up and attack me. Grandpa Dog will concede that you’re powerful if you manage to push me back a single step!” A loud bark suddenly sounded from among the disciples.

It went without saying that this was the voice of the large black dog. After all, how could he not participate in such an exciting confrontation?

Hu Yingmu’s expression instantly changed. He had been fully focused on cultivation for the entire first half of his life. As such, he had never considered the problem of having children and descendants. Rather, he planned to marry hundreds of women after advancing to the Saint Tier. However, having children as a Saint... was extremely difficult!

Right now, this Grandpa Dog or whatever was actually cursing him to have children without assholes? This struck him right where it hurt.

“Who’s barking?!” He wore a baleful expression as he swept his eyes over the disciples.

“It’s your Grandpa Dog! If you can, come and bite me!” The large black dog’s voice was adrift, and it sounded like it was coming from different locations whenever he spoke. Even the Saints were unable to pinpoint his location. His skills were extremely mysterious.

Hu Yingmu unleashed his divine sense, which surged outward like billowing waves. He was going to uncover the large black dog.

“Oi, are you going to fight or not?” Ling Han asked impatiently. “You’re a Saint, after all, so why are you being so whiny and hesitant?”

Everyone laughed upon hearing this.

Hu Yingmu was being relentlessly teased by Ling Han and the large black dog, and this dragged the disciples out from the frustration and hopelessness they had felt after the defeat suffered by the nine Saints.

Hu Yingmu trained his gaze on Ling Han. Although he felt a strong desire to kill the large black dog, he was aware that he wouldn’t be able to find him anytime soon. Thus, it wouldn’t hurt to kill Ling Han first. This was also a supreme prodigy, and thus killing him would definitely give him a strong sense of achievement.

Moreover, this person had even dared to ridicule him! Did he not deserve to die?

“Hold it right there!” the Tranquil Heart Saint roared as he stepped forward. He couldn’t allow his disciple to battle for him.

Xiu!

Another golden path appeared as the Star Sand Saint descended upon the scene. He couldn’t maintain his composure any longer. He gave Ling Han a stare before waving his sleeves and saying, “Stand back!” Although Ling Han’s talent was inferior to Gu Daoyi’s, his battle prowess among those at the same cultivation level was stronger. Thus, the Star Sand Saint also had strong hopes for him. This being the case, he couldn’t bear to watch him die.

The Star Sand Saint turned around to face Hu Yingmu. “You can piss off now!” he chided.

However, Hu Yingmu was unfazed by this, and he said, “I’ll naturally leave if you give me what I want! Otherwise, I can also leave if one of you is able to withstand a single strike of mine. Not only will I leave, but I’ll even offer an apology! I’ll admit that I underestimated you ants and weaklings!”

He was still as arrogant as always, even in the presence of a Great Saint.

The Star Sand Saint wore a dark expression, and there was killing intent emanating from his body. He felt a strong desire to kill this person, even if it meant provoking the Saint Kings of the Forbidden Lands.

“Let me face him,” Ling Han said as he stepped forward again. “He’s but a mere pawn, so there’s no need for you to personally deal with him. Believe me!” There was a look of strong conviction on Ling Han’s face.

An Eternal River Tier elite had actually uttered the words “believe me” before a Great Saint. What kind of confidence and boldness was this?

The Star Sand Saint was involuntarily stirred by Ling Han’s demeanor. At the same time, a rare feeling of doubt arose in his mind. Had he misjudged Ling Han?

Talent was indeed very important. However, had Gu Daoyi possessed the type of confidence and domineering demeanor that Ling Han was displaying right now?

This domineering nature, this confidence, this demeanor... Even the Great Saint was moved by Ling Han’s spectacular display.

‘This young man is incredible! He’s definitely going to become a supreme elite!’ 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Star Sand Saint silently made a decision in his mind. He was definitely going to protect Ling Han no matter what—even if this meant killing Hu Yingmu and provoking the Saint Kings of the Forbidden Lands. If worse came to worst, he would simply relocate the entire martial arts academy. With the ginormous size of the Immortal Realm, could they not find somewhere safe to relocate?

Ling Han took a few steps forward until he was standing face to face with Hu Yingmu. “Only one strike?” he asked.

Hu Yingmu was in no hurry, either, and he calmly replied, “Only one strike.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “How about three strikes. I’m afraid that you’ll renege on your promise in anger and embarrassment if you fail to defeat me in a single strike.”

Pu!

Many of the disciples spluttered in shock upon hearing this. That was a Saint he was speaking to! When a Saint came up against an Eternal River Tier elite, unleashing one strike or unleashing 10,000 strikes wouldn’t make an iota of difference. After all, the latter would be killed in a single strike.

He was ridiculing him; Ling Han was definitely ridiculing Hu Yingmu!

‘Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

‘That Hu Yingmu is far too arrogant. It’s only right that he also gets a taste of his own medicine!’

The large black dog couldn’t help but stroke his chin as he stood upright on his hind legs. “This brat is learning more and more of my demeanor. Could he be a child that I accidentally fathered in the past?” Fortunately, Ling Han wasn’t there to hear his musings. Otherwise, he would definitely chase after the large black dog and beat him to death.

Hu Yingmu’s eyes bulged in anger upon hearing this. There were flames of rage burning within them.

The tongue of this person... was far too toxic! He definitely couldn’t allow him to speak anymore. Otherwise, he would die of rage even if he was a Saint!

‘Die, measly ant!’

He immediately launched an attack, swatting his palm at Ling Han. He didn’t activate any secret technique, and he more so didn’t unleash the might of his precious robe. This was a simple and unremarkable strike. However, this was still the attack of a Saint, after all, and thus it was powerful enough to crush heaven and earth even being as casual as it was. Who under the level of Saint could block this attack?

Boom!

His attack landed.

The Star Sand Saint, Tranquil Heart Saint, and other Saints were already prepared to intervene at any moment. They naturally wouldn’t stand by idly and watch one of their disciples be ruthlessly killed. However, just as they were about to intervene, they all paused and exclaimed in surprise. Their expressions... were indescribably strange.

The disciples had all thought that the 10 Saints would intervene before Hu Yingmu’s attack landed. However, Hu Yingmu’s palm had already pressed down, yet the Saints were still standing there unmoving. It was as if they were stone statues.

‘Why are they not intervening?’

‘Why are they watching Ling Han get killed just like this?’

‘How can this be?!’

The attack of a Saint was naturally devastating. The surroundings were flooded with plumes of dust and earth, though they were rapidly dissipating and settling down.

Pu!

The disciples all spluttered in unison when they saw a figure walking out from amid the plumes of dust and earth. Their jaws dropped open, and their eyes bulged out. It was as if they had been turned into stone.

That was Ling Han, perfectly fine and unscathed.

An Eternal River Tier elite, one at the Low extreme, no less, had actually withstood an attack from a Saint—even though this was only a casual attack. T-t-t-t-this... This was definitely the most absurd thing in the world!

This was completely unfathomable! There was definitely something wrong with the heavens!

‘Holy f*cking god!’
