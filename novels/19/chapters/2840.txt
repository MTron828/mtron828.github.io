2841 Tricked

Rong Yang couldn’t help but shake his head, and gained a new awareness of how black-hearted Ling Han could be.

F*ck, this guy really had a string of tricks ready for others.

Rong Yang felt extreme sympathy for these rookies. Later, they would definitely be beaten down to the point that they lost all confidence in themselves. But who asked them to be so self-centered and think that only they were the strongest in this world? This could be considered paying a price to learn a precious lesson.

“All right, I will be the referee,” a Fourth Tier elite said. His name was Zhuang Bi, and his cultivation level was the peak stage of the Fourth Tier. He was also the one with the highest cultivation level here. In an all-out battle, even Ling Han might not be his match.

A fight naturally had to have rules. Every person who fought would have to sever a Heavenly Venerable Seal from their mind in advance, and one of the more widely known seven seals was definitely not accepted. They were really everywhere, so who would need them?

But Heavenly Venerable Seals could only be transmitted, and could not be taught, so how could others know that the Heavenly Venerable Seal severed was one of the more widely known seven seals?

Simple. One only had to sever that Heavenly Venerable Seal first, and then display those seven seals.

Though their display would be very blurred, who had not mastered these seven seals? No matter how fuzzy they were, they could still be sensed.

All of them severed a Heavenly Venerable Seal each, and sealed it in a unique stone. Otherwise, there was nothing that could contain a Heavenly Venerable Seal.

Ling Han was no exception. He thought for a moment, and then severed the Ninth Seal. It could not be helped. The only ninth grade seals he had were the more widely known seven seals, and what was left after that was eighth grade seals.

Everyone sealed the Heavenly Venerable Seals in a stone slab. They could not be stored for too long. After all, they had already been severed. However, it was completely possible for them to last for the period of time needed for a few fights.

These stone slabs were secured by Zhuang Bi, and there were also a great many Heavenly Venerates who would stand guard, so there was no need to worry that Zhuang Bi would embezzle it. Otherwise, there would be no further need to stay in this circle in the future.

“Who’s first?” Ling Han swept an eye at those more than dozen challengers.

“Me!”

“Me!”

“I’ll do it!”

Everyone was scrambling over each other. Ling Han had only severed a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and who knew just how many he had? If they were too late, wouldn’t there be none left?

Ling Han chuckled. “No need to be so troublesome. All of you can fight at the same time, and I can also save myself some time.”

Without waiting for these people to agree, Ling Han moved first.

Peng, peng, peng! He threw 14 punches in a row, and those challengers were all sent flying, completely losing all power to battle.

“Done and dealt with,” Ling Han clapped his hands, walking towards Zhuang Bi.

Since he had won, he naturally had to retrieve his reward.

Everyone was surprised and shocked by Ling Han’s mad barrage of blows. No one managed to even react.

Though they had all heard how powerful Ling Han was, and how he was a freak that had broken records, no one had expected that he would really be as strong as this. Those were 14 Heavenly Venerates, and they had all suppressed their cultivation level to the First Tier, so this was a battle of equal cultivation levels, and they still couldn’t even withstand a single blow?

Ling Han took 15 stone slabs in total from Zhuang Bi, and opened them one after another, absorbing the Heavenly Venerable Seals that were sealed within into his mind. He immediately began comprehension. If he could not quickly master these seals, they would very soon disappear.

Including the Ninth Seal that he himself had severed, he would have to comprehend them one by one. Since he had already severed it, there would not be the slightest bit of memory left of it, and comprehending it again would not be any faster.

Those Heavenly Venerates that had been sent flying all gradually got back to their feet. They were all looking at Ling Han indignantly. They had failed from the get go. The main lead, Meng Dong, was not even here yet, and they had already lost a battle.

How would they have any more confidence to face Meng Dong?

Ling Han sat on the sidelines, focusing on comprehending these newly obtained Heavenly Venerable Seals. He discovered that, aside from that Ninth Seal of his, what the others had actually taken out were actually all ninth-grade seals as well.

They were not the more widely known seven seals, but every level of Heavenly Venerable Seals would have 111 of them. Hence, aside from the more widely known seven seals, there were another 104 Heavenly Venerable Seals which had boosting effects of less than 10.

However, Ling Han was unconcerned, because he was ambitious, and wanted to comprehend 999 Heavenly Venerable Seals. Naturally, he would not mind the level of the Heavenly Venerable Seal. Of course, it would definitely be better if he could get higher-grade seals now.

He boosted his divine sense with Regulations of Time, and his divine sense channeled at high speed. Merely in over a dozen days, he had already mastered these seals at a preliminary level, but to completely master them was definitely not something that would only take a few days.

Shockingly, he discovered that when he strung these seals together, there were actually five that could resonate.

Combination seals!

Unfortunately, even if five ninth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals were combined together, the boost they could provide would only be a mere 13 times, which was still less than any eight grade Heavenly Venerable Seal that he had.

It was fine. Now, there were five combination seals, and this could expand to 10, 50, or 100 seals in the future. Furthermore, when he cultivated, the more Heavenly Venerable Seals he had, the better, and only in battle would he need a seal with great explosive power.

Since he had the time, he continued cultivating.

Right at this moment, the main lead finally arrived.

An overwhelming aura surged out. Peng! A figure also descended from the skies. He did not control his power at all, and when he landed, he crashed ruthlessly into the great mountain. Peng! This great mountain was instantly shattered with a loud boom.

Aside from Devouring Metal in its complete state, was there anything else that could withstand the power of Heavenly Venerable Tier?

Instantly, everyone rose into the air.

Ling Han was also forced to interrupt his comprehension. He frowned. He had just been cultivating peacefully, so who had disturbed him?

“Meng Dong!” quite a number of people shouted, looking towards that domineering guy.

Meng Dong was a young man with a strong, heavy built. He looked around, his eyes filled with carelessness. He was clearly only a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, yet his appearance still caused a great many Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates to feel wariness.

“Very good. With so many people here, I am sure that I will be able to obtain even more Heavenly Venerable Seals.” He laughed loudly, seemingly brimming with confidence.

“Arrogance!” someone immediately declared disdainfully.

Meng Dong looked over, and beckoned with a hand gesture. “Do you dare to fight? For trash like you, I can accept stakes of one to 10. How about it?”

That man instantly looked tempted. The stakes were one to 10. He only had to win once, and he would be able to win 10 Heavenly Venerable Seals. Where else would he find a deal as good as that?

“All right, I will fight you!”

He severed a single Heavenly Venerable Seal, and Meng Dong did indeed sever 10. The two of them began their battle afterwards, but that man was no match for Meng Dong at all. In a few moves, he was defeated.

Meng Dong sneered, walked over, and took the spoils of the battle that belonged to him. However, he did not stow it into his mind, but rather swept an eye over his surroundings. “Is there anyone else here who wishes to fight? It’s still the same stakes, one to 10.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Forget about Second Tier; I can’t be bothered to bully them. Any Third Tiers? You do not have to suppress your cultivation level, and I will play around with you guys.”

Originally, there were some Second and First Tiers that were moving restlessly. They all had the invincible aptitude within their respective cultivation levels, but they were certain that they could not match a Third Tier with just Second-Tier power. Hence, they naturally did not dare step out to take the challenge.

“Is there no one? This is truly disappointing!” Meng Dong shook his head. “Then I will relax the rules even further. You guys can add on a few more people, and even 10 is no problem.”

...

“Meng Dong, you are too arrogant!” Zhuang Bi exclaimed.
