Chapter 1945: Siblings from the Liu Clan

However, since Hu Dong had already been defeated, who else dared to challenge Ling Han?

Ran Fei stepped forward, and said, “Young Master Zhu, let me capture him.” It was clear that fourth severance emperor tiers could only rival Ling Han, but not suppress him. In the Severing Mundane Tier, perhaps only Holy Son Liu could suppress him.

Of course, Celestial Maiden Liu Han could also suppress him. However, could they command these two supreme beings?

Zhu Zijun pondered for a moment before slowly nodding his head.

After receiving Zhu Zijun’s agreement, Ran Fei immediately stepped forward.

Boom!

An aura that was unique to Dividing Soul Tier elites instantly erupted into the surroundings. Even though alchemists were extremely weak against cultivators of the same cultivation, Ran Fei possessed an advantage of one major tier over Ling Han. Thus, in comparison, he was still indescribably powerful.

To a fourth severance cultivator—even if they were an emperor tier—he would still be an insurmountable mountain.

The king tiers in the surroundings all wore expressions of disdain. This was a gathering of prodigies, yet upon being unable to defeat Ling Han, Zhu Zijun was actually seeking the help of a “senior”. They naturally viewed such action with contempt. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Strength was king in the cultivation world. This strength not only referred to one’s cultivation, but it also referred to their ability to remain invincible against those at the same cultivation.

At this moment, Ling Han also lost his patience. His voice was cold as he said, “By the looks of it, I need to discipline you people for Third Senior Brother.”

“You still dare to utter such nonsense!” Ran Fei said with a cold chuckle. He immediately charged forward.

Even if he were relatively weak, he was still a Dividing Soul Tier elite. Thus, he would possess a crushing advantage over any Severing Mundane Tier emperor tier.

Right now, even the king tiers in the surroundings were wearing expressions of unease. Even though they weren’t being targeted, the overwhelming power of a Dividing Soul Tier elite still wasn’t something that they could withstand. They had no option but to retreat to avoid his aura.

Meanwhile, the emperor tiers fared slightly better. However, it wasn’t much better. They still had no option but to retreat.

There were five celestial tiers, and each subsequent one would be an insurmountable mountain.

Ling Han... was going to suffer a miserable fate!

Boom!

Ran Fei’s hand crashed down.

Pa!

Ling Han replied with a casual slap. He clearly hadn’t unleashed any Regulations, and his movements clearly weren’t very quick. Everyone could see his movements clearly. However, as if under a trance, Ran Fei dazedly stared at this slap cracking across his face.

There was a crisp slapping sound as Ran Fei was sent flying back. However, before he could fly far, Ling Han grabbed his calf, and forcefully dragged him back.

“There are so many things you could have learned, yet you insisted on learning such dirty tricks. How did Third Senior Brother teach you?”

Pa!

Ling Han slapped Ran Fei again before saying, “You need to respect your seniors.”

Pa!

“Even if I’m not your senior, as fellow alchemists, should we not aim to help each other?”

Pa!

“With no regard for right or wrong, the first thing you did was accuse me of smearing others. Just who do you think you are?”

Pa!

“If it weren’t for my strength, wouldn’t I need to silently swallow this humiliation?”

With each point that he raised, Ling Han would slap Ran Fei across the face. Each of these slaps was extremely powerful, and it wasn’t long before Ran Fei’s entire face became swollen. He looked as ugly as a pig.

Pa, pa, pa!

The crisp slapping sounds were incessant, and everyone in the surroundings descended into a state of shock and disbelief.

A Dividing Soul Tier elite was completely powerless as Ling Han slapped him across the face.

Th-th-this... Just how great was the gulf between their strength?

Fifth severance monarch tier!

At this moment, no one would doubt Ling Han’s strength any longer. Only a monarch tier could overcome the gulf of one major tier.

Gasp!

He was truly a monarch tier!

“Heh, it seems like everyone’s having fun, huh?” There was a long laugh, after which a young man strode over. Behind him was a stunningly beautiful woman. The two of them appeared relaxed, yet they were radiating with a domineering aura that forced everyone in the surroundings to retreat.

“Holy Son Liu!” many people said in a trembling voice. There were expressions of absolute respect and reverence on their faces.

This was a supreme prodigy whom they could only gaze up at. The words fifth severance monarch tier were more than enough to describe his overwhelming strength.

Meanwhile, the person beside him was Liu Han, his younger sister. These two siblings were both cultivation prodigies, and they had both become powerful monarch tiers. This was a rare feat, even in the history of the Celestial Realm. Just how much did the heavens adore them to allow both of them to become so extraordinarily outstanding?

“Friend, can you stop for a moment?” Liu Jie said to Ling Han. Even though this was a question, his tone was that of a command.

This was only natural. After all, he was a monarch tier, so everyone had to obey his words. Who dared to question him?

Ling Han glanced at Liu Jie, and an expression of displeasure spread across his face.

If Liu Jie had asked in a friendly manner, he wouldn’t have insisted on being unreasonable. However, upon arriving, Liu Jie had directly issued a command at him. This instantly caused Ling Han to feel ticked off. He slapped Ran Fei once more before turning around, and saying, “I’m disciplining my junior, so do I need you to stick your nose in?”

‘F*ck! This person is so audacious!’

Everyone was stunned upon seeing Ling Han retort Liu Jie. Even though Ling Han had already proven his strength as a monarch tier, no one believed that he stood a chance against Liu Jie.

This was because there was also a concept of strong and weak among monarch tiers. Among the monarch tiers from the Wide Prosperity Heaven, Liu Jie was ranked around 20th. Although this was near the bottom, was this not stronger than Ling Han? After all, if Ling Han were more powerful, would he not have become famous already?

“Ling Han?” Liu Jie mused. He wasn’t angered. Even in the Wide Prosperity Heaven, there were only around 20 monarch tiers in total. Each of them could become a Celestial King in the future, and they were the pillars of the Wide Prosperity Heaven.

He had learned Ling Han’s name by listening to the conversations in the surroundings, and he quietly murmured it to himself. He was certain that he had never heard this name before.

“I never knew that such a person existed under the branch of Grandmaster Zhu Feng!” he said.

This was incredible. An alchemist had actually raised a monarch tier? Who would believe this?

“Release him first!” Liu Han commanded. There was strong displeasure in her voice.

Liu Jie had already commanded him to stop, yet Ling Han was still acting as he pleased. He was far too arrogant.

No matter what, this was still the residence of Liu Jie. Thus, by fighting here, just how much did he disrespect Liu Jie?

“I’m merely disciplining my junior. There’s no need for you to worry,” Ling Han said.

After asking someone, Liu Jie immediately learned of the current situation. He was astonished by what he heard. A monarch tier was actually impersonating an alchemist? He couldn’t wrap his head around this.

However, if one were to say that Zhu Zijun and the others were lying, that would be far too preposterous. Did they dare to refute such an important relationship in public? Wouldn’t Zhu Zijun become an unfilial grandson?

He pondered for a moment before saying, “We should deal with these matters one by one. Weren’t you competing in alchemy? Continue!”

Once he learned of Ling Han’s skill in alchemy, he would be able to largely determine whether he was lying or not.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Now this is the way to resolve problems!”

“Then hurry up and release him!” Liu Han chimed. Because first impressions were the strongest, she had a very negative view of Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “My alchemical pill was swapped out by him, so how can we continue if I don’t get it back?”

“Absolute nonsense!” Ran Fei hurriedly shouted. If he were indicted with this crime in public, he might even be expelled by Zhu Feng. That would be far too cruel.

“Is it up to you to say whether this is nonsense or not?” Ling Han said in a cold voice. He was supremely disappointed in this junior’s character.

“Then is it up to you to say?” Liu Han asked in a menacing voice. She had already endured Ling Han’s haughty attitude for a very long time.

“It’s up to the truth!” Ling Han said. It was also at this moment that he retrieved a Spatial God Tool from Ran Fei’s sleeves. He retrieved an alchemical pill from this Spatial God Tool, and he could naturally tell whether this was the alchemical pill that he had refined or not.
