Chapter 2445: Fruit Fragrance

??

Ling Han and the others were all trapped on the island. There were hundreds of water vines blocking their path, and they couldn’t break through this barrier at all.

They had attempted to leave from different directions, yet they discovered that there was a mind-numbing number of water vines. Each direction had been blocked by several hundred water vines. It was clear that these water vines didn’t want them to leave.

“We can’t just stay like this!”

Everyone frowned in thought. They didn’t have any time to waste. To say nothing of the fact that they could only stay here for 10,000 years, the most important thing was that there was still a flawless Celestial Seed to fight for. This pertained to reaching the Heavenly Venerable Tier. In fact, it even pertained to how far they could ascend in the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

No one was willing to advance to the Celestial King Tier, sacrificing themself to help the others. Before the last moment arrived, no one was willing to do this.

One by one, the days crept by. No one else arrived on the island. It was as if this island genuinely only welcomed monarch stars.

“Huh?!”

One month passed, and everyone suddenly sat up in surprise.

“Do you guys smell that?” Dongfang Rui asked.

Xuan Rong nodded, and replied, “It’s an indescribable fragrance.”

“This fragrance even contains the fragments of a Celestial Seed. Even though it’s only some fragments, according to my analysis, the level of this Celestial Seed is astonishingly high,” Shi Chanzi said.

They all possessed a complete Celestial Seed Mark in their divine sense, so it was naturally very easy to perform a comparison.

Everyone exchanged a glance. “There’s a Celestial Tree here!”

This was a Celestial Tree, and it had produced a complete Celestial Seed. Moreover, the level of this Celestial Seed was astonishingly high.

“Perhaps… those water vines trapped us here so that we could obtain this Celestial Seed?” Jia Lan arrived at a hard-to-believe conclusion.

Was this… possible?

Bewitching Maiden Rou pondered for a moment before saying, “The Celestial Seed was about to ripen, so the water vines forced us onto this island to obtain this rare opportunity?”

“Otherwise, it would be a waste of this Celestial Seed. That would be opposed to the dao of heaven and earth!” Dongfang Rui said with a nod. He appeared confident in his conclusion.

This was most likely the case. The water vines had herded them here, and they simply trapped them here without attacking. A while ago, they still hadn’t understood the reason behind this. They couldn’t figure out the reason no matter how hard they wracked their brains. Now, however, everything could be explained.

This was an opportunity bestowed upon them by heaven and earth!

Why could only monarch stars arrive here? This was because the other measly cultivators weren’t worthy of obtaining such a high-level Celestial Seed!

“This isn’t the flawless Celestial Seed, is it?” Xuan Rong suddenly remarked. His heart thumped against his chest. Even as the descendant of a Heavenly Venerate, he couldn’t help but feel a strong sense of greed.

This Celestial Seed could be the determining factor regarding whether they could ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier or not. Otherwise, it wasn’t as if monarch stars hadn’t appeared in the past before. However, how many of them had become Heavenly Venerates?

They had to grab this opportunity with both hands!

“No matter what, let’s look for it first,” Huo Furong said.

Everyone followed the trail of the fragrance. They traversed the mountains, and they quickly discovered a cave of unknown depth. It was pitch-black, not emitting a single ray of light. Even with their powerful vision, they couldn’t see into the cave.

“I can’t observe it with my divine sense, either. This cave is extremely peculiar, and it’s as if it can engulf all matter, allowing only entrance but no exit,” the Rain Emperor said in a solemn voice.

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and said, “The worst-case scenario will be if we can only enter and not exit as well.”

This place was far too eerie. Even though this could be explained as a bestowal from heaven and earth, those water vines in the sea were far too sinister. Ling Han found it difficult to believe that this was a great opportunity.

Perhaps it was, but it would definitely be riddled with grave dangers.

“Coward!” Dongfang Rui said with a sneer.

The Rain Emperor glared at him, and asked, “You’re itching for a beating.”

Dongfang Rui almost exploded in rage. However, glancing at the displeased Empress and Hu Niu, and glancing at the calm Ling Han… Who knew what kind of terrifying killing intent was hidden under their faces?

He calculated the strength of both sides. If they truly engaged in a conflict, only Xuan Rong was certain to help him. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s side had four people—only counting monarch stars. There was a great imbalance in power.

He couldn’t engage in this conflict. Of course, this was unless Xuan Rong was willing to advance to the Celestial King Tier.

However, a grand opportunity awaited them, so he naturally couldn’t mess things up here.

Forget about it! He would endure this!

He lowered his head, ignoring the Rain Emperor’s threat.

“Don’t provoke others if you’re not strong enough, f*cking idiot,” Ling Han said. His voice was extremely loud.

Dongfang Rui almost exploded in anger. Back then, he had been invincible in his cultivation level, and he had been referred to as peerless under the level of Celestial King. In fact, after entering the Heaven Forbidden State, he had even been able to rival those at the First Heaven. Just how domineering had he been?

Moreover, his father was a Heavenly Venerate, so even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had to treat him with respect. Since when had he ever been derided like this?

The others all exchanged a glance. However, no one spoke up for him.

At their level, they were all loath to rely on outside power. If they encountered any problem, they would strive to overcome it by themselves. Dongfang Rui had caused this problem himself, and it was also he who had to cower back now. No one would show him any sympathy.

Huo Furong wore an expression of impatience, and she said, “Hurry up!”

She took the lead, walking into the cave. With her extraordinary strength, she could make it out alive even if she were ambushed by a Second Heaven Celestial King Tier.

The others followed behind her. Ling Han and his companions naturally stuck together. Ling Han walked in the front, while the Rain Emperor stayed at the back.

However, there was also Shi Chanzi behind the Rain Emperor, and Ji Wuming was even further behind her. This provided them with another layer of defense.

By allowing Shi Chanzi to walk before him, Ji Wuming was also showing an intention to protect this grand-disciple from his previous life. This way, there would be Ling Han in front of her and he behind her. It was almost impossible to break through their defenses.

After taking a few steps, all that remained before them was an expanse of pitch-black. They could barely see three meters before them. Moreover, their divine sense was also limited to this small range. If they tried to detect anything beyond this, their divine sense would be completely engulfed. They wouldn’t be able to sense anything.

Fortunately, they could follow the path of the fragrance. Moreover, there was only a single path here, so they didn’t need to be afraid of getting lost.

However, after walking for a while, three separate paths appeared before them.

Boom!

An orb of green flames instantly burst to life in Huo Furong’s hand, illuminating an area that measured at least 30 meters in radius.

This was an origin flame of heaven and earth, and it was perhaps even at the level of Celestial King. Thus, it was naturally extraordinarily mighty.

The three caves all looked similar. In fact, what did it matter even if they were very different? They weren’t familiar with this place anyway.

Taking another sniff, they realized that the fragrance was traveling over from all three paths. Moreover, they were all similar in concentration. That being the case, how should they choose?

Everyone furrowed their brows. Their divine sense couldn’t extend too far in this place. Otherwise, they would have used it to scout the different paths.

“Let’s split up,” Dongfang Rui immediately said.

He had never wanted to travel with Ling Han anyway. Moreover, upon thinking of the possibility that this was the flawless Celestial Seed, he more so didn’t want to travel with the others. After all, the flawless Celestial Seed would definitely trigger an intense battle.

Truth be told, his battle prowess wouldn’t give him an advantage, either.

Thus, splitting up here was the best option that he could take.

Everyone exchanged a glance before nodding in agreement.

People were all selfish. If there were only a single flawless Celestial Seed, who wouldn’t want to obtain it for themself? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Then let’s part ways!” Xuan Rong said as he left the group. He chose the left-most path.

Meanwhile, Huo Furong chose the central path. After hesitating for a brief moment, Jia Lan also chose this path. Perhaps it was because they were both females, so she felt like it would be better to follow Huo Furong.

One after another, they all made their choice. However, they still traveled in their groups. For example, Shi Chanzi left with Ji Wuming, while Ling Han and his wives traveled with the Rain Emperor.

Each group chose one of the three paths. After walking for a moment, they came to a stop once again.

Another fork appeared before them. This time, however, it wasn’t a fork of three paths. Instead, it was a fork or five, seven, and eight paths.

Ling Han immediately frowned upon seeing this. “This is a maze?”

“Should we retreat?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.
