Chapter 1038: Reappearance of the Jade Box

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The giant crocodile swam around the area for a while, but in the end, it left with a wave of its strong tail, causing water to surge.

Ling Han came out of the Black Tower, planning to once again float to the sea’s surface, yet suddenly felt alarmed. Immediately, he once again entered into the Black Tower.

“Boom!”

The giant crocodile actually charged back silently without any warning, and released a fierce attack towards him.

So crafty and cunning!

Ling Han shook his head. He definitely could not underestimate it just because it was a crocodile. To be able to cultivate to the Sun Moon Tier, how many thousands of years had this crocodile been alive? A Demonic Beast at Shattering Void Tier would awaken its intelligence completely. From that point onwards, it had lived so many years, so its intelligence would definitely not be inferior to any wise man’s of the human race.

Underestimating it was absolutely courting death!

Hu , but that pounce from the giant crocodile caused the violent surging of the sea waters. The Black Tower would not be affected by the special gravity of this place, and so it went with the natural flow, moving with the water.

How powerful was the strength of a Sun Moon Tier cultivator? Furthemore, the pounce just now was planned out by the giant crocodile, so the power it unleashed was really very strong, pushing the Black Tower far away. In a few breaths’ time, it had floated over a dozen miles away.

Ling Han waited for a while, and when he felt that it was calm, came back out of the Black Tower.

He had not surfaced for long when a terrifying feeling was once again felt by him. He hurriedly ducked back into the Black Tower. Bang! True indeed, that gigantic crocodile had reappeared.

F*ck, why was this animal so determined not to let him escape?

Ling Han was speechless. Had this massive crocodile discovered that he had disappeared in a way that was too unnatural, and sensed that there was an incredible treasure in his possession?

“If you want to follow, then just follow. I will go and be intimate with my wife, and you just wait patiently!”

He simply went to seek out Shui Yanyu, tormenting this seductive beauty so much that she was flushed red. She repeatedly called him a pervert, yet was also delighting in the treatment, half-resisting and half-welcoming it. Her beautiful eyes were like spring water, releasing an air of charm and captivation, stirring Ling Han’s appetite greatly.

At this time, he did not have the time to care about the huge crocodile outside, and thus, he did not realize that the Black Tower had actually been drawn into a channel with the flow of the water.

This channel was unfathomably deep, and there was an endless darkness at the bottom.

The large crocodile had swum here once before, but it was so scared that it turned with a sweep of its tail immediately and fled in the opposite direction.

If Ling Han had also noticed this detail, perhaps he would have immediately come out of the Black Tower, and would not have allowed the Black Tower to fall in no matter what. But now, he was completely ignorant of the situation outside, just going with the flow of the water, which brought him into the endlessly deep abyss.

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were whispering sweet nothings to each other to pass the time, waiting for that giant crocodile to leave by itself out of impatience.

Xiu , he came out of the Black Tower.

“F*ck!”

He only felt as if all the bones inside his body had been shattered, immediately releasing cracking sounds.

Why was it like this?

Ling Han was confused. The water pressure here was extremely frightening, and this was something that he had been aware of. However, it was definitely not serious to this extent—even if he channeled his Origin Power, it was useless this time. In an instant, over a dozen of his bones had been broken, and they even turned into shattered pieces.

He could not hold on!

He immediately entered into the Black Tower, and then channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. His bones began to heal, and after about 30 minutes, he was completely recovered.

“Why has the pressure suddenly become so strong?” Ling Han observed the outside world from within the Black Tower, but it was completely dark there, and the surroundings were completely different from before.

Ahead of them, there was a somewhat weak light, flickering.

“Oh no, who knows where the waves created by that massive crocodile have drawn us to.”

Ling Han was lost for words. Previously, he merely went to be intimate with Shui Yanyu, and paid completely no attention to the change in surroundings. Now, he was actually brought into such a dangerous place.

‘With such terrifying water pressure, all the bones in my body would probably be shattered in only a single breath’s time. How am I going to float to the surface of the sea, then?

‘Then, wouldn’t that mean that I am eternally trapped in this place?

‘Hold on, something ahead is glowing. Perhaps it will bring around a turn in luck!’

Now that things were like this, Ling Han could only try everything and anything in this desperate situation. He immediately came out of the Black Tower, and caused waves with a palm strike. Then, he quickly ducked back inside to allow the Black Tower to float towards that glowing spot by itself.

It was naturally very slow. Furthermore, the water did not flow according to his will, and would frequently float in the wrong direction. Hence, the speed with which they were nearing that point of light was extremely slow.

However, no matter how slow he was, he was closing in on it. After about less than half a day, Ling Han could finally clearly see that point of light.

It was actually a box. It was made of jade, and it was exuding a milky white light by itself.

It was that box!

Ling Han recognized it with a single glance. It was precisely the treasured box that Ju Yueyun and Hou Yang had been fighting over. He had never thought that neither of them had gotten ahold of it, and this box had actually fallen into such a place.

‘Am I fortunate or unfortunate, then?’

Ling Han scratched at his head. If he was lucky, then how would he have fallen into such a crisis? It was practically desperate straits. Then, if he was unlucky... well, the treasure that two great elites of Heavenly Body Tier had been fighting over had actually fallen onto a place that was not far from him.

‘Who cares if I’m lucky or unlucky? I’ll first get ahold of the treasure; otherwise, I would definitely be unlucky.’

Ling Han tried the same trick again, and floated towards that box.

He was slowly approaching.

Finally, there was only an arm’s distance left.

Ling Han left the Black Tower in a flash, and grabbed the box with a stretch of his arm. He was just about to retreat back into the Black Tower. However, just in that instant, a black gas also spread out. It had previously been hidden underneath the jade box, and now, like an octopus that had stretched out its tentacles, it wrapped around Ling Han.

In that instant, a strong feeling of impending danger rose up in Ling Han’s heart. He felt that if he was entwined by this thing, it would definitely be worse than suffering a palm strike from an elite of the Sun Moon Tier.

He quickly tried to hide back into the Black Tower, but that black-colored aura actually followed him closely like a shadow, sticking tightly onto the jade box. Shua , it entered with it into the Black Tower. Furthermore, the black-colored gas was spreading out too quickly, and had already entwined Ling Han’s hand.

Incomparably confusing thought was rushing up against Ling Han, causing him to completely lose all reason as if he was about to go mad. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Duo!”

Small Tower appeared, and shouted at him.

The black gas dispersed like fog, instantly transforming into millions of silken threads. However, it was very stubborn, and a stream of black gas was still sticking onto Ling Han’s hand, and boring into his body.

More and more, the whole black fog was shrinking back, and gushing into Ling Han’s body.

Boom!

A scene of battle arose in Ling Han’s mind. Two great elites were battling among the stars. One attack was enough to even shatter the stars far away, causing the sun to eternally lose its brightness.

He was astonished; what level were these elites at?

The Genesis Tier?

One of the two fighting was an old man whose skin was completely gold in color. He was very fat, and was all smiles. He also had a big, round tummy, and his earlobes were extraordinarily big—they actually touched his shoulder. His head, meanwhile, was completely bald.

This caused Ling Han to recall one of the pirates he had encountered before. He was obviously a mad murderer, but when he practiced his cultivation technique, he actually had an air of dignity and stately grace.

The feeling this old man gave him was the same—an incredibly sacred air full of great mercy that transcended all life.
