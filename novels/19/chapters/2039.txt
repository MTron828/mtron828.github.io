Chapter 2040: What a coincidence

In the Western Celestial Realm, the Universal Peace Heaven was ranked above average in terms of overall strength. There were a considerable number of Celestial King Tier-level forces here, but the very most famous was naturally Hundred Dragons City.

This was an important branch of the Ancient Alchemy Tower. Every time the alchemy tournament took place, it would be hosted here, and the city bore an extremely important responsibility.

The Ground Piercing Shuttle tunneled out of the ground several dozen miles outside Hundred Dragons City. They couldn’t advance any further, or they would be treated like invaders, and be directly eliminated by the defensive formations of Hundred Dragons City.

Fu Yue stowed the Ground Piercing Shuttle away, while Ling Han released everyone from the Black Tower. The party then journeyed towards Hundred Dragons City. It was only several dozen miles away—just the matter of a few steps for them.

To enter the city, one had to pay a fee first.

Since Hundred Dragons City was a great city of cultivators, as well as a great city of alchemists, not only were there very many cultivators who came and went, there were also a great many merchants here. In the entire Western Celestial Realm, this could be considered one of the more bustling large cities.

Thus, the entrance fee into the city was very high, extremely high.

One person would have to pay 100 Star Stones, and their Spatial God Tools would also be searched. If it was discovered that there was anyone smuggling in, they would be executed!

It was very strict, but they did indeed have the confidence for it. There were at least 10 Five-Star Alchemists in the Ancient Alchemy Tower, and their influence was incredibly wide-ranging. Since these were rules that they had set in place, who would dare to disobey?

Ling Han and his group honestly paid up on the city entrance fees, and finally entered into this ancient city.

It was said that there were more than 100 Immortal Dragons buried here. Perhaps it was only a myth, but it was indeed true that there would occasionally be sightings of the images of great dragons soaring from the earth and surging towards the Nine Heavens in the city.

Perhaps it was also because there were such bizarre scenes that it led to the legend of 100 dragons being buried here.

“Let’s find an inn to settle first.”

Now that they were here, Fu Yue’s name of young master was not very useful anymore. In United Link City, everyone would yield to him because he was the third generation heir of the Fu Clan, but who would care about that here?

For young masters like him, there were loads of them here.

“Brother Ling, don’t meddle in the business of others here,” Fu Yue reminded Ling Han.

This guy was fond of meddling, but meddling would also have to depend on one’s own strength. There were a great many matters here that they really could not afford to meddle in.

Pa!

The back of Fu Yue’s head sustained another smack, and it was naturally Hu Niu’s work. “Why are you being so fierce to Niu’s Ling Han!”

Ling Han, meanwhile, laughed loudly. It was really hard to say if he would meddle or not. Sometimes, if he sighted it, he would move on a whim of his. There was no way he could hold back.

“I’ll try,” he said. “Little Yue Yue, you have to control yourself too. Don’t let your temper of a spoilt young master rise up again.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ptui, how could I possibly lose control?” Fu Yue scoffed.

They found an inn where they settled down. Because there was a glutton like Hu Niu in their party, the second matter on their agenda was naturally to gorge themselves.

This inn itself held a restaurant, but it was all private rooms, making it seem very high-end. But because the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles and the alchemy tournament were close at hand, it was also overcrowded with guests here, and they couldn’t even get a private room.

“Guests, the private rooms are really all full.” The waiter bowed repeatedly towards Ling Han and his group.

“Nonsense, isn’t this one empty?” Hu Niu asked, pointing at a private room. Very coincidentally, the doors of that private room were open, and they could clearly see that there was not a single person inside.

“That room is already reserved,” the waiter said hurriedly.

“Since they aren’t here yet, let us use it first. Worse come to worst, we’ll give it back to them when they’re here,” Fu Yue also said. By now, he was Hu Niu’s faithful lackey.

“Er…” The waiter paused, but after a while, he nodded, and said, “I won’t hide the truth. This private room has been reserved permanently by Young Master Du, but there are indeed not many times he has come… How about this? I will allow your party to use the private room, but if Young Master Du comes, you must definitely let him have the private room. Please don’t make things difficult for me.”

“Fine, fine.” Hu Niu nodded continuously. At present, the only thought on her mind was food.

The group entered into the private room, and dishes and beverages were served very soon. Upon tasting, the taste was really not too bad.

As expected of Hundred Dragons City. There was Immortal Beast flesh supplied here. As long as one could afford it, they even had Immortal Palace Tier beast meat.

For cultivators, not only was the meat of Immortal Palace Tier beasts delicious and nutritious, it could even allow them to increase their appreciation of Regulations—even after an Immortal Beast died, there would still be a sliver of power of Regulation contained within its flesh, so there would still be some benefits to be had.

Of course, when this Immortal Beast flesh was being cooked, an elite was definitely needed to dispel the murderous aura from it. Otherwise, if one with a lower cultivation level consumed it, their intestines and stomach would be destroyed instantly.

Fu Yue was very generous, and ordered a serving of Immortal Beast meat, and it was at the Immortal Palace Tier at that.

This had required close to 1,000,000 Star Stones from him, and when it was served, there were only a rare few pieces of meat on the plate.

“Is it delicious? Niu wants a taste.” Hu Niu was the first to move her chopsticks.

“Let me have a taste too.” Ling Han stretched out his chopsticks as well without reserve, serving both the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden a piece of meat first, and then he himself took a piece.

“En, not bad, let me have another piece.” Hu Niu stretched out her chopsticks again.

There was no one serving Bewitching Maiden Rou, so she could only move herself, and feed herself.

Xiao Gu copied his companions, and also stretched out his chopsticks quickly. Shi Lei and his sister were not slow, either. As long as one spent enough time around Hu Niu, they would know that only if they moved fast enough would they get anything to eat. Food definitely had to be snatched, or they could only stay hungry.

Chopsticks danced, and then Fu Yue shockingly discovered that the plate was now empty.

F***, that was it? He hadn’t even eaten a bit.

His 1,000,000 Star Stones… Even if he dumped it into the water, he could still hear a splash, and it could even cause a ripple.

“Guests, please quickly give way. Young Master Du is here.” Right at this moment, that waiter suddenly ran over, his face filled with anxiety.

Since they had already had a previous agreement, Ling Han and his group could not say anything, either. They all rose up, and as for the remaining food, there was no need to worry. There was a glutton here that would have it wrapped for takeaway, and there was absolutely not going to be the sligthest bit of wastage.

They exited the private room, and had not taken a few steps whe they saw seven people approach them. They were all extremely young, and were all men.

“Huh?!”

One of them spotted Ling Han and his group, and his expression immediately changed. Even his body was beginning to shudder.

“Yi, Little Ruan, what’s wrong with you? Have you been playing so hard yesterday that your knees are weak now?” someone beside him asked with a laugh.

“Haha, you really have made no mistake with your surname, you really have soft knees[1].”

Ling Han looked over, and suddenly felt like this was really a small world.

That person was…. Ruan Dongxiang.

“You, you, you…” Ruan Dongxiang raised his finger shakily, appearing to be incredibly furious, but at the same time inconceivably terrified.

This was natural. He had been killed once by Fu Hui, so naturally it would leave a very strong phobia in his heart.

“Little Ruan, what is it?” the person in the lead of the other party, a young man in green robes, asked in a deep voice. He was walking at the forefront, and the remaining six were following his lead.

“A few months ago, they killed my divided soul!” Ruan Dongxiang said harshly. “At the time, I was pursuing my fiance and her adulterer, yet was stopped by these people, and this person is the murderer who has killed my divided soul.”

He pointed at Fu Yue.

Hearing him say these words, the green-robed young man and the others all erupted, and felt that Ling Han and his group were really too vicious, not only sheltering an adulterous couple, and even killed the divided soul of the victim.

“Haha. I never thought that there would be such people in this world.” A young man dressed in purple robes walked out, sweeping an eye over Ling Han and his group before disdainfully saying, “All of you kill your own divided soul, and then you may leave. However!” He paused, pointing at Fu Yue. “He has to stay behind!”
