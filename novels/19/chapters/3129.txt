3130 Hypocrite

When Li Changdan stopped, he was instantly separated from Rui Yuanliang and Yang Fei.

Rui Yuanliang and Yang Fei were stunned. ‘F*ck, why was Li Changdan like this again?’

However, Ling Han just happened to be surrounded by the three of them at this moment, so he was walking himself right into a siege.

Good!

Rui Yuanliang and Yang Fei both turned around and charged towards Ling Han again.

Li Changdan was still hesitating whether he should make his move, but his expression suddenly changed, because he saw a bright red lizard that was rapidly approaching them, as its four short legs moved at an indescribable speed.

Pu!

The lizard stuck out its tongue, and like a spear, it directly sank into Yang Fei’s back. Then, it penetrated through his chest, creating a fountain of blood.

Yang Fei only struggled for a few moments, before his limbs drooped, and with a tilt of his head, died.

Rui Yuanliang was the closest, so he naturally witnessed this scene. He couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat.

Yang Fei was only weaker than him by the cultivation level of a single meridian, but in front of this giant lizard, he did not even have the ability to fight back, and was directly insta-killed. Then, just how dangerous was it for him to be so close to this giant lizard? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He was so terrified that he did not have any other thougthts. He rushed out with full speed, in hot pursuit of Ling Han.

—As long as he could run faster than Ling Han, Ling Han would become the first target of attack by this lizard. Then, there would be a chance for him to escape.

Li Changdan, on the other hand, breathed a sigh of relief. The moment this lizard attacked, he could confirm that the cultivation level of this ferocious creature should also be Nine Meridians. He was completely unafraid of that.

Though it was very strange that a Demonic Beast had appeared in the territory of the Ancient Dao Sect, and one that had reached the height of Nine Meridians at that, but now, he did not have the time to think too much about it. Immediately, he threw out a rock.

He wanted to stop Ling Han, and let the lizard take the role of the main force in killing Ling Han. Meanwhile, he only needed to deal the finishing blow.

Xiu, a rock shot over at subsonic speed, its power incredibly terrifying.

Ling Han didn’t dare to take this strike head-on. With a flash, Ling Han dodged this strike.

Rui Yuanliang was overjoyed. With Li Changdan stopping him, Ling Han would be forced to stop, giving him the chance to surpass Ling Han.

To ensure that Ling Han would be behind him, he even brandished out a saber, slashing towards Ling Han’s head.

Ling Han humphed, and with a wave of his right hand, the longsword in his hand shot towards Rui Yuanliang.

If this was Rui Yuanliang, there was definitely no way for him to give up the weapon in his hand at this moment.

This was the difference between a prodigy and a mediocre person.

Rui Yuanliang was helpless. The distance was too close, and he couldn’t possibly dodge it. He could only slant the saber in his hand to block this strike.

Ding!

A crisp sound rang out, and this strike was indeed blocked by him. However, he had also lost the chance to stop Ling Han’s advance.

Shua, right at this moment, that blood-coloured lizard launched another attack. It stuck out its tongue like a long spear, aiming straight for… Rui Yuanliang!

Rui Yuanliang was shocked, and hurriedly brandished his saber to fight fiercely with the blood-coloured lizard.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The tongue of the blood-coloured lizard was incomparably hard. It could actually stand firm against sharp blades and not be damaged. Furthermore, this tongue was extremely agile. After a clash with the large saber, it could immediately become incomparably soft, and like a whip, continued to whip out at Rui Yuanliang.

In just a few moves, Rui Yuanliang was already flustered. He had never encountered such an opponent before. Its attack method was strange, and it also had the advantage in power. He estimated that he would only be able to last ten moves at most. He would definitely be like Yang Fei, having his heart pierced through by that tongue like a spear.

“Li Changdan, save me! Hurry up and save me!” he roared. He naturally didn’t want to die.

Li Changdan hesitated for a moment, but did not make a move.

If he went to save Rui Yuanliang, he would have to fight with the blood-coloured lizard, and Ling Han would be able to take the chance to escape.

Humph, how could this be allowed?

It was fine even if Rui Yuanliang died. A person that the Qi Clan had given up on, aside from the fact that his cultivation level of Eight Meridians was slightly useful, what other use did he have?

And as long as Rui Yuanliang died, the target of the blood-coloured lizard’s attack would be Ling Han. Under the super strong attack of a Nine Meridians, Ling Han would either die, or use that Talisman Weapon. Then, if he attacked again, Ling Han would only die.

‘Rui Yuanliang, just make some sacrifices.’

Xiu! Ling Han threw out another rock. He was only stopping Ling Han’s speed of advance.

F***.

Ling Han cursed in his heart, but faced with this attack, he had no choice but to dodge—

“Li Changdan, even if I become a ghost, I won’t let you off!” Rui Yuanliang roared in fury. He really couldn’t take it anymore. Under the suppression of the power of one meridian, and with the attack of the blood-colored lizard being so tricky and strange, he couldn’t withstand it any longer.

Pu!

Ling Han noticed that there were many spikes growing on the tongue of this lizard. Not only was this attack fatal, but it had also sucked dry all the blood in Rui Yuanliang’s heart. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so little blood spurting out.

Before he could have a second thought, the blood-coloured lizard once again attacked, and this time, the target was naturally him.

Ling Han blocked. He used the Demonic Monkey Fists, and instantly, a primitive, overbearing aura circulated, possessing astonishing might.

It was this fist technique again!

Li Changdan saw this clearly. In the Ancient Formation, he had been defeated by this fist technique. Otherwise, how could he have lost to Ling Han when he had an advantage in power?

He focused his attention on watching, and couldn’t help but feel moved.

Ling Han’s power was clearly much inferior, yet he still managed to withstand a great many attacks with this fist technique. This was truly inconceivable.

He was filled with greed. The might of this fist technique far surpassed the Four Directional Fists, and the more brilliant the fist technique was, the faster the speed of cultivating the fist technique would naturally be. He was sure that Ling Han must have relied on this fist technique to be able to advance his cultivation level so quickly.

Perhaps… Ling Han had a fist manual hidden on him?

He began to focus his attention on the blood-colored lizard. Ling Han was destined to die, so it was inevitable that he would have to battle with this Demonic Beast. At the very least, he had to snatch Ling Han’s corpse from it.

Hence, he wanted to understand the method of attack of this blood-coloured lizard.

Ling Han frowned upon seeing this. Although he was trying his best to hold on, the power gap between them was far too large. Moreover, this Demonic Beast’s tongue was like a precious tool, being soft at times and hard at others, which was extremely difficult to deal with.

If this continued, he would only be able to last 50 moves at most.

He could only… use his trump card.

Ling Han sighed. He had not thought that he would have to use the Talisman Weapon so quickly.

But there was nothing that could be done. If he did not use it, could it be that he would leave it as a burial item for himself?

With a wave of his hand, a yellow talisman paper was shot out. Shua, golden light flickered, and an endless brilliance spread out.
