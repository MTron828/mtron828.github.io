Chapter 3567: Seven Shattering Sect

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

The bewitching man’s eyes turned cold, and he said, “How dare you come to the

Seven Shattering Sect and behave atrociously?”

“How dare you! This is the territory of the Dark North Nation, and all lands under the heavens belong to the Imperial Family. You people occupy land and declare yourselves the ruler, and you still want to stay shamelessly?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Humph, now that the world is divided under five powers, Primordial True Lord, Nine Spirits True Lord , Blue Fire True Lord, Silver Sword True Lord and Chen Fengyan each take a corner. In terms of geographical location, we are more inclined towards Primordial True Lord, and Master has also made contact with the Primordial True Lord. In a few days, we will submit to the Primordial

Sect!”

“If you have any objections, go to the Primordial Sect!”

Ling Han shook his head, “Hehe, you have made your choice, so you should bear the consequences for your own choice! I will still say the same thing. Have Pang Haifeng come out, and you, a mere pawn, should not waste my time.” “What a sharp-tongued person!” The bewitching man humphed coldly. With a bounce of his toes, he charged towards Ling Han, “Do you think that the title of the Department Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department can scare me?

He raised a palm and delivered a slap at Ling Han. The aura of Mystery Realm

Tier was on full display.

When the bewitching man approached, only then did Ling Han move. A murderous aura burst out, and the bewitching man instantly faltered. How was he supposed to block Ling Han’s next punch?

Peng! He was instantly sent flying.

When the guards at the entrance saw this, they were all shocked.

This bewitching man was Pang Haifeng’s eldest disciple, and also a trusted aide that he had brought out of the prison. His strength was clear for all to see, yet he could not even withstand a single blow from Ling Han.

As expected, only a fierce dragon dares cross the river©.

The bewitching man got back to his feet, blood seeping from the corner of his lips.

“This punch is only a lesson for you. If you still don’t know what’s good for you, I’ll kill you,” Ling Han said calmly. His voice wasn’t loud, but it was filled with pressure.

The bewitching man was filled with dissatisfaction, but in front of absolute strength, he did not dare to say a word.

“Hehe, Young Friend Ling, why do you have to be so overbearing?” There was a long laugh, and a figure flew out, like a deity.

This was a tall, broad-shouldered man. He was extremely sturdy, and his whole face was covered with a full beard.

Sensing his powerful aura, Ling Han immediately asked, “Pang Haifeng?”

The sturdy man humphed, “A mere Inscription Tier factually dares to directly address me by name?”

It was a great taboo in martial arts for weaklings to directly address elites by their names.

He stared at Ling Han, his aura surging, pressing down on Ling Han.

“Do I need to respect you for disobeying the Holy Emperor’s decree?” Princess Bixiao asked. She also unleashed her aura to protect Ling Han.

Boom! The auras clashed, and it was clear that Pang Haifeng had the upper hand. However, if Princess Bixiao was merely defending, there would be no problem at all.

Pang Haifeng cast a second look at Princess Bixiao, and revealed an expression of greed. In the first place, there were very few women in the prison.

Occasionally, when a beauty appeared, she would be taken in by an elite, either becoming a disciple or a private pet, but it definitely had nothing to do with him.

After escaping from prison, the first thing he did was wantonly take concubines. In a single stroke, he had married more than thirty beauties. Every day, he would switch from one to another, and there would not be enough for even a month.

However, how could ordinary women compare to Princess Bixiao, what more when this was a Celestial Path elite.

She was only a newly advanced Foundation Building cultivator; was she delivering herself up to be played with?

Pang Haifeng chuckled coldly, and said, “Chen Fengyan is nothing more than a Spirit Transformation True Lord, and he actually dared to refer to himself as the Holy Emperor. He truly doesn’t know how the word death is written!

The Holy Emperor, the Great Emperor, and the Ancestral King were all unique titles. Only the strongest beings were worthy of being crowned with these titles.

“Pang Haifeng, cut the crap. Either hand over the surrender form, or be eliminated. Make your choice,” Ling Han said domineeringly.

Pang Haifeng almost went mad with fury. These two brats actually dared to threaten him?

“What an ignorant brat!” He reached out to grab Ling Han and Princess Bixiao, mainly targeting Princess Bixiao. A mere Inscription Tier cultivator, even if he possessed Mystery Realm Tier-level battle prowess was still trash in his eyes.

Princess Bixiao instantly armed herself, wearing her Battle Armor and wielding her battle hammer, and charged towards Pang Haifeng.

Peng!

With this strike, Pang Haifeng was forced backwards.

“What?!” Pang Haifeng’s eyes widened in disbelief.

He was an elite of the second tier of the Foundation Building Tier, and had formed the foundation of Heavenly Dao. His battle prowess should have completely overwhelmed Princess Bixiao, so how could he have been sent backwards by her?

“Battle Armor?” He wasn’t an idiot, and he immediately guessed the reason. Greed instantly appeared on his face.

Spirit Tools were precious, but a complete suit of Battle Armor was even more precious. Furthermore, it was not just one or two times, but rather a dozen over times, or even dozens of times more valuable.

“Haha, thank you!” He moved again, filled with confidence. Even if Princess Bixiao was wearing a Battle Armor, there was still a gap of a cultivation level between them, so he still believed that he would definitely win.

“Young lady, cultivating the foundation of Heavenly Dao is not only an improvement in power, but more importantly, a suppression in level!” Pang Haifeng said with a smile. A golden rock floated out of his body, covered with mysterious veined patterns.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This was the foundation stone of his Heavenly Dao. The moment it channelled out, it exuded a terrifying aura, as if heaven and earth was pressing down on them.

Ordinarily, an elite that had built foundations of Heavenly Dao would completely crush a cultivator that had built foundation of human Dao. This was a crushing advantage in terms of level, and the gap was endless.

However, Princess Bixiao’s aura wasn’t weakened in the slightest. She remained standing proudly, and as she brandished her battle hammer, terrifying arcs of lightning flashed. It was as if she had transformed into a god of thunder.

Pang Haifeng showed an expression of disbelief. How could this be? The Battle Armor could only increase attack and defense, but definitely couldn’t increase the level of being.

“I used a Divine Stone to build my foundations, so how could your foundation stone of Heavenly Dao be able to suppress me!” Princess Bixiao declared proudly.

“Divine Stone!” Pang Haifeng said through gritted teeth, filled with envy and jealousy. He had been born in the prison, and it was already not easy for him to be alive, what more when he had advanced into the Celestial Path, and established the foundation stone of the Heavenly Dao.

However, due to the restrictions, how could he possibly obtain a Foundation Building Divine Stone?

Otherwise, with the Foundation Building Divine Stone and the foundation of Heavenly Dao, he wouldn’t even be afraid of ultimate elites.

Princess Bixiao did not speak further. Brandishing her battle hammer, she charged over.

Pang Haifeng rose up to counterattack. He was a Heavenly Dao Foundation elite, and if he couldn’t even suppress a Human Dao Foundation junior, how would he be able to face others in future?

After advancing into Celestial Path, the gap between each cultivation level was as wide as the sky. Even for three-star geniuses and four-star geniuses, if they did not depend on external factors, it would be extremely difficult for them to battle with a disadvantage of a cultivation level.

He was at the peak stage of the Heavenly Dao Foundation, while Princess Bixiao had only just entered into Human Dao Foundation, so he should have been able to suppress her single-handedly.

However, Princess Bixiao used the Battle Armor and the Spirit Tool to compensate for her shortcomings in power, and even far surpassed him in defense. With the Divine Stone as the core of her Dao foundation, she was unafraid of being suppressed by the Heavenly Dao Foundation Stone.

In the clash between the two of them, not only was Princess Bixiao not at a disadvantage, she even had an advantage.

The two Celestial Path elites battled fiercely, and even Ling Han could not see clearly. After activating his ocular technique, he could just barely see two figures flashing around. At every turn, they would use their Spiritual Power to grab giant rocks and throw them at each other.
