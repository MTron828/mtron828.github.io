Chapter 3579* You are a wolf in sheep’s clothing?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

One-star geniuses were quite rare no matter where they were. They would be fought over by various forces to take them under their banner.

Now that two one-star geniuses had appeared all of a sudden, it was naturally a fierce battle.

Originally, one-star geniuses would only meet each other in the round of the top 32, or even the round of top 16 or top 8. However, because of the rules of the tournament, the two young prodigies clashed so early.

When two tigers clashed, one would definitely be injured.

Ling Han was in high spirits as he sat on the sidelines and watched. Since he had nothing else to do, he might as well pass some time.

Seeing Ling Han’s expression, Xiao Zhixuan was completely speechless.

Where did you get such high spirits from?

That was Liu Huayun. Once Niu Er couldn’t hold on any longer, would the two of them be spared?

She wanted nothing more than to rush up and slap Ling Han a few times, so that he would recognize the reality of the situation.

The battle between Niu Jianhua and Liu Huayun was incredibly intense. The two of them exchanged blows, both showing their full abilities, but even if they were both one-star geniuses, there was naturally a difference of superiority and inferiority, though the gap between them was very, very small.

…Liu Huayun was stronger.

Niu Jianhua was extremely depressed. If he had not been knocked out, and if he had not been robbed completely, then he only had to wear a Battle Armor now and he would be invincible. It would be he that would be abusing Liu Huayun. ’ Ah, ah, ah, that damn little thief, don’t let him catch him! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Liu Huayun smirked coldly. In truth, his talent was not higher than Niu Jianhua’s, but he had stayed longer in the Mystery Realm Tier, smoothing out his cultivation level even more perfectly. Thus, after a long battle, this advantage was naturally slowly revealed, and it was getting bigger and bigger. He was definitely going to win this battle.

“The two of you, leave quickly!” Niu Jianhua shouted loudly, yet immediately turned around and fled.

Yi, you told us to run, but did not buy us any time?

Xiao Zhixuan was dumbfounded. She knew that a second-generation young master like Niu Jianhua was unreliable, but she had not expected that he would be unreliable to this extent.

This was too shameless, wasn’t it?

But Niu Jianhua ran very quickly, and in an instant, there was no sign of him.

Liu Huayun only chased for a few steps before stopping. He had to admit that Niu Jianhua had grasped a profound movement technique, and his speed was superior to his. Even if he gave chase, it would be pointless.

It was fine. There was still a very long time ahead, and he would be able to meet the other again.

He would deal with the other two first.

He turned around, and looked balefully at Ling Han and Xiao Zhixuan.

“You, break an arm, then get lost,” he said to Xiao Zhixuan, then looked towards Ling Han, “As for you… pull out your tongue, then break both of your arms.”

Ling Han gave a ‘ya’, and said, “I can break one arm, but the difficulty of breaking both arms is too high. Why don’t you give me a demonstration?” Liu Huayun couldn’t help but feel angry, TH give you a demonstration?’ Hiss, this guy was really very bold. He no longer had a backer, and still dared to be unreasonable with him?

“Looks like I’ll have to dig out your eyes and cripple both your legs to teach you a lesson,” Liu Huayun said indifferently. However, his fury was already gushing out, and his gaze was extremely terrifying.

Ling Han spread out his hands, and said to Xiao Zhixuan, “Why do people keep threatening me? Sigh, what I hate the most is being threatened by others. Towards this kind of person, I usually beat the wits out of them.”

Xiao Zhixuan was completely speechless. All she could do now was completely separate herself from Ling Han.

She stood further away to show her innocence.

You really don’t know how the word ‘death’ is written!” Ling Han strode towards Ling Han. Boom, the blood and Qi in his body surged, as if he was a ferocious beast in human form that was about to start a massacre.

Ling Han crossed his arms over his chest, appearing extremely relaxed.

Liu Huayun moved. Boom! Cold air swept out, as if they had suddenly arrived in an extremely cold place. Even if a cup of hot water was poured out of thin air, it would instantly freeze into ice.

He was filled with confidence. 99% of his opponents couldn’t even rival the coldness he released, and would directly shiver from the cold, completely losing their battle prowess. He was sure that Ling Han would be no exception. However, he soon discovered, much to his surprise, that Ling Han was standing there completely unscathed, and did not look like he had been affected at all.

This…!

He showed a sliver of seriousness, and said, “So you are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Your abilities are not too weak.”

Ling Han cracked a smile, “Thank you for the compliment.”

Xiao Zhixuan was also stunned. This guy was actually capable of resisting Liu Huayun’s attack of cold air? Hiss, though this did not mean that Ling Han would be able to match Liu Huayun, there was still a sliver of hope.

Why did such an elite keep such a low profile, and did not raise any objections even when Niu Jianhua was protecting him like a lackey?

Hold on, this guy couldn’t be playing around with Niu Jianhua, right?

It was very possible!

“So what? I am still invincible among my peers!” Liu Huayun roared loudly, and charged towards Ling Han.

Being able to resist the coldness was one matter, but being able to resist his attack was another matter.

Ling Han clenched his right hand into a fist, and greeted Liu Huayun’s attack. Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, violent energy surging madly, endless sand and rocks surging.

Xiao Zhixuan saw very clearly that Ling Han was not at a disadvantage at all in this exchange. He was standing steadily, and even his expression did not change. He was still so calm, a faint smile curling up the corners of his lips. This guy had indeed been pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger all this while!

Liu Huayun, meanwhile, revealed a serious expression. Though they had only exchanged a single blow, it was enough for him to see how extraordinary Ling Han was. Otherwise, how could an ordinary Mystery Realm Tier block his cold attack, what more a full-power punch?

This opponent could not be underestimated. In fact, he was even harder to deal with than Niu Jianhua.

A cold chill rose up in his heart. In the previous battle with Niu Jianhua, he had expended a great amount of mystical power. If Ling Han’s strength was not inferior to Niu Jianhua, then in a situation when he had no support, it was very possible that he would be outmatched.

This person was really sinister. He actually did not care about the life or death of his companions, and merely used them to exhaust his own power, so that he could win the good reputation of defeating him alone?

Damn it!

Whether it was in the eyes of Ling Han or Xiao Zhixuan, Ling Han’s image was incredibly black-hearted.

Ling Han released a battle cry, and began his counterattack.

Previously, with an idiot like Niu Jianhua who liked to charge ahead, Ling Han would not mind relaxing a bit, but now that he was being bullied, he naturally would not keep a low profile any longer.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?!” Liu Huayun also roared in fury, raising his fist and throwing a punch.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them did not dodge at all, and simply clashed head-on. There was no need for technique. It was completely the most direct clash of power.

Thus, it was also very easy to determine the victor.

After a heavy blow, Liu Huayun felt as if his insides had been knocked over. The pain was indescribable, and his bones were also cracking loudly. He was sure that a crack must have appeared on the surface.

If this continued, it was possible that his internal organs would be shattered by the powerful shock, and his bones would definitely be broken.

However, even if he couldn’t hold on, the other party should be about the same as well.

You are ruthless?

I am even more ruthless than you!

Liu Huayun was filled with fighting spirit, and attacked Ling Han madly.. Competing in viciousness? As someone who had just come out of prison, who would he be afraid of?
