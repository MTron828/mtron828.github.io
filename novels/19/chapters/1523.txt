Chapter 1524 New Nine Deaths Heaven Ar

The Star Sand Saint threw the ring back to Ling Han. With his command, everyone left the world within the chest.

“Send someone to stand guard here. The three Phoenix King corpses seem to be undergoing some kind of change. The moment there is any activity, immediately send someone to inform me,” the Star Sand Saint commanded.

“Yes!” the nine Saints all affirmed their adherence to his command loudly.

The 10 Saints stretched out their golden paths, and had already returned to Wood Figure Planet. Naturally, there was someone staying behind to stand guard here, taking note and observing any change to the three Phoenix King corpses.

Even the Saints had left, so there was naturally no reason for the others to stay behind any longer. They all made their way back.

Though everyone had not managed to gain anything, it was not a wasted trip.

They had seen the remains of Saint Kings; wasn’t that a valuable experience in itself?

Meanwhile, Ling Han did not leave. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was a massive weakness by now. When she had completely accepted her inheritance, he would move at the first instant and knock unconscious everyone here. Then, he would take her from here before the Saints arrived.

He made a long detour, then directly entered into the Black Tower, and waited patiently.

And in the outside world, or to be more exact, in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, a huge matter happened.

Gu Daoyi had disappeared!

The Star Sand Saint flew into a thunderous rage. He even sent out the nine Saints to search for the whereabouts of Gu Daoyi. He had mysteriously vanished when he journeyed out of Wood Figure Planet; this was something that the Great Saint could not accept.

If he was still alive, he had to be found. If he was dead, then he wanted to see his dead body for himself.

Yet when the news of this spread out, it was incredibly encouraging news to the other students.

If Gu Daoyi had died, didn’t that mean that he was not the fated person, and the others still had hope of becoming a Saint?

Indeed, just like Ling Han said, effort might not necessarily lead to success, but no effort meant absolute failure.

They had stayed behind in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy; if they managed to gain the favor of the Star Sand Saint, that would mean that they could replace Gu Daoyi and become a new candidate for a Saint.

These people naturally wanted nothing more than for Gu Daoyi to have died. Only those like Long Xiangyue and the Second in the World had firm belief in themselves. They believed that they were inferior to none.

Aside from the three Phoenix King corpses that were still there, everything seemed to have returned to normal.

Gu Daoyi had not been found in the end, but the Star Sand Saint did not take any new disciple, either. Then, a more explosive piece of news spread out. The Star Sand Saint had the intention to nurture his own son to inherit the position of Saint from him.

At first, this was practically an impossible thing.

Though Saints had exceptional ways, they would be able to pull others into the Eternal River Tier at most. They had no way to increase the cultivation level of others further than that. The barrier into Saint level had to be breached with one’s own effort.

But when the Star Sand Saint had taken that paw of the Saint King, he gained that slight sliver of a chance.

He had extracted a drop of blood essence from a Saint King from within it, dispelled the murderous aura inside, used it to reforge his son’s body, and increased his martial arts natural talent from the very source.

The blood essence of a Saint King was too precious and too powerful.

Since he could nurture his own son, what was the point of letting his own fertile water flow into the fields of others?

In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.

Inside the Black Tower, the Empress ended her isolation, and smilingly stood in front of Ling Han.

“Finished?” Ling Han asked in pleasant surprise.

The Empress in front of him did not seem to have advanced much in her cultivation level, but the feeling she gave off was different. She seemed to have an additional otherworldly air of divinity. She was even more charming than before, and had also become stronger many times over.

The Empress smiled beautifully, and replied, “I have already cultivated the Divine Fetus, and obtained the Mystical Power of Ten Lives. I have also improved further.”

Her figure swayed slightly, and a person walked out from within her body. This new person looked exactly like her, but her bearing was slightly different. However, she was still very strong. Consecutively, it was a second person, a third... and there were nine in all. Added with herself, there were 10 of them in total.

Ling Han was a little dumbfounded. He had 10 Empress wives? One was enough to completely captivate him out of his wits, how was he supposed to handle 10 of them?

“Gu Daoyi could only summon his bodies of nine lives, and I previously could also only form nine doppelgangers, and their abilities would still be weakened.” Empress Luan Xing was slightly excited. “But now, every one of my doppelgangers is as strong as I am. Furthermore, no matter how far my doppelgangers are from me, they are connected with my will, and communication between us will not be affected by time and space.

“If a doppelganger dies, I will still be able to reform it!

“What is more amazing is that the 10 of us can cultivate at the same time, and the abilities of the doppelgangers will flow into the main body, and their battle prowess will only be affected by the main body.”

Ling Han experienced a huge shock; this was truly extremely impressive!

As expected of the technique of a Celestial King. Previously, whether it was the Empress or Gu Daoyi, they had only cultivated a superficial part, and now the Empress had truly grasped some profound secrets of a Celestial King technique.

This definitely was not the true Nine Deaths Heaven Art, either.

Still, it was already very powerful. Unless the Empress herself pointed it out, Ling Han had completely no way to distinguish which was her main body, and as long as the main body was not dead, the doppelgangers could grow and multiply without end. In battle, this was really too powerful.

Furthermore, the 10 of them could cultivate at the same time, and all their gains would be supplied to the main body, which was equivalent to being 10 times faster than others. More importantly, when others ingested alchemical pills, they would slowly become immune or even accumulate alchemic poison, but the Empress could use her 10 bodies to ingest them in turns. After a whole round, the alchemic poison and immunity would have more or less disappeared.

How could a Celestial King technique not be awesome?

Ling Han leaped up and embraced the Empress. Whirling her around a few times, he asked, “Then you wouldn’t need too much time to enter into Saint level, right?”

The Empress smiled confidently. “Within 100 years!”

Ling Han chuckled. That was only a hundred years. ‘I... I will bear it!’

Because the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was still undergoing her inheritance, they continued to stay inside the Black Tower. Everyone had previously drank a soup of Saintly medicine, and by now, the medicinal effects had been more or less digested. Thus, Ling Han drew out a second Saintly medicine, and began to cook again.

This time, the Empress had devoured a large portion of the Saintly medicine because she had 10 bodies to help her with the digestion, which was not the slightest bit inferior to Ling Han.

A number of days later, Ling Han just barely reached the late stage of the low extreme, and the Empress had advanced into the peak stage of the low extreme. She was merely one step away from breaking through. Her current cultivation rate was really too fast. With 10 of her cultivating at the same time and ingesting alchemical pills together, added with the fact that she was a Divine Fetus as well, even Ling Han could only watch her with shock from behind, completely dumbfounded.

Ling Han was naturally not going to feel envious. He wanted nothing more than for the Empress to advance her cultivation rate even faster.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was still the same, so Ling Han returned to Wood Figure Planet to seek out Lin Yuqi. Of course, the Empress also left behind one of her doppelgangers to stand guard. If anything unusual happened, she could find out at the first instant, and rush back with Ling Han.

Though a Saint’s speed was faster, the person that had to inform the Saint had to make a trip to Wood Figure Planet first. Ling Han only had to be faster than this person who was bringing the information back. Obviously, this was not a hard thing to do. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The Treasure Forest Pavilion had opened a branch here, but this was not the Long Light Galaxy. The Treasure Forest Pavilion did not have the slightest advantage in this place. Their doors were desolate, and looked as if they were about to close down very soon.

Ling Han entered, and exclaimed, “Where is your shopkeeper? There’s big business to be done!”

He slightly released the aura of an Eternal River Tier, and those shop assistants immediately became incomparably respectful. They hurriedly requested him to wait for a while as they raced to the backyard to inform the shopkeeper.

Soon after, with a tinkle and an air of fragrance, a beautiful woman approached him with graceful steps and a seductive swing of her hips. She exuded a bewitching air from her very bones, and the eyes of the younger shop assistants blazed with fire at the sight of her.
