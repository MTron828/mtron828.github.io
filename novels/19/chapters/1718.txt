Chapter 1719: Spectacular Show

Ling Han followed Ding Xiaochen to the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan.

The Ding Clan was huge, and this was obvious from their possession of a magnificent mountain that soared into the clouds. How was this a clan? Their land was even larger than an entire city of the Ancient Realm!

Thus, even though they were both Saint Kings, it still took them almost an entire hour to reach the ancestral shrine.

This was a golden shrine that was radiating with a majestic and dignified aura. It was both noble and solemn. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Ling Han suddenly shook his head, and said, “What a pity, what an absolute pity.”

‘Pity what?’ Ding Xiaochen asked in his mind.

However, he didn’t voice his question to Ling Han. After all, conversing with Ling Han would never end well for him. He certainly didn’t want to seek humiliation again. Moreover, once Ling Han became a member of the Ding Clan, he would become meat on a chopping board.

In actual fact, Ling Han was naturally expressing pity for this building that was about to transform into rubble soon.

Many mighty figures had already arrived, and were sitting in the stands. Several third severance grand elders had come today, and the only two from the Ding Clan had also come. As for Ding Yaolong, he hadn’t come to attend this ceremony. It wasn’t important enough to catch his attention.

Ding Xiaochen breathed a sigh of relief after bringing Ling Han to the ancestral shrine. He swore that he would definitely exact revenge tomorrow. He would show Ling Han his might.

He shot a glare at Ling Han before turning around to leave.

“Ling Han!” a low voice suddenly called. This was none other than Ding Hu. He started at Ling Han, and said, “It’s almost time. Come and worship the ancestors of the Ding Clan, and we’ll officially accept you into the Ding Clan.”

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Are you certain that the Ding Clan is willing to accept me?”

Wasn’t this nonsense? They had already opened their ancestral shrine, so how could they be playing around?

“Of course!” Ding Hu replied with a nod. Members of the two other large clans were also present, so he naturally had to consider the Ding Clan’s face. Otherwise, how could he be bothered speaking nonsense with a Genesis Tier cultivator?

“You won’t regret it?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

He was buying time. Meanwhile, he also started to grumble in his mind. ‘Why isn’t the large black dog here yet? He isn’t trying to genuinely screw me over, is he?’

Ding Hu grimaced upon hearing this. Such annoying questions! He humphed, and replied, “We naturally won’t regret it! You—”

However, Ling Han cut Ding Hu off, saying, “Will the Ding Clan take responsibility no matter what troubles I cause?”

Ding Hu was already feeling a strong urge to kill someone. He felt immense regret for accepting this task. This was a young man who was always capable of driving people insane. However, he calmed himself down, and said, “If you’re a member of the Ding Clan, we’ll naturally be your shield regardless of what happens.”

“Really? For real?” Ling Han asked.

Ding Hu’s hands started to tremble. He wanted to kill someone, and no one could stop him!

However, shouts of commotion suddenly traveled over from the distance. Moreover, it seemed like the commotion was fairly large.

What was happening? One had to realize that this was the Ding Clan!

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face. The large black dog had finally arrived.

“Oh, you old bastard, did you not have breakfast today? Or did you waste too much energy on debauchery with women? Your legs are like jelly, and you still haven’t caught up to Grandpa Dog after half a day!” The large black dog’s voice slowly traveled over. “Do you want Grandpa Dog to take a handicap of one leg?”

Xiu!

A black figure streaked through the air. This was a large black dog, yet he was wearing a pair of iron underwear that sparkled in the sunlight. One of his legs was raised, and sure enough, he was only running on three legs.

Everyone faltered upon seeing this. What was going on? Why had a large black dog suddenly run over? This was the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan! Just how holy and dignified was this place? Even damaging a single tile would enrage their ancestors into leaping out from their graves!

“Impudence!” Ding Hu roared as he immediately lashed out and grabbed at the large black dog.

This large black dog was only at the Genesis Tier, so heaven knew how he had managed to sneak into this place.

However, Ding Hu suddenly understood how after grabbing at the large black dog. This was because the large black dog was extremely slippery. As he reached over, the large black dog actually shattered the void and started to dash around. Before long, he had already escaped from the range of his attack.

Everyone was deeply astonished by this. How was this possible?

Even a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder had failed to capture the large black dog?

Not only was Ding Hu astounded, but Mao Dai and the other elites from the Duan Clan and the Long Clan also exclaimed in surprise. At the same time, Mao Dai immediately looked toward Ling Han. Just then, his conversation with Ling Han had been extremely strange. Perhaps this large black dog had something to do with it?

Boom!

A terrifying aura surged over, causing everyone under the Severing Mundane Tier to go pale. Some vomited blood, while others collapsed in their seats. The guests from the other clans were naturally all elites, so those who were wounded at this moment were all members of the Ding Clan.

Ding Hu was infuriated. First it was that large black dog, but who was it now?

What place did they think this was? Was this a place where they could act wantonly?

“Humph! Who dares to act wantonly in my Ding Clan!” he roared as he hovered into the air. He moved forward to intercept the uninvited guest.

Pa!

However, a figure suddenly dashed over and furiously slapped Ding Hu across the face. Ding Hu was instantly sent flying, and he eventually crashed into a distant wall, blasting a gaping hole in it. He then disappeared in this hole.

This...!

Ding Hu was a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder! Although he was only at the first severance, those who advanced to this cultivation level were all supreme prodigies!

Everyone looked toward the uninvited guest. Upon closer inspection, they discovered that this was an elderly man. There was a youth in his hands, and the aura that he exuded had already transformed into a tangible wave. It was as tumultuous as the vast sea.

“Fourth severance!” Mao Dai and the other third severance grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan exclaimed in unison. This elderly man was clearly more powerful than them.

There were only three fourth severance grand elders in Dark Moon City, and they were none other than the current clan leaders of the three great clans. However, this old man clearly wasn’t one of them, so where had he come from?

Meanwhile, Ling Han was well aware of who this old man was. He was a member of the Han Clan, and he had come here with Han Qi this time. Otherwise, it would be far too dangerous for a Genesis Tier cultivator to venture around the Celestial Realm by themself.

“Elder Han, why are you so angry?” Ding Shan and Ding Song asked as they walked over to greet him. They naturally recognized him as he had come to visit them just a few days ago. At that time, they had spoken many good words to appease him.

This old man was called Han Lu, and he couldn’t be regarded as a top-notch elite of the Han Clan. Here, however, he was definitely powerful enough to act as a domineering elder.

Pu!

Someone suddenly spluttered with laughter. As it turned out, there was a large hole in Han Lu’s clothing on his rear, revealing a patch of his pale white buttocks. By the looks of it, this hole was the result of a bite. Combining this with the large black dog’s sudden arrival, it was easy to imagine what had happened.

Han Lu had been bitten by a dog, and it was because of this that he had charged over.

As a mighty fourth severance grand elder, he had actually been bitten by a dog! How could he not be enraged?

Han Lu completely ignored Ding Shan and Ding Song as he continued to look for the large black dog. However, as if he had evaporated from the world, Han Lu couldn’t find a single trace of the large black dog.

There was a loud roar as Ding Hu burst out from the hole in the wall. He was so furious that he wanted to kill someone! He had actually been attacked in the ancestral shrine of his own clan! Was there still any justice and reason in the world?

However, upon charging out, he finally discovered that it was actually Han Lu who had slapped him across the face!

His anger instantly vanished, and his expression became as awkward as could be. He had wanted to vent his fury, yet he discovered that his target wasn’t someone he could provoke. What kind of feeling was this?

“Oi, old geezer, you actually dared to attack someone in my Ding Clan? Are you tired of living?” a voice suddenly said.

This was none other than Ling Han.
