2899 Mission

Xin Qihu just stood there. He had at least four first-grade seals, but no one dared to snatch them.

He was a super elite with battle prowess at the peak of the Fifth Tier. It could be said that no one could suppress him unless he was a Sixth Tier himself. Moreover, Xin Qihu’s father was a supreme being of the Seventh Tier. Who dared to touch Xin Qihu? Wasn’t he afraid that Xin Fu would drop everything and come looking for him?

Who wouldn’t be afraid of the might of Seventh Tier?

!!

Ling Han entered into the Void, just circled around, and then returned to this lost overlapping dimension.

He sat cross-legged and digested his battle experience with Xin Qihu.

Ling Han had benefited a lot from fighting such super elites and prodigies. Not only had his cultivation level increased, but he had also refined his combat techniques.

He spent three years in seclusion this time, and this was only the case because his thoughts could be accelerated. Otherwise, it would have taken much longer.

“Something doesn’t seem right,” he muttered, but he couldn’t figure out what was wrong, so he shook his head, and stopped paying attention to this problem.

Just as he was about to move, he suddenly grasped a special signal.

Meng Dong.

He had finally appeared.

Previously, Meng Dong had made an agreement with Ling Han. When the latter grasped this signal, it meant that the former wanted to see him.

Only “special” people like them could use this signal, and only they could grasp it. It was a very safe and reliable method of communication.

Of course, it could only be used when they were relatively close, even if they were all Heavenly Venerates.

This was a price that had to be paid for safety.

However, even when both parties sent out the same signal, there was still a slight difference. It would be imbued with each person’s unique intent, allowing them to completely differentiate who had sent out this signal.

If not for that, Ling Han would have killed Meng Dong long ago. He would have used this signal to lure out all the remaining dregs of Hysteria and killed them one by one. He would have been able to resolve this huge problem very quickly.

In just a moment, Meng Dong flew over.

“Little Brother, long time no see. You really know how to run. If I hadn’t seen your battle with Xin Qihu a few years ago, I wouldn’t have known where to find you,” he said.

Ling Han took the opportunity to say, “I don’t know where our base camp is. Even if I have something to discuss with you, I have nowhere to go.”

Meng Dong laughed heartily, and said, “There’s no need to rush. There’s a mission for you to complete right now. This is a test for you from the Lord. As long as you complete this mission perfectly, you’ll truly be accepted.”

Ling Han was shocked. Hysteria was actually still worried about him?

When did he reveal any flaws? He was actually being guarded against?

Thinking about it again, Ling Han was relieved. The others had all awakened as soon as they entered the Heavenly Venerable Tier, but he had still not been “awakened” even at Second Tier. If Hysteria hadn’t made a move and forced Ling Han to see those scenes, he wouldn’t have known that he actually had a deep connection with Hysteria.

Even so, he hadn’t “changed sides.” Why would Hysteria trust him?

This was a sly old fox who had lived for who knew how long. How could it trust others so easily?

Ling Han deliberately put on an expression of indignation. “You don’t trust me?”

Meng Dong hurriedly waved his hand. “Little Brother, this is also for the sake of caution. After all, we’re doing something world-shaking.”

Ling Han was only intentionally complaining. This was his normal reaction. He said, “Alright, what’s the mission this time?”

Meng Dong shook his head. “It’s not convenient to talk about it in detail here. Come with me.”

This guy was quite careful. Ling Han did not object, and followed him.

After walking for several days, they arrived at an abandoned raw stone mine. Stone layers that had been cut were everywhere, and Meng Dong had constructed a simple formation with them that could completely cut off the divine sense of a Heavenly Venerate. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Heavenly Venerable Stones had such an effect to begin with, so it was naturally safer to use them to set up a formation.

“Wait a few days,” said Meng Dong.

Ling Han did not ask, and merely sat cross-legged.

A few days later, a man suddenly appeared.

“Let me introduce you. This is Brother Ba Duo,” Meng Dong said as he pointed at this man, and then pointed at Ling Han. “This is Ling Han.”

“Brother Ling, I’ve heard of your great name for a long time. When will you come and spar with me?” Ba Duo asked, his face full of fighting spirit.

He was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. For him to be chosen by Hysteria, or perhaps be affected by Hysteria’s consciousness, meant that his strength should be extremely powerful, not weaker than Meng Dong’s.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Alright.” In a battle at equal cultivation level, whom was he afraid of?

Meng Dong hurriedly stopped the two from fighting, and smilingly said, “There’s no hurry to spar. We’re all brothers, and there are plenty of opportunities. It’s more important to complete the Lord’s mission.”

Only then did Ba Duo shut his mouth, but the way he looked at Ling Han was still filled with provocation.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t shrink back, and similarly looked at the other party with a challenging gaze. If the other party dared to make a move, he would definitely knock the other party to the ground with a single punch, shattering all of his teeth.

“The mission this time is to send this thing into the core of the Flaming Frost Realm.” Meng Dong finally revealed the specific content of the mission. He took out an item. It was a sphere that was flowing with a pitch-black luster, and exuded an incomparably evil aura.

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. “What is this?”

“You only need to complete the mission. Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!” Ba Duo immediately shouted.

“Hey, hey, hey!” Meng Dong hurriedly waved his hand. “We’re all family. Why can’t he ask questions?” He chuckled. “This is something forged by our Lord. It has a strong corrosive effect on the dimensional core.”

He looked at Ling Han, and continued, “As long as this thing is thrown into the core of the Flaming Frost Realm, it will greatly weaken the power of this realm, allowing our Lord to gain the upper hand in a dimensional clash.”

Ling Han was shocked. This move was truly vicious.

The core of a dimension was the heart of a dimension. If it was corroded, it would greatly weaken the power of the dimension.

Of course, it was also incomparably difficult to achieve this, especially against a transcendent dimension like the Flaming Frost Realm. Even Sixth Tier elites would only be reduced to ashes if they tried to face it head-on.

Could this thing really work?

Ling Han didn’t know if Hysteria was testing him on purpose. Perhaps it didn’t have the effect Meng Dong had mentioned at all.

...

But what if it was true?

Ling Han hesitated. Should he directly take down Meng Dong and Ba Duo and resolve this conspiracy against the Flaming Frost Realm, or should he continue to feign civility and become a spy to find all of Hysteria’s moles?

It would be easy to take them out, but he would also lose this line. Furthermore, if this was really a test aimed at him, then it would be fine. If this thing really worked, then even if he resolved it this time, Hysteria would still be able to do it a second time and a third time. There would be a lot of people who could use it, and he wouldn’t be the only one who could do it.

Thinking of this, Ling Han nodded. “Understood.”
