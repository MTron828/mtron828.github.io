Chapter 1286 Using Public Office to Avenge a Private Resentmen

Following the Netherworld’s invasion, the higher-ups of Wolf Fang City issued a notice stating the everyone had to report to the three armies within three days of receiving the notice. There, they would receive commands from the generals and fight together against the Netherworld.

This time, it didn’t matter whether one had retired from the army or not, nor did it matter how many merit points they had accumulated. All Immortal Realm elites still present in the Two Realm Battlefield were obligated to participate in the battle against the Netherworld. Moreover, an urgent call for reinforcements had already been issued, and it wouldn’t be long before more elites arrived at the Two Realm Battlefield.

The Netherworld had suddenly elevated the small skirmishes into a full-blown war, and it was crucial that all the elites on Cloud Apex Planet were mobilized to participate in the resistance.

Ling Han immediately rushed to the front lines as well—everyone had a responsibility to fight against the Netherworld’s invasion. This was a clash between two realms, and the beings on Cloud Apex Planet would definitely be massacred if the Netherworld were to conquer the planet.

The Netherworld wouldn’t refine the Cloud Apex Planet into a Realm Pill, but what they did certainly wouldn’t be any less brutal. Whatever they did, widespread death and destruction would be inevitable.

Ling Han arrived at the front lines, only to see a tense stand-off between two large armies.

One of the armies was naturally from the Immortal Realm. This army was 700,000 strong, and it consisted of soldiers from the Purple Moon Army, Wind Riders Army, and Holy Army, as well as a large number of mercenaries. However, the quality of the soldiers was varying and uneven.

Some were at the Mountain River Tier, while some were at the Sun Moon Tier. However, at least half of the soldiers were at the Mountain River Tier. This caused the overall quality of the army to fall drastically. In fact, the Immortal Realm army was absolutely no match for their opponent.

The Netherworld army was 1,000,000 strong, and all of their soldiers were at the Sun Moon Tier!

This stark contrast revealed just how terrifying a force the Netherworld had unleashed upon the Immortal Realm. The Netherworld possessed a crushing advantage.

At this moment, Ling Han didn’t have the spare time to worry about his personal affairs. He didn’t search for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, instead entering the army encampment and reporting his arrival. He didn’t ask for any special treatment, and he was willing to listen to the commands of the generals. He would be a responsible soldier.

The Netherworld launched several attacks, though they controlled the scale of the battle each time, only deploying a small number of Heavenly Body Tier elites. The other members of the assault squads were all at the Sun Moon Tier.

‘Are they feeling us out?’

However, few people paid attention to this fact. Everyone was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the reinforcements. Right now, it was tremendously difficult for them to hold the Netherworld army at bay.

Meanwhile, those who were smarter were also extremely confused. Why had the Netherworld army suddenly launched an all-out assault?

One had to realize that Netherworld elites couldn’t wield the Regulations of the Immortal Realm after entering the Immortal Realm. So, their battle prowess would fall by at least three or four stars. If both armies were of similar quality, such a drop in battle prowess would be like a death sentence.

Moreover, the Immortal Realm didn’t appear to be weaker than the Netherworld. So, what was the point of launching such a huge assault?

“Perhaps there are profound treasures hidden on our side, and even the great elites of the Netherworld have become interested. Thus, they’ve launched this offensive in the hopes of seizing this land.”

“Even Eternal River Tier elites have become interested... These treasures were definitely left by a great elite who was at least at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. Perhaps this treasure is the inheritance of a Saint!”

“That must be the case!”

Such speculations were wildly popular, and they quickly spread throughout the entire army. Many people became giddy upon hearing this, and they started to consider whether or not they should search for this hidden treasure. If it were truly the inheritance of a Saint, it was entirely possible that they could become a supreme elite in a single step.

The war had yet to be fought, yet many people had already started to think about other matters. The three commanding generals had no choice but to execute several people who were acting the most disobedient. This was necessary to ensure military discipline.

Once the number of mercenaries increased, military discipline would naturally decrease. Mercenaries had no thought for the group, and it was very easy for them to reveal their own greed.

After this slight hiccup, the Netherworld army launched several more assaults. However, the intensity of the battles was much lower than the noise that they generated. From beginning to end, all the battles were suppressed to a certain scale. With the passing of time, the reinforcements from the two Imperial Empires also started to arrive.

More and more elites joined the Immortal Realm army, and it seemed as if the assault from the Netherworld was going to be stopped here and now. However, the arrival of these elites also reaffirmed people’s belief that the Netherworld wasn’t invading them to seize the land of Cloud Apex Planet. Instead, they were invading them to obtain the inheritance of an Eternal River Tier or even Saint.

A soldier ran over to Ling Han, and said, “Ling Han, the newly arrived captain wants to see you.”

None of the mercenaries had been incorporated into the legitimate armies, as they hadn’t undergone any official training. Thus, it would be useless even if they were extremely powerful. There was simply no way they could merge into the military and cooperate smoothly. If they were forced into the three official armies, they would only end up making matters worse.

As such, the mercenaries had been gathered together to form an independent army. If mutiny occurred, only this hastily put together army would be affected. The battle prowess of the legitimate armies wouldn’t be affected.

‘Newly arrived captain?’

Ling Han found this a bit strange. ‘Do I know this person? Why are they suddenly asking to see me?

‘Whatever, I’ll go if they want me to.’

He followed the soldier and arrived before a tent. The soldier stopped, and respectfully said, “Captain, Ling Han has arrived.”

This tent was huge, and it signified the lofty standing of its owner.

“Let him enter,” the person in the tent said.

‘Huh? This voice sounds a bit familiar,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

Meanwhile, the soldier next to him had already opened the flap of the tent. A person immediately walked out.

‘Xie Donglai!

‘No wonder the voice sounded so familiar. No wonder they wanted to see me. So, it turns out that he wants to exact revenge!’

“Hahahaha! Ling Han, you didn’t expect this, did you? We meet again so soon!” Xie Donglai sneered coldly, a mocking look on his face.

He had initially planned to cultivate in seclusion and strive to become a Heavenly Body Tier elite. When he succeeded, he would seek Ling Han and Faceless out and then kill them. He would make them pay a heavy price for humiliating him. However, the Netherworld had suddenly invaded, and even Great General Xie was deployed to the frontlines. As a descendent of the Xie Clan, he was also assigned to the position of captain.

Coincidentally, Ling Han was under his direct command. He was naturally delighted by this fact, and the first thing he did upon realizing this was calling Ling Han over. He was going to flaunt his might as a superior.

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle, and say, “Dumb c*nt, why is it you again? Have you not suffered enough yet?”

Xie Donglai was infuriated upon hearing this. However, power was on his side, and he said, “In this place, I’m the captain, and you’re my soldier! You have to do as I say!”

“Oh? Then what commands does Captain want to issue?” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“Go, collect some firewood for me,” Xie Donglai said with a humph. Right now, he was simply going to toy around with Ling Han. However, once battle erupted, he would send Ling Han to the most dangerous location on the battlefield. He would borrow the hands of the Netherworld to kill Ling Han.

“No problem,” Ling Han said with a nod. He turned around and left.

Xie Donglai sneered coldly. ‘What a coward. He submitted to me so readily.’

He stood there and waited for Ling Han to return. Once he returned with the firewood, he would continue to issue commands and force him to carry out other mundane tasks. If he dared to disobey, he would punish him according to military discipline.

Haha, who told Ling Han to be his subordinate?

However, the longer he waited, the darker his expression became. This was because Ling Han still hadn’t returned.

‘This brat... actually dared to disobey my orders?’

He flared up in rage and immediately headed toward Ling Han’s tent.

“Ling Han!” he roared. His voice rumbled like thunder, revealing the rage that he was currently experiencing.

The surrounding soldiers were astonished by this roar, and many people walked over to check out the commotion.

“Dumb c*nt, why is it you again?” Ling Han asked as he walked out of his tent. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“You dared to disobey my command, so I’m here to punish you!” Xie Donglai said coldly. Ling Han had given him a legitimate excuse to flaunt his power.
