3146 Amongst the Strong, there will always be those who are stronger

What?!

Sun Jianfang was undoubtedly a Twelve Meridians. In other words, he had cultivated six or seven overlapping layers of power?

Hiss, what ancient secret technique had he obtained?

Sun Jianfang crossed his arms behind his back and said, “Now, do I have the right to ask for some guidance?”

As the mountain winds blew, his robes fluttered, and he had an indescribable air of ease.

Even if he was facing a group of powerful enemies, and even if he was targeted by terrifying arrows, so what?

Cultivators were unyielding!

Ji Yuanlong and the other Twelve Meridians king tiers all felt admiration from the bottom of their hearts.

They knew that a large part of the reason why Sun Jianfang dared to step out like this was because he did not have much lifespan left. At most, he could live for another ten years. Hence, he was willing to go all out, and did not hesitate to have a vigorous battle to end his legendary life in glory.

However, it was the same for them, but none of them dared to step out. In comparison, Sun Jianfang stood out.

“Ah!” Wang Feng roared in fury as he charged back from the distance. This attack caused blood to seep from the corners of his lips, but it seemed to have incited his vicious nature, and his face was filled with killing intent.

“Step back.” Lian Xuerong’s eyes lit up, “You are no match for him.”

“Captain!” Wang Feng was unwilling to give up. Although he had suffered a loss in a single strike, he believed that he could still win with his superior technique.

“En?” Lian Xuerong’s beautiful eyes glared, and a murderous aura spread out.

“Yes.” Wang Feng obediently stepped aside. A dignified Twelve Meridians supreme king tier actually didn’t have much of a temper.

This woman… just how strong was she?

Lian Xuerong looked at Sun Jianfang, nodded, and showed an expression of approval. “In this desolate land, you can actually rely on your own efforts to advance into the Blood Transformation Tier. It’s really not easy.”

When these words fell, everyone was shocked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

What, Sun Jianfang had already stepped into another cultivation level?

No wonder he could send Wang Feng flying with a single palm strike. If he had advanced into a new major tier, then what would it matter if his opponent was a king tier of Twelve Meridians?

“Blood Transformation Tier?” Sun Jianfang also revealed a blank expression, as if he didn’t understand at all.

She paused for a moment before continuing, “Others can obtain an additional 30 years or so of lifespan after reaching the Blood Transformation Tier. However, you’ve suffered far too many losses. At most, you can only obtain a lifespan of 10 years.”

His name was destined to remain in the annals of history, and become a legend on the path of martial arts. It was already enough for him to have reached this point in his life.

“Oh, you think your accomplishments are very extraordinary?” Lian Xuerong smiled faintly, “Old man, you have been a frog at the bottom of a well for too long.”

She leaped out, as agile as a cheetah, and pressed her palm down on Sun Jianfang.

Peng! She was still extremely far away, yet her power had already reached him.

Sun Jianfang hurriedly raised his fist to parry. This was the Four Directional Fists.

In this exchange of blows, the two of them were separated by at least fifteen meters, but the force had already clashed fiercely, as if it had solidified.

Sun Jianfang’s figure swayed, and he couldn’t help but take a few steps back. Then, he trembled again, and took another ten steps back. After stopping, he took another ten steps back, and then another ten steps back. In this manner, he took more than a hundred steps back before finally stopping.

Everyone was transfixed with shock. F*ck! This woman’s strength was far too heaven-defying!

Sun Jianfang was already awesome enough, sending Wang Feng, who was a Twelve Meridians, flying with a single slap. However, faced with this woman, he retreated more than a hundred steps with a single strike. Moreover, he stopped, retreated, retreated, and stopped again.

What did this signify?

Lian Xuerong’s attack not only crushed Sun Jianfang in terms of power, but also formed a dozen over overlapping layers of power, and only then could she have suppressed Sun Jianfang in waves.

She was too strong. She alone was enough to sweep aside all opposition in the world. No wonder so many Twelve Meridians elites were willing to submit to her.

He Guan, Gu Tang, and the others, on the other hand, became energetic, raising their heads and puffing out their chests.

As the saying went, smart birds would choose a tree to perch on. They were the smart people here, and had made the most correct choice.

Moreover, if a Banner Lord was already so awesome, then how strong would the Lord of Huju City be? And how strong would the sovereign of the Black North Nation be?

Only with such a powerful backer would there be boundless brilliance.

Just listen, what did Lian Xuerong say just now? If one advanced to the Blood Transformation Tier, they would be able to obtain an additional thirty years of lifespan.

That was thirty years.

Especially for Ji Yuanlong and the others, they were all restless. Which of them wasn’t nearing the limit of their lifespan? It was possible that they would sleep at night, and not be able to get up the next day.

Who didn’t want to live for a few more years?

Sun Jianfang’s expression changed drastically. He had never imagined that he, who had pushed open the door to a new cultivation level, would be inferior to a woman in her twenties.

This Dark North Nation or whatnot was a little too powerful, wasn’t it?

Was there a higher cultivation level than the Blood Transformation Tier?

Everyone’s hearts thumped wildly. This was really a temptation that could not be refused.

Stronger strength, more lifespan, what better choice could a cultivator make than this?

Sun Jianfang sighed. Previously, he had thought of himself as a legend, but hearing Lian Xuerong’s words, this little achievement of his was really nothing.

—Just how many Blood Transformation Tier elites were there in their city?

His heart had already wavered. However, he still couldn’t just discard his pride, so he stood there without saying anything.

Meng Ruining walked over and said, “Big Brother Sun, come on. Water naturally flows downhill, and we’re all naturally aiming for greater heights.” He had already made up his mind.

Moreover, with the terrifying abilities of Lian Xuerong and the others, there was actually no need for them to be so polite. They could completely force their way through, and who would be able to stop them?

With this thought, the conflict and grievance in his heart naturally decreased slightly.

Sun Jianfang nodded. He looked at Lian Xuerong, and said, “I can surrender, but there’s one thing that has to be made clear. That Demonic Snake was indeed killed by one of our disciples!”

“I believe you,” Lian Xuerong said, glancing at Sima Rong.

Sima Rong’s body instantly trembled, and he couldn’t help but shiver.

Although Lian Xuerong still hadn’t reprimanded him yet, he knew that this Banner Lord couldn’t tolerate faults. He actually dared to deceive her, so he definitely wouldn’t have a good ending.
