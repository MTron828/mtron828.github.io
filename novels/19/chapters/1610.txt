Chapter 1611: Long Tribe

The greatest benefit of breaking through to the pinnacle level for Ling Han was that his Godly bones would advance to Saint Grade!

He inscribed a total of 999 Limitless Nine Deaths Formations on his Godly bones in one go. In truth, he very much wanted to inscribe Saint Grade killing formations. Unfortunately, without advancing into the Saint Tier himself, even if his Godly bones could support them, it would be useless. They would only be an empty frame, and could not be activated at all.

However, a quantitative change could form a qualitative change. 999 Limitless Nine Deaths Formations, just what kind of concept was that? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was definitely not just 999 cultivators at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier combining forces, merging together to attack. The boost of power would be 10 times to 100 times that.

Ling Han felt an itch in his heart. He sought out the Tranquil Heart Saint, and the two of them engaged in a spar.

The result was astonishing; Ling Han actually suppressed the Tranquil Heart Saint!

They both depended on formations, but the might of the simultaneous activation of 999 Limitless Nine Deaths Formations was actually stronger than even a Saint Formation! Of course, if Ling Han could inscribe 10 Saint-grade killing formations inside his body now, that would definitely be even more amazing.

It was only now that Ling Han truly possessed the ability to kill a Saint with his own battle prowess—the issue was that just what Saint would clearly know that he was no match for Ling Han, and still be determined to battle him to the death? After all, his strength was not equipped with an overwhelming advantage. When a Saint sensed something was off as the battle continued, how could it be that they would not flee?

Aside from killing formations, whether it was the Banishing Technique, Darkness of the Paramount Night, Flying Dragon Shadow Hands, or other such celestial techniques, they all had no effect on Saints, but the Nine Heavens Flame, Divine Demon Sword, and the broken wooden sword were still very frightening. Even Saint Kings would dare not be touched or struck by these attacks.

Ling Han finally felt it was about enough, and went to seek out Long Xiangyue.

“Take me to see your aunt,” he said directly.

Long Xiangyue’s expression was filled with resentment. This fickle guy, being surrounded by the exquisite beauties of the Forbidden Lands every day, was now having designs on her aunt. Was he planning to have both aunt and niece? He was really too shameless!

She was thinking this in her heart, yet her head involuntarily nodded, and she replied, “All right!”

When the words left her mouth, she almost slapped herself. She actually agreed to such a preposterous request! When she thought that she and her aunt would be lying on the same bed, and this guy would show a perverted expression, suddenly pouncing on them, her face flushed as red as blood, yet she looked a bit dazed as well.

Ling Han was a little baffled. When had this fierce woman become such a love-struck fool?

He grabbed Long Xiangyue and stuffed her into the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. It rose into the air, and entered into the galaxy.

“Why do you not use the means of Saints, and directly travel through space?” Long Xiangyue asked Ling Han in confusion, coming back to her senses after a very long time.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han was mocking in his heart. If he could, he naturally wanted to. Spreading out a golden path, just how eye-catching was that? But how could the present him have that ability? Putting aside the fact that he could no longer use a power boost from the Black Tower, even if he could, and merely used it to travel quickly... the exorbitance of doing something like that was something that even he would not be able to forgive himself for.

‘Women, what mysterious beings.’

When Long Xiangyue saw that Ling Han did not answer her, she used her own understanding. ‘Now that both of us are aboard the shuttle, wouldn’t it be a rare journey where it is just the two of us? Does he want to have more time alone with me?’ With this thought, she couldn’t help but become more infatuated.

‘If he wants to do that to me, should I allow it or not?

‘If I allow it, would it seem as if I were too unreserved?

‘If I don’t, what if it angers him, and he ignores me in future?

‘Then I will just half-allow it and half-refuse. In any case, I am not as strong as him, so after slight resistance, I will just allow him to do what he wills.’

When she thought about the embarrassing parts, her face couldn’t help but blush, her heart beating madly.

Unfortunately, what she was both afraid and expectant of did not happen. Ling Han sat firmly as if he was made of stone, and did not even say much. After about four months later, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle entered into the Strong Sun Galaxy, and very soon arrived at Gathered Seas Planet.

The Long Tribe resided on Gathered Seas Planet.

In the Strong Sun Galaxy, the Long Tribe was the undisputed strongest force. The leader of the Long Tribe was a Medium Saint, and Long Xiangyue’s aunty had also become a Saint herself thousands of years ago. Having two Saints in the same tribe was extremely shocking.

This aunty of Long Xiangyue was named Long Yushan, and had been known for her beauty and natural talent ever since childhood. However, after she became a Saint, not many people dared to have improper designs on her.

Without being Saints themselves, how could they possibly think of wanting to seize this princess of the heavens?

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle landed. Because the landing position could not be accurately controlled, there was still a very, very long distance to travel before reaching the ancestral grounds of the Long Tribe. Thankfully, for two Eternal River Tiers, this was only a matter of three to four days.

Long Xiangyue was a bit gloomy. Could it be that his guy was a blockhead? They had shared a few months of time alone, and his gaze actually did not slant at all. Was he putting on a pretense of being serious, or was it that she was not enchanting enough?

As her thoughts ran wild, three days passed in the blink of an eye. They had already arrived at the ancestral grounds of the Long Tribe.

“Ninth, Ninth Young Miss!” When they saw Long Xiangyue walk over with an unfamiliar man, the four guards at the entrance were first startled, and then continued to gasp, immediately calling out to her respectfully.

Long Xiangyue was also the pride of the Long Tribe. In future, there was a chance for her to become the third Saint of the Long Xiangyue, and by then, they would have a total of three Saints in their tribe, which would mean glory for all ages!

Long Xiangyue nodded, and brought Ling Han in.

“Yi, Ninth Young Miss would actually bring a man back with her!”

“How rare, with how proud and arrogant Ninth Young Miss is, there has never been a man that was able to walk by her side in the past.”

“The gaze that Ninth Young Miss directed at that person is also full of tender feelings!”

“Yi, could it be that this is our future Young Master[1]?”

“Oh no, we have not greeted him properly just now.”

Those four guards immediately began discussing in whispers at the side. However, though their voices were very low, how could they escape the ears of Ling Han and Long Xiangyue?

Long Xiangyue was both embarrassed and glad, and said, “These people really know how to chatter nonsense, just see how I will deal with them later!”

Ling Han only snickered, and Long Xiangyue couldn’t help but pout.

Now that she was home, Long Xiangyue became energetic, scrambling here and there in the courtyard, a genuine smile on her face, which made Ling Han feel rueful. This was the real behavior that a young girl should have.

She dragged Ling Han with her directly to the residence of Long Yushan. That was a serene and elegant little courtyard. In truth, Long Yushan very rarely stayed here. She frequently traveled all over in pursuit of a breakthrough so she could advance further in her cultivation.

But when the two of them arrived at the entrance to the courtyard, they unexpectedly discovered that there was a young man and woman standing there. Both of them were of graceful bearing, as if they were giants among men, and were both in the Eternal River Tier.

“Halt!” Seeing Ling Han and Long Xiangyue approach, the young man stretched out his hand to stop their advance. “Who are the two of you?”

Long Xiangyue couldn’t help but be irritated. She did not recognize these two people, but was absolutely sure that they were not members of the Long Tribe. Otherwise, how could she possibly be unaware that two young prodigies that had broken through to the Eternal River Tier had appeared in the tribe?

“I should be the one asking this question; who are you two!” She released her aura, already preparing for a battle.

The young man smiled slightly. “I am Yang Zige, may I know how I should address you, Miss?”

“Long Xiangyue!” This princess of the Long Xiangyue looked towards that young woman.

“Jing Yi,” the woman answered.

“What do you mean by standing guard at the entrance to my aunty’s residence?” Long Xiangyue directly questioned. That was what her personality was like.

[1] In this context, what they mean is that he would marry Long Xiangyue and become their young master, not that he would become a son of the family.
