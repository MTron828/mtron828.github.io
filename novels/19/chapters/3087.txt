3088 One Last Fight

Boom!

Extermination exchanged a blow with Ling Han, but she was no match for Ling Han at all, and was instantly sent flying.

Ling Han caught up to her, and swung his fists continuously, with each strike bearing enough power to crush Extermination.

Extermination’s two heads roared as they swung their hands with boundless power.

However, in front of Ling Han, this kind of power could only be said to be insignificant, and was easily extinguished by a casual punch from Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng. After a few hundred punches, Extermination was beaten into a tragic state.

However, she also had about 10% of Ling Han’s strength. Thus, it would not be easy to kill her, at least not with just a few punches.

“Let me do it, scram to the side!” Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand’s head said to Extermination’s head.

“I’ll do it. I’m the true master of this body. Give me all the control!” Extermination’s head said indignantly.

Peng!

Ling Han punched out, and Extermination’s body was instantly sent flying.

“We can’t go on like this!”

“Like this, we’ll both die together!”

“Fuse!”

Extermination and Yellow Sand looked at each other with determination.

Ling Han was too powerful. “They” were inferior to him in the first place, yet they still had to compete for control over this body. Wasn’t this courting death?

Weng, Extermination’s body emitted a powerful aura as the two souls began to fuse.

They were truly at the end of their rope. Otherwise, who would be willing to merge their soul with another?

In terms of soul possession, if one didn’t like it, one could still switch to another body. However, once the souls were fused, they would truly be together forever, unless they died.

Peng!

Ling Han threw a punch, and Extermination was immediately sent flying. He chased after her. Peng, peng, peng, his fists struck out furiously, wanting to completely destroy this ancient great evil.

“Ah…” Extermination’s two heads were roaring. The two heads were then seen getting stuck tightly together, and sank into each other. They fused very quickly.

This scene was quite scary and disgusting, but it wasn’t just a fusion of the body. At the same time, it represented the unification of the two souls.

From then on, there would no longer be any Extermination or Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand. In its place was a brand-new soul. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Boom!

A terrifying aura surged, and the black dress on Extermination’s body was immediately shattered, revealing her graceful and mesmerizing body. However, a black aura immediately surged out of her body and covered her.

As if she had just been reborn, she let out a long breath and opened her eyes abruptly, releasing an indescribable pressure.

The two souls had completely fused and obtained perfect control over their body. At this moment, Extermination had reached an unprecedented level of power.

She was filled with confidence as she looked down at Ling Han.

“Ling Han, your doomsday has arrived—”

Peng!

Before she could finish her sentence, a heavy punch landed on her face and sent her flying.

“F*ck you!” Ling Han caught up to her. “Did you think you’re very impressive and awesome?”

Hehe, he hadn’t unleashed his full battle prowess all this while, alright?

Extermination’s face was filled with disbelief. She had already fused the power and the souls of two beings, yet she was still no match for Ling Han?

How was this possible?

She was in a daze, and could not accept it at all.

Peng!

However, Ling Han’s fist swung over again and directly sent her flying, letting her know that this was not a dream, but rather an incomparable reality.

Peng, peng, peng, Ling Han’s punches came upon her like rain, continuously crashing down.

Extermination roared, and she channeled all of her Heavenly Venerable Seals. An incomparably complex symbol shone on her forehead, and then she charged toward Ling Han to meet the attack.

Peng, she was sent flying with a single strike.

Even with a boost of 100,000 times in strength, she was still no match for Ling Han?

No, no, no, her power didn’t increase at all.

How could such a thing happen?

It was very simple. Why could the Heavenly Venerable Seals increase one’s power? That was because the Heavenly Venerable Seals were a bridge that connected with fundamental power. The higher the level of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, the wider the bridge, and more fundamental power would surge over, resulting in greater boost of power.

But now?

The Genesis World was gone, and there was no more energy in the Void. So what if Extermination channeled the Heavenly Venerable Seals? Where could she extract power from?

When the well had dried up, what was the use of a bucket?

Peng, Ling Han chased after Extermination, continuously unleashing Fists of Fury.

This time, Extermination really didn’t have any other methods.

In the current situation, any secret technique would be useless; only the one with greater power would win.

And undoubtedly, not only was Ling Han’s power stronger, his power was almost 10 times stronger, and not just stronger by a slight margin.

There was not much improvement in their physiques, as they were still stuck in the so-called “immortal and indestructible” state of the Seventh Tier. No matter who struck whom, they could cause great damage to the other party.

Right now, only Ling Han would be able to tyrannize Extermination.

Pu, pu, pu! Blood splattered everywhere. Extermination was in an extremely miserable state.

Lin Luo and the others sighed. It seemed like everything was about to end.

“Ah…” Extermination roared. She was indignant, and filled with resentment. She had already reached such a height, but she would still die?

Why did Ling Han exist?

“You brought this upon yourself!” Ling Han said coldly.

Both Yellow Sand and Extermination belonged to the Genesis Worlds of the previous era.

At that time, if Extermination hadn’t had the intention to dominate the Genesis World, why would she have been targeted by so many ultimate elites, and why would they have ended up risking the destruction of the Genesis World to kill her?

Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand had also brought this upon himself. He had been reborn, and if he hadn’t had such great ambitions, how could he have fallen to such a state?

Therefore, he had brought this upon himself. He couldn’t blame anyone.

“I can’t accept this! I can’t accept this!” Extermination shouted as she fought back. She really couldn’t accept this.

Lin Luo and the others were extremely emotional. Although Extermination hadn’t been killed yet, the outcome had already been decided.

The fiends that hounded the Genesis Worlds of two eras were finally going to be executed, and could no longer stir up trouble.

However, not only had the Genesis World collapsed this time, but even the Void had been sucked dry. Could another third-generation Genesis World be born?

Impossible.

The only way out now was to open that door and enter a new world.

If the new world was also nothingness, then they would live in this desolation forever.

Hopefully, it wouldn’t be this bad.

The more Ling Han fought, the more violent he became. Extermination had to die as the Genesis World had been destroyed because of her, and countless lives had been lost. It would be unforgivable if she did not die after all that.

Ling Han attacked wildly. So what if Extermination’s power could suppress that of a Seventh Tier? The injuries on her body were getting more and more severe, and she was not far from death.

“You forced me to do this!” Extermination said in a resolute tone. Xiu, the space between her brows split open, and a beam of light flew out, shooting straight towards Ling Han’s forehead.

This was her soul.

She was very decisive. Since she was no match for Ling Han in terms of power, she would compete in divine sense. If her divine sense was superior, she would be able to dominate Ling Han’s mind, and thus control Ling Han’s body.

This way, she could become the strongest through another method.

However, this was too dangerous. Without the protection of the physical body, the soul would be extremely fragile. Once the soul was destroyed, one’s divine sense would be destroyed as well.

However, there was no way out for Extermination, so she could only give it a try.
