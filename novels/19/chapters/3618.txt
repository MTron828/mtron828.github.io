Chapter 3619: Origin Gold

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was definitely not an exaggeration.

That was because this was Origin Gold, a supreme precious material used only by the Ancestral King!

After every Ancestral King achieved Dao, they would seek out Origin Gold, and forge their own unique weapon, which was called an Imperial Weapon or Monarch Weapon or Ancestral Weapon.

Origin Gold was the general name for this kind of precious material. There were actually many types, such as Celestial Tears Green Gold, Limitless Black Iron, and Earth Black Source Qi, but every kind of ingredient was incredibly rare. In fact, there was only one such ingredient in this world.

Even if it was the Ancestral King, it was possible that he would not be able to obtain a single piece of Origin Gold even if he spent his whole life. This was not due to insufficient strength, but rather a problem of luck.

However, Great Emperor Wu Ya obtained two pieces of Origin Gold for himself. One was obtained in his early years, and was forged into the Extreme Dao Sword, an Imperial Weapon. The other was obtained in his later years, and was no longer forged into an Imperial Weapon. Instead, it was left here, to be bestowed on those who were fated in future generations.

In reality, there were also differences in quality among different types of Origin Gold. It was just that this difference was extremely small, and this Origin Gold could be ranked in the top ten among all the types of Origin Gold.

—There was no specific ranking for the top ten. They were all extremely valuable.

This piece of Origin Gold was called Primal Chaos Extreme Lightning.

According to legends, this was created in the Primal Chaos, and had been forged countless years by the Divine Lightning in the pool of lightning of heaven and earth, and only then did it form into a piece that was the size of a fist.

There was no need to worry about not having enough. Once the Origin Gold was forged into a tool, it could be enlarged and shrunk at will. It was no problem at all. The difference was that the larger the original size of the Origin Gold, the stronger the power would be correspondingly after it was forged into a tool.

However, the Origin Gold of heaven and earth was really too rare. Every time it appeared, it was about the size of a fist, and it was difficult to see any difference.

Ling Han’s heart thumped against his chest. He was only at the Enlightenment Tier and hadn’t even advanced to the Celestial Path yet, yet he had already obtained a piece of Origin Gold that could be forged into the Ancestral King’s personal weapon.

Til take it!’

Ling Han walked over, and according to the technique that Wu Qingxu had taught him, he put away the Origin Gold and stored it into his Spatial Spirit Tool.

This was only the raw Origin Gold, and had not been forged into a weapon. Otherwise, it could not have been so easily retrieved by him, and if it had been personally forged by the Ancestral King, then once it showed its might, a sliver of aura would be enough to shake a Saint to the point that his whole body would crack, and his Dao would be destroyed, and he would die.

The Ancestral Weapon represented, in a certain sense, an Ancestral King. An Ancestral King had a limited lifespan, but the Ancestral Weapon would last for eternity.

Even if he put away the Origin Gold, Ling Han still felt like he was in a dream.

This gain was so great that he could not believe it.

“Who would believe that I haven’t even set foot on the Celestial Path yet, and already possess a piece of Origin Gold?” Ling Han murmured. “This kind of treatment, even an Ancestral King, his son, or his daughter would not be qualified to enjoy.”

Origin Gold was too rare. Even the strongest Ancestral King in the world would only be able to obtain a single piece of Origin Gold in their lifetime, and some would not even be able to obtain it.

Great Emperor Wu Ya’s luck was nature-defying.

Aside from the Origin Gold, there was also a jade bottle on the table, which was half-filled with water.

That was Natural Dao Water; what was it used for?

To resist an environment of extreme flames.

Before the Origin Gold was forged into a weapon, it was incredibly sturdy. Even if all the Saints in the world worked together, they would not be able to knock off a single corner. They would have to go to the place where the Heavenly Dao Flames was burning.

The Heavenly Dao Flame could burn Saints to death. If Ling Han went at this time, that would be equivalent to seeking death. However, as long as he ingested the Natural Dao Water, he would be able to restrain the Heavenly Dao Flame, and complete the tempering and forging of the Origin Gold.

Heavenly Emperor Wu Ya was very thoughtful. Not only did he deliver the Origin Gold, he had even prepared the ingredients needed to forge the Origin Gold. This Ancestral Weapon definitely had to be forged person, infused with a sliver of divine sense, so that the wielder and tool would be connected, and could command it according to his will.

“Please don’t worry, senior. Since I have obtained this great opportunity, I will also bear the corresponding responsibility. In future, when I have cultivated and attained great dao, I will definitely eradicate this Evil Eye, and get rid of any future trouble.”

Ling Han said solemnly. He had made a dao oath, and would definitely fulfill it.

He bowed towards the end of the palace hall. This was to thank Great Emperor Wu Ya for actually leaving behind a piece of Origin Gold for him. This inter-generational favor was really too heavy.

Ling Han turned around and quickly returned to the garden. He then exited the front hall and arrived at the plaza.

In the distance, the little loli was sitting on the ground in boredom, not even licking the candy. She had probably eaten too much, and lost her appetite.

Ling Han returned, and when he arrived at the edge of the plaza, he easily walked over. He didn’t need to walk for another ten days.

“Come on, let’s go back,” he said.

“Any gains?” The little loli’s eyes widened. She was also a curious child.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and took out a Water Element Crystal.

“Yi, there’s actually Water Element Crystals inside?” Tang Yun’er’s expression was filled with shock. However, she immediately gave an ‘oh’, and said, “This is the Cold Water Lake, so it’s not strange for there to be a Water Element Crystal inside the palace. It’s not a waste of your ten days of travel.”

Ling Han gave a ‘ha’, drew the little loli into the Essence Nurturing Gourd, and prepared to leave.

He did not say anything about the Origin Gold. It was not that he did not trust the little loli, but rather that the Origin Gold was really too valuable. Tang Yun’er may not have any devious thoughts about it, but what if she let the cat out of the bag, and others found out?

This was a treasure that even Saints would be tempted by. Even if they did not have the means of an Ancestral King, and could not forge it into an Ancestral Weapon, a Saint could still forge it into a Saint Tool. It was enough to be invincible among Saints.

The less people knew about such a secret, the better. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han took a deep breath, then stepped out of the light screen. Instantly, an endless pressure assaulted him, causing even his bones to crackle.

He left.

He quickly floated upwards, and after about ten minutes, a white colour appeared above him.

They were about to reach the peak.

With a splash, Ling Han broke through the water’s surface. It didn’t matter that there was no floating ice. He had already been inspired. His feet quickly stepped on the water’s surface, providing him with buoyancy, allowing him to stand on the water’s surface.

Ling Han determined the direction, and quickly set off.

In only half an hour, he arrived at the shore. Ling Han disguised himself and waited to meet up with the babies.

Coincidentally, three days later would be the agreed time to meet.

Aside from cultivating, Ling Han was also searching for a place where the Heavenly Dao Flame could be found.

There was none on the Moonlight Planet. He had to go to the super large planet, a place that could help an Ancestral King ascend Dao.

Ling Han made some queries of the little loli, and coincidentally, she came from such a great planet.

The problem was, Tang Yun’er didn’t want to return at all.

“I’m not in a hurry either. I’m only at the Enlightenment Tier right now, so even with the help of the Natural Dao Water, it’ll still be difficult for me to escape death if I enter the land of Heavenly Dao Flames. No matter what, I have to advance into the Celestial Path first.”

“All right, I will now calmly concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill, and break through to Celestial Path. I will just pretend that I did not obtain the Origin Gold.”

Three days later, the babies returned one after another. When they found out that Ling Han had already obtained the Water Element Crystal they were naturally happy for him, and this also freed them from their labour. They did not have to search for Water Element creatures every day, which was extremely boring.

“Father, where are we going now?” Second Baby asked.

“We’re going to collect some interest,” Ling Han said calmly.

He had almost been killed by the Pang Clan and Lei Clan, and this vengeance had to be avenged — though it was also because of them that he had obtained the Origin Gold, that was a different matter..
