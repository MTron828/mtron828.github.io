2930 Spar my a*s

The clash between the two great prodigies was a great eye-opener.

It turned out that the number of dimensions that the body of a Heavenly Venerate could contain was not two, but could reach as many as three.

Feng Wuding was also stunned. He had not expected that there would be another that could accomplish the same feat aside from himself.

“Do you think that this is my limit?” he shouted loudly, and the fourth dimensional projection suppressed down.

!!

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!’

At this, everyone’s mouth was gaping as they were completely rendered speechless.

Four dimensions, how was this done?

Meanwhile, Ling Han smiled faintly. Four dimensions, and this just barely had the feeling of a Son of Destiny. However, compared with the tens of thousands of infant dimensions inside his body, this was no big deal.

Limited by the cultivation level, even Ling Han couldn’t possess millions and millions of dimensions. Right now, he only possessed 19 dimensions.

The problem was, what was Feng Wuding’s limit?

Ling Han was a little curious, but was completely unconcerned. He had not come to spar with him, but merely to deliver a beating.

Boom! In a single breath, he channeled another five dimensional projections.

Pu!

Everyone spluttered. There was nothing wrong with their eyes, right? How could they have seen an absolutely impossible feat?

Eight dimensions! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Feng Wuding was instantly suppressed and continuously forced backwards. Even his back was bent under the pressure.

The suppression from eight dimensions was too strong, and even he could not bear it, but in the next instant, he roared furiously, and a majestic power surged out of his body. Weng, weng, weng! A total of 10 dimensions appeared around him.

This was his true trump card10 dimensions, unprecedented in history, a supreme miracle.

Everyone was also dumbfounded. Ling Han was already overwhelmingly strong, possessing eight dimensions, which they didn’t even dare to imagine. However, Feng Wudingwas actually even more freakish, advancing another two steps further from the impossible.

This was the Son of Destiny.

“Suppress!” Feng Wuding charged over with the projections of 10 dimensions, his might unmatched. At the level of Fifth Tier battle prowess, who could stop him?

Ling Han was still silent. He merely clenched his right fist. Weng, weng, weng! Another three dimensional projections were activated, instantly turning the tables.

‘This!’

Everyone couldn’t wrap their head around this. So what if they were Heavenly Venerates? This had instantly broken the iron rule that had existed throughout eternity, so who could still remain calm?

11 dimensionswere you trying to defy the heavens?

The members of the World Alliance were even more stunned because they knew that the number of dimensions that Ling Han truly possessed would have to be increased by one.

Feng Wuding was also rendered speechless. He was favored by the heavens, and there were actually more than 10 dimensions that could be easily accommodated in his body. However, limited by his cultivation level, he presently could only allow 10 of these dimensions to grow.

Though Ling Han only had one more dimension than he did, he was still overwhelmed, and there was no way he could catch up.

Ling Han penetrated deeply, bringing the 11 dimensions, and firmly suppressing Feng Wuding.

Everyone was dumbfounded, and then felt rueful.

A great many people felt a sense of pride. After all, Ling Han was one of their own. Feng Wuding was a remnant of the Genesis World from the last era, and no matter what, he should be considered an outsider. If it were not for Hysteria, they would even have come to blows. After all, the ancient newcomers could also be considered as invaders.

Feng Wuding humphed and didn’t say anything else. He simply continued to exchange blows with Ling Han.

He indeed had one less dimension than Ling Han for suppression, but he was only slightly suppressed, but it was not to the extent that he would be overwhelmed. Hence, he could still bear it.

He was defiant. He had placed his hopes of victory on exhausting Ling Han’s Heavenly Venerable Seals, which would result in his battle prowess dropping drastically.

And he still had another trump card.

His battle prowess was outmatched, so it was inevitable that he would be hit a few times, causing him to feel great pain, and a strong sense of humiliation rose up in him.

He was a supreme prodigy that could surpass his cultivation level and defeat a superior opponent, but now, in a battle of equals, he was actually still being suppressed?

However, two hours were about to pass.

As expected, the light of the seals on Ling Han’s body dimmed one after another, and his battle prowess also ebbed considerably.

“Haha, what is the meaning of background? This is what background means!” Feng Wuding laughed loudly. Boom, another three seals lit up on his body. They, too, were supreme, and could crush all life.

First-grade seals!

Heavens, not only did he have eight first-grade seals, he could even form two sets of combination seals: one set of three and another set of four.

This allowed his battle prowess to increase by more than 170 times; he still maintained the standard of crushing all with Fifth-Tier battle prowess.

Now, how was Ling Han supposed to block this attack?

Everyone shook their head. Who would have thought that Feng Wuding would actually have mastered three first-grade seals, and could even combine them? This kind of battle prowess could sweep aside all with Fifth-Tier battle prowess.

Boom! Feng Wuding’s palm struck towards Ling Han.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and the eighth-grade seals lit up one after another. However, he controlled them, and only channeled half of them so that the increase in battle prowess was only about 500 times.

But was 500 times not enough?

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han completely overwhelmed Feng Wuding, throwing furious punches one after another, and blasting Feng Wuding like he was a scarecrow; he could only be sent flying continuously.

Feng Wuding was completely stupefied. The reason why he could possess eight first-grade seals was because he had obtained them through the inheritance of Genesis World from the last era, but he had already expended one whole set of Ling Han’s ninth-grade combination seals, and he was actually still overwhelmed by Ling Han?

He could not accept this.

Perhaps he couldn’t accept this fact, but it couldn’t change the fact that Ling Han’s battle prowess was overwhelming. Feng Wuding could only be pummeled.

“I forfeit!” he declared reluctantly, but he had even less desire to have Ling Han continue pummeling him like this.

His arrogance did not diminish, and he thought that this was only because his cultivation level was still too low, so he could not make full use of his full advantage as the Son of Destiny. For example, there were a total of 100 dimensional seeds in his body, but now he had only developed 10 of them into dimensions.

...

As long as his cultivation level increased, his ability to battle above his cultivation level could at least be maintained, if not improved. Moreover, everyone knew that once the cultivation level increased, the ability to battle above his cultivation level would definitely decline.

One declined, while the other maintained this ability. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, who would win?

Revenge was a dish best served cold. A man who knew when to yield and when not to yield was a true man.

Peng!

However, he had just finished his words when a heavy punch landed on his face, causing his nose to bleed.

“You!!” Feng Wuding roared loudly. He had already admitted defeat, so why didn’t Ling Han stop? Who would spar like this?

Peng! He suffered another punch.

“You have gone too far!!” Feng Wuding was filled with fury.

“Do you think I have come to spar with you?” Ling Han finally spoke.

“Is that not the case?”

“Wrong, I have come to deliver a beating. There is no difference between you and those nobodies, so don’t think too highly of yourself,” Ling Han said coldly as he continued to throw punches. “What bullsh*t Son of Destiny? Trash!”

...

These words were too hurtful.

Feng Wuding wanted to die. He had a high opinion of himself, and thought that he was the Son of Destiny. No one could compare to him. However, Ling Han didn’t take him seriously at all, and ignored him completely.

This kind of disdain was something that he could not tolerate.
