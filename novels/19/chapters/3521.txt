Chapter 3522 - 3522: Crashing the party

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The purpose of today’s gathering was to build momentum for Hong Tianbu. As for stepping on the Foreign Affairs Department and striking a blow to the pride of Chen Fengyan, that was only something they had done in passing.

However, since Ling Han insisted on coming here to join in on the excitement, then he’d just have to stomp on him.

For this kind of minor character, even if he was trampled to death, no one would take a second look at him.

Lu Haiyuan looked at Ling Han. He was clearly shorter than Ling Han, yet there was a condescending air about him.

This was the general feeling of superiority that those who had come out of prison had. Hehe, they were clearly prisoners themselves, yet were still high and mighty, looking down on the living creatures of this primitive land.

Ling Han looked at Lu Haiyuan, his expression gradually becoming cold, “What did you say?”

“I told you to kneel!” Lu Hai Yuan said disdainfully. In truth, in the prison, even

if a Mystery Realm Tier wanted to kneel down to him, that would have to depend on his mood. Not everyone was qualified to kneel in front of him.

Ling Han looked at Lu Haiyuan, and suddenly exerted force with his feet. Peng, he burst out with astonishing speed, and in an instant, had rushed in front of Lu Haiyuan, delivering a slap.

“How dare you!” Lu Haiyuan smirked coldly, and shot out a punch back at Ling Han. He actually dared to make a move on him; he was really too outrageously

bold.

Weng, Ling Han unleashed a murderous aura attack.

This was formed through the Seventh Change, and even Enlightenment Tier elites would be affected.

LU Haiyuan’s attack instantly faltered. However, since he could be taken as disciple by a Spirit Transformation Tier elite, he naturally couldn’t be an idiot. He came back to his senses in an instant.

However, when elites exchanged blows, could they afford to miss this instant?

Pa, Ling Han’s palm had already descended, and Lu Haiyuan was sent flying.

After drawing an arc in the air, he landed heavily on the ground.

All of a sudden, a dead silence fell.

Just how arrogant had Lu Haiyuan been just now? He did not even take the Imperial Princes to heart, but the Imperial Princes did not dare to do anything to him, because he was the disciple of a Spirit Transformation True Lord.

However, Ling Han paid no heed to this, and directly delivered a slap.

Everyone’s expressions were strange. As expected, Ling Han was still that Ling

Han, fearless of heaven and earth. Previously, he even dared to oppose an elite of the Core Formation Tier, and now, it did not seem to be too hard to understand that he had slapped an Enlightenment Tier.

The problem was, that was the disciple of a Spiritual Transformation Tier elite,

so how could he be so vulnerable?

In truth, Ling Han’s murderous aura attack had caused Lu Haiyuan to go blank for an instant, and then his eye technique had seen through Lu Haiyuan’s attack. These two abilities had been created when he attained Seventh Change.

Thus, this strike had sent Lu Haiyuan flying. It was neither Ling Han’s luck, nor was it that Lu Haiyuan was not strong enough, but rather that Ling Han had practically used his full strength. This was to establish his might, so he naturally could not drag things out.

Lu Haiyuan got back to his feet in a flash. Though there was a large swelling on his face, in truth, he had not sustained any serious injury. He had only been hit with a single strike, and furthermore, it was a direct hit to his face at that, which made him feel incredibly humiliated and furious.

“Ling Han, are you really seeking death?” he said through gritted teeth.

■■Without registering your entry at our Department, who allowed you to stay in the imperial Capital?” Ling Han said calmly. “I’ll give you a chance now.

Immediately kneel down and surrender. Otherwise, I, as the Department Chief, can only expel you.”

Everyone was surprised. Lu Haiyuan was the disciple of a True Lord of Spirit Transformation Tier, and you actually dare to oppose him head-on?

Though Lu Haiyuan’s strength was far from being comparable to the Core Formation Tier, in the case of the Core Formation Tier, Chen Fengyan could still withstand it, but once a Spirit Transformation True Lord appeared, Chen Fengyan could only retreat in defeat.

Otherwise, why would the Imperial Princes have to swallow their anger?

“Ling Han, don’t mess around!” the Eldest Imperial Prince immediately rebuked.

“This is not the time for you to act on impulse!” the Third Imperial Prince also

said.

Right, even the Imperial Princes were opposing Ling Han.

One couldn’t blame them for being despicable. It could only be said that the might of a Spirit Transformation True Lord was really too great.

Everyone shook their heads, and felt a sense of grief. Even Chen Fengyan’s sons were opposing Ling Han. What kind of mockery was this?

Meanwhile, Lu Haiyuan laughed loudly, “Ling Han, don’t you think you are a clown? You have jumped up and down, and in the end, you are nothing but an ugly person that does strange things to attract attention, and is putting on a one-man show.”

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “Doesn’t your face hurt when you say that?”

Lu Haiyuan’s expression changed drastically. This had hit a sore spot.

-You’re seeking death!” he roared, and charged towards Ling Han. This time, he used his divine sense to guard his heart.

Was it useful?

Ling Han unleashed another barrage of murderous aura. Even if Lu Haiyuan was on guard, it was useless. He was still dazed for a moment.

Ling Han raised his hand, and delivered another slap.

After all, he had suffered once, so Lu Haiyuan instinctively lowered his head. However, he was still scraped by the palm strike, leaving a red mark on his forehead. In the end, however, he wasn’t sent flying again.

To Lu Haiyuan, this was still a massive failure, causing his expression to become even uglier.

He had attacked twice, and both times ended in failure. As a disciple of a Spirit Transformation Tier, wasn’t this kind of disciple a joke?

“B@stard!” With a shake of his right hand, a jade-colored Small Tower appeared. It was only seven inches tall, and floated up into the air. It hovered above his head, casting down streaks of jade-colored light.

Lu Haiyuan released a battle cry, and charged out for the third time. This time, he had also used a weapon, a long sword.

Ling Han did the same thing, yet discovered that his opponent’s jade tower actually had the effect of preventing divine sense from invading. His murderous aura attack was declared to have no effect.

This was more like it. Otherwise, it would be too useless. What kind of disciple of a Spirit Transformation Tier would that be?

“Die!” Lu Haiyuan’s sword slashed over, radiating with boundless brilliance, causing even the air in the surroundings to bubble.

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. The sword in his opponent’s hand was a One Star Spirit Tool. If he used his bare fists to parry, perhaps, with the toughness of his Seventh Extreme, he would not suffer too severe a wound, but his skin would definitely break and blood would flow.

This was not worth it.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He brandished his battle hammer. Crackle! Lightning flashed as he charged forward.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The battle hammer and sword clashed, forming a massive collision, bursting forth with a dazzling light, so bright that many people could not open their eyes, and could not look at it directly at all.

This was a very strong opponent, Ling Han thought.

Enlightenment Tier elite added with having the natural talent of a one-star genius in martial arts allowed Lu Haiyuan to possess the ability to sweep aside all other Enlightenment Tier elites, not inferior to Ling Han at all. Previously, he was sent flying with a single strike because he had suffered from the barrage of murderous aura, and not because his abilities were weak.

Now that he was able to unleash his full battle prowess, this was truly terrifying. Even the Imperial Princes were extremely stunned, and thought that if they went up to battle, their chances of victory would be pitifully slim.

Of course, the reason why Lu Haiyuan was able to become Ling Han’s opponent was completely because he was superior to Ling Han by a major tier. Otherwise, what was a one-star geniusworth? It was completely impossible that he would be able to withstand a single blow from Ling Han.

Ling Han activated his Eye Technique, causing the channeling of the world to immediately slow down. Lu Haiyuan’s attacks were analyzed one after another, and he had complete grasped them.

Lu Haiyuan’s situation immediately became dire. His attack patterns had been grasped, and he was completely helpless. Usually, before he had even delivered a single move, he would discover that Ling Han was already waiting for him ahead of him.

How were they supposed to fight like this?

He kept changing his moves, but it was useless. It was as if Ling Han knew him like the back of his hand, and knew everything about him..
