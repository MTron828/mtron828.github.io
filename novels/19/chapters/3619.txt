Chapter 3620: Plan to screw others over

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“How do you plan on getting your revenge?” Tang Yun’er asked. “Let me make things clear first. Don’t expect me to help you. Handsome Brother isn’t cute at

all!”

Ling Han cracked a smile, “I don’t need your help!”

“Yi, you really think you can match a force of the Core Formation Tier?” The little loli appeared very surprised.

Under the suppression of absolute strength, no matter what method Ling Han used, there was no way he could match the Lei Clan and the Pang Clan.

Ling Han wagged his finger, “Little girl, don’t just think about fighting and killing all day long. For someone as smart as me, how could it be that I can only charge up and fight head-on?”

Tang Yun’er instantly looked excited, “Then should we go and start a fire?” Hearing the word ’fire’, the seven babies became excited at the same time. This would be very fun.

Ling Han was speechless. What was going on with kids nowadays?

He shook his head, “I am not going to set a fire.”

“Then how are you going to get your revenge?” Tang Yun’er asked in confusion. Ling Han smiled, took out a Water Element Crystal, and said with a smile, ‘Til sell this Water Element Crystal to the Pang Clan.”

“Handsome Brother, Uncle, has your brain gone muddled?” Tang Yun’er stretched out her small hand and placed it on Ling Han’s forehead. “Strange, it’s not hot. How did he have such a bad fever that it turned him into an idiot?” Ling Han pushed her hand aside in irritation, and asked, “What are you doing?” “Uncle, the Pang Clan originally wanted the Five Elements Crystals to concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill, yet you yourself are delivering the Water Element Crystal to their doorstep. Isn’t that helping them?” Tang Yun’er looked at him as if he were an idiot. “Uncle, the blow you suffered was too heavy.

You’ve gone stupid, haven’t you?”

Ling Han shook his head and said, “The so-called prodigy from the Pang Clan wants to reach the peak, so the Pang Clan definitely won’t reject this Water

Element Crystal.”

“It’S over!” The little loli grabbed her head. This Handsome Brother had already gone mad.

The seven children finally came to their senses. They had been following Ling Han for a very long time, so they naturally had a deep understanding of Ling Han’s personality.

“Father, are you planning to tamper with this Water Element Crystal?” Eldest Baby asked.

The Second Baby clapped her hands, and said, “When the Pang Clan gathers the Five Elements Crystals and refines them into the Five Elements Karmic Pill, it will be ingested by that idiot from the Pang Clan. Not only will they be unable to push away the shackles in their bodies, but they’ll also be in big trouble. -When Father reveals his identity, the Pang Clan will definitely be angered to death if they find out that they were tricked by Father,” the invisible Sixth Baby said.

“Father is indeed good at screwing people over!” the proud Third Baby concluded.

Ling Han laughed loudly. That was indeed what he was thinking.

Tang Yun’er felt extremely gloomy. Her intelligence was even inferior to a baby’s now? How was she supposed to be the big sister of these babies in the future?

“Ling Han, how are you going to do something to the Water Element Crystal? Do you think that the members of the Pang Clan don’t know to examine it?” she said, dampening his enthusiasm.

This was a problem.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I already have an idea, but I don’t know if it’ll work.”

He wanted to inject Destructive Energy into the Water Element Crystal, but with his own willpower enveloping it, it would not immediately explode, right until when they were concocting the Five Elements Karmic Pill. Destructive Energy would surge out, and directly destroy the alchemical pill.

Of course, it would be even better if he could give some fake medicine to that prodigy from the Pang Clan.

in the next few days, Ling Han studied the Water Element Crystal as he rushed to the ancestral grounds of the Pang Clan. What kind of method should he use? This Water Element Crystal was no different from a drop of water, but the condensing power was very strong, so it would not shatter. However, it was not appropriate to shatter it either. Once it was broken, though it could still condense, it would lose a large amount of essence, which would affect the effects of the pill.

Have some essence disperse?

No, this could be seen clearly from the outside. If he did something like this, the Pang Clan would definitely discover it.

“Or can I concoct a drop of medicine that can perfectly fuse with the Water Element Crystal?”

Thoughts streaked through Ling Han’s mind. Injecting Destructive Energy into it was his final move. He would only take this step if all other methods were useless. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He began to rummage through his information. With his skill as a Grandmaster of alchemy, there was still hope that he could concoct such a medicinal potion.

Thus, he stopped in a small city for two days, and successfully concocted a drop of liquid.

“Condensation Fluid can extend the time taken to concoct alchemical pills. It’s originally used in alchemy, but adding Condensation Fluid in inappropriate situations will ruin the effects of alchemy.”

“I used another three methods to fuse it together with the Water Element Crystal. Even if it is cut open and studied carefully, without profound alchemy abilities, it would be impossible to tell.”

“Hehe, this is a lesson for you all. Don’t ever offend an alchemist.

A satisfied smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. He had already fused the Condensation Fluid into the Water Element Crystal. Next, he would have to deal with how he was going to sell it to the Pang Clan.

This was incredibly simple.

Ling Han arrived at Azure Spirit City. This was where the ancestral grounds of the Pang Clan were located, and in this Azure Spirit City, the Pang Clan was also the absolute ruler.

After changing his appearance, Ling Han went to the local auction house, took out that Water Element Crystal, and expressed that he wanted to auction it off. This naturally caused a great commotion on the auction house’s side. That was the Water Element Crystal. An ordinary Mystery Realm Tier would have to spend several hundred years to condense it, and they would have to ensure that they did not die. They could only obtain it if they stayed in Cold Water Lake and did not come out. How valuable was that?

Elites above Celestial Path naturally did not take it to heart at all, but to Mystery Realm Tiers, this was incredibly precious. It could open even more shackles, and allow one to rush up to the limits of the mortal level.

Especially for prodigies, this was indescribably precious. Unfortunately, there was only one Water Element Crystal. If there were other Five Elements Crystals, then if they were sold together, the price could be raised even higher.

The auction house immediately announced that they would begin the auction as soon as possible, using this Water Element Crystal as the climax item. Ling Han waited in the city for two days, and someone from the Pang Clan came to look for him.

This was a middle-aged man. He directly barged into the courtyard that Ling Han had reserved, his expression filled with arrogance.

■’Brat, I heard that you are auctioning a Water Element Crystal.” He looked down on Ling Han, “Go and cancel the auction. I want it.” Ling Han had long since drawn the seven babies and Tang Yun’er into the Essence Nurturing Gourd to avoid exposing his identity. He deliberately looked confused, and said, “Sir, if you need the Water Element Crystal, you can go and participate in the auction. As long as you have enough wealth, you can naturally purchase it.”

“So you don’t want to sell it to me?” the middle-aged man asked coldly. Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’ve already handed it over to the auction house for auction. If it’s suddenly canceled, won’t I become a person who goes back on his word?”

“Do you know who I am?” the middle-aged man asked coldly.

■You must be a dog of the Pang Clan. Otherwise, why would you be so arrogant?’ Ling Han thought to himself, but a dazed expression appeared on his face, “Who are you?”

“My name is Pang Li, that Pang from the Pang Clan,” the middle-aged man said proudly.

Ling Han smirked coldly in his mind. This was merely a Mystery Realm Tier, so what was there to be arrogant about?

However, this made sense. Even if the Pang Clan was a force of Core Formation Tier, elites of the Celestial Path were not so common that they could be found all over the place. Most of the clansmen would still be cultivators of the mortal level.

He smiled and said, “So you’re a member of the Pang Clan. Sorry for the disrespect. However, I’ll still say the same thing. I can’t be a person who goes back on my word..”
