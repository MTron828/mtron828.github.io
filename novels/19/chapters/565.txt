Chapter 566: Bone Sword

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han made a hooking motion with his finger, and said, “Bring it on!”

“As you wish!” Tian Xiu Ning let out a battle cry and controlled the five Corpse Soldiers to attack Ling Han. When the five corpses pounced at Ling Han, covering his entire figure, everyone began to shake their heads; this youngster was obviously dead for sure.

This wasn’t the first person to die today, and wouldn’t be the last, so everyone didn’t take it to heart; who would care about a person who wasn’t a well-known figure?

However, the scene that followed made them dumbstruck.

Ling Han’s figure was actually extremely slick, wandering freely within the enclosing attacks of the five Corpse Soldiers. He would block with his hand the attacks that really couldn’t be dodged, and with a flicker of golden light, the Corpse Soldier that assaulted him would be jolted back.

“How’s it possible!?”

“Isn’t this guy only in the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier? How can his strength be so terrifying?”

“Those Corpse Soldiers are about fourteen stars in battle prowess, right?”

“Definitely fourteen stars! But this boy can parry it just by waving his hands casually. Such power is too terrifying.”

“A genius, absolutely a genius!”

“Definitely no inferior to Xuanyuan Zi Guang and Yao Hui Yue!”

The face of the experienced old man from earlier twitched. In a short while, three super geniuses ran out, slapping him fiercely on the face; he wished there was a large hole in the ground for him to worm into.

“You do have some strength.” Tian Xiu Ning smiled grimly and joined the battle.

The weapon he used was a bone sword. Judging by the shape of it, it looked like it was made from a large-sized beast’s polished femur. On top of it were vein-like patterns that were definitely naturally formed.

Once activated, the vein-like patterns shone and linked together, unleashing an astounding ray of light.

It was as if Ling Han saw a massive beast floating on top of the blade, and the terrifying size of the beast seemed to be able to overwhelm even heaven and earth. His eyes lit up involuntarily as he said, “This was refined by extracting the femur of Ba Xia, right?”

According to the legends, the true dragon had nine offspring, but each one was different because they were conceived with different beasts and each offspring only inherited part of the true dragon bloodline. Ba Xia was one of them. Its shape was like a fish, and its head was like a lion’s. Yet, it grew a pair of horns and its entire body was covered with dragon scales.

Even if it only had a trace of the true dragon bloodline, the true dragon was the leader of all beasts in the world. It could be seen that its status towered above the masses and possessing a shred of true dragon’s bloodline was extremely remarkable and very hard to come by.

Tian Xiu Ning revealed an astounded look, and said, “You actually recognize this sword?” He only learned of the legend of Ba Xia after being bestowed with the sword. However, the Ba Xia’s bloodline was even more diluted, or else it would really be the dragon’s son; it couldn’t possibly be killed so easily and have its femur extracted and made into a sword.

“The bloodline is thinned and the vein-like patterns are mixed, nothing much to it.” Ling Han made another evaluation.

Instantly, Tian Xiu Ning’s nose twisted in anger; you were shocked at first, but went on with, “nothing much to it”?! How could he possibly accept this. He snorted, and said, “Its more than enough to kill you!”

He waved his sword and slashed at Ling Han. This bone sword was made from the femur of a descendant of a divine beast and refined by adding several precious ingredients; it could be called outstanding amongst sixth tier Spirit Tools. With this strike, a massive phantom image of a beast surfaced immediately, pouncing towards Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “This sword’s not bad, I’m taking it!” The Demon Birth Sword couldn’t be displayed randomly, so replacing it with this word wasn’t a bad idea.

“Impudence!” Tian Xiu Ning was furious. This guy was too arrogant, actually viewing him as nothing?

Ling Han carried out the Demon Fairy Step, arriving directly before Tian Xiu Ning and attacking with both fists repeatedly.

The five Corpse Soldiers became decorations; roaring angrily, they charged back, chasing behind Ling Han.

Now, it became a head-on fight between Tian Xiu Ning and Ling Han. The former wasn’t terrified, waving his sword while nine flashes of Sword Qi formed; under the blessing of the bone sword, each flash of Sword Qi became a terrifying silk two meters long, slashing towards Ling Han.

Ling Han obviously wouldn’t fear it, directly brandishing his fists in counterattack.

Peng, peng, peng, peng , these flashes of Sword Qi were instantly demolished.

Seeing this scene, everyone covered their heads and cried out.

This was too inconceivable. The nine flashes of Sword Qi were all set off by the bone sword, and their sharpness was equivalent to the sword’s; this was the reason why everyone sought a first-class Spirit Tool.

However, Ling Han shattered the Sword Qi with a single punch, and his fist actually wasn’t injured at all. Was that still a body of flesh and blood?

Tian Xiu Ning was also shocked. He originally thought that Ling Han blocking with his fists head-on would cause blood to splatter across the skies, but never would he have thought not a damn thing happened! He couldn’t help but doubt the bone sword in his hand, was this truly refined from the bone of the leftover species of a divine beast?

“No need to doubt. This is because my fists are harder!” Ling Han said, smiling. He cultivated Indestructible Heaven’s scroll, and if he truly attained the Diamond Tier Body, his physique would definitely be tougher than a true dragon’s.

Now, though he was at the Iron Sheet Tier, the opponent’s bone sword was only refined from the bone of a distant descendant of the Ba Xia that couldn’t be considered even a divine beast’s child, so how could it possibly harm him?

To threaten his sixth tier Iron Sheet Body, a seventh tier Spirit Tool had to be used.

While talking, Ling Han brandished both fists repeatedly, forcing Tian Xiu Ning to retreat.

It was very interesting. Tian Xiu Ning retreated and Ling Han chased, while five Corpse Soldiers were behind, forcibly turning this ganging-up into a one-on-one fight and chase. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Haha, this youngster discovered the Corpse Soldiers’ greatest weakness.” Atop the city will, someone clapped and laughed.

“That’s right. Corpse Soldiers’ weakness is that they’re not fast enough. After all, they’re just a corpse, and can’t execute movement arts.”

“However, simply unleashing their power, they are equivalent to someone in the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, and there aren’t many that can surpass them in speed.”

“This youngster’s movement art is out of the ordinary.”

Many things were actually easily exposed, but even if they were thoroughly clear, there might not be people able to accomplish them. None knew the weight of another’s burden; if one were to personally take it up, one might only be able to groan.

Tian Xiu Ning was shocked. In this way, the five Corpse Soldiers were practically useless, and he now faced Ling Han alone! The majority of Thousand Corpse Sect’s battle prowess came from corpses, and if they couldn’t be brought into paly, their personal strength obviously decreased greatly.

He was actually quite extraordinary, having the cultivation of the eighth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier and battle prowess reaching even fifteen stars, which was enough to look down upon people of the same age. However, he encountered a freak like Ling Han, so he could only be miserable.

Ancient bone patterns accumulated on Ling Han’s fists. Close combat was now his forte, and as the power of physical cultivation burst forth, it was not much different from Origin Power. Each fist shot out like it was driving piles.

Only physical cultivators could attack so quickly, and when Origin Power cultivators couldn’t keep up in endurance, they could only put more effort on Qi, replacing speed with quantity.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

With a hundred consecutive punches, the bone sword in Tian Xiu Ning’s hand instantly slipped out, and Ling Han reached out to grab it.

“Give it back!” Tian Xiu Ning hurriedly shouted. This was a treasure that the lord sect master personally bestowed on him.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It’s a waste of this Spirit Tool to leave it in your hands!” He turned around and stared at the five Corpse Soldiers that charged over.
