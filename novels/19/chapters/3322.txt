Chapter 3323: Slaying another beast

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the outside world, everyone was still engaged in heated discussions about how Ling Han had been chased into fleeing by that Third Extreme goat yesterday. They hadn’t seen any sign of Ling Han for almost a day. This guy couldn’t have been severely injured, right?

Hong Tianliang was no longer in the mood to compete, and his credits had never changed. He had even fallen to fifth place, and the second place holder was only a few digits away from Ling Han. As long as he killed another Demonic Beast, he would be able to completely surpass Ling Han. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Could it be that both the top two were going to withdraw from the stage in a dramatic manner?

Right at this moment, everyone saw Ling Han appear on the screen again.

“Here he is, here he is again.”

“Yi, this guy looks a little different.”

“Hiss, look at his Qi and blood!”

Everyone shockingly discovered that Ling Han’s Qi and blood was extremely unstable. Furthermore, there was black in the purple, and it was obvious that he had just broken through.

“Heavens, he has broken through to Second Change!” Someone finally discovered.

“What, has this guy gone mad? He actually broke through here?”

“To forcefully break through like this, to say nothing of the dangerous environment here, how could he possibly bring Treasured Fruits to maintain vitality with him? Isn’t that just courting death?”

“This guy is really putting his life on the line. Looking at the path he is taking, he clearly wants to find that Third Extreme Demonic Goat again.”

“In order to win, this guy doesn’t even care about his life.”

“Sigh, what’s the point of doing this? If one’s foundations are damaged, would there still be any future to speak of?”

“After all, he’s a person who came from the rurals. For the sake of immediate benefits, he neglected the big picture, so it’s actually understandable.”

“Forget it. There is no need to pay attention to this person in the future. There’s already no future to speak of. Soon, he will be surpassed by others.”

“To say nothing of being the second Hong Tianbu, he’s not worthy at all!”

Though that was what they said, they were still watching as Ling Han challenged that Demonic Goat.

“Yi, Ling Han used another mysterious Spirit Tool.”

“I can’t see clearly at all. I can only see a flash of light.”

“The demonic goat has been shot in a vital point.”

“It has been hit again.”

“Heavens, that Demonic Goat has fallen.”

Everyone wanted to grab their heads and exclaim in shock. ‘You advanced a minor level in cultivation level, and even increased the upper limit of beating an Extreme Bone Tier by a whole level?

How could such a thing happen?

It should be known that when an Extreme Bone Tier elite increased their cultivation level by a minor level, how could the increase in battle prowess from this compare to the increase in battle prowess obtained when a Blood Transformation Tier advances by a minor level?

However, Ling Han overturned everyone’s understanding and created a miracle.

“I have to say, though this brat’s future is already bleak, he can still possess the battle prowess of Extreme Bone Tier. No matter what, he can still be considered a somebody in the future,” someone mused ruefully.

“Heh, in the Imperial Capital, what are Extreme Bone Tier elites worth?” someone immediately scoffed.

In a short while, Ling Han’s credits refreshed, adding another 500 points all of a sudden.

There was only less than half a day left until the deadline of three days. He was sure that no matter how hard the second place holder tried, he would not be able to obtain 500 credits. Thus, the outcome was already decided.

On the other side, Ling Han also began to clean up the mess.

He had just broken through, and the upper limit of his physical power had also been lifted. He just happened to need this kind of high-energy meat to nourish himself.

Roasted whole lamb!

This Demonic Goat was very big, and was comparable to the size of a fierce tiger. Roasting it was very time-consuming, and Ling Han couldn’t help but reminisce about the time when he was still in the Genesis World, when he could easily ignite divine flames with a casual press of his hand. Roasting a goat was a piece of cake.

After two hours, this demonic goat was finally roasted, its fragrance wafting in all directions.

Ling Han’s appetite was stirred, and he immediately began wolfing down the food.

His appetite was shockingly huge now. After eating madly for half an hour, only a small half of this demonic goat was left.

Finding a blind spot in the surveillance, Ling Han put away the remaining mutton, then began to rush back.

He was definitely going to get first place, so he could naturally go back the way he came.

However, halfway there, the sun just happened to rise, so he naturally stopped, and began to cultivate first.

He did not absorb a sliver of Purple Qi. Looks like merely cultivating in the wilderness and mountains was not enough. He still had to go to specific places.

Half an hour later, he continued on his way.

Before he had even walked out of the hunting grounds, the three-day deadline had already arrived. The optical computer sent out a notification, informing everyone that the hunt had already ended. The credits leaderboard was locked in, and no matter how much they hunted, they would not be able to obtain an increase in marks.

Ling Han walked all the way out, and gradually saw some people. They were all heading towards the exit.

“Ling Han!” Xuanyuan Dingguo leaped over and punched Ling Han in the chest, saying, “Brat, you’re truly hiding your strength. You managed to get first place without making a sound.”

Ling Han smiled faintly, “I was just lucky.”

“Luck your head. Killing three Extreme Bone Tier Demonic Beasts is called luck?” Xuanyuan Dingguo mocked. “Although I also have a Spirit Tool, it can only rival First Extreme at most. It’s difficult to suppress one, let alone kill it.”

“I’m cheering for you, work hard.” Ling Han patted his shoulder.

“You’re blatantly showing off!” Xuanyuan Dingguo pointed out. However, he wasn’t overly jealous.

Though he had not gotten the chance to receive personal guidance from the Holy Emperor, his old man was still an elite of Inscription Tier, after all, and that was enough to guide him to Extreme Bone Tier. On the other hand, forming a friendship with a freak like Ling Han could possibly bring him endless help in future.

Perhaps it would allow him to stand out from the rest of the Xuanyuan Clan.

The two of them walked side by side. When they arrived at the plaza, they saw that one third of the people had already returned, and on the high platform, the Holy Emperor, Chen Fengyan, Grand Tutor Hong, and the Council Chairman, Yang Bai, were already waiting there.

Everyone entered the plaza and obediently stood there, waiting for Chen Fengyan to personally announce the results of the competition.

After another half an hour, Chen Fengyan stood up and said, “I hereby announce that the champion of this hunting competition is… Ling Han!”

Although everyone already knew this result, hearing it from Chen Fengyan’s mouth still caused their hearts to shudder.

Pa, pa, pa! Grand Tutor Hong and Yang Bai were the first to applaud.

Even the two of them were clapping, so who would dare not follow suit?

Instantly, a round of applause rang out in the plaza.

The Holy Emperor personally announced this, and Grand Tutor Hong and the Council Chairman took the lead in applauding. Just how exciting was this?

Quite a number of people were thinking that they would definitely work hard next year, and also become a glorious figure like Ling Han.

Chen Fengyan pressed his hands down, signaling for everyone to stop clapping, and said, “I am very gratified. You all—”

He had just started, when he suddenly stopped, and raised his head to look at the sky in the west.

Everyone was at a loss. What was wrong with the Holy Emperor?

They couldn’t help but look over as well, but the sky in the west was completely clear. There was not a single dark cloud, nor was there a single bird.

What was the Holy Emperor looking at?

“Your Majesty!” Grand Tutor Hong walked over and called out softly. He couldn’t just leave everyone hanging, right?

Chen Fengyan waved his hand, and Grand Tutor Hong immediately shut up obediently.

In the Dark North Nation, Chen Fengyan possessed supreme authority. Everyone could only listen obediently to him.

After a while, xiu, a figure shot over from the distance. With a flash, he had covered more than three hundred meters, his speed astonishingly fast.

It had to be four times the speed of sound, right?

Xiu, this figure leaped over, and landed on the high platform.

All the guards drew their sabers at the same time. Who would be so bold, to actually dare challenge the Holy Emperor’s authority?

‘Your Majesty!” The person clasped his hands in greeting towards Chen Fengyan.

“General Hengtian!” Everyone exclaimed in shock. This person was actually General Hengtian, one of the Four Great Generals.

However, this was a top-notch elite only inferior to the Holy Emperor, and he was actually riddled with wounds, that dripped with blood.

What had happened?
