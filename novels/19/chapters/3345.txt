Chapter 3346: SteppingOut

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After enduring for so long, this basement finally couldn’t hold on any longer.

Boom, the whole arena collapsed, filled with dispersing dust.

Peng, peng, peng! However, the elites immediately exploded one after another, tearing through the ruins and charging out.

Those who dared to stay here all this while were at least elites of the Blood Transformation and Extreme Bone Tiers. It would not be a problem for them to break through the ruins and leave.

However, now that the underground arena had collapsed, the entire street was in an unbelievable state. At least, it affected half the street, and there were also cars that just happened to pass by. Unfortunately, they had fallen into the pit. Thankfully, they had only fallen in, and had not been buried.

Hu Sihai and the others naturally rushed out. Their eyes swept over the surroundings, looking for Ling Han’s whereabouts.

However, it was as if Ling Han had disappeared. He couldn’t be found no matter how hard he tried.

This was natural. Ling Han’s mask had fallen off in the process of breaking out, and everyone’s clothes were more or less the same, so how could they possibly recognize him with a single look?

“Where’s that human, come out!” Hu Sihai shouted loudly. The might of Inscription Tier spread out; he was very overbearing.

The reason why he had defeated Ling Han was naturally to redeem the reputation of the Demon Race, but he was still coveting the technique of the Demon Race that Ling Han possessed. He had a feeling that if he could obtain it, he may be able to become the Great Saint of the Demon Race in future.

Thus, he definitely had to find Ling Han and snatch the secret technique.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. Since these people from the Demon Race didn’t recognize him, he might as well not step out.

He wasn’t an idiot. At the moment, he definitely couldn’t rival Inscription Tier elites.

He was confident, but he was definitely not arrogant. To surpass two major cultivation levels so easily?

If he could win, that would really be abnormal.

He had already done enough. He had defeated four elites of the Demon Race in a row, and there were even two elites of Extreme Bone Tier among them.

That was enough. Now, this responsibility would be left to Yang Bai and Grand

Tutor Hong.

Even if he could really defeat Hu Sihai, then if the Imperial Prince in the Enlightenment Tier came, would it still be needed for him to make a move? “You’re not coming out?” Hu Sihai smirked coldly, “Then I will begin to kill, right until you come out!”

Everyone couldn’t help but feel furious and shocked. This Demon Race was really vicious and merciless. Furthermore, this was the Imperial Capital, so how dare you?

However, Hu Sihai was an Inscription Tier elite, and only Yang Bai and Grand Tutor Hong could rival him in the Imperial Capital. If these two didn’t arrive, how could they block him? Moreover, above this demonic tiger was an Imperial Prince in the Enlightenment Tier, and that was the most terrifying thing.

“Do you think I don’t dare?” Hu Sihai’s eyes swept over, focusing on Xuanyuan Dingguo. This was a person who had come with Ling Han. Since Ling Han had disappeared, he would make an example of this person.

Xuanyuan Dingguo’s expression changed drastically, and he said, “I’m General Xuanyuan’s son. If you dare to touch me, my father will definitely kill you!”

“I’m about to laugh myself to death. He’s only at the Inscription Tier and is at the same cultivation level as me.” Hu Sihai laughed loudly. “In a battle of equal cultivation levels, who can defeat me?”

He said this with soaring confidence.

“That human, are you coming out or not?” Hu Sihai continued, “If you still don’t come out on the count of three, you will be preparing to collect the body of your friend!”

“One!”

“Don’t come out!” Xuanyuan Dingguo roared. He was General Xuanyuan’s son, so he still had some backbone. He glared furiously at Hu Sihai, and said, “The Holy Emperor will come out of seclusion, just you wait!”

-Two!” Hu Sihai was unmoved. A mere Enlightenment Tier cultivator could be suppressed by the Fifth Prince alone.

Ling Han sighed. He naturally couldn’t stand by and watch as Xuanyuan Dingguo was killed. He immediately leaped out and said, “Kitty, can’t you be a little more promising?”

“Ling Han!”

“It’s actually Ling Han!”

“So that person is Ling Han!”

“As expected of the second Hong Tianbu. He even knows formation techniques!”

“It’s a pity that he forcibly broke through in the hunting competition. Without the Treasured Fruit of Life to compensate for his life force, he would only be able to reach the Fifth Change of Blood Transformation Tier at most. It would be impossible for him to advance any further.”

“Hmph, he dared to step out and fight with the Demon Race. Even if his future cultivation level drops to Meridian Opening Tier, I’d still be just as impressed of him!”

“I am impressed too!”

Everyone said one after another. Some looked down on Ling Han, while others were very impressed, and thought that Ling Han was a real man just now, since he was able to step out, and to defeat four elites of the Demon Race, that was a man among men.

Hu Sihai looked over, and couldn’t help but sneer, “So you are Ling Han!”

“That’s right, it’s your Grandpa Ling.” Ling Han didn’t hold back at all. He didn’t need to give these animals any face.

“How many moves can you block from me?” Hu Sihai’s expression was filled with disdain, as he walked step by step towards Ling Han.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

With every step, a loud sound was heard, as if it was pounding on one’s heart.

He was deliberately putting pressure on Ling Han.

Ling Han took a deep breath. His current state couldn’t be considered good at all. He had been poisoned, and he had also used up his boiling of blood and Qi. How was he supposed to resist an Inscription Tier elite?

-If you can take a single blow from me, I will spare your life!” Hu Sihai laughed loudly, completely unconcerned that this was the Imperial Capital of the Human Race, and not the territory of the Demon Race. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“If you can withstand a single strike from me, I will spare your life.” An extremely calm voice rang out, yet it was enough to cause one’s heart to waver. “Brother!” Hong Tianliang immediately called out, filled with pleasant surprise.

Brother? Hong Tianliang’s older brother… Hong Tianbu!

That overwhelming freakish freak?

Even Hu Sihai showed a hint of seriousness. In these few days, he had heard the name of Hong Tianbu who knew how many times. At first, he had thought that it was because the scope of the human race was too low, and any one of the stronger ones would be crowned with the title of overwhelming freak. However, after witnessing Ling Han’s strength just now, he had a much higher opinion of Hong Tianbu.

“Hong Tianbu!” Everyone looked around. Many had only heard of Hong Tianbu’s name, but had never seen this person before.

A man in white strode over. The moonlight was like water, shining on him, exuding a clear brilliance.

This seemed to be a handsome man that shouldn’t exist in the world. He was gentle and refined, without the slightest bit of temper, making one feel ethereal just by looking at him. In fact, he was floating like a celestial.

Hong Tianbu the freakish genius, gifted in both martial arts and formations, a talent rarely seen in a hundred years, or even a thousand years.

“Hong Tianbu?” Hu Sihai looked over, his eyes slightly cold.

He had the name of a man, but a towering figure like a tree. Hong Tianbu’s reputation was like the sun in the midday sky right now, so he had no choice but to treat him seriously.

Moreover, he had a strong feeling that this man who was walking over was extremely terrifying. Even he felt a coldness that he did not want to face.

Hiss, he hadn’t even made a move, and just by walking over, he already had such might. Just how strong was this Hong Tianbu?

■The mere Demon Race dares to challenge the orthodox line of the Human Race?” Hong Tianbu said in a calm voice.

These words instantly ignited everyone’s emotions. This vented their anger and boosted morale.

Hu Sihai instantly flew into a thunderous rage. It was one thing for him to be wary of Hong Tianbu, but now that this was a battle that involved the overall power of the Human Race and the Demon Race, he definitely could not show weakness.

“Hong Tianbu, your boasting is too exaggerated.. You have no idea how many powerful prodigies there are in our Demon Race!” he said coldly, “You, are nothing at all!”
