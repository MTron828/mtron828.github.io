Monkey

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Little kitty, if you don’t fight, I’ll take it that you admit defeat.”

Hu Sihai naturally wouldn’t admit defeat. With a loud roar, he pounced towards Ling Han.

Swish, swish, swish! He waved his claws at high speed, leaving claw marks that were wrapped in black energy and had astonishing destructive power.

Ling Han activated Floating Wind and Clouds, and his feet could move freely. His fists similarly blasted out successively, striking out golden fist imprints.

On the other hand, he also moved the surrounding rubble, striking them out at an astonishing speed.

Although this could not be compared to the destructive power of the flying swords, the advantage was that there were enough of them. There was an endless supply of materials.

Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! These rocks hit Hu Sihai’s body and shattered into pieces. However, they did not cause much damage to Hu Sihai.

Even so, Hu Sihai’s body was still staggering from the impact, and his attack was no longer in shape.

“Ah ah ah!” Hu Sihai roared towards the sky. He had never felt so aggrieved before. He clearly had the advantage in power, but he was being suppressed and beaten.

A ferocious glint flashed across his eyes. “Human, you forced me to do this!”

Hong, he emitted a terrifying might. He was originally standing, but now, he was prostrating on the ground like a ferocious tiger.

Pa, pa, pa! The clothes on his body tore apart, and a huge tiger really appeared.

He had returned to his original form.

These Demon Race had all eaten the Transformation Fruit before transforming into human forms. However, as long as they were willing, they could return to their original forms at any time.

In fact, this was their most powerful combat form.

However, Hu Sihai was clearly a spotted tiger, but his body was emitting a white glow, making him look like a white tiger.

“So the legend is true. Hu Sihai has a trace of the bloodline of the White Tiger Divine Beast!”

“Although it’s only a trace, the white tiger is a terrifying existence. A trace of his bloodline is enough to make his battle prowess extremely terrifying.”

Many Demon Race members exclaimed. They had thought that Hu Sihai’s possession of the white tiger bloodline was just a rumor, but they did not expect it to be true.

“This white tiger bloodline is too thin. It will take at least a few years to recover after using it once.” Someone was sharp-eyed and quickly saw through it.

“No wonder Hu Sihai never activated his bloodline in battle. It’s because this is a trump card among trump cards. It takes several years to use it once.”

“It can only be used once every few years. Hu Sihai’s outburst is definitely terrifying.”

“For the dignity of the Demon Race, he has to fight with all his might!”

“Yes, this is for the dignity of our Demon Race!”

Amidst the discussions of the Demon Race, Hu Sihai suddenly let out a roar. His voice rumbled like thunder, and many people felt a rumbling in their ears. They lost consciousness and fainted.

This was the might of an Inscription Tier elite, and he had even activated the bloodline of a Primitive Age Divine Beast. The might of a roar was something that even Extreme Bone Tier elites would find difficult to withstand.

Ling Han was astounded. He had not expected Hu Sihai to have such a move.

Why didn’t he use it when he fought against Hong Tianbu?

Yes, when he was fighting against Hong Tianbu, Hu Sihai’s strength was too weak. Even if he used this move, it would probably be useless. Furthermore, it did not involve the issue of the dignity of the two races at that time, so he did not need to go all out.

This time was different. He had the advantage in cultivation level, and he was fighting for the dignity of the Demon Race. If he lost to Ling Han, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was a sinner of the Demon Race—if he didn’t use his ultimate move in the future, if others found out in the future, he would definitely be condemned by everyone.

Therefore, Hu Sihai had to put everything on the line.

Then let’s see what’s so special about the white tiger bloodline.

Hu Sihai roared continuously. With every roar, the aura he emitted became more violent. Gradually, the phantom of a white tiger appeared behind him. It could not be seen clearly, but it gave people a feeling that it was billions of metres long.

“Ling Han, in front of the radiance of my distant ancestor, you are nothing!” Hu Sihai said. He waved his claws at Ling Han, and with a swish, the white tiger phantom pounced towards Ling Han.

It was too terrifying. The white tiger was a legendary Divine Beast. Even a blurry phantom was incomparably powerful.

Ling Han did not dare to be careless. With a light shout, he channeled the Demonic Monkey Fists. A murderous aura surged, and a Primitive Age Demonic Monkey also appeared.

A strange scene appeared. Although this Demonic Monkey was originally filled with hostility, it lacked agility. However, when it saw this white tiger, it suddenly became lively. A set of golden Battle Armor appeared on its body, and a rod appeared in its hand. It was impossible to see what material it was made of, but there were incomparably complicated symbols on it.

It stood there with its feet on the ground and its head in the sky. The iron rod seemed to be capable of flipping the sky with a light move!

Not only that, but the white tiger phantom also became real. Its body was really hundreds of thousands of metres long, even larger than the sun, filling the sky.

The two phantoms, the tiger and the monkey, stood facing each other as if they had traveled through time and space.

“This is… this is…” Princess Bixiao immediately became incomparably excited. She was originally sitting, but now, she suddenly stood up. Her hands were tightly clenched, and her delicate body was trembling slightly.

“Eh, there’s actually a connection that transcends space and time?” Sixth Baby said in surprise. Although her cultivation level was not high, she was an innate divine power and was proficient in spatial secret techniques. She was very sensitive to space.

“I can sense a supreme will appearing here from the endlessly distant space-time. No, it’s two!”

“Don’t tell me that the monkey and the Primitive Age White Tiger who created this fist technique are still alive!”

“Tens of millions of years have passed. No existence can still live!”

“Yes, although these two willpowers are supreme, they are extremely weak. It should be because the white tiger and the Demonic Monkey were too powerful back then. They were engraved with dao marks by the heaven and earth. Now that bloodline has encountered a secret technique, the heaven and earth are reacting.”

“That must be it.”

Sixth Baby nodded as if she wanted to convince herself.

The Demonic Monkey suddenly moved. It raised the iron rod and struck at the white tiger.

The white tiger met it head-on and swung its claws at the iron rod.

It was clearly just a phantom, but when the tiger claw and the iron rod collided, a terrifying murderous aura impacted. Peng, peng, peng, peng! Everyone fell to the ground.

Except for three people.

Ling Han, Princess Bixiao, and… Sixth Baby! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

A faint yellow halo appeared on Princess Bixiao’s body and condensed into the form of a monkey. It looked somewhat similar to the Demonic Monkey in the sky.

She was able to withstand the impact of this murderous aura, not because she had Mystery Realm Tier cultivation, but because of this halo.

Ling Han, on the other hand, was completely different. In the millions and millions of dimensions in his body, every living being had their own will. This willpower was naturally nothing, but when the countless living beings in the millions and millions of dimensions were added together, it was powerful enough to resist the impact of the murderous aura.

As for Sixth Baby?

She was not in this time and space at all, so how could she be affected?
