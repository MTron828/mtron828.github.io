3085 Regret or no regret?

Ling Han actually made a move, and stopped Extermination from committing murder.

If Extermination wanted to kill Lin Luo and the others, then it was naturally not strange for Ling Han to make a move, but why did he want to save Shatter Mountains and the others?

This scene was truly confusing and inconceivable.

“You dare to stop me?” Extermination said balefully, flames flickering in her eyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “I’m going to kill these four people with my own hands. I’m already quite displeased that you have killed one of them, and you still want to do it again?”

Extermination was furious. Her black hair stood on ends. She had hated Chong Yan and the others for as long as 3,000 epochs. What kind of deep hatred was this?

Now that her cultivation had reached the peak, and she had tricked Chong Yan’s group of five miserably, the climax was naturally to kill all five of them one by one at this moment and obtain a perfect revenge.

But she was stopped by someone after killing only Chong Yan?

She was extremely displeased and furious.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll kill you first!” Extermination shouted, and charged towards Ling Han.

Ling Han attacked, and exchanged blows with Extermination.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The intense battle started again. Currently, the strength of these two persons had already reached a level that even those at the peak of the Seventh Tier could not hope to catch up to; a single ripple of energy could not only send Seventh Tiers flying, but also cause them to vomit blood endlessly.

Even Hysteria couldn’t withstand it, and had no choice but to retreat under the surging energy waves. However, it was too powerful, and the energy waves alone couldn’t injure it.

“You’re actually this strong as well?” Extermination was shocked. She had originally thought that after absorbing all the energy in the Void, she would be able to crush any existence. She did not expect that Ling Han was actually not any weaker than her.

‘How is this possible?!’

It had to be known that only after she had obtained the golden sphere, which was the complete secret code of life, had she absorbed such a vast amount of energy.

As for Ling Han?

The secret code of life that he had obtained was not complete at all, so how could it compare to hers?

Extermination was unable to accept this. Ling Han’s current strength was completely unreasonable.

“Surprised, right?” Ling Han said calmly. “There’s something that would shock you even more.”

He had only used 10% of his power, and this was already enough to fight against Extermination. Thus, if he went all out, suppressing Extermination would be a piece of cake.

Extermination gritted her teeth, and shouted, “Damn brat, how dare you snatch my opportunity!”

Hysteria didn’t know that if it wanted to break out of this small pond, it had to obtain the energy of the entire Void. Only then could it blast open the barrier that transcended the dimensional level and enter the mysterious and unknown new world.

Extermination knew of this because she had witnessed the destruction of the Genesis World twice, and had even obtained the tiny bits of consciousness of the Genesis World.

But now, she speculated that half of the power had been obtained by Ling Han. This meant that she was unable to open that door and enter the new world.

How could he do this?

This world, including the Void, had been sucked dry, and no new Genesis World could be born, leaving behind an inexhaustible emptiness. Who could withstand living in such a world for countless epochs?

Just thinking about it was enough to drive one crazy.

No, there was still hope!

Extermination stared at Ling Han. “As long as I kill you and obtain the energy in your body, I can still open that door and enter into a new world!”

“Stop dreaming!” Hysteria sneered. “That doesn’t exist at all. Otherwise, I would have gone out long ago!”

It was no longer a match for its previous incarnation, but if it had the chance, it didn’t mind delivering a blow to this opponent from its previous life.

Extermination sneered. “Idiot, what you’re seeing isn’t a real door at all, but coordinates, a weak point in space. As long as you absorb the power of the Void and bombard that point, the real door will open.”

Oh, so that was how it was.

Hysteria, Shatter Mountains, and the others all came to a realization. No wonder they couldn’t charge out no matter what. It turned out that they were too weak, and didn’t have the qualifications to open that door.

It was no wonder that the door didn’t seem to exist. It was untouchable and unreachable. Indeed, it was only a guide, and not a real existence.

Extermination let out a long howl, and used all sorts of techniques repeatedly, attacking Ling Han.

However, Ling Han ignored her, and instead focused his gaze on Shatter Mountains and the others.

“You old bastards, I told you to work hard at the front line, but not only did you not listen to my advice, you even hooked up with this damn transvestite. You even colluded with Hysteria and caused the destruction of the Genesis World!

“Let me ask you, do you regret it?”

He moved as fast as lightning, and grabbed Shatter Mountains in his hand.

As early as when Ling Han had just advanced into the Sixth Tier, Shatter Mountains had already been no match for him. Now, not only had Ling Han reached the Seventh Tier, he had also absorbed almost 90% of the entire Void’s energy.

There were millions of transcendent dimensions in his body. What kind of concept was this?

To say nothing of one Seventh Tier, even if 100,000,000 Seventh Tiers joined forces, they might not be able to stop him.

Shatter Mountains was shocked, and his entire body was covered in cold sweat.

“Put him down!” Extermination roared, her tone sharp.

She hated Shatter Mountains and the others to death, and it was precisely because she hated them to the core that she had to personally kill these four people. Otherwise, how could she vent the anger in her heart?

After so many years, what kept her from going crazy was the desire for revenge.

Now, as she reached the peak, she was about to taste the sweetness of revenge. However, this satisfaction was suddenly snatched away. How could she not be furious?

She acted as if she had gone mad, and attacked Ling Han with all her might.

Lin Luo and all the others had complicated expressions on their faces. A dignified ultimate elite of Seventh Tier had actually become a toy that was being fought over.

It wasn’t that Ling Han and Extermination wanted the battle prowess of the Seventh Tier; they just wanted to kill him with their own hands.

Even though they were standing on opposite sides with Shatter Mountains, Lin Luo and the others were incomparably emotional because they were also Seventh Tiers, so it was inevitable that they would have some complicated emotions.

As for Big Dipper, Half Moon, and Mysterious Feather, these three Heavenly Venerates only felt a sense of empathy towards Shatter Mountains. Being targeted by both Ling Han and Extermination, how could they not feel distressed in their hearts when either one could easily crush the three of them to death?

After the death of Shatter Mountains, it would be their turn.

Ling Han completely didn’t care, and one of his hands casually parried Extermination’s incomparably terrifying attacks, while his other hand gripped Shatter Mountains’ neck. With the force of his five fingers, Shatter Mountains’ neck bones emitted crisp cracking sounds.

What indestructible physique of Seventh Tier? In front of the current Ling Han, it was so fragile that it couldn’t even withstand a single blow.

“Old thief, do you regret it or not?” Ling Han asked again.

“I regret it!” Shatter Mountains said in a hoarse voice.

He truly regretted cooperating with Extermination and bringing his own end. He didn’t even know that he had been betrayed. And they just had to go against a freakish fellow like Ling Han. Otherwise, with Ling Han fighting against Extermination now, they might even have a chance of winning.

As long as Ling Han won, he would be able to open that door and bring them to the new world. What a happy ending that would be!

But now?

It was too late for regrets.

“It’s good that you regret it!” Ling Han nodded, and squeezed his five fingers. Pa, Shatter Mountains turned into a shower of blood.

His gaze was baleful as he stared at Big Dipper, Mysterious Feather, and Half Moon.
