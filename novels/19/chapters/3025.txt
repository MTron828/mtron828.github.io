“I’ll fight you!” Chen Ruijing let out a long howl and charged out.

Peng!

He exchanged a blow with that Third Heaven Celestial King. Instantly, both sides trembled simultaneously and retreated.

After so many years, it was naturally impossible for Chen Ruijing’s cultivation to remain stagnant, especially when Ling Han had discovered his “conscience,” and had been continuously guiding his disciples with great care, even giving these disciples many alchemical pills.

Thus, Chen Ruijing was already a Third Heaven Celestial King. Currently, among Ling Han’s eight disciples, his cultivation level was at the bottom. Next was Kang Xiuyuan, who was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, followed by Yun Yongwang, Fifth Heaven Celestial King, and Jiang Yuefeng, who ranked the highest, was already a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

“Anomaly, come at me if you dare!” Once the old ginseng was out of danger, he immediately became full of vigor once again. “This is one of Grandpa Ginseng’s nephews. Defeat him first, then Grandpa Ginseng will consider exchanging blows with you.”

It had always addressed Ling Han as its brother, so Chen Ruijing really was its nephew; it wasn’t exaggerating.

But who would believe that?

‘You are only in the First Heaven, while your nephew is in Third Heaven. What kind of joke is this?’

Chen Ruijing was not as despicable as the old ginseng. He bowed to him, and said, “I am Chen Ruijing, and would like to seek your guidance.”

The old ginseng was displeased, and shouted from the sidelines, “Don’t waste your breath on him. Hurry up and deal with him. Grandpa Ginseng is going to step on his face!”

Chen Ruijing respected his teacher. Although his cultivation level had long surpassed the old ginseng’s, he had always regarded him as an elder. Thus, he nodded, and said, “Please wait a moment, Grandpa Ginseng.”

Yi, was this fellow really the descendant of this despicable ginseng?

Everyone was dumbfounded; this scene practically made their jaws drop. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The Third Heaven Celestial King’s face was livid. It was bad enough that he was being mocked by a despicable Celestial medicine, but now this person in front of him wanted to mock him too?

‘Humph, you want to take me down?’

“Sir, you’re too confident!” he said coldly as he drew out his Celestial Tool. It was a long staff, and as he waved it, weng, the veined patterns on it all lit up, emitting an intense oppressive force.

Chen Ruijing didn’t dare to be negligent. His natural talent in martial arts really wasn’t that great, and he was only good at alchemy. Now, he was fortunate enough to become a Third Heaven Celestial King because he followed Ling Han.

He raised his hands, and a vermillion alchemical pill appeared in each of his palms.

‘Yi, you want to engage me in battle like this?’

The Third Heaven Celestial King couldn’t help but sneer. He had a Celestial Tool in his hand, and you wanted to use two alchemical pills to fight me?

‘You’re seeking death!’

He did not stand on ceremony, and immediately charged over. In any case, he had the backing of the Shatter Mountains’ place of enlightenment. So what if he killed someone? Who would dare to find trouble with him?

“Master!” Jiang Yuefeng turned to look at Ling Han. “Will Senior Brother Chen be alright?”

He knew that with Ling Han holding the fort, Chen Ruijing would definitely be fine even if he lost. However, they were here to challenge the sect and crash the party. If they were defeated instead, how humiliating would that be?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s fine. Although Rui Jing’s natural talent in martial arts isn’t high, his ability in alchemy isn’t weak. Just watch.”

Jiang Yuefeng found it strange. Alchemy was only supplementary. Could it be used in battle?

Although he was Ling Han’s disciple, he was not skilled in alchemy, so he was naturally confused as well.

Hong, the Third Heaven Celestial King approached and thrusted his sword forward, unleashing the mighty power of Regulations, and intending to defeat Chen Ruijing with an explosive force.

Chen Ruijing raised his hand, and xiu, xiu, two alchemical pills were thrown out at the same time.

“Explode!” he shouted softly. Boom, the two alchemical pills exploded at the same time. Instantly, a terrifying power surged, and two black holes actually appeared, sucking everything in that direction.

The Third Heaven Celestial King happened to be situated in between the two black holes, and under the terrifying suction force between the two black holes, his body became frozen on the spot.

If there had been only one black hole, he would have been directly sucked in. With his strength being the Third Heaven Celestial King Tier, he would be fine even if he was to fall into the black hole. This wasn’t the dimensional Void, and there were no energy storms. It was just a spatial rift created by a crevice in the dimension.

But right now, the two black holes were unleashing their might at the same time, forming an equal suction force. It was as if they added a shackle to him, forcibly pulling his hands and feet apart to form the Chinese character “big,” which looked like a person[1].

He had to resist with all his might, or he would be torn into pieces.

Everyone couldn’t help but be shocked. A Third Heaven Celestial King had actually been dealt with so easily?

What did Chen Ruijing do? He only threw out two alchemical pills.

Wouldn’t this mean that any Severing Mundane Tier or in fact Spiritual Ocean Tier would be capable of trapping a Third Heaven Celestial King, and watch with hilarity while he was stuck?

Hiss, this was too terrifying.

“Ah!” The Third Heaven Celestial King let out a furious roar. He was going all out to break free from this unfavorable situation.

However, Chen Ruijing didn’t give him a chance. He directly threw out another alchemical pill. Peng, the alchemical pill exploded. This time, it didn’t form a black hole. Instead, it transformed into an arrow that shot toward that Celestial King.

Pu!

The arrow was so fast that even the power of the black hole couldn’t restrain it, and it pierced a hole through that Celestial King’s chest.

At this moment, the power of the black hole also disappeared, the surrounding space instantly became pacified, and everything returned to normal.

Pa, that Third Heaven Celestial King fell, already heavily injured to the point of losing his battle prowess.

“Hahaha!” The old ginseng was overjoyed, and he immediately dashed out to step on the Celestial King’s head. “How is it? Grandpa Ginseng’s subordinates are powerful, right? You anomaly, you’re really a loser. Go eat dirt!”

It dug up some soil and buried the head of the Third Heaven Celestial King.

“Damn it!” Another Celestial King couldn’t hold it in any longer, and directly attacked. Xiu, the power of Regulations transformed into a long spear that shot directly towards the old ginseng.

This was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King. His attack was too fast, and the old ginseng had no time to dodge at all. He could only watch helplessly as this attack came at him.

Peng!

A person suddenly stood in front of the old ginseng and blocked the attack. With a press of his left hand, a light shield was formed.

As the spear struck the light shield, an explosion ensued emitting boundless brilliance. Cracks appeared on the light shield, but the spear was shattered.

“Nephew, thank you!” The old ginseng heaved a sigh of relief. It naturally knew that with Ling Han holding the fort, it would definitely be fine. However, seeing such a terrifying attack with its own eyes, how could its heart not beat faster?

The person who saved him was Kang Xiuyuan.

Kang Xiuyuan nodded, and said, “Grandpa Ginseng, you’re being too courteous.”

“Nephew, this bastard actually sneak-attacked Grandpa Ginseng! Beat him up for Grandpa Ginseng!” The old ginseng pointed at the Fourth Heaven Celestial King who had just attacked.

“Rest assured, Grandpa Ginseng,” Kang Xiuyuan replied. Then, he cupped his fists at the Fourth Heaven Celestial King, and said, “I’m Kang Xiuyuan, and I would like to seek your guidance.”

That Fourth Heaven Celestial King hesitated.

Just now, Chen Ruijing had also said that he wanted to ask for guidance. In the end, his companion was instantly defeated, and was still buried in the ground to eat dirt.

Could this guy also be just as weird?

However, everyone was looking at him. If he was to back down, would he still have the face to survive in the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment in the future?

He walked out slowly, and said, “My name is Dang Shen.”

“Pei!” The old ginseng immediately spat. “Nephew, this bastard actually dared to pretend to be Grandpa Ginseng’s relative[2]! Hurry up and beat him up!”

[1] Remember, it’s the one that looks like a stickman doing jumping jacks, with his legs and arms both spread to the sides.

[2] The man’s name shares a character with the Chinese word for ‘ginseng’ which is Ren Shen.
