Chapter 423: Battling Yao Hui Yue

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Charred skin once again appeared on Ling Han’s arms and legs, but there was only a tiny sliver of the white rock left. He gave a loud yell and made a vast slash with his sword. Peng , the rock finally broke. He stretched out a hand and pressed down on it, whilst communicating with the Black Tower. Xiu , he had stored both the broken rock along with the Scarlet Rainbow Frost Ice Grass inside the Black Tower.

Retreat!

He hurriedly retreated, and in a few steps, exited the zone of flames. He quickly drew out multiple alchemical pills which he swallowed down like crazy. In the meantime, he continuously circulated the Indestructible Heaven Scroll to heal his injuries.

“You’re already cooked,” Hu Niu said with a hint of heartache in her voice as she raced over, but when she gave a few sniffs with her little nose, her saliva dripped out of her mouth. “Smells nice!”

The corner of Ling Han’s mouth twitched. Was this little girl going to pounce on him and take a bite?

“Grandmaster Ling, please give the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass to me. No matter how many Origin Crystals, I will pay you for it!” Zhu Xuan’er immediately exclaimed.

“Grandmaster Ling?” Yao Hui Yue wore a thoughtful smile. “He’s an alchemist?”

“Earth Grade low level alchemist,” the Rain Emperor answered.

This time, Yao Hui Yue finally looked surprised. He had estimated that Ling Han was at most a Black Grade mid level alchemist, or high level at best, but he had never imagined that Ling Han was actually an Earth Grade alchemist. Don’t think lesser of an Earth Grade low level alchemist. Once one passed to Earth Grade, it was like a cultivator had passed into the Flower Blossom Tier; it was a completely different plane.

A young man who had yet to reach eighteen years old was actually an Earth Grade low level alchemist!

Yao Hui Yue’s talent in martial arts was indeed worthy of receiving a thumbs-up from mostly everyone in this world, but if his talent was compared to Ling Han’s accomplishments in alchemy, Ling Han was in no way inferior, or might have even exceeded him drastically.

That was because when he was at Ling Han’s age, he was only in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier. That was only comparable to being a Black Grade mid level alchemist.

But what about Ling Han? In martial arts, he had reached the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier as well!

He was a really terrifying young man. No wonder his heart would throb with the feeling that Ling Han would be one of his greatest rivals in the future.

Yet Ling Han did not pay them any attention. He merely continued to circulate the Indestructible Heaven Scroll. The effects of the alchemical pills were also continuously taking effect, allowing his body to recover at a rapid rate. As long as he was not constantly being attacked by the flames, the Indestructible Heaven Scroll could display its effects to the fullest.

After about ten plus minutes, he stood back up. Though his injuries had not recovered completely, most of his injuries had.

“Ling Han, hand over the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass to Xuan’er and I can spare your life,” Yao Hui Yue said calmly. He had said before that the next time he saw Ling Han, he would take the latter’s life.

The Rain Emperor immediately humphed and interrupted, “I was just thinking to have a battle with you!” He decisively accepted the challenge to battle in Ling Han’s stead.

Yet Ling Han smiled and said, “Rain Emperor, just leave this battle to me!” There was still half an hour left of the instillation of power from the Black Tower, so how could it be wasted?

“Hahahaha!” Yao Hui Yue laughed loudly, but as he laughed, he kept shaking his head. “Though I have a high opinion of your potential, the current you is not acceptable. You are not yet qualified to battle me.”

“You’d only find out after a battle!” Ling Han waved the Demon Birth Sword. Faint patterns appeared, and a terrifying pressure emanated from the sword.

This kind of pressure had strong suppressive effects on any cultivator below the Flower Blossom Tier, but its effects were limited against those upwards. After all, from that cultivation tier onwards, the cultivator had stepped beyond the limits of mortality.

Yao Hui Yue humphed and said, “I was originally very expectant of the day that you will come to challenge me in the future, but if you insist to seek your own death, I do not mind granting your wish, either!” He was someone who had no fear of killing in the first place. He did not have the habit of treasuring talent, either. It was only a spur of the moment kind of thing for him to make a two-year promise with Ling Han, so naturally, he did not mind killing Ling Han before then.

“Mr Yao, Grandmaster Ling is an Earth Grade alchemist!” Zhu Xuan’er reminded coldly. Though she very much wanted the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass, she had no intention to take Ling Han’s life for it. Moreover, the two of them were still supposed to head to the middle state to “battle” together, and were allies. How could she possibly sit by and watch?

Yao Hui Yue smirked. Others might fear the Alchemist Society, but how could he? The internal workings of age-old sects like the Heaven’s Sword Sect were far stronger than anyone dared to imagine. Even the Alchemist Society would not be willing to trifle with them easily.

So what if he killed Ling Han? Could it be that the Alchemist Society would dare to come to Heaven’s Sword Sect to apprehend him?

“If you can block three sword strikes from me, I will spare you,” he said darkly.

Don’t think that his heart had softened. It was an absolutely one-sided domination for one in the Flower Blossom Tier against an opponent in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Wouldn’t three moves be enough to kill?

Ling Han raised the Demon Birth Sword levelly and answered calmly, “You won’t be able to kill me!” These were honest words. Currently, he was, at any rate, in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and at least before the instillation of power from the Black Tower ended, he would be able to activate the peak period of the Flower Blossom Tier-level defense from the Thunder Battle Armor.

As for when the instillation of power from the Black Tower ended? Naturally, he would then beckon over the Rain Emperor to take his place. He was definitely not a man who was willing to die for useless pride.

“First strike!” Yao Hui Yue acted. He casually waved his finger, merely forming five flashes of Sword Qi. But who was he? Not only was he in the Flower Blossom Tier, he had also proclaimed himself as the second strongest swordsman in the world. Though that was a bit of an exaggeration, his power in the Flower Blossom Tier was still unbelievably strong.

It was as if these five flashes of Sword Qi were furious dragons that could easily kill a cultivator in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Tier over a hundred times.

In the first place, the gap between the Spiritual Pedestal and the Flower Blossom Tier was like the gap between heaven and earth, what more when it was the kind of monster that Yao Hui Yue was. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ling Han was unafraid and waved his sword to parry. Pu, pu, pu, pu. He could not slice apart Yao Hui Yue’s Sword Qi, but the Thunder Battle Armor managed to easily block all five flashes. Ling Han wasn’t even forced back from the impact.

“Interesting.” Yao Hui Yue smiled. Previously, he had already seen the defensive ability that the Thunder Battle Armor displayed against flames, but being able to resist flames and being able to defend against a powerful attack were two completely different things.

For example, an earthen wall could resist fire, but facing a powerful attack, it would definitely be broken.

After this one strike, Yao Hui Yue’s thought that it was a fluke had disappeared. The Thunder Battle Armor could not only defend against fire and ice attacks, but was also effective against powerful attacks.

He had to get serious.

Yao Hui Yue drew his sword, his expression serious. For someone as proud as he, since he had declared that he would strike three times, he was definitely not going to strike a fourth time. Otherwise, that would ruin the core of his art of the sword, and he could never possibly form Sword Heart in this lifetime.

He once again waved his hand. Xiu , nine flashes of Sword Qi appeared simultaneously, and charged towards Ling Han.

Peng!

These flashes of Sword Qi were once again perfectly dispersed by the Thunder Battle Armor. How could normal attacks be effective against defense at the level of the peak period of the Flower Blossom Tier?

Yao Hui Yue’s expression increased in seriousness. He did not mean to take Ling Han seriously at all, but the might of the latter’s battle armor had exceeded his expectations.

He had to use his best move, or he would really be unable to kill this young opponent.

He took in a deep breath and his treasured sword trembled slightly. Endless Sword Qi was exuded from all over his body, as if the wielder had also transformed into a sword. His body was the sword, his consciousness was the sword, all was the sword!

Ling Han was greatly moved. In his last life, he had naturally not seen the Sword Emperor attack at full strength, and Yao Hui Yue’s trying his best now instantly gave him inspiration. So the path of the sword could be walked in this way too.

He wanted to walk the path of the strongest, so naturally, he had to absorb the strongest points of various paths.

“Mysterious Three Thousand, Slashing All Three Realms!” Yao Hui Yue struck. Xiu, xiu, xiu . A total of 1,200 flashes of light actually shone with luster from the strike!

Ling Han smiled. It was indeed the Mysterious Three Thousand; he had made the right bet!
