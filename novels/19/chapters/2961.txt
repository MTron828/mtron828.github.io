2962 Found them

It was a vague feeling; Ling Han could roughly tell the direction he should be heading towards, but not the exact location.

A large city was soon in his sights. Ling Han guessed that his descendants had to be somewhere in here.

The scope of his search had greatly reduced, but the size of a city was still nothing to scoff at.

It was many times larger than a star in the Ancient Realm, and he was expected to find a single clan in all of that?

It would be difficult.

Fortunately, Ling Han was not just anybody, but rather a Heavenly Venerate with Sixth-Tier battle prowess. There were many things within the realm of possibility for him.

He asked around about the whereabouts of the Ling Clan. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This city was called Peaceful Leaf City, and it had a total of seven Ling Clans.

Ling Han visited each one of them. His plan was simple. Once he found a member of the Ling Clan, he would take a sample of their blood. If they were a descendant, he would be able to feel a resonance, no matter how much the bloodline had thinned.

No, no, no. With hope, he had made his way through five clans, but he returned with disappointment each time.

The three of them finally came upon the sixth Ling Clan.

Out of the seven Ling Clans, this was the weakest, with their strongest member only at the Severing Mundane Tier. As such, they were barely considered a force. Otherwise, without a Severing Mundane elite, they wouldn’t even be able to call themselves a minor force.

“Ling Duanyun, have some self-awareness and stop bothering Miss Cheng. She’s not someone the likes of you can approach!”

Before Ling Han could even enter the premises, he heard someone arguing nearby.

On one side was a man who seemed to be about 20 something years old. His appearance was charming, but his cultivation level was only Heavenly Body Tier. In the Profound Negative Realm, this was way below average.

In contrast, the other side had a bigger group of seven people. Their cultivation levels differed greatly, with the lowest being at the Heavenly Body Tier, and the highest at the Severing Mundane Tier.

The person who had spoken up just now was the Severing Mundane Tier cultivator.

He was a youth dressed in fancy green robes, and he looked condescendingly at the lone youth on the other side, Ling Duanyun.

Ling Duanyun scoffed, and didn’t back down even against a Severing Mundane Tier. “That’s not for you to decide. Mind your own business.”

“You…!!” The Severing Mundane youngster was furious as he stared daggers at Ling Duanyun. It seemed like he was about to attack.

He was not afraid to, either. It was because the strongest person in the Ling Clan was only at the third severance of the Severing Mundane Tier. While the green-robed youth was only at the first severance, there was still an Immortal Palace Tier elder in his clan, so he could completely dominate them.

So what if he were to hit Ling Duanyun? Even though he would not be able to defeat a third severance elite, he could still leave as he pleased. Moreover, a Severing-Mundane-Tier force could only bow before an Immortal-Palace-Tier force.

Ling Duanyun taunted, “Stupid dog, do you dare fight me if we’re on the same level? If you can beat me, you can do as you want with me!”

“Fine, fine. Gou Li, you happy?” Ling Duanyun was quick to ease the tension.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. If this Ling Clan were truly his descendants, then this Ling Duanyun definitely bore some resemblance to Ling Han in the past when it came to offending people.

Gou Li looked at him coldly. “Why should I have to lower myself to fight a peasant like you? Qingping, you go.”

“Alright.” Another Heavenly-Body-Tier youngster stepped out. He crooked a finger at Ling Duanyun in a challenge. “Come, I’ll play with you for a bit.”

This person was called Lu Qingping, and he came from a small Severing-Mundane-Tier clan. His clan was subservient to the Gou Clan, so he naturally became Gou Li’s lackey as well.

Ling Duanyun placed one hand behind his back, and said, “I won’t bully you. I’ll give you a handicap of one hand.”

“You…!!” Lu Qingping was furious as he thought, ‘How dare you look down on me?!’

He immediately charged out. “You insolent brat! I’ll beat you to a pulp!”

Bang, bang, bang! In a few short clashes, Lu Qingping was back where he started. He hadn’t retreated on his own, but rather he was sent sliding back on the ground with a single punch.

“How’s that?” Ling Duanyun rubbed his nose in a provoking manner.

Ling Han quietly nodded. The kid’s strength was decent, and his foundations were especially solid. He would be able to achieve great things in the future.

Embarrassed, Gou Li barked, “Rulong, you’re up.”

“Young Master Gou, isn’t this too beneath me?” the burly youth said while smiling wryly. That being the case, he still stepped out and stood before Ling Duanyun like a giant iron tower.

Ling Duanyun was a little surprised. The other party wasn’t at the Heavenly Body Tier, but at the Eternal River Tier. In terms of cultivation level, he was absolutely stronger than him.

He was powerful enough to beat anyone on the same tier, but to have him beat someone with a gap of a major tier between them?

It would be too difficult. No, it wasn’t possible at all.

“Kid, if you can take three punches from me, I’ll admit defeat!” The burly youth struck out, his punch as heavy as it was fast.

Ling Duanyun didn’t have time to evade at all, and could only cross his arms in front of him to block the blow.

Peng!

The punch landed squarely, forcing him backwards by 17 steps. He felt a burning sensation in his chest as blood trickled out the corner of his lips.

“Not bad. You can still stand after taking my punch.” The burly youth laughed.

“Brother Rulong is known for his iron fists. He had bathed them in Spiritual Herbs since he was young, and even fused them with Godly Metal. They’re absolutely terrifying.”

“There aren’t many on the same level who could take Brother Rulong’s iron fists. He can break someone’s bones with a single punch.”

“Kid, just admit defeat and beg for mercy!”

The other youths behind Gou Li yelled excitedly. However, there were two who were more reserved with their arms crossed in front of their chest. They had a disdainful expression as they were much stronger than the burly youth. Naturally, they wouldn’t be as concerned with the outcome.

“Take my second punch!” the burly youth said excitedly.

“Hold it,” Ling Han spoke up as he walked towards them.

When Ling Duanyun was bleeding out just now, he was able to confirm that he was his descendant.

How dared someone bully his descendant like that!

“Who the hell are you?” one of the youths said rudely.

Pa!

The Empress slapped that person from a distance. The crispness of the slap resounded as the youth spun several dozen times before landing on his butt in confusion.

He didn’t die, because the Empress could sense that Ling Han had no killing intent, so she only used a tiny bit of force. Otherwise, if a Heavenly Venerate were to just release some of their aura, all these people would burst like a bloody bubble.

“Hehe.” Hu Niu simply laughed.

“Who are you?” Gou Li said seriously, sensing that Ling Han and the rest were not as simple as they seemed.

“You don’t need to know who I am.” Ling Han said emotionlessly, and then gestured towards Ling Duanyun. “Kid, come here. I’ll teach you a few moves and show you how to beat that ugly brute.”

Ugly brute?

The burly youth was so angry his nostrils were flaring. Even though he was a little bigger than most people, he didn’t think he was ugly in the least.

However, because Ling Han and the rest had already taken everyone’s attention, he didn’t dare speak up, and simply held it in for now.

Ling Duanyun was extremely intelligent. He didn’t know how strong Ling Han was, but he could tell he was very awesome.

He said, “Senior, you don’t need to go through all that. You can just beat all of them up in a single breath. In particular, that Gou Li is a two-faced bastard. You need to take extra care of him.”

[1] The man’s name is “Gou Li,” with Gou being pronounced the same as “dog” in Chinese. This is a very demeaning nickname.
