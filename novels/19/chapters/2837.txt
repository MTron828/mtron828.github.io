2838 Taking down Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate

‘I, I will forge on again!’

Rong Yang was fuming inwardly. He didn’t believe that Ling Han had mastered more high-level Heavenly Venerable Seals than himself. As long as he could persevere until Ling Han’s high-level Heavenly Venerable Seals were used up, it would be his turn to show his might.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Rong Yang continued to endure the beating, and was being so brutally pummeled that he soon became severely wounded and was bleeding heavily, with maimed limbs—it was a miserable situation.

But for a Heavenly Venerate, as long as his life force wasn’t wounded and the mind wasn’t obliterated, then everything could recover very quickly. This had leaped out of the range of Regulations; the fundamental power of the Genesis World has an incomparably miraculous effect.

!!

However, this merely made Rong Yang more capable of enduring a beating.

Another hour later, Rong Yang was filled with anticipation as he was going to fight back.

Weng, Ling Han channeled the Ninth Seal again.

The two Heavenly Venerable Seals which were being channeled earlier emerged on their own when he had broken through to the next cultivation level, while the Ninth Seal was obtained from the Realm Battlefield, condensed from the flesh and blood of countless Third Tier Heavenly Venerates.

The power boost of the Ninth Seal was only 15 times, which was far inferior to the 27 times of the Eighth Seal and the 29 times of the Fourteenth Seal, but Rong Yang, who had also used two high-level Heavenly Venerable Seals, felt immense pressure.

The third Heavenly Venerable Seal that he used could only boost his power by 13 times. Although he was already at the same level as Ling Han, being inferior meant just that—there was nothing else to be said about it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Therefore, he was still at a disadvantage; it was just that the frequency of him getting beaten was much less.

Rong Yang was about to lose his mind.

Who exactly was the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate here?

He snarled, but this did not reverse his position of disadvantage at all, and he was still getting beaten.

But one really had to admit his toughness; he was still fighting tenaciously after being beaten like this.

Ling Han couldn’t help but nod; top prodigies were indeed extraordinary. At least in terms of willpower, each one was just as tenacious and unyielding.

Indeed, that meant Ling Han could beat him up to his heart’s content.

Another hour later, Rong Yang’s eyes became dead serious. “Do you still have any high-level Heavenly Venerable Seal left? I will let you see the true power of my background!”

Weng, the eight seals on his back glowed simultaneously.

Simultaneously channeling eight Heavenly Venerable Seals? He must have gone crazy; the power of a Heavenly Venerable Seal couldn’t be superimposed in any way.

Nevertheless, Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. Of course Rong Yang wasn’t such a fool, and therefore the fact that he was channeling eight seals simultaneously could only prove one point.

…He had mastered combination seals.

Eight seals, this was truly amazing.

Boom, Rong Yang unleashed a strike which actually caught Ling Han by surprise.

It wasn’t that the power was too great, but rather… too weak. It merely increased his power by about a dozen times.

Those were eight Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Ling Han thought for a while, and finally understood. These ought to be eight low-level Heavenly Venerable Seals. Didn’t Lin Luo divide the Heavenly Venerable Seals into nine grades? Then this ought to be the ninth grade, whereby the boost of each Heavenly Venerable Seal was below 10 times, so the combination of eight seals would boost the power to around a dozen times.

One couldn’t underestimate them, as these were originally ninth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals, but after combining them, they would advance to the eighth grade, which was already quite extraordinary.

Rong Yang was exceptionally confident. Ling Han had used up three Heavenly Venerable Seals, one of eighth grade and two of seventh grade. Even if there were more, they would at most be of the eighth grade.

His combination seals had increased his power by 19 times, close to the seventh grade. It could definitely suppress Ling Han’s next Heavenly Venerable Seal.

“Oh, this background… isn’t too bad.” Ling Han shook his head, and when he punched out, the skull, pelvis, arm bones, and leg bones glowed simultaneously, with each part having a flickering seal, and exuding a supreme domineering aura despite being blurred.

Boom, with a punch, four divine beasts appeared and turned solid, which was extremely terrifying.

“What!?” Rong Yang was taken aback—the current Ling Han had suddenly raised his power to a height that he could only look up to. Not to mention Ling Han, even a single divine beast had the battle prowess to crush him.

F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, Ling Han actually had also mastered the combination seals, and his level far exceeded his own mastery. Just four of them already increased his power by more than 30 times, leading to an absolute suppression upon Rong Yang.

After experiencing a succession of heavy blows, Rong Yang finally couldn’t sustain it anymore. He was violently beaten and fell down from the sky. Peng, he fell heavily onto the ground, and his body directly smashed open a deep hole into the ground, and one couldn’t even see its bottom.

Ling Han’s figure descended. The four seals disappeared, and he turned his gaze towards Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

Jiuwu couldn’t help it when his heart shrank all of a sudden. He knew that Ling Han was extremely freakish, which was the reason why he wanted to kill Ling Han so badly no matter what. However, he never thought that Ling Han’s drive would be so strong, not only surpassing himself, but also easily suppressing Rong Yang, a Fourth Tier.

What to do? What to do?

Sweat involuntarily dripped from Jiuwu’s forehead. He had experienced countless crises in his lifetime. Before he became a Heavenly Venerate, things weren’t smooth sailing for him as well, but he managed to resolve them by virtue of his strength, wit, and luck.

Now that his strength was far behind, and his wit probably was useless, would Ling Han listen to his explanation?

It would be just a matter of luck.

But luck was too unreliable. Still, could it be possible for a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate to suddenly appear at this instance and order Ling Han to stop?

…There wasn’t any Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, but there was one Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. It was only that Lin Xiaoyang obviously had no intention of coming forward.

“Ling Han!”

Peng, Rong Yang flew out from the ground. He had broken arms and legs, and was covered in blood, but his fighting spirit nevertheless shot up to the skies. He glared at Ling Han angrily, and had not the slightest intention of stopping the battle at all.

Ling Han turned his head and glanced at him. “I see that you have also been deceived by another, and this villain… is none other than him!” He pointed at Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate humphed. “I don’t know what you are talking about! Ling Han, don’t be too presumptuous, Lord Rong is the only son of the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, Rong Tianyu!”

He wanted to suppress Ling Han using a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

At this moment, Rong Yang scolded Jiuwu angrily. “This is my battle, don’t mention my father!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said to Rong Yang, “You are considered a tough one, you have my respect.” His figure jumped out at this moment and charged murderously towards Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

“Your opponent is me!” Rong Yang didn’t appreciate it, and intercepted Ling Han.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate hurriedly retreated; how could he be Ling Han’s match.

Ling Han directly channeled the Four Directions Seals, and peng, he sent Rong Yang flying into the air with a single punch, and then quickly caught up with Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, stretching out his hand to grab the opponent’s neck.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate almost went mad with anger. After all, he was a Heavenly Venerate, and a Third Tier at that. Yet, Ling Han actually used a method like an eagle catching chickens to bully him. How condescending was this? But he didn’t dare to make any objections, and quickly took advantage of the chance created by Rong Yang’s attack to escape.

...

However, with such a big gap in strength, how could he run?

A huge force quickly struck, causing all the hair on his back to stand on ends.

He couldn’t escape.

He mused inwardly that he could only be compelled to turn around and fight, and so boom, he brandished a Heavenly Venerate Tool, and channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, but this was one of the seven more widely known seals, and could only increase his power by four times.

Not to mention fighting against the Four Directions Seals, even if Ling Han didn’t use any secret technique, but merely blasted out Fourth-Tier power, it also wasn’t something that Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate could match.

Peng, his counterattack immediately fell apart. Ling Han’s big hand, which he was already using to grip his opponent’s neck, was hardly affected at all.
