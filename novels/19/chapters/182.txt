Ling Han laughed and said, “A few **** 1 ago, I was having lunch at a restaurant and coincidentally encountered a pair of assassins. Moreover, three members of the Black Cloud Army even died.”

The Eldest Imperial Prince was stunned for a second, then asked, “Young Master Han was also at the scene on that day?”

“En.” Ling Han nodded and said, “That woman seems to be a member of the Imperial Family, right? From the looks of her, she has yet to reach thirty years old, and yet has already stepped into Spiritual Ocean Tier. Her accomplishment is really something awe-inspiring.”

The face of the Eldest Imperial Prince instantly darkened. He kept his silence for a moment, then said, “This woman’s name is Xu Ke Xin, she had entered the court just a few years ago. My Imperial Father named her as Consort Yun, and dotes on her very much. Since Young Master Han knows that the power of the nation can help one to break through to Flower Blossoming Tier, then you should know that it can also help to speed up one’s cultivation rate. However, the power of the nation is still limited, yet my Imperial Father actually used a large portion of it on a woman. Heng!”

The last words of the Eldest Imperial Prince were already extremely traitorous as he dared to actually criticize the actions of the current Emperor. However, it was also very obvious from his tone that the Eldest Imperial Prince was very displeased with this Xu Ke Xin.

Ling Han thought back on the naturally seductive appearance of Xu Ke Xin, and could not help but think that it was no wonder that even the Rain Emperor would be head over heels over her. She was indeed a captivating beauty. It was evident how much the Emperor doted on her just from the fact that she could leave the palace with the Black Cloud Army as her guards. If she did not have the Emperor’s favor, then, as an Imperial Consort, how could she so casually leave the Imperial Palace?

“Does this Consort Yun have any children?” Ling Han asked casually.

“Thankfully, no.” The Eldest Imperial Prince shook his head. Otherwise, based on the way the Rain Emperor doted on her, neither himself nor the Third Imperial Prince would need to waste their time to compete for the throne.

As they conversed, time passed and they had arrived at the Spirit Treasures Pavilion. Right when they had just disembarked from their carriage, they saw a young man approach them and say, “This Sun Zi Yan greets Your Imperial Highness!”

Sun Zi Yan?

A thought flashed through Ling Han’s head. He turned to look at this young man. The latter was average in terms of looks and was quite tall and slender. He should have just stepped into Gushing Spring Tier as his aura was still not very stable.

“Spare the niceties, Zi Yan.” The Eldest Imperial Prince raised his hand slightly, naturally exuding the aura of a ruler.

The most powerful and greatest clan in Rain Country was naturally the Qi Family, which held control over the political court and had power that spread to all corners of their Empire.

However, the Sun Clan was only slightly beneath the Qi Family in status, so Sun Zi Yan was not really afraid of the Eldest Imperial Prince. After paying his greetings, he turned to look at Ling Han and said, “Brother Ling, we have finally met.”

Looks like Sun Zi Yan was deliberately waiting for him here.

“Sun Zi Yan, what do you want?” Liu Yu Tong asked coldly. As a good female attendant, she naturally had to stand at the front lines.

A stunned and envious expression appeared on Sun Zi Yan’s face. Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan were known as the Twin Pearls of the Imperial City, and the number of men that were interested in them was enough to surround the whole Imperial City a few times. He himself was also one of the admirers.

Unfortunately, it seemed as if these two beautiful flowers were actually plucked by the same man. This was really something that would attract envy, jealousy, and hatred!

…If Ling Han had any idea of his current thoughts, he would definitely scream out loudly that he was innocent. The gods know that he really hadn’t done anything. He was as pure as a little white flower.

Sun Zi Yan smiled and said, “I only wanted to settle a little conflict between myself and Brother Ling.”

“Oh, there is such an issue?” the Eldest Imperial Prince interrupted.

“It’s just a little misunderstanding,” Sun Zi Yan said in an understatement.

“Oh?” Ling Han’s eyes turned cold. “Are you talking about how that father-in-law of yours coveted my two little sisters, and when he did not succeed in tricking and kidnapping them, he sent people to snatch them from me? So that was a misunderstanding, tsk, tsk!”

Fury flashed through Sun Zi Yan’s face, but he forced it down and said, “Brother Ling, aren’t those two little sisters of yours unscathed and completely unharmed? I am here to represent my father-in-law to offer up an apology, and will also deliver a gift as thanks for accepting our apology, so please forget about this matter, Brother Ling, and not continue doing something that will only damage both sides.”

The Eldest Imperial Prince nodded, and said with a smile, “Since Zi Yan is so sincere, why won’t Brother Ling give me some face and forgive Zi Yan and forget the whole matter?”

Liu Yu Tong looked on with a little worry. She knew Ling Han’s personality very well and feared that Ling Han would come into a direct conflict with the Eldest Imperial Prince.

Ling Han laughed loudly. When Sun Zi Yan and the Eldest Imperial Prince saw this, they both laughed as well, thinking that the “misunderstanding” was settled.

“No!” Right at this moment, Ling Han suddenly declared. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Cough! Cough!”

Both the Eldest Imperial Prince and Sun Zi Yan did not manage to get their breath back and broke out into coughs. Their faces were darkened as they looked at Ling Han. Since you are not agreeing to resolving things peacefully, then why were you laughing so happily?

“Brother Ling, I am being very sincere here!” Sun Zi Yan’s tone deepened considerably as well, a hint of threat underlining his words.

Ling Han smiled calmly and said, “I am also very sincerely telling you that there is no way that this matter will be resolved peacefully! That old father-in-law of yours is a complete scum, and continuing to allow him to live in this world would only be a waste of food.”

“Brother Ling, are you intending to declare war with the Sun Clan with this?” Sun Zi Yan asked darkly.

“Hehe, Zi Yan, you are being too harsh in your words, aren’t you?” the Eldest Imperial Prince stepped out as mediator. He did not want to first form an enmity with the Sun Clan when he had yet to obtain the support that would come with an amiable relationship with Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled and asked, “Sun Zi, Yan, can you really represent the Sun Clan?”

“You dare to insult me?” Sun Zi Yan glared at him. This guy must have been deliberate, pausing while saying his name in such a way that Sun Zi came first, then followed by Yan.

“Yi, isn’t Sun Zi Yan your name? So does that mean calling your name is equivalent to insulting you? What a weird fellow.” Ling Han shook his head.

“Heng, it would be all right if you call my name in a normal way, but the way you called my name just now must have been deliberate!” Sun Zi Yan declared harshly.

Ling Han revealed a very innocent expression, and asked, “How did I call you just now, again?”

“Sun Zi, Yan!” Sun Zi Yan did not suspect anything and repeated his name the way Ling Han had called his name just now. But just after the words left his mouth, he finally realized his blunder and flew into a great rage as he shouted, “Ling Han, you dare to trick me!”

“With an intelligence level like yours, ai!” Ling Han shook his head. “You really only deserve to be a grandson!”

“You’re looking for death!” Sun Zi Yan was furious and aimed a harsh punch towards Ling Han.

Ting!

Liu Yu Tong stepped out and blocked Sun Zi Yan’s fist with the hilt of her sword. She said coldly, “Sun Zi Yan, don’t force me to draw my sword.

Sun Zi Yan took one step back and looked at Liu Yu Tong with caution. He was not able to detect her real cultivation level, which made it evident that she had superior cultivation to his—he needed to be extremely cautious when facing her.

“Haha, both of you are important subjects of our nation, so please avoid coming into conflict,” the Eldest Imperial Prince interrupted, standing between the two of them.

The two of them were both members of the Eight Great Clans. It was all right if it was just a spar, but if there was any loss of life, then even an Imperial Prince like himself would have to bear the blame. At such an important time in the battle for the throne, even the slightest mistake could cause him to lose all hope of his dreams of inheriting the throne.

“When you return, let Chen Yun Xiang clean his neck properly, as I will personally send him to the executioner’s block,” Ling Han said calmly, but there was an extremely determined tone underlining his words.

Sun Zi Yan regained his composure, and asked, “Ling Han, must you do something that will hurt both sides?”

“What do you mean by hurting both sides?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

“Heng, since that is so, then don’t blame me for taking action!” Sun Zi Yan said coldly. “Let me give you a piece of helpful advice. You should be more careful with those stores of yours. The Imperial City is too big, so it is unavoidable that some rogues would come to make trouble!”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Then I would have to eliminate another Clan then.”

His words were spoken very lightly, but the Eldest Imperial Prince had still vaguely heard them and his expression instantly changed.
