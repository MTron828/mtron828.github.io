2907 The Realm Battlefield reopens

After so many years, most of the Heavenly Venerates had already returned to the Flaming Frost Realm, and continued to do whatever they should be doing.

However, the previous situation had already stabilized, and the strength of the various forces was about the same. Very few forces took the initiative to start a war, because this might allow a third party to reap the benefits.

The entire world might not be peaceful now, but there were basically no large-scale wars. It was as if they had arrived at a golden age of cultivation. Although the competition was incomparably intense, the overall environment was good.

Ling Han returned to the Lin Clan’s ancestral grounds, and asked to meet Lin Xiaoyang and the others.

!!

He explained what had happened previously, which made Lin Xiaoyang and the other two feel extremely shocked.

“Hysteria’s creations can actually fuse together? This has never happened before.”

“This should be a special case. Otherwise, we would have seen it on the Realm Battlefield long ago.”

“Yes, even with Hysteria’s methods, it has only nurtured more than 100 people after so many years. This shouldn’t be enough to become a catastrophe.”

After the three Sixth Tier elites had a serious discussion, they felt that there was no need to be too vigilant.

When they heard that they themselves were actually remnants of Hysteria as well, they couldn’t help but laugh. This Hysteria was really trying to drive a wedge between them.

Ling Han chatted with Zhou Heng and the other two for a long time. The three elites were all very warm to him, and looked forward to his future achievements.

Ling Han then left and returned to his Ling City.

The large black dog, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, Ji Wuming, and the others had returned a long time ago. Their strength had all improved greatly. After all, that lost dimension had too many opportunities. For example, Ji Wuming and Huo Furong had already advanced to the Third Tier, and even the large black dog had advanced to the Second Tier, while Ling Han himself had yet to advance. This made him sigh ruefully that the heavens were really blind.

“What do you mean by the heavens being blind? Grandpa Dog was born to be wise and mighty and decide the world on his own terms,” the large black dog boasted shamelessly. “If the heavens don’t take it well, Grandpa Dog will slaughter the heavens.”

In the end, Ling Han kicked him into a ditch.

The current situation was extremely harmonious. Everyone cultivated, and when they were bored, they would discuss cultivation. It was as if the world was truly at peace.

However, it didn’t take long before someone came looking for trouble.

This was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, Yue Chengwang’s father, Yue Borong.

In the past, Yue Chengwang had died at Ling Han’s hands. After Yue Borong learned of the news, he would definitely want to take Ling Han down and avenge his son’s death. It was just that everyone had been searching for raw stone mines at the time, and that was too important. An elite like Yue Borong was able to take things as they came, so he naturally knew which to prioritize.

Moreover, there were multiple dimensions there, and it was extremely difficult to find a person there. Yue Borong naturally wouldn’t waste time.

Now that the outcome had been decided, Yue Borong naturally had a lot of time, and wanted to avenge his son.

However, Zhou Heng and the other two were filled with anticipation for Ling Han now. How could they hand him over?

Yue Borong was very domineering. He threatened that if Zhou Heng and the other two did not hand Ling Han over, a war would inevitably break out.

With how Zhou Heng and the other two could reach the Sixth Tier, they naturally had experienced and gone through countless storms. How could they be intimidated by such a threat?

They had no fear. Should you wish to fight, then you would get the war that you wanted.

Both sides were on the verge of a fight. Both sides summoned a large number of people to confront each other at the outermost perimeter of the Lin Clan’s ancestral grounds.

However, in the instant that the great battle was about to erupt, all Sixth Tier elites on both sides revealed expressions of rapt attention.

After a long while, they all revealed shocked expressions.

“Go back!” Yue Borong immediately said.

He waved his hand, and his subordinates immediately retreated like a tide.

Why did they suddenly stop fighting?

Ling Han naturally couldn’t stay out of this. He had been standing at the side the entire time, and was also very confused now. This formation had already been set up so fiercely, and all that was left was for the big shots of both sides to wave their hands, and then start a bloodbath. However, they actually retreated at a time like this?

How strange.

Lin Xiaoyang opened his mouth, and said with a boom, “I just received a message from the Seventh Tiers. The energy storm in the Realm Battlefield is rapidly dissipating, and it’s very likely that it will stabilize within a billion years.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

‘What?!’

When everyone heard this, they were all shocked.

The Realm Battlefield was about to reopen?

Didn’t they say that the energy storm would last endlessly? Why did they suddenly say that it would disappear in a billion years?

One shouldn’t think that a billion years was very long. To Heavenly Venerates, they might not even be able to take a small step forward in their cultivation with this little amount of time. When seen from that perspective, a billion years was really very short.

Furthermore, once the energy storm was gone, the Hysteria’s army would definitely make a comeback. They had to immediately set up the city defenses. Otherwise, if they went to face the Hysteria’s army that had been accumulating for hundreds of billions of years, they would definitely suffer heavy losses.

Why? How was that possible?

Back then, when the energy storm was raging, even the Seventh Tiers were certain that this sort of situation would most likely continue forever. But now, just how long had it been? Not even a single epoch had passed.

Everyone was at a loss. Were they going back to face that terrifying Hysteria’s army again?

This caused many people to feel at a loss, and an aversion to war arose among them.

There was a saying that it was easy to become extravagant when one was frugal, but it was difficult to go from extravagant to frugal. Similarly, just how many people would still have a willpower as firm as iron when they were used to being at ease, and had to enter that bloody and cruel war?

But what could they do?

Every person knew that everyone would die if Hysteria successfully invaded.

Many people began to wonder if the energy storm back then had been a scheme created by Hysteria to let them get used to ease and disintegrate their fighting spirit. It had even made them kill each other, greatly weakening their strength.

Zhou Heng and the other two had naturally guessed this long ago, but they had not expected that this day would’ve come so quickly. They had thought that there would be a buffer period of one or two epochs. Fortunately, the discovery of the primitive dimension had made the surviving Heavenly Venerates much stronger. This was good news.

But at the same time, there was also a piece of bad news. Extremely bad news. So many years of killing each other had planted the notion that others were unreliable in the hearts of every Heavenly Venerate. How could they still trust their comrades and leave their backs to others?

But no matter what, this was a battle that they had to face.

All the Sixth Tier elites took action, bringing the remaining Heavenly Venerates to the Realm Battlefield.

As expected, the energy storm was rapidly dissipating like an ebbing tide.

Even though this battlefield was incomparably huge, if the energy storm was ebbing on both sides at the same time, it would only take about a billion years for the energy storm to completely disappear. At that time, the Hysteria’s army would be able to charge over from the other side.

...

“Forward. We need to keep the front line as far forward as possible.”

The energy storm retreated, and they advanced. Soon, they arrived at the place where space overlapped. Previously, this place had been divided into eight levels, corresponding to the eight cultivation levels from the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier to Seventh Tier. Although Seventh Tier could also enter the first spatial level, their battle prowess would be suppressed, and they would be unable to unleash their full strength.

This was the Realm War, and the Genesis World determined the rules of the battle. Even Seventh Tiers had to follow the rules of the game.

However, when everyone arrived, they discovered that the space here had been severely damaged.
