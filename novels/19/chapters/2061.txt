Chapter 2062: Provoking on behalf of the master

Ling Han and his group arrived at the area that the townspeople of Azure Dragon Town spoke of. It naturally was in the mountains, and there was a naturally formed canyon here. Both sides were towering, steep mountain cliffs, and as the mountain winds whistled through here, there would be a few rocks occasionally carried by the wind too. If these rocks were blown onto your face, it would ache and be sore.

And among these rocks, some would contain Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes. If one was lucky enough to rake some in, that would really be hitting the jackpot.

The Empress waved her hand casually, and sucked in all the rocks that flew out to her hand. Then, with a slight tremor,?pa, pa, pa,?these rocks were all crushed to dust.

There were no Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes.

If there had been some, these rocks would not have been crushed, as they were as hard as Divine Metal… not, of course, but they were definitely not inferior to Seven or Eight Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal. After all, they contained the bone ashes of a Celestial King Tier, so how could they not be amazingly strong. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han and his party were just planning on entering the canyon when another group of people came from behind them. The one in the lead was a man of lanky build, and naturally had an intimidating presence to him.

It was Tian Qingyue, one of the four super monarch tiers of the Universal Peace Heaven.

When he saw that Ling Han and his group were also here, a hint of disdain flashed through Tian Qingyue’s gaze. He considered himself very noble, so he naturally did not take everyone seriously. Of course, this was also because he had left too quickly, and had not discovered that the Empress and Hu Niu had similarly stimulated the golden dragon bridge. Furthermore, Ling Han had even stepped onto the black dragon bridge. That was the Most Venerable Divine Path!

If he had known, his present attitude would definitely not have been like this.

However, when he saw how exquisitely beautiful the Empress and Hu Niu were, and how alluring and graceful Bewitching Maiden Rou was, even Tian Qingyue’s eyes lit up, and he took a second look at Ling Han.

This brat’s luck with women was practically enough to drive anyone mad with envy. To actually have three women who were as beautiful as celestial maidens, each having a different kind of charm, to accompany him. This was really baffling to others, and they could not accept this.

Wasn’t it just a shame?

Not only Tian Qingyue was an arrogant bully, even the nine lackeys behind him were similarly insufferably obnoxious. They probably thought that now that they had such a powerful backer like Tian Qingyue, everyone else was below their notice.

Someone saw the stunned expression that flashed quickly through Tian Qingyue’s eyes, and immediately became aware that this was a good opportunity to curry favor with this lord.

He stepped out, and in a flash, he already stepped in front of Ling Han and his group, blocking their way forward. However, he did not use force, but rather bowed very courteously, and said, “My name is Sikong Hao. Greetings, three celestial maidens!”

Three celestial maidens? Then what about Ling Han?

Sikong Hao had clearly spoken deliberately. He purposely wanted to leave Ling Han out.

And if Ling Han was not happy, and wanted a fight? Then he’d take the chance to thrash Ling Han harshly so that he would come out of it dejected and depressed.

And at that time, Tian Qingyue only had to step in, and rebuke him harshly. He could then play the role of a nice guy, and also show off his formidable might—you see, Ling Han could not even match Sikong Hao, but Tian Qingyue was capable of reprimanding the latter harshly, and in an instant, his image would become mighty and noble.

For a lackey to go so far, he was actually quite dutiful enough.

Ling Han swatted a hand dismissively, and said, “A good dog doesn’t block the way. Scram!”

“Hehe, I don’t think I was talking to you, right?” Sikong Hao asked in a contemptuous tone, his expression filled with arrogance.

‘So how about it? I disdain you!’

In the distance, Tian Qingyue’s steps slowed, and as he slowed, the speed of the eight people behind him naturally slowed down as well. How could they possibly surpass him?

With Tian Qingyue’s intelligence, he had naturally guessed what Sikong Hao wanted to do. He couldn’t help but smile, and did not stop him.

In his opinion, he had not been moved by the Empress and the other women, and merely admired their beauty and grace slightly. Furthermore, he indeed thought that Ling Han was not worthy of the three women. Thus, if the Empress and the others could see Ling Han’s “true face”, he thought that he would be helping the three women.

Of course, he would definitely not show off deliberately. That was too purposeful and low-grade, which he was disdainful of doing.

If he, Tian Qingyue, wanted to pursue any woman, who would actually refuse him?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Trash, there is some type of bootlicking that cannot be done casually, because you have no idea how strong the enemy you provoked would be.”

“What you mean is that you are very strong, and I have trifled wrongly with you?” Sikong Hao raised a brow, continuing to express his disdain of Ling Han.

He wanted nothing more than for Ling Han to make a move.

Ling Han nodded. “You are overwhelmingly wrong.”

“A mere Yang Soul, I can suppress you single-handedly!” Sikong Hao scoffed. Previously, every person who registered would register their cultivation level, and when they obtained Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes, it would then be distributed according to their respective cultivation levels.

You didn’t think that everyone would be able to get an equal share of the Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes, right?

How could this be possible!

Thus, Sikong Hao knew that Ling Han and his party were all only Yang Souls, and he, on the other hand, was a Heaven Soul, and also had the aptitude of a king tier. Even if Ling Han and his group were monarch tiers, they could only kneel in submission in front of him.

“What a despicable guy, let Niu beat him up!” Hu Niu declared angrily. Her ferocious nature was on full throttle, and she bared her teeth, showing two tiny canines.

Ling Han stopped the little girl, and said, “Let me.”

“You? You would not hold up to three moves from me.” Sikong Hao increased the intensity of his provocation.

Ling Han was not angered in the slightest, because it was naturally not worth getting angry at the words of this kind of person. He smiled faintly, and shot out a punch at Sikong Hao.?Weng, weng, weng,?multiple seals appeared on his right hand, and his punch seemed capable of shattering the universe.

“You will collapse at the first blow!” Sikong Hao similarly shot out a punch in response.

Peng!

Their two fists crashed into each other, and the light of Regulations instantly exploded.

Ling Han retreated continuously for seven steps, and then steadied his footing. With a smile, he retorted, “You’re nothing more than this!”

Sikong Hao did not step back. He had the upper hand in this clash, but his expression did not look happy at all, because this was completely different from the result that he had anticipated.

A mere Yang Soul, and he actually had such powerful battle prowess?

Even Tian Qingyue showed a hint of seriousness. He would be able to suppress Sikong Hao with a single hand, and even facing Sikong Hao, Ling Han was inferior, so it was even more impossible that the latter was a match for him.

But Ling Han was only just slightly inferior to Sikong Hao. This kind of battle prowess was really too astonishing, and even he was no more than this in the past.

This was a super monarch tier whose natural talent in cultivation was definitely not inferior to his!

Sikong Hao was first taken aback, and then flew into a humiliation-fueled fury.

Ling Han actually dared to counter him with sarcastic mockery?

‘Die!’

With a soft exclamation, Sikong Hao’s fists moved continuously.?Tu, tu, tu,?every punch would shoot out a streak of light, and several hundred streaks of light were instantly descending on Ling Han, sealing off every route of retreat that was available to the latter.

Just previously, though Sikong Hao had not pulled his punches, he had not used any celestial technique, either. And now, he used Shooting Star Fists, so his battle prowess spiked greatly, so it was still possible to deal with Ling Han in the remaining two moves.

A vicious glint flashed through Ling Han’s eyes. The opponent was actually delivering a fatal strike!

‘Since you are so merciless to me, then don’t think that I will be merciful, either. You are the one who has trifled with me in the first place.’

Great Clash of Source Powers!

Boom, Ling Han’s whole person was shining, and a frightening brightness surged out from his body, shooting out over the oval-shaped region in front of him.

“Not good, step back!” Tian Qingyue was shocked. An attack like this was already comparable to a full-out attack from him, and if Sikong Hao was touched by this kind of attack, he would definitely die immediately.

But though his shout was very loud, the problem here was, what time or space did Sikong Hao have left to dodge?
