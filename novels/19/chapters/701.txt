Chapter 702: Gold-Seeking Rat

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

What Hu Niu caught in her hand was a fury little thing, somewhat like a bamboo rat, only with a different color. Its body was plump, with four short limbs and a long tail.

If this animal was black, it probably would appear more terrifying, but with its white pelt and pink claws, on top of a pair of eyes that almost took up one third of its face, this guy appeared very endearingly silly.

The little guy was struggling desperately to escape from Hu Niu’s hand, but it was troubled by short limbs and just struggled in vain, squeaking in panic.

Hu Niu began to drool, and said, “Grilled or boiled. Grilled is more aromatic, boiled is fresher, sigh, why’s there only one, making things so difficult for Niu!”

“You can’t eat it!” Zhu Xuan Er, Wenren Qian Qian, and Li Zi Xian all shouted at the same time. Such a cute little thing, who would be willing to!

“Why?” Puzzled, Hu Niu said, while looking vigilantly at the others. “You guys want to snatch it? Hmph, Niu’s no vegetarian, Niu’s down to fight!”

Ling Han was curious, and said, “Could this little guy be the thief from earlier?”

“Great, daring to frame your Uncle Rabbit, slaughter and eat it!” the rabbit said in an aggressive manner.

“Damn rabbit, talk nonsense again, better believe I’ll slaughter you first!” Wenren Qian Qian threatened.

“Alright, Niu wants to eat rabbit meat!” Hu Niu immediately targeted the rabbit again.

Ling Han waved his hand and made Hu Niu bring the little thing over. He looked at the round and fat guy by tossing and turning it, making the little guy quite embarrassed, even using its small claws to cover its groin.

Pu , it actually spat out a small piece of metal, completely blue, emitting a translucent sparkling hue. It used two front claws to clasp the metal and stared attentively at Ling Han as if to ingratiate with him.

“All your saliva, at least be particular about gifting it!” Ling Han said with a smile, but he was immediately visibly moved. “This is a precious eighth-tier metal, Jade Sea Azure Metal!”

Everyone was surprised. A fat rat actually spat out an eighth-tier rare metal; this was very surprising.

“Hm, could it be a Gold-seeking Rat?” the rabbit said in shock. “According to the legends, this living spirit has special sensory abilities towards rare metals, being able to sense metal buried even several li 1 underground.”

Gold-seeking Rat!

Everyone shook their heads, showing that they’d never heard of this name.

“Rabbit, is that made up?” Zhu Xuan Er said with a smile.

“Pah, don’t think that you can treat Uncle Rabbit unfairly because you’re a bit prettier!” The rabbit stamped its feet. “You guys haven’t heard of it before, because there are pathetically few Gold-seeking Rats. Although they don’t have any strong powers, they are definitely scarcer than true dragons and true phoenixes.”

“It can be said that they’re valuable treasure even in the divine realm!

Everyone was finally moved. This fat and round guy was actually a tall-handsome-rich 2 level.

The Gold-seeking Rat looked at Ling Han with an ingratiating expression. It felt the greatest terror toward Hu Niu, and truly like a rat encountering a cat, even its reactions weren’t keen, or else, with its speed, normal people couldn’t possibly catch it.

But this human could subdue Hu Niu, naturally making it fawn on Ling Han; whether or not it could escape the fate of going in the grill or the boiling pot was completely dependent on Ling Han.

Its two small claws clasped the Jade Sea Azure Metal, rocking it as if presenting a gift.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile and let down the Gold-seeking Rat, taking the Jade Sea Azure Metal and causally wiping away the saliva this little guy left.

Zi liu , the big white rat hurriedly took to its heels.

It might look fat and round, like it would pant in a few steps, but its speed was surprisingly fast. Fleeing shortly, it disappeared without a trace—ridiculously fast.

Everyone was taken aback, and the finally realized they were tricked by an old rat.

Who could’ve thought that it looked endearingly silly in Hu Niu’s hands, but was agile to this degree.

“Simply an agile damned fatty!” Ling Han thought about Ma Duo Bao, who was also a damn fatty yet extremely agile.

“Niu’s grilled meat!” Hu Niu cried out. She’d just decided how to eat it, but the food ran away.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “This large white rat has great use; the next time we catch it, let’s keep and raise it.”

Hu Niu pouted. She really wanted to eat, so what could she do? Her gaze turned to the rabbit, her large eyes glowing even more.

The rabbit instinctively covered its butt in shock, and cried out, “Little girl, what do you want to do? I’m warning you, don’t have any ideas about Uncle Ra— ah!” it screamed as it was already bitten on the butt by Hu Niu.

Everyone continued to eat. In a short while, Hu Niu suddenly laughed loudly and raised both arms, cupping a fat and round large white rat in her hands.

What else was it if not that Gold-seeking Rat?

This time, it was caught red-handed. This large white rat’s claws clasped a piece of meat and a part of its mouth bulged out, apparently from having shoved in too much food. It used its innocent eyes to look at everyone—it was adorkable.

Everyone couldn’t help but smile and start to laugh.

“I’ve seen a foolish one, but foolish to this degree... this Gold-seeking Rat is quite a miracle.”

“Humans die in pursuit of wealth, and birds die in pursuit of food, how truly fitting.”

“This is definitely a gluttonous rat. Earlier, it smelled the aroma and ran over, and being caught once, it still hasn’t learned its lesson, falling twice in the same place.”

Hearing everyone speak, the large white rabbit embarrassedly used its claws to cover its eyes as if its face was going red.

Ling Han laughed loudly, grabbed the large white thing again, and said, “Fatty, follow me in the future. I’ll guarantee you’ll have enough good wine and food, and as for you, just display your talent and find rare metal for me.”

The large white rat squeaked and gesticulated with its hands and feet as if protesting... I just ate a few pieces of your meat, and you want to make this rat sell itself?

“You dare not to agree?” Hu Niu moved closer, and revealed a vicious look.

The large white rat was immediately scared stiff as its tail suddenly straightened and its four limbs upright; its entire body was rigid, actually being scared to the point of passing out. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Pu , everyone laughed loudly. This rat was too hilarious.

It was a cowardly rat that actually consecutively came to steal food, and it was a daring rat that was frightened unconscious—five stars for its acting cute.

Xiu , but at this moment, the large white rat took advantage of Ling Han’s carelessness and fled like a wisp of smoke.

Sh*t!

Everyone’s smiles instantly froze, having been tricked once again by the large white rat.

Ling Han took out large amounts of food, and said, “I don’t believe it. This fatty will definitely appear again!”

Everyone shook their heads. As gluttonous as that Gold-seeking Rat was, it wouldn’t make the same mistake thrice, right?

As expected, a night passed, and the large white rat didn’t appear again. It was early morning, and the change from day to night was almost done in an instant. The sky full of stars and the moon disappeared at the same time, and that large fireball rose into the sky.

Although Ling Han thought constantly of that Gold-seeking Rat, there wasn’t any time to waste now, so he moved forward with everyone.
