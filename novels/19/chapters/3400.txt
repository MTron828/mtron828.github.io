Chapter 3401: No Fight Without A Bet

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han also sighed, but immediately composed himself. He called for a car, and after driving for half an hour, he finally arrived at the place.

Although Princess Bixiao was the princess of a surrendered country, Xue Chiluo was an elite of Mystery Realm Tier. Who would dare to not give him face and arrange a bad place for them to stay?

Of course, not many people knew that Princess Bixiao was actually also a

Mystery Realm Tier elite.

This was a huge mansion that originally belonged to a high-ranking official.

After he died of old age, this place became empty.

Ling Han walked to the door and handed over the invitation. After the guard looked at it, he respectfully invited him in.

This was not like the Alchemist Association, where they only needed to verify fingerprints. Their manor did not have such equipment, so they could only verify it in the most primitive way.

Ling Han entered, passed through the front hall, and arrived at the banquet hall.

This place was filled with tables and chairs. There were already many people sitting here, including both humans and Demon Race.

The table was filled with food and wine.

Ling Han did not stand on ceremony. He found an empty table and sat down. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Then, he poured himself a glass of wine and began to eat.

Not only did he eat himself, but he also stuffed things into the Essence Nurturing Gourd for the six children to eat together. Sixth Baby sat beside him and also ate happily.

Although those seven were all little babies, other than Seventh Baby who ate and slept for a while, the others all had huge appetites. Not only were they have bigger appetites than adults, but they were also not inferior to Ling Han.

Therefore, how could a table of dishes withstand the ravages of these big eaters? They were quickly wiped out.

Eh, I’m not even 30% full.

Ling Han looked around, then picked another table and sat down, continuing

to eat.

At first, no one paid attention to him, but Ling Han had the titles of two grandmasters, after all. Naturally, there would be people who wanted to get to know him and befriend him.

Which alchemist or Formation Master was not a super strong support?

However, before anyone could approach him, they saw him wolfing down the food.

Damn it, was this the reincarnation of a hungry ghost?

To be able to receive an invitation, all of them definitely had extraordinary statuses, so they naturally had their pride. Now that Ling Han was like a beggar who hadn’t eaten for a few days, who would have the nerve to approach him?

It was too embarrassing.

“Ling Han, Grandmaster Ling!” A sweet voice rang out, and Ling Han raised his head to look. It was the little vixen Yin Xiujing.

Bewitching Yin Xiujing was still extremely charming, but now that the Demon Race’s princess had appeared, her halo was naturally much dimmer.

Ling Han raised his head and looked over, and said, “Miss Yin.

Sixth Baby immediately revealed a vigilant expression. Was this another person who wanted to be their mother?

She was too ugly!

Sixth Baby commented in her heart. She was picky. Her eyes were too charming, her lips were too thin, and her breasts were too big. Tsk, they were like two balls. They were so ugly!

Yin Xiujing giggled. She walked over to Ling Han’s side and conveniently sat down. However, halfway to her seat, her expression changed.

’Eh, where’s the chair?’

Fortunately, she was in the Extreme Bone Tier, so the horse stance was naturally a piece of cake?. Even without a chair, she still “sat” very steadily.

Ling Han glanced at Sixth Baby. Although he couldn’t see her, he was certain that this was definitely Sixth Baby’s doing. She had even moved her chair away.

Sixth Baby covered her mouth and laughed. It was impossible for her to become their mother!

Yin Xiujing didn’t bat an eyelid as she brought over another chair. This time, she held it with her hand and slowly sat down.

When her butt touched the chair, she finally relaxed. However, when her legs retracted and her butt sank, she heard a bang. The chair actually cracked.

The sound was very loud. In an instant, many people looked over.

Yin Xiujing was incomparably embarrassed. In everyone’s eyes, she must have used too much strength when she sat down, causing the chair to break.

This seriously affected her image.

So embarrassing!

Yin Xiujing turned around and ran. After exiting the door, she immediately disappeared.

Ling Han was astounded. This Yin Xiujing was known as a demoness, and even second-generation young masters like Xuanyuan Dingguo regarded her as a ferocious beast to keep a distance from. He did not expect her to be dealt with so easily by Sixth Baby.

“Hehe.” Sixth Baby smiled and continued eating.

Ling Han also smiled. He didn’t have any thoughts about Yin Xiujing at all. It was also good to scare this little vixen away so that she wouldn’t bother him again.

After a while, Xuanyuan Dingguo arrived. He no longer had that many reservations. In any case, he had long been tied to the same battleship as Ling Han.

“You’re early.” He sat down and was not on guard at all. Fortunately, Sixth Baby did not trick him.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “There’s good food and drinks, so why wouldn’t I come earlier?”

“It’S not for the princess of the Demon Race, is it?” Xuanyuan Dingguo nudged Ling Han with his elbow, his intention to tease him obvious.

Ling Han chuckled at him, and ignored him.

“However, you really dare to come?” Xuanyuan Dingguo looked around. “Right now, the eyes of the Demon Race are all on you and Hong Tianbu. They can’t wait to beat you down. Yet, you appeared at the Demon Race’s banquet openly.” Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This is our imperial capital. Do I still have to tiptoe around the Demon Race?”

“You can’t say that —” Xuanyuan Dingguo was about to persuade him again, but he stopped abruptly because the Demon Race was already walking towards them.

There were a total of four people with obvious furry heads. It was obvious that they were not humans.

“Ling Han?” A member of the Demon Race looked down at Ling Han, and said,

“I am the Leopard Race’s Bao Taigong. Do you dare to fight me?”

Ling Han remained calm and composed, and said, “Why should I duel with you?”

“You don’t dare?” Bao Taigongsneered.

“If you don’t dare, kowtow to Brother Bao and admit to everyone that in a battle of the same level, you are inferior to the Demon Race!” Another Demon Race member said.

“Hehe, I’ll deal with you first. Next, it’ll be Hong Tianbu’s turn.” The third Demon Race said, “Other than His Majesty the Holy Emperor, the rest of the humans are trash. They can’t compare to us Demon Race at all!”

There was still a look of dissatisfaction on Bao Taigong’s face. This was because the Demon Race had the upper hand in terms of level of being and completely crushed the human race. The reason why Chen Fengyan could defeat the Demon Emperor was because his cultivation level was too high. It was not that the Demon Emperor was inferior in terms of natural talent.

Thus, the Demon Race was only temporarily submitting to the human race. As long as the Demon Emperor’s cultivation level surpassed Chen Fengyan’s, no, as long as their cultivation levels were equal, it would be fine. At that time, the Demon Race would blow the horn of counterattack.

Now, let him flatten the so-called freakish geniuses of the human race first. Ling Han shook his head, put down his chopsticks, and said, “If you want to challenge me, it’s not impossible, but you need to bring out the stakes.” “St-stakes?” The three Demon Race members were all surprised. In the Demon Race, a challenge was a very sacred thing. Those who did not dare to accept the challenge were cowards. Why did they need to bet?

“Of course, when your Fourth Prince challenged me, he bet a lot of Treasured Fruits.” Ling Han lowered his head and continued to eat, as he said vaguely, “What do you have in your hands? Without enough stakes, I won’t make a move.”
