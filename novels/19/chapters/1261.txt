1262 Xie Donglai

The biggest difference between Rising From The Ashes and the Indestructible True Fluid was that Indestructible True Fluid could only heal wounds, while Rising From The Ashes could return Ling Han to the peak of his powers.

Take this scenario, for example, where two equally matched opponents had both become heavily wounded, and were on the brink of death. However, one individual suddenly used Rising From The Ashes, and returned to the peak of their powers. What could their opponent do but cry?

It was no wonder the Immortal Phoenix was a top echelon Immortal Beast. Just this ability alone would terrify countless cultivators. One would have to do some serious thinking regarding whether they could withstand the relentless ability of an Immortal Phoenix.

It was a shame that Ling Han only had a one percent success rate of activating this secret technique at this moment. This was the most impressive and most core secret technique of the Immortal Phoenix Tribe. Thus, it was astonishing that a Sun Moon Tier cultivator like Ling Han was able to grasp even a small portion of it.

Ling Han didn’t exit the Black Tower. Instead, he took a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill, and digested it under the Reincarnation Tree.

Three days passed, and his cultivation reached the peak stage of the low extreme. If he spent one or two months to stabilize his cultivation, he could attempt to break through to the medium extreme.

Of course, he would need to spend these one or two months comprehending under the Reincarnation Tree. Otherwise, how could he reach the doorstep of the next cultivation level?

However, Ling Han didn’t have the spare time to do this. The auction was almost about to begin.

Anyhow, he hadn’t gone out for a long time, so he was planning to go out for a stroll anyway. Rabbit and the old ginseng were also bored out of their minds after being holed up in the Black Tower. They insisted on going out for a breather. More importantly, one of them wanted to steal Spiritual Herbs to eat, while the other... Well, the ladies in Wolf Fang City needed to raise their guard.

Fortunately, this was the Cloud Apex Planet, where Demonic Beasts and spirits of the five elements got along fairly well with humans. Otherwise, it would be likely that their venture out would be a fatal one of no return.

Ling Han wandered into a tavern. He wanted to see if anything significant had happened during the past few days, and taverns were naturally the best place for gathering information. There were many loudmouths, and revealing “secret news” was also a good way for them to seek attention.

He calmly listened to the surrounding conversations. Before long, he had already gathered a lot of information.

Some people were blowing hot air, describing how they had killed this many and that many Netherworld elites. However, it was obvious that they were bullsh*tting just by looking at their Mountain River Tier cultivation.

There were also some who were discussing the upcoming auction. However, the Realm Spirit Stone’s size had already been exaggerated to being as large as a bull’s head. Rumors were truly flowing thick.

Meanwhile, there were also some who were discussing the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering.

“Have you guys heard? It’s almost time for the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering again.”

“Of course I’ve heard! Those who can attend the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering are all supreme geniuses. They’re prodigies who only appear once in tens of thousands of years.”

“What do you mean tens of thousands of years? It’s at least hundreds of thousands of years!”

“Oh, that’s right, are they entering the Mountain River Forest or Sun Moon Valley this time?”

“I remember they entered the Sun Moon Valley last time. So, it should be the Mountain River Forest this time.”

“Actually, I reckon that the Mountain River Forest is the fairest location. We can truly see the difference between prodigies of different cultivation levels.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Not necessarily! Some can cultivate to a state of perfection in the Mountain River Tier, yet they’re unable to do so in the Sun Moon Tier.”

The conversation became more and more heated, reaching the point that they almost started fighting.

Ling Han was completely baffled. However, there was an elder and a youth seated at the table next to him, and the youth was equally as baffled as Ling Han. Thus, the elder was currently explaining the situation to him.

“The Mountain River Forest and Sun Moon Valley are both mystery realms in the Two Realm Battlefield. These are extremely strange places. No matter what cultivation one possesses, they’ll be suppressed to the Mountain River Tier upon entering the Mountain River Forest and suppressed to the Sun Moon Tier upon entering the Sun Moon Valley. Even Saints aren’t exempt from this.”

Ling Han finally understood the situation. At the same time, he also breathed a sigh of relief.

If the gathering were held at the Mountain River Forest, he wouldn’t lose to any other person. He had cultivated to the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, and he had also reached a state of perfection for all the tiers before that.

However, if the gathering were held at the Sun Moon Valley, he would be at a severe disadvantage when battling those with a higher cultivation level than him. In fact, he might even lose in one exchange. After all, he still hadn’t reached the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier yet.

Of course, there were still three years until the gathering, so he could continue to elevate his cultivation level. However, it would be incredibly difficult to reach the peak stage of the pinnacle level in time.

‘These strange mystery realms were probably created by the collisions between the two realms. So what if one becomes a Genesis Tier Saint? They’re cultivating in this heaven and earth, so they’ll still be subject to the restraints of this heaven and earth,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

“Oi, oi, oi, have you guys heard yet?” a man suddenly shouted. He was asking whether the others had heard, yet his smug expression made it clear that he was thinking, ‘None of you know, huh? This is secret news that only I know!’

“Heard what?” many people asked.

This man was dressed in a black leather outfit, and his one-foot-long hair was tied into a ponytail. His chest was half-naked, and an aura of ruggedness exuded from his body. A feeling of narcissistic glory welled up in his heart when he saw everyone’s eyes turn to him. He lifted his bowl of alcohol and downed it in large gulps.

“Two days ago, a grandson of Great General Xie went to the Purple Moon Army. He wanted to bring someone away, yet he was kicked out of their encampment. In fact, his face was almost beaten swollen!”

“What?!”

Many people couldn’t help but laugh. “Is he crazy? He actually dared to go to the Purple Moon Army to bring someone away? Doesn’t he know that the Purple Moon Divine Maiden is extremely protective?”

Ling Han’s heart shuddered. ‘A grandson of Great General Xie? This person is definitely Xie Donglai. He knows that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden came to the Two Realm Battlefield, but how does he know that she joined the Purple Moon Army?

‘Hang on, even Great General Xie can’t extend his influence to the Two Realm Battlefield. Although there are no eternal secrets in the world, there’s no way he figured out her whereabouts so quickly.

‘Unless... someone revealed this secret to him!’

Ling Han’s mind immediately turned to Zhu Liyun. She was a good friend of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, so it was likely that she knew some of her backstory as well, including why she had come to the Two Realm Battlefield.

“Humph!”

Killing intent oozed from Ling Han’s body. Zhu Liyun was pushing the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden into a hellhole!

The people sitting at the tables next to Ling Han involuntarily started to shudder. Ling Han’s killing intent was far too terrifying. There was more so a wisp of heaven’s might contained in this killing intent, and it caused terror to well up from the bottom of their hearts. They hurriedly stood up and went to pay their tabs. They didn’t dare to stay any longer.

However, those who were further away were completely unaffected. They continued to converse with eagerness and vigor.

Someone couldn’t help but ask, “Which grandson of the Xie Clan was this?”

“Hehe!” The man in black leather paused to build up suspense before saying, “Xie Donglai!”

“What?! It was actually Xie Donglai? He’s an extremely important member of the Xie Clan’s younger generation!”

“Indeed. He’s only cultivated for tens of thousands of years, yet he’s already reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. According to hearsay, he has a chance of breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier within 1,000,000 years!”

“Sigh! It would be great if I could break through to the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier within 1,000,000 years. Otherwise, my body will stiffen, and I’ll pass into the afterlife.”

“Haha, then kill more Netherworld demons and earn more merit points. After redeeming resources with them, it definitely won’t be too difficult to reach the medium extreme.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. In fact, many of the people here had already retired from the army long ago. However, they still stayed around this place. They were taking a gamble, one which could help them reach a higher cultivation level.

Some succeeded, yet many more lost their lives trying. They would remain here forever, with no one to collect their corpses.

The Venerable Trinity had most likely come across some great opportunity here, one that had helped him break through to the Eternal River Tier. However, it was a pity that he had been smashed to death by Hu Niu.

“The Purple Moon Divine Maiden is truly domineering! She’s not even giving face to the Xie Clan!”

“Heh, who doesn’t know about her protective nature? She treats her soldiers as if they were her own daughters. To say nothing of Xie Donglai, the Purple Moon Divine Maiden mightn’t necessarily budge even if Great General Xie makes a request himself.”

“Indeed!” Everyone nodded in agreement.

“Heh, is there something wrong with me, Xie Donglai?” There was a cold chuckle, and a tall and slender man suddenly appeared at the foot of the stairs. His hands were clasped behind his back, and a powerful aura that was unique to elites radiated from his body.
