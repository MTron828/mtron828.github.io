2786 Even Fourth Tier would be beaten

The Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates had arrived, but none of them spoke. In their eyes, everyone here was nothing but trash unworthy of their second glance.

With every difference in Tier among Heavenly Venerates, the gap was as great a disparity as between the heaven and the earth. They had qualifications to be so arrogant.

This kind of atmosphere was quite stifling. In front of Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, even the Third Tier elites seemed very tense. After all, it would be impossible for everyone to stay in the Realm Battlefield for the rest of their lives, so who could not take the suppression by a Fourth Tier seriously?

The strong needed to be revered, and this was a reality that would never change for eternity.

Everyone stepped aside one after another, staying away from those Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, as if to show them respect with such a gesture.

In fact, this kind of hierarchy had always been very clearly defined. Before the arrival of these Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, the Third Tier Heavenly Venerates had dominance, while the Second Tiers had to show them respect, and the First Tiers similarly also had to respect the Second Tiers.

Certainly, it was guaranteed that no one would show any mercy if a Heavenly Venerable Seal appeared and had to be fought over. That would have been a completely different matter.

However, at this moment, a young man was seen walking slowly, heading straight for a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate—He Liqun.

“Yi, what does this guy want to do?”

“He is probably going to bootlick the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate; otherwise, what’s he going to do? He can’t be going there to provoke him, right?”

“That’s not right. That person is Ling Han.”

“So what if it’s Ling Han?”

“Er… This person is quite capable of stirring trouble.”

When they saw that this person was Ling Han, many people revealed strange expressions. They had all heard of Ling Han’s “story,” and knew that this person had a bad temper and stubborn personality. In addition, he was the most prodigious talent who had been Wu Haoyang’s equal all those years ago. As for him bootlicking a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate… Who would believe it?

“Hey, hey, hey, what does he want to do?” Yuan Yinglong was also feeling anxious. He naturally wouldn’t stop Ling Han from taking a casual walk, but the latter was actually walking straight towards a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate; what kind of trouble was he thinking to cause?

This was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, who could kill a First Tier with just a single breath! Despite there being suppression of cultivation levels here, the higher one’s cultivation level, the greater the advantage one would have.

Moreover, a First Tier provoking a Fourth Tier would have been wrong no matter where it was.

The Empress and the others all had calm expressions. They knew Ling Han too well. Once this guy made up his mind to do something, who would be able to dissuade him?

“Not doing anything. He’s probably just going to spar with He Liqun.” Ling Jianxue smiled.

The corners of Yuan Yinglong’s mouth twitched. To spar with a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate?

‘You must be mad.

‘Even though you are incomparably freakish, a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate would very likely have mastered more Heavenly Venerable Seals. This was power accumulated over time, and it was by no means something that a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could compare with. Besides, wouldn’t you consider how being targeted by a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate would make you suffer when you went back to the normal world?’ Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Those lackeys of his also revealed ugly expressions, and wanted nothing more than to hide far away, drawing a clear line between themselves and Ling Han and his group.

When Ling Han passed by everyone and entered into He Liqun’s “territory,” he finally captured everyone’s attention.

This person… What does he want to do?

Even some Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates glanced over, and were sizing up Ling Han.

He Liqun also cast a few extra glances at Ling Han. In the first place, he looked down on the rest of the world in disdain, and didn’t take any of the Second Tier or Third Tier Heavenly Venerates here seriously, and even more so completely disregarded the First Tier.

However, when he saw Ling Han’s appearance clearly, his eyes narrowed slightly.

Ling Han!

Killing intent immediately flared up in his heart. This brazen man actually dared to bully his son, which greatly displeased him. However, he also needed to thank this young man. It was precisely due to his provocation that He Yufeng had advanced to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

He hesitated. Should he leave Ling Han to be dealt with by his son, or should he beat him up first to vent his anger?

“Don’t say anything, let’s fight!” Ling Han raised his fists and charged forwards.

What was going on?

Seeing this scene, everyone was dumbfounded.

F***, it really was a fight!

He Liqun also didn’t expect that Ling Han would dare to attack him. Was a First Tier taking the initiative to challenge a Fourth Tier because he had fried his brains? If it was on the fifth spatial level—no need for it to be on the fifth spatial level, even if it was only on the fourth or third spatial level—He Liqun could suppress Ling Han with just a wave of his hand.

But this was the second spatial level. He only had the power of a First Tier Heavenly Venerate; at most, it would only be a peak-stage First Tier Heavenly Venerate. So how could he possibly dare to underestimate Ling Han?

He quickly made his move and parried Ling Han’s strike.

Peng!

However, his defense was useless against Ling Han. With a single punch, Ling Han hit He Liqun directly in the face, causing his nose to bleed profusely, and sent him flying.

Peng, peng, peng, Ling Han caught up, swinging his fists like a violent storm.

So what if He Liqun was a Fourth Tier?

Here, Ling Han could pat his chest with assurance and say that even if a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate was to come, he would also need to address Ling Han as big brother.

Everyone was dumbstruck as they watched He Liqun being thrashed by Ling Han as if he was a sandbag, completely powerless to fight back.

Was this really a First Tier fighting against a Fourth Tier?

Many people felt the urge to rub their eyes, wanting to confirm whether this was true.

Even if cultivation level was being suppressed here, a Fourth Tier would only be slightly stronger than an ordinary First Tier Heavenly Venerate. It should be noted that this was still above the First Tier, so how could he be beaten up like a sandbag by Ling Han, completely powerless to fight back?

Yuan Yinglong’s face became even paler with fright. He swore that he had to draw a clear dividing line between himself and Ling Han upon returning this time. Otherwise, when He Liqun returned to exact revenge, he might also be implicated.

…How humiliating it had to be for a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate to be violently beaten up by a First Tier in public?

If He Liqun didn’t exact revenge for this, he would also be too embarrassed to call himself Fourth Tier. In fact, even if he took revenge, such humiliation would definitely not be erased as well.

Everyone had only one thought: Ling Han was indeed too outrageously bold. Why would he deeply offend a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate? Could it be that he would be able to kill him here?

However, it had to be admitted that Ling Han’s strength was very impressive indeed. He should be the strongest at the First Tier.

“As expected of a guy who has achieved great military merits on the first spatial level. At first, I thought the rumors were exaggerated, but now it seems that this person really has actual abilities.” Everyone was feeling rueful.

Peng, Ling Han knocked He Liqun to the ground with one punch, and then stepped on his chest with his right foot. “Okay, now we can talk.”

...

He Liqun was so angry that he vomited blood. He was still thinking whether to beat up Ling Han first, and it turned out that he got beaten up severely by Ling Han first instead. He really had an impulse of wanting to die. In front of so many people, how could the dignified Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate withstand such humiliation?

“Young man, don’t you think that you’ve gone overboard?” a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate said casually at this time.

Ling Han glared at him. “If you don’t accept it, come and fight. Otherwise, stop your blabbering.”

That Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate was at a loss for words, and then his face flushed red, with him feeling a kind of urge to kill someone.

‘You brat, you are really too arrogant; you really don’t take a Fourth Tier seriously?’

But thinking about it, there was not much difference between the man’s strength and that of He Liqun. He was slightly stronger, but he had not reached the point of being able to suppress He Liqun. If he was to fight with Ling Han… It was to be reckoned that his fate would be the same as that of He Liqun.

So what even if he could tear Ling Han to pieces after leaving here. Could such a humiliation be erased?

Thus, he no longer uttered another word.
