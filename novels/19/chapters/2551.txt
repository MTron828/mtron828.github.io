Chapter 2552: Counter Checkmate

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Lord Ancestor?

Xiao Yingxiong and the others were only feeble; they hadn’t lost their consciousness yet. Thus, their hearts involuntarily jolted upon hearing this.

Celestial King He Feng?

Perhaps Celestial King He Feng wasn’t dead yet?!

“Lord Ancestor, there’s no need for such charades anymore!” He Runhai said with a cold chuckle. “You’ve schemed for countless years, and all of this was to leave a path of retreat in case you failed when ascending to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. You think that only you’re so smart?”

“What are you trying to say?” an ancient voice said. This voice directly sounded in everyone’s mind.

This was communication through the divine sense. However, the thing communicating with its divine sense… was surprisingly the colossal tree of chains!

“You think I don’t know?” He Runhai said in disdain. “At that time, you failed while trying to ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Your physical body was destroyed, and your divine sense was also targeted by heaven and earth. As such, you could only cower in this Nine Star Grand Formation, obstructing heaven and earth and living a wretched life.

“Is your scheme not to use a Celestial Tree as a seed? After nurturing yourself for several epochs, you then attract future generations over, enticing them to sacrifice their blood essence. This in turn gives you the opportunity to revive, no?

“However, it’s a shame that I saw through you long ago!

“I played along with your plan, releasing information about this ancient site and attracting numerous fools over. When they shattered the formation, this would make you believe that the time was ripe. Your divine sense would come out from the formation and enable the growth of the Dao Tree, using the fruits of this tree to construct a new life. In fact, you could even reach new heights.

“However, it’s a pity that these people don’t have the bloodline of the He Clan. Their blood is completely useless to you!

“The fruits of cultivation might mature, but you’ll be unable to use them to revive. Thus, all of this can only benefit me.

“Haha! With the divine sense of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate as its core, and with the blood essence of so many monarch stars, just how astonishing will these fruits of cultivation be?

“I’ll surpass you and become a genuine Heavenly Venerate!

“Ancestor, you’re nothing but history. I suggest that you continue to rest under the surface of the earth. Allow your sons and descendants to enjoy the new glory!”

He rambled on and on, with his words stunning everyone else.

As it turned out, it was because of He Runhai’s scheme that they had even heard about the ancient site of Celestial King He Feng. The opportunity had become ripe, so he had released some information to draw them over.

Sure enough, even supreme monarch stars were enticed by the treasures of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. They all ran head-first into this trap.

However, He Runhai was truly a ruthless person. Not only had he tricked them, but he had even treated his own ancestor as a sacrificial lamb.

Not long ago, He Runhai had said that he was even willing to sacrifice his own son if that could help him reach the pinnacle of cultivation. That being the case, would it be beyond him to screw over his own ancestor?

“Unworthy descendant! Unworthy descendant!!!” The metal tree released its enraged thoughts.

Clang!

All of the metal chains suddenly turned around, piercing toward the crown of the tree.

“Ancient ancestor, since I’m saying this, you think I’ll be unprepared?” He Runhai said with a sneer. He held a white stone in his hand, and with a light squeeze, the stone instantly shone.

Clang, clang, clang!

The chains turned around again, impaling Ji Wuming and the others that it had tossed aside just then.

Seizing this opportunity, the Imperial Void Celestial King prepared to flee. However, before he could escape, the metal chains swooped over and attacked him with precision and zeal.

“Hahahaha! I didn’t abide by the ancestral rules at all! Not being allowed to enter before the time arrived or whatnot?” He Runhai roared with laughter. “I’ve already entered this place heaven knows how many times. I became familiar with the situation here long ago, and I seized control of the core of this large formation long ago as well.

“Ancestor, the ruler of this place isn’t you anymore. Instead, it’s me!

“What does it matter that you were once a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate? Right now, you’re nothing but a damaged soul. How can you compete with me?”

He Runhai suddenly pointed at Ling Han and the others. “I told you just then, you could only delay your inevitable demise for a short while. Everything is settled now, so obediently accept your death!”

He clenched the stone in his hand, and it was as if he were commanding something.

Clang, clang, clang!

A dozen or so chains instantly shot toward Ling Han and the others.

With an angry howl, the large black dog immediately charged over. He flashed forward, covering a huge distance with each bound, and bearing down on He Runhai.

It was better to capture the general than to capture the pawns. If they didn’t dispose of He Runhai or snatch the control of this formation from his hands, they could only remain on the back foot forever.

However, the closer the large black dog got to the metal tree, the shorter his teleportations would become. In fact, he could only advance by around 10 to 15 meters each time. It was as if he had sunk into mud, with each step forward as difficult as could be.

“Hahaha!” He Runhai roared with laughter. “This is the grand formation of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate! As a measly Ninth Heaven Celestial King, what does it matter even if you’re a supreme monarch star? You can’t defeat this formation at all!”

As he said this, a dozen or so metal chains shot toward the large black dog.

Clang!

Ling Han and the others retreated. However, they quickly discovered that the metal chains could only attack within a limited range. They couldn’t reach their original location.

In other words, if the large black dog hadn’t charged forward to attack, the metal chains couldn’t have done anything to him.

“Damn it! We’ve been tricked by him again!” Ling Han said in a solemn voice.

He Runhai had purposefully revealed his secrets. He was being smug and arrogant for a reason. This wasn’t because he necessarily felt so, but rather because he was putting on a show for them. He was tricking them into acting. Sure enough, the large black dog fell for his trick.

“It’s a shame that you realized too late!” He Runhai said as he glided down from the top of the tree. At this moment, both of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had been trapped by the metal chains. Meanwhile, the remaining three Celestial Kings were all too weak to do anything. He could dispose of them with ease. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In fact, Wally was quite strange, but his battle prowess was far too weak. Thus, there was no need to kill him at all. He Runhai could continue to suppress him.

He Runhai walked extremely slowly, yet his expanding aura placed Ling Han and the others under immense pressure.

He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Moreover, his ability to reach this level also proved that he was a monarch tier to begin with. Thus, it was only natural that he was boundlessly terrifying.

Ling Han and the others retreated slowly. However, He Runhai was unhurried as he continued to bear down on them.

After a while, He Runhai chuckled, and said, “There’s nowhere else for you to retreat!”

He was an extremely careful person, so even at this moment, he still didn’t act rashly and carelessly. Only after confirming the situation did he finally feel confident in victory.

“Obediently lie down!” He Runhai extended a hand that was filled with symbols.

“Old geezer, you’ve also been tricked!”

Whoosh!

A dark figure suddenly leaped out from Ling Han’s body, expanding in size as it did so. It lunged toward He Runhai.

It was the large black dog!

What in the world was going on?

Hadn’t the large black dog already been trapped?

“Haha! If I had allowed you to notice anything, wouldn’t I have wasted my lifetime of cultivation?” the large black dog said with a loud laugh. He unleashed a barrage of wild attacks at He Runhai.

The metal chains couldn’t reach this area, so He Runhai had no option but to face his opponent alone.

He Runhai had only acted because he had been confident of victory. However, who would have expected this from the large black dog?

“You created a clone of yourself using your divine sense, so why can’t we do the same as well?” Ling Han said in a calm and composed voice.

“Impossible!” He Runhai exclaimed in disbelief. How could a mere divine sense rival the power of the metal chains?

“Enough with your shock. Just who is Grandpa Dog? Am I someone that you can fathom?” the large black dog said with haughty pride.

Wally snickered upon hearing this. They had come up with this plan just then, with Ling Han in charge of formulating their plan of attack. Meanwhile, Wally had been responsible for making the large black dog’s divine sense appear as real as possible. As for the large black dog, he had hidden inside Ling Han’s Spatial God Tool, and would be responsible for the final battle.

Now that the large black dog was taking all of the credit for himself, Wally naturally snickered in disdain.
