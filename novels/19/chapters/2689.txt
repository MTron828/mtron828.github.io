2690 Compensate me for my losses

“Little Han, quickly let go of Grandpa Dog!” the large black dog shouted.

Ling Han loosened his grip accordingly, and the large black dog ran off immediately. While running, he also exclaimed, “I will be on the lookout for you. If you lose, Grandpa Dog will come out to save you!”

Xiu, he ran off and disappeared.

This damn dog was really cowardly and only interested in saving his own neck.

!!

Ling Han didn’t mind anyway. In fact, he even closed his eyes, and appeared nonchalant.

The four guards were trembling with fear. Liu Fuming was still embedded in the city wall, with all four limbs dangling, and it was unknown whether he was dead or still alive. If someone from the Liu Clan came out to ask, how would they answer?

It seemed that whatever you were afraid of would materialize. A short while later, three figures arrived in a flash.

Although the three arrived almost at the same time, they did not come together, but separately rushed here from three corners of the city.

“What’s going on?”

“Why is Fuming injured?”

“And who is this person?”

The three of them cast a sweeping glance around, looking very angry.

Who would be as bold as to come to the Liu Clan to cause injury, and even damage the city wall of the Liu Clan?

“It’s him!” The four guards hurriedly pointed at Ling Han. “His name is Ling Han.”

“Ling Han?” The three people who came over all frowned; it seemed like they had never heard the name.

“It sounds familiar.” One of them racked his brains for a while, and felt as if he had heard the name somewhere. He couldn’t help but keep trying his best to recall it again.

“Humph, I don’t care who you are, if you dare to come to the Liu Clan to commit a crime, then you must be tired of living!” said a man in green clothing. He was a Third Heaven Celestial King, and his face was full of arrogance. “Even if you are a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, you can only prostrate or go down on your knees here.”

This was the arrogance of the members of the Liu Clan. No matter who Ling Han was, even if he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, the Liu clansman was neither terrified nor afraid.

Ling Han shook his head. “You’re really used to being arrogant and domineering, and don’t even know how to talk properly.” He waved his hand and struck the man in green clothing in a similarly nonchalant manner as he had before. It was another swat at empty air like before, as if he was swatting a mosquito.

Pa!

When the strike landed, the man in green was instantly sent flying, and he was tightly stuck in the crack of the city wall near Liu Fuming, with one on top of the other, as if they were trying to mend the crack on the wall with their own bodies

“How brazen of you, you actually dare to make a move?” the man in red shouted fiercely. This man was too reckless; how could he be so impudent?

“You can go join them too!” Ling Han waved his palm again, and the man in red became embedded in the crack as well.

“You are Ling Han, that Ling Han!” At last, the other man finally remembered where he had heard Ling Han’s name, but when he raised his head, he saw that the two people around him had disappeared. As he turned to look for them, he found the two of them were embedded in the city wall together.

It was really too brutal.

He thought of the legend regarding Ling Han, who had killed more than 10 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in one battle; they were all Celestial Kings at the peak of the Ninth Heaven. Even for a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier force such as theirs, it would take several epochs to nurture a Celestial King to reach the peak of the Ninth Heaven. The fall of one would mean that countless resources had been exhausted in vain.

“Now you know who I am?” Ling Han smiled, but he still waved his right hand without hesitation.

Pa, the last person was also sent flying, and became embedded in the crack of the city wall.

“I have always been fair in doing things. Since I was the one who broke the wall, I will fix it up,” Ling Han said to himself.

When the four guards heard it, the corners of their mouths twitched. They thought to themselves, ‘How could you fix up the wall like this, filling it up with Celestial Kings one after another? This is too extravagant, and the Liu Clan will be angered like crazy.’

Sure enough, another Celestial King appeared after a short while.

This time, more people came because the longer the interval from the time that the alert signal was issued, the more people would receive the news. Moreover, the longer the time it took for news that the alert signal was resolved to arrive, the more it would naturally seem that something was not right, and this had to have alerted certain powerful beings.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, more than a dozen Celestial Kings flew down from various corners of the city.

“Hmm?” When they saw that the city wall had cracked open, and it was filled with four Celestial Kings of their own clan, all of them had a cold glint in their eyes.

Who could be so brazen, did he want to die?

“You bastard, how dare you still remain seated, hurry, be on your knees and receive your death penalty!” A young man leaped out. He only had the cultivation level of the Second Heaven, but there were clansmen at the Fifth Heaven and Sixth Heaven nearby, so he naturally was full of confidence and fearless.

“Noisy!” Ling Han coldly snorted, and waved his palm at the young man through the air.

“Insolence!” Two Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings immediately snarled. How dared he resort to violence in front of them? They both moved, meeting Ling Han’s incoming attack.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Accompanied by three bangs, the two Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings and the young man at the Second Heaven from before were similarly sent off flying with a palm strike, and became embedded in the city wall.

‘This…!’

All the other Celestial Kings of the Liu Clan couldn’t help but feel chills all over their bodies. This was too savage. How could a Sixth Heaven Celestial King be like a toy in front of Ling Han, sent off flying with just a casual slap through the air?

Ling Han looked up at the city wall, and said to himself, “It’s still a dozen or so short.” If it was filled with a dozen more people, the city wall would be “patched up,” albeit in a sloppy way.

Hearing this, the other Celestial Kings of the Liu Clan were all so scared that their faces became pale, and they all retreated one by one. Now the strongest among them was merely a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, who would be as powerless as a sheep in front of Ling Han.

Weng!

A terrifying pressure descended, and an elite came down from the sky, wrapped in nine ribbons of iridescent light.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King had come. Finally, a real elite had appeared.

“Elder Qiyuan!”

“It’s Elder Qiyuan who has come.”

“Elder, please take action and suppress this villain!”

Those Celestial Kings of the Liu Clan shouted in unison. Now that their pillar of strength had come, they were suddenly all tough.

The name of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King was Liu Qiyuan. He looked at Ling Han, and said solemnly, “So it is Friend Ling who has arrived. Why not present your identity clearly so that Liu Clan could receive you as a guest properly?”

‘What?!’

Hearing this, all the others of the Liu Clan were stunned. Had the elder gone crazy to be so polite to a villain? They were the Liu Clan, with a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate in charge. To say nothing of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, even if it was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate who had come, he would have to be respectful and courteous.

Ling Han smiled lightly. “I’m here to collect a debt. You can just barely be regarded as the person in charge. I’ll ask you then, how will you pay for my damages after sending people to the martial academy to besiege me?”

Compensate for your damages?

Liu Qiyuan almost jumped out. ‘You killed two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings from our Liu Clan, and yet still want the Liu Clan to compensate you?’

However, thinking of Ling Han’s brutality, more than 30 Celestial Kings at the peak of the Ninth Heaven had attacked simultaneously at that time, but the result was that not only had they failed to take down Ling Han, more than 10 Celestial Kings at the peak of Celestial Path had met their demise. They had suffered a colossal loss.

Now, the Liu Clan “only” had 19 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and there was no one at all with the strength of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. How would they be able to take on this brutal murderer?

“Ling Han, you best not forget that this is the Liu Clan. Our grand elder is, after all, a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate!” Liu Qiyuan said menacingly. Now he just hoped that would scare Ling Han. When the grand elder of the Liu Clan returned in the future, he would naturally suppress Ling Han. It would just be as easy as turning his hand over.

Ling Han laughed out loud. “If I had been afraid, why would I have come?” He withdrew his smile and tapped the armrest of the chair. “Don’t waste my time. If you don’t think carefully on how to compensate me, then I’ll go in and get it myself.”
