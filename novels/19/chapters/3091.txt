3092 General Situation

Ling Han’s heart trembled violently. He finally understood why the Genesis World was called a small puddle.

Not only was it small, but the flow of time was also wrong.

One day in the heavens was equivalent to one year on the mortal plane[1]!

And it was not just a year here. A year had passed here, but 1,000 epochs had passed in the Genesis World.

Ling Han sought guidance from Sun Jianfang. He was truly filled with unanswered questions about this world.

Sun Jianfang didn’t hide anything. Just because Huan Xue didn’t know some things, it didn’t mean that it was a secret.

Actually, 123 years ago, this world had still been very ordinary. Humans had only been humans, and there hadn’t been any powerful cultivators. There had indeed been martial artists, but they only strengthened their bodies, and had been better at fighting than ordinary people. They hadn’t been much stronger.

Wild beasts had only been ferocious. For example, tigers and lions could’ve been resisted or even in fact killed by a dozen people with blades and spears. After the invention of firearms, even a completely weak person could kill ferocious lions, tigers, and black bears. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

However, 123 years ago, there had been a huge turn of events.

On a certain day in that year—there was no way to verify the exact date—some kind of great change had occurred in heaven and earth, and wild beasts had mutated. They had begun to evolve rapidly and become incomparably powerful.

In fact, firearms were useless against them. Humans had almost been exterminated overnight.

Not only had ferocious beasts become stronger, but they also possessed astonishing intelligence. They occupied a large number of territories that had originally belonged to humans, and treated humans as food. The status of both sides seemed to have completely been flipped upside down.

However, the ground was also changing, revealing some ancient buildings buried deep underground. There were even ancient cultivation secret techniques inside.

Some of the people who found these ancient buildings quickly rose to power, and gained the strength to fight against mutated beasts. Only then did humans truly obtain a chance to breathe.

These cultivators created places like the Ancient Dao Sect to protect a region.

“This old man wishes to appoint you as the Dao Child, but although you’ve been born from the Divine Stone, you haven’t displayed any freakish abilities yet. If I directly appointed you as the Dao Child, it would not be legitimate or appropriate…” After Sun Jianfang finished explaining the matters of this world, he began to talk about Ling Han.

“Therefore, I’ll give you a mission. Within three years, open 12 meridians and reach the pinnacle of Meridian Opening.”

Ling Han was not interested in becoming this so-called Dao Child, but it seemed that his powerful strength could only be used in the small world of the “Divine Stone.” Once he left that place, he would become an ordinary person.

This indeed made Ling Han a little depressed, even a little defiant. He even had the urge to go back and become an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier.

But firstly, the Divine Stone had already been destroyed, and it was impossible for him to return. Secondly, since someone like him had a vaster heaven and earth to conquer, how could he possibly retreat?

He had to advance courageously. Otherwise, the Empress, Lin Luo, and the others would be trapped in the dimensions within his body forever.

From this point of view, Ling Han was definitely different from the rest. This also gave Ling Han great confidence.

“Sect Master, I still want to ask about cultivation.”

Ling Han sought advice from Sun Jianfang, but he received very little information.

100 years ago, there was no true cultivation in this world, and it was just a show of fancy moves. No matter how high one’s martial prowess was, they would not be able to withstand a blow from a firearm. In the last 100 years, cultivation had blossomed, and elites could even withstand bullets head-on!

However, not many people could explain the nature of cultivation.

There was a widespread saying that the ability they obtained now was not traditional martial arts, but cultivation.

If one continued cultivating like this until the end, he would become a Celestial, as the legends speak of. He would be able to fly in the sky and burrow into the ground, and he would be omnipotent.

However, because there was no inheritance, everything could only be explored by oneself. There was no way to know if it was right or wrong.

The reason why the Ancient Dao Sect could rise to prominence, or rather, why Sun Jianfang could become an elite of a region, was because of a fist manual.

This fist manual had also become the Ancient Dao Sect’s top secret and supreme precious treasure. Even an outstanding disciple like Li Changdan had only been taught one move, and the elders had only learned three to five moves from it.

Ling Han hadn’t even learned a single move, and Sun Jianfang had indeed taught him a set of fist techniques. However, it wasn’t the ultimate technique of the sect, but a simplified version of the “Four Directional Fists,” and its power couldn’t be mentioned in the same breath as the original version.

When Ling Han returned to his residence, a fist manual was in his hands. This was a simplified version of the Four Directional Fists. Even so, this was still something that countless people would fight over.

‘Here, cultivation has just begun. Everything seems to be shrouded in a fog. I have to slowly explore on my own.

‘Take Li Changdan for example. He opened up the nine meridians in his body, and each meridian is filled with power. With a punch, powerful power surged out of all nine meridians. The power of his punch is terrifying and can shatter rocks.

‘Hehe, just being able to shatter rocks, and that can be called an elite?’

Ling Han sighed. He couldn’t think about the past anymore. That wasn’t even a real world. If he were to be placed here with his terrifying power, even walking was difficult.

He had to let go of his past glory, treat himself as the most ordinary person, and start over.

In fact, he had no choice but to think that way. He was just an ordinary person now.

‘The first step of cultivation is to open up the meridians, but first, you have to know where the meridians are.’

Ling Han smiled bitterly. Previously, he had been able to look inside himself, and everything was not a big deal. But now?

‘People with high natural talent in cultivation can use fist techniques, palm techniques, and other techniques to trigger a surge of power, and naturally open up their meridians.

‘However, if I don’t have such powerful natural talent, I can only settle for the next best thing.

‘The first is the Meridian Guiding Fruit. After consuming it, there’s a high chance of sensing the meridians in the body and guiding the power through them.

‘Secondly, the effect of refining the Meridian Guiding Fruit into a Meridian Guiding Pill is much stronger than the Meridian Guiding Fruit. However, very few people know how to refine pills. Every Meridian Guiding Pill is priceless.

‘Eh, only fist techniques can be cultivated?’

Ling Han found it strange. On his cultivation path in the past, besides martial arts techniques, there were also cultivation techniques. Cultivation techniques were the key to increasing one’s power.

Were there no cultivation techniques here?

‘The Meridian Guiding Fruit only appeared after the upheaval of heaven and earth. Now, it’s basically in the territory of those ferocious beasts. Occasionally, we can pluck it in the wild, but the chances are pitifully low.

‘Wild beasts have developed intelligence. They can no longer be called wild beasts, but rather demonic beasts.

‘Hehe, this is very similar to the Genesis World.

‘The Ancient Dao Sect also has Meridian Guiding Fruits, but there are pitifully few of them. They can only be obtained when one has achieved extraordinary contributions for the sect.

‘There are 12 meridians in the human body. In order to cultivate to the peak of Meridian Opening, you have to open these meridians. In other words, with every step you take, you need at least one Meridian Guiding Fruit. There are so many people in the Ancient Dao Sect. There is not enough to go around.

‘I’ll practice this fist technique first, and see if I’m that kind of cultivation prodigy!’
