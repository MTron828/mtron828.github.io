Chapter 1624: The Zhong Clan Has Come

Time slowly crept by. In the blink of an eye, another year had already passed.

Both the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden had completely stabilized their cultivation. The Empress’ cultivation was especially terrifying, and the level of her Origin Power had already reached the peak stage of the Small Saint. Her 10,000,000 heavenly bodies already couldn’t evolve anymore. During the past year, she had spent almost all of her time cultivating under the Reincarnation Tree. She would only occasionally leave to make love with Ling Han.

Under the Reincarnation Tree, one year was equivalent to over 3000 years. Add to that the Divine Fetus of the Empress, and her comprehensions were able to completely catch up to her cultivation level. At this moment, she had truly reached the peak stage of the Small Saint.

This was an unfathomable speed. Moreover, it could be seen that although her advance had been slow before, she had actually been accumulating experience and comprehension. By releasing her potential at once, she was able to easily soar to the peak stage of the Small Saint, and shift her target to the level of Medium Saint.

Right now, the Empress could even rival those at the peak stage of the Great Saint if she unleashed her full battle prowess. She could surpass eight stars!

As for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, she was nowhere near this level. Although she had received the inheritance of the three Phoenix Kings, her cultivation speed still slowed down after she advanced to the Saint Tier. Right now, she was still at the early stage of the Small Saint, and was a considerable distance from reaching the middle stage.

Meanwhile, Ling Han had set off on his path of frenzied breakthroughs. He didn’t forget to swallow pills every day, and he had also continued to accumulate his Origin Power. Right now, he had already formed a staggering 6,000,000 heavenly bodies. However, he would still need around three years to reach the maximum number of 10,000,000.

This was already the fastest he could advance, unless there was some Saint Pill that he could wantonly take. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to advance any quicker.

The others had also improved greatly, like the Rain Emperor who had already advanced to the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier. He was also aiming to form 10,000,000 heavenly bodies. In fact, the biggest surprise was the large black dog, who had actually become a Saint!

This detestable dog had actually become a Saint?

Not only did Ling Han find this strange, but everyone else also found it strange. Moreover, almost every student would grind their teeth in frustration and anger at the mention of the large black dog. After all, the large black dog was far too sinister and detestable. He found great joy in deriding others, and he had completely no morals to speak of.

Not only that, but he had also found two new subordinates now—a rabbit and an old ginseng. The three of them caused endless turmoil in the martial arts academy. Afterward, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire also joined this strange group. The appearance of this child Saint caused everyone’s jaws to drop to the ground.

Fortunately, they quickly learned that the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was actually the reincarnation of a “Saint”. Even so, they were still shocked that he was able to recover his Genesis Tier cultivation so quickly. In the end, however, this was at least still within the bounds of what they could accept as “reasonable”.

At any rate, the appearance of five Saints in just a few short years shattered the long-standing rumor that only one disciple of this generation could become a Saint.

Thus, all of the disciples found a renewed vigor. It didn’t matter that their cultivation speed was a little slower, as they still had a sliver of chance to become a Saint.

On this day, a golden path suddenly materialized in the sky, bringing with it a Saint.

The Saints of the martial arts academy all came out to meet this unexpected guest. After all, a Saint could cause huge amounts of damage if they suddenly launched an attack. Moreover, in terms of escape, Small Saints wouldn’t be any inferior to Saint Kings. Thus, they had to be extremely cautious.

However, this Saint was none other than the Notionless Saint.

Ling Han immediately went out to greet the Notionless Saint upon hearing of his arrival. However, he saw that the Notionless Saint looked extremely weak and fragile. It was clear that he had suffered severe wounds.

“What happened?” Ling Han asked with a frown.

After so many years together, he already viewed the Notionless Saint as a teacher and a friend. Thus, with his personality of protecting those close to him, he was naturally enraged upon seeing the Notionless Saint in such a sorry state.

The Notionless Saint sighed, and said, “I left to seek revenge on my three traitorous disciples immediately after becoming a Saint. However...”

The results naturally weren’t great.

At Ling Han’s questioning, the Notionless Saint revealed that one of his disciples had already died countless years ago after failing in his attempt to become a Saint. However, his two other disciples were extremely talented, and they had not only digested his previous fruits of cultivation, but they had even surpassed him to become Medium Saints.

He had failed to exact revenge, and had even ended up being hunted himself. If it weren’t for the fact that Saints all possessed similar speed, his fate would have been much worse than just getting some severe wounds. It would have been extremely likely that he would have been killed.

He had bitterly waited for countless years and finally become a Saint again, yet his desired revenge seemed just as distant as before. This naturally caused him to feel frustrated.

Seek revenge after advancing to become a Medium Saint?

He wasn’t confident that he could do so. After reaching the Saint Tier, just how difficult was it to advance another minor tier? How many hundreds of millions of years had passed? Yet his two disciples had only just advanced to the level of Medium Saint. If he wanted to catch up to their progress—if that were even possible—he would need at least hundreds of millions of years.

“You need to have faith in yourself!” Ling Han said as he patted the Notionless Saint’s shoulder. “Once I reach the Saint Tier, I’ll make sure to research Saint-level alchemical pills and refine some that can increase one’s cultivation speed. I’ll make it so that you can pummel your two unworthy disciples!”

This kind of bitter resentment naturally had to be resolved by the Notionless Saint himself. Relying on the power of others would dampen his ability to vent his anger.

The Notionless Saint nodded upon hearing this. He was quite confident in Ling Han’s abilities. At the same time, he couldn’t help but sigh in emotion. At that time, just how correct had his decision to follow Ling Han been? He had not only regained his cultivation as a Saint, but he even had the chance to advance to the level of Medium Saint or Great Saint.

Several days passed, and another golden path unfurled through the sky.

This...!

The Star Sand Saint and the other Saints all felt slightly irritated. Should they erect a sign outside Wood Figure Planet, warning miscellaneous Saints to stay away? They were arriving one after another, and it seemed like there was no end in sight!

Weng!

An overwhelming aura swept through the sky. This newest arrival was no Small Saint!

“Humph!” The Star Sand Saint humphed in displeasure as he immediately pushed back against this aura.

“I’m Zhong Ye, from the Open Clouds Forbidden Land!” an incredibly haughty and arrogant voice announced. There was an air of superiority in his voice.

“You’re merely a Medium Saint. Don’t you understand common courtesy?” the Star Sand Saint asked.

The golden path disappeared, revealing a middle-aged man. He was tall and lightly built, and his appearance was also extremely handsome. His hands were clasped behind his back, and it was clear that he was unafraid of the Star Sand Saint. “The ancestor of my clan is a Saint King, and I’ve specifically come here on the orders of our ancestor. By looking down on me, are you also trying to look down on my ancestor? Is that your intention?”

The Star Sand Saint felt extremely frustrated. Having a Saint King as an ancestor was truly magnificent!

If he were a lone cultivator, he naturally wouldn’t allow a Medium Saint to act all high and mighty before him. He would definitely teach him a lesson as he saw fit. However, the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was his blood and sweat, and it was something that he couldn’t sacrifice or abandon.

Thus, he didn’t explode in anger, only asking in a grave voice, “For what reason have you come?”

“Tell the detestable brat Ling Han to come out!” Zhong Ye said coldly. This brat had actually dared to kill a member of the Open Clouds Forbidden Land! Humph!

The Star Sand Saint was at a loss for words. ‘Why is it that troublemaker again?’

He couldn’t help but accept the fact that Ling Han was far too good at causing trouble.

For example, he had never seen a Saint King a dozen or so years ago. However, ever since Ling Han’s arrival at the martial arts academy, it was as if Saint Kings had suddenly become run-of-the-mill. They appeared before him one after another.

Generally speaking, it was almost impossible to come across Saint Kings, much less offend them. But Ling Han? He somehow managed to offend such beings on a regular basis. What kind of physique did he possess? Did he bear some innate grudge against Saint Kings?

“Oh, the Zhong Clan has finally come to seek me,” Ling Han said with a chuckle as he appeared. Standing beside him were the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. A Medium Saint had arrived, so they were naturally worried about Ling Han facing him alone.

Zhong Ye immediately looked toward Ling Han, and his pupils involuntarily contracted as he did so. Ling Han looked just like he did in the memory image. This was a junior who had yet to advance to the Genesis Tier.
