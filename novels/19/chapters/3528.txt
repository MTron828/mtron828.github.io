Chapter 3529: Legends on the Sea

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor; Henyee Translations

Boom, along with the fog, there was also a large wave that surged over, crashing heavily onto the hull, causing quite a number of people to be sent flying. Some had even fallen into the sea.

Splash, splash, it was as if dumplings were dropped into the sea

Thankfully, after the wave had passed, it stopped, and the ship swayed a few times before regaining its stability. Everyone hurriedly threw down ropes to save them. However, the fog was really too thick. It could be said that even if they stretched out their hands, they would not be able to see their fingers clearly. If they were struck too far away by the wave, to say nothing of ropes, they would not even be able to see the large ship.

Everyone was shouting loudly, using their voices to guide the rescuers.

Ling Han grabbed a rope and directly jumped off the ship. After activating his Eye Technique, he could already see a person. After he landed, he picked that person up, and xiu, tossed him towards the deck.

He did not stop, and grabbed the rope with his hand. The tip of his foot tapped repeatedly on the body of the ship, and very soon, he found a second person. Using the same method, he tossed the latter onto the deck.

Three, four, five. Some were thrown up in a daze, while others were extremely defensive, and actually launched an attack when he was rescuing them.

Thankfully, the abilities of those who would fall off the ship were too weak, so how could they possibly wound Ling Han?

In just a few minutes, Ling Han circled around the large ship, saving at least twenty people.

Upon calculation, this number exceeded more than half of the people who had fallen into the water.

He returned to the deck, and instantly, a great many people ran over to thank him, but there were also some that looked disdainful, as if they thought that saving this kind of trash would lower their own status.

Strangely, looking outside the ship, the visibility was no more than a foot, but the deck was extraordinarily clear, as if this fog could not invade the ship.

“It’S over! It’s over!” A sailor slumped down, his eyes lifeless, appearing to be incomparably hopeless.

Immediately, other sailors walked over, whispering softly, causing the other party to fall silent.

“Hey, hey, hey, what are you guys talking about?” A passenger was displeased, -What do you mean it’s over? Is there something strange about this fog?” “It’s fine, it’s fine,” several sailors said with a smile. However, their smiles were slightly fake.

“What on earth is going on?” This made even more people shiver. With a single look, they could tell that something was off. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Under everyone’s relentless questioning, the captain of the ship was forced to come out and explain to everyone.

“Previously, there were also ships that had encountered the fog, and had been trapped for a long time. Furthermore, there were some sailors and passengers that had mysteriously disappeared, and they have not been found even now.” “Missing mysteriously? Haha, could it be that they have been eaten by the sea monsters?” Immediately, someone laughed.

“In short, everyone must be careful. It is best that you stay together, and do not split up,” the captain of the ship said very seriously.

Seeing how serious his expression was, some who wanted to refute him did not speak further. Though the cultivators were all very confident, and did not believe in ghosts and gods, and only believed in themselves, the fog this time was too strange, so they had no choice but to be serious.

“Everyone, don’t be too nervous. This fog usually only lasts until the next morning. Though it will delay us for some time, it will definitely disperse,” the ship’s boss said.

“So, you plan to stop the ship and wait here for more than half a day?” someone immediately shouted.

This won the agreement of a great many people, and they all began to shout. Under the powerful pressure, the captain could only continue to set sail, but it was unknown whether this area of fog was astonishingly large. They sailed for half an hour, and there wasn’t the slightest sign of them sailing out of the fog. Meanwhile, Ling Han could see very clearly that the ship was actually circling around in this area.

It was not that the captain of the ship had done it on purpose, but rather because of the undercurrent, which had unknowingly changed the course of the ship, causing them to keep circling around.

With Ling Han’s present speed, there was no need for him to run at full speed. It was enough for him to tread on the waves as if he was walking on flat land, but he did not even know where the Ethereal Peak was. Furthermore, even if he ran in that direction, he could possibly miss it by a slight difference.

After all, to the vast sea, an island and a mountain were really too small.

Thus, if he travelled on his own, it was possible that it would be even more time-consuming. Ling Han was willing to wait for more than half a day.

—There were a great many people that had the same idea as him. After all, once they advanced into Blood Transformation Tier, they would be able to possess double the speed of sound, which was enough for them to walk on

water.

Everyone gradually calmed down. Since they could not leave this godforsaken place for the moment, they would just have to be patient. In any case, they would only have to wait for half a day.

Being enshrouded in fog, it was obviously not night yet, but it was already dusky. The ship’s boss had someone light torches. In such a dark environment, it was easy to develop negative emotions.

Some people were unwilling to give up. They picked up a torch and threw it into the fog, but as soon as they threw it out, it disappeared.

“That’s right!” The captain of the ship seemed to have suddenly thought of something, “At night, there would also be a mysterious song playing. Everyone must cover your ears. It is said that a great many people disappeared because

they heard the song.”

There were many rumors on the sea. For example, there was a super-large whirlpool that swallowed giant ships, and there was also a Black Tortoise that was even larger than a city. With a flip of its body, it could set off huge waves, and overturn large ships. There was also a mysterious singer that was singing,

bewitching people.

Everyone was stunned. Could it be that it was possible that they would encounter such a strange thing?

Who could sing on the seas?

-So, everyone, cover your ears first.” The captain of the ship looked at his watch, “There are still about two hours until dark. Later, let’s quickly eat. After eating, everyone should stay alert, and we can overcome the difficulties together.”

No one spoke. The atmosphere was exaggerated by the ship’s boss, making everyone’s hearts pound.

Very soon, everyone had eaten their dinner in advance. Then, they waited for night to fall, though they could not see it even in the fog, and could only judge based on the passing of time.

When night fell, everyone became nervous. What exactly was going to happen tonight?

Time passed quietly. The ship was completely silent, and the heartbeats of others could be heard.

Cultivators had vigorous blood and Qi, and their bodily functions were terrifying. Their heartbeats were also strong and powerful. Usually, they would not feel anything when they spoke or did things, but now, it was too quiet, and the sound of their heartbeats was also incredibly clear.

Tong, tong, tong! Everyone’s heartbeats rose and fell. Clearly, cotton was stuffed in their ears, yet it was useless. It was as if hearing had been magnified many times over.

“Ah!” someone suddenly screamed.

“Who?”

“Where is the murderer?”

“Get out here!”

Immediately, a great many people drew their weapons, all of them shouting, in the first place, it was just a ruckus, and a terrible scream directly ignited the nervousness in the area.

“Er…” someone said weakly, “I wasn’t attacked by anyone. I was just too nervous, and was blown by a sudden gust of wind, so I couldn’t help but call out.”

p***l

Everyone was speechless. You are really too f****** cowardly, aren’t you?

Those who had jumped out all put away their weapons, their expressions slightly sheepish.

Everyone sat back down, and the ship was once again silent.

“You, did you guys hear someone singing?” After a while, someone suddenly asked in a trembling voice..
