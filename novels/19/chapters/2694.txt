2695 A real battle

Ling Han stood upright in the air. He pondered for a while, and said, “You are right.”

“Ling Han, it’s about time that you stop while you are ahead,” Yun Haoyang persuaded. “Being an Eighth Heaven Celestial King and yet having achieved such battle merit. If word gets out, your reputation will not be matched by another Celestial King! I need a genius like you in the Realm Battlefield. I am unwilling to kill you, so don’t force my hand!”

This was naturally delaying tactics. As someone of a dignified Heavenly-Venerable-Tier force, being blocked by an Eighth Heaven Celestial King at the door and not being able to go out was a great humiliation to the Yun Clan with each passing day.

Therefore, Yun Haoyang hoped that Ling Han might be convinced to retreat. When he completely stabilized the cultivation as Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, or when the clan’s grand elder returned, killing Ling Han would naturally be effortless and gratifying.

!!

Now, he would just let the brat be happy and pleased with himself.

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face as he said, “Yun Haoyang, come out to fight. This time I will reciprocate accordingly as well!”

It was only just now that Ling Han realized that every time Yun Haoyang launched a powerful attack, he would evade. Although this kind of battle was a little stressful, and would injure him, he himself knew that it wouldn’t endanger his life. That being the case, how would he then be able to squeeze out his potential and break through to the Ninth Heaven using the hands of Yun Haoyang?

Ling Han needed real pressure that could make him feel like his life was on the line, and that he could fall at the slightest misstep.

Therefore, he needed to battle again, and this time he wouldn’t dodge Yun Haoyang’s powerful attack.

Yet, Yun Haoyang nearly exploded with anger. He had already lowered his stance and given advice in a coaxing manner, but Ling Han was still being stubborn and determined to stand against the Yun Clan.

The words of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate were that insignificant in value?

Yun Haoyang’s face was full of sternness, and this time he was really angry.

“Since you are stubborn, I will let you taste regret,” he said word by word.

Ling Han stopped talking nonsense, raised both fists, and directly launched himself to attack Yun Yanghao.

He wanted to put himself in an extremely dangerous situation where he could fall at every turn, forcing himself to exert every single bit of his potential.

“You are really arrogant!!” Yun Haoyang was mad with fury. Without the help of the Heavenly Venerate Tool, what did Ling Han have to be worthy of fighting against him?

Peng!

With just one blow, Ling Han vomited blood. The Indestructible Celestial King Physique could make him fearless when fighting against a Celestial King at the peak of the Ninth Heaven, but when he faced a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, a single blow was enough to give him serious injuries.

“Come again!” Ling Han burst out laughing. He found that his blood was boiling with excitement.

It turned out that he had been wrong all this time. Although he had been challenging a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he had always been fighting with guerilla tactics. Could that even be referred to as a battle?

A battle had to be vigorous and intense, with one having to fight desperately when confronting mortal danger and overcoming the danger for survival.

“You’re really courting death!” Yun Haoyang sneered. He didn’t know what had happened to Ling Han, but Ling Han’s willingness to fight with him was exactly what he wanted.

He just hoped that this brat wouldn’t escape again.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two attacked one another, and Ling Han was in an absolutely unfavorable situation. Every time they attacked each other, he spurted blood. After about a dozen times, he even broke his bones.

But all the while, Ling Han neither retreated nor took out the Divine Demon Sword.

He was burning with fighting spirit, and with the channeling of Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, the speed of recovery from his wounds was astonishing.

Fight, fight, fight, he was like a madman.

Yun Haoyang was a little shocked. Was it so difficult to kill a puny Eighth Heaven Celestial King? A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had made his move, and they had already exchanged a few hundred blows, but Ling Han was still gritting his teeth and preservering. Anyone seeing this scene would be emotionally moved.

What made Yun Haoyang worry even more was that it was possible for Ling Han to experience a breakthrough and take the last step of the Celestial King Tier in such a bloody battle.

If it was another person, even if that person was a Celestial King at the peak of the Ninth Heaven, Yun Haoyang would have nothing to fear, and could even suppress him with only one hand, but Ling Han was different. This brat had already achieved such battle merit when he was at the Eighth Heaven, so he would be a rival of the same level upon entering the Ninth Heaven, and with the help of the Divine Demon Sword, it was really possible that Ling Han would be able to suppress Yun Haoyang in reverse.

He definitely couldn’t allow this brat to experience a breakthrough!

Yun Haoyang went all out, intending to kill Ling Han with thunderous force.

Ling Han was fighting hard in an extremely difficult battle. Even though Yun Haoyang did not use the Heavenly Venerate Technique, when a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate made a move, how terrifying would the power of the blow be?

Ling Han’s injuries were getting more and more severe, but the fighting spirit that emanated from him was in fact getting stronger and stronger, rising into the sky like a fire beacon and solidifying. His face was already stained red with blood, exuding a ferocious aura like a wounded lone wolf. His counterattacks would only become swifter and harsher.

Even Yun Haoyang didn’t dare to be careless. Although Ling Han didn’t use the Divine Demon Sword, he could still pose a considerable threat to him by using the Heavenly Venerate Technique. He absolutely did not want to get injured at the hands of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, not even slightly. This would cause him to be ridiculed for an eternity.

‘Die, die, die,’ he cried in his heart. Even the composure of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was shaken.

But Ling Han just didn’t die. He was astonishingly tenacious. After being suppressed, he would immediately rebound. Moreover, the harder he was suppressed, the stronger was the strength of the rebound.

Yun Yanghao sighed, and had to admit that he really couldn’t do anything about Ling Han with conventional battle prowess.

He had to launch an ultimate powerful attack.

He put some distance between himself and Ling Han, spread out both his hands to form a bow, and weng, a golden arrow was immediately formed.

Even Yun Yanghao wasn’t able to use this kind of powerful attack several times consecutively, as it involved the unique power of heaven and earth. He could only extract it to temper himself, but could not directly use it against the enemy. However, even if there was only a trace of it, just a little bit, this was a power that superseded the Regulations.

It would crush and destroy everything. Anyone whose strength was below a Heavenly Venerate’s wouldn’t be able to block it.

Ling Han’s hair stood on ends immediately. His first reaction was to run away, but the urge to escape was forcefully suppressed by him.

If he wanted to break through, he had to force himself into complete desperation, and then be reborn from the ashes, soaring into the sky.

‘Come!’

He channeled the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll and increased his power infinitely.

Not running?

Yun Haoyang was stunned at first, and then overjoyed. This was a Heavenly Venerate Technique he was using, and even the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would not dare to confront it, but Ling Han, an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, intended to take it head-on. This was truly bringing about his own destruction.

However, this suited him.

‘This time… really go meet your doom.’

Xiu, Yun Haoyang loosened his hand and shot the golden arrow.

Too fast! The arrow directly crushed the space with tu, tu, tu, leaving a ripple of Regulations behind it, and appeared in front of Ling Han in a flash.

“Break!” Ling Han threw his fist, and zi, nine-colored thunder was wrapped around his fist.

With this punch, he channeled two Heavenly Venerate Techniques simultaneously, causing the flesh and blood of his entire arm to burst at the same time.

Compared to when he had been at the Seventh Heaven, his physique had not improved, but as his cultivation level became higher, of course his battle prowess also became stronger, but this made the backlash become stronger as well, causing greater damage to his body.

Peng!

This punch hit the golden arrow, and endless brilliance flashed. At this moment, heaven and earth became pale due to it.

Countless stars were shaken down, as if it were raining.

Did Ling Han block the golden arrow?

No!

Even the combination of two Heavenly Venerate Techniques wasn’t able to do it, and Ling Han’s entire arm… was currently only left with the skeleton, which instantly turned into countless pieces of broken bones, dispersing violently in all directions, while only part of the energy of the golden arrow was consumed, and it continued to shoot towards Ling Han.

Ling Han let out a loud roar, circulating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to the extreme, and golden seals began appearing on his body one after another.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
