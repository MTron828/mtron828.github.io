Chapter 1588: Chiding Heaven Demons

Ling Han flipped through Hu Feng’s Spatial Spirit Tool. Most of its contents were True Origin Stones, with a small number of alchemical pills, but he did not discover the presence of any Saintly medicine.

True, even if they did have Saintly medicine, it would be stored in the Eight Stones Forbidden Land to be consumed when needed.

Time passed, day after day. In any case, Ling Han spent his days concocting alchemical pills and cultivating, so he completely did not feel that the time was hard to pass.

He had seen the conflict between Ouyang Taishan and the other Heaven Demons, which made him feel slightly better. At least there was someone that had not betrayed him, and was standing on his side.

A Celestial King technique and Celestial Tool were much too important. There were powerful figures endlessly coming from the nine great Forbidden Lands, from both the conservative party and open-minded party. However, now the problem was no longer about whether to maintain a conservative or an open-minded attitude.

There was only a single Celestial Tool, so they just set it aside first. Who did not want to obtain a Celestial King technique?

After cultivating such a technique, there was no need to wait for the merging of the two Realms, and they could directly achieve success in one go!

The merging of the two Realms was a theoretical possibility, but who knew how many years it would take for the two Realms to completely merge even if there was someone that had successfully merged the Regulations of the two Realms taking the role of a core?

100,000,000 years? A billion years? Ten billion years? This was in no way more of a guarantee than directly cultivating a Celestial King technique!

Thus, the open-minded party was also divided into two. The majority supported the actions of the conservative party, demanding that Ling Han hand over the Celestial King technique. As for the Celestial Tool, there was only one, so they could slowly discuss its ownership.

There were pitifully few big shots that shared the same opinion as Ouyang Taishan—there were only a total of three of them along with him—yet there were as many as 25 big shots standing opposite them.

The true big shots were Heaven Demons, at least, and there were a few of them that were big shots even among Heaven Demons.

The grand elder of the Tan Clan had also come, bringing with him another Heaven Demon who was much younger. The latter would inherit his position and protect the Tan Clan in future.

“Where is the brat?” the grand elder of the Tan Clan asked immediately after he arrived, flames that took the form of two fiery dragons bursting from his nostrils. Those were flames that could turn even the stars in the skies into ash.

“He hasn’t appeared,” a Heaven Demon answered.

Ling Han did not appear, and they could do nothing about it. They could only sit in a cross-legged position in the surrounding area.

Beneath them, there were also a great many Earth Demons and Black Demons, but they were not qualified to sit on equal level with the Heaven Demons. They could only sit in the area at the back. There was even less need to mention the disciples; they were watching from an even farther distance away.

Ling Han was also very carefree in the Black Tower. He was not anxious in the slightest, so he would just keep these people hanging.

He made some queries of Small Tower, and understood the abilities of every single elite in this place.

Peak stage Heaven Demons, nine of them. Heaven Demons beneath that, 16 people. Earth Demons, 37 people. Black Demons, 51 people. As for Yellow Demons, ho, they were uncountable.

Ling Han calculated internally. Those that could become tough opponents for him would be those nine peak stage Heaven Demons, but Ouyang Taishan could be excluded. Additionally, there were also another two peak stage Heaven Demons that he suspected were Ouyang Taishan’s allies.

25 Heaven Demons!

This lineup was a little frightening, but thankfully there were only nine peak stage Heaven Demons. Furthermore, if Ouyang Taishan and his companions could help him block a few of them, there were actually not many peak stage Heaven Demons that he had to face at the same time.

“I’ll just use a minor power boost. After all, it is only those few peak stage Heaven Demons that make me feel that they are more problematic,” Ling Han mumbled. “I’m really poor, so I have to be thrifty in my use. When I return to the Immortal Realm, I still have to face the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, so I have to save a few tricks up my sleeve.”

He smiled at the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and said, “My two wives, allow me to venture out for a short while.”

“Be careful.” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden finally showed a caring, gentle expression.

The Empress was very imperious, and declared, “Just beat the crap out of them!” She had utter confidence in Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, and with a flash of his figure, he appeared in the outside world.

“Hey, hey, hey, let me make things clear first...” He pressed down his hand. “If anyone makes a move on me, I guarantee that I will disappear immediately.”

With these words, all the big shots halted their advance. They had absolutely not discovered how Ling Han had appeared; this kind of ability had surpassed their imagination, and also allowed them to realize that if Ling Han truly wanted to vanish, it was not something that they could stop.

“Young man, the Celestial King technique is much too important, and is not something that you can possess alone,” a Heaven Demon spoke. “Hand it over. As for the trouble you have caused, we can lighten your punishment on the basis of your merit in handing over the Celestial King technique.”

“Humph!” The grand elder of the Tan Clan was extremely displeased; the people that had died were all the members of the Tan Clan!

Ling Han swept an eye over the grand elder of the Tan Clan, pointed at him, and declared, “I am extremely displeased with the attitude of this old guy; who among you can drive him away?”

“Brat!” The grand elder of the Tan Clan suddenly moved in fury, and directed a slap at Ling Han.

Shua, Ling Han’s figure immediately vanished.

He was gone in front of the eyes of those many big shots just like that.

They couldn’t find him; there was completely no trace left of him.

Finally, all the Heaven Demons had to admit that they truly could do nothing against Ling Han.

Two days later, Ling Han reappeared, and said, “Have you all learnt your lesson? I will say it one more time, and it will also be the last time. if anyone still makes a move on me, then I will not appear again... for eternity!”

All the Heaven Demons were flushing from his chiding, yet they all suppressed their emotions. There was nothing else they could do. In the face of a Celestial King technique, so what if they had to swallow their anger for this moment?

Ouyang Taishan, meanwhile, stroked his beard, and showed a sliver of a smile. Previously, his expression had been stern, but seeing all the Heaven Demons admit defeat now made his feelings suddenly turn to delight.

Only then did Ling Han nod his head. “Fine then, then let us now talk.”

“Brat—” a Heaven Demon spoke up.

“What brat, and old man, you have been living for so long, and all your years of living have gone to waste? Don’t tell me that you do not know how to respect others?” Ling Han immediately chided him, completely not treating the former as a noble and powerful Heaven Demon.

That old Heaven Demon couldn’t help but turn green in fury. If it was any other person who had spoken so rudely to him, it would be simple—he just had to kill him with a single slap. However, the problem was that he couldn’t make a move now. This was really infuriating.

“Now you are the ones begging me, so your attitude had better be proper,” Ling Han continued.

“Young friend Ling!” another Heaven Demon spoke up.

“Now this is the correct attitude.” Ling Han turned towards that Heaven Demon. “Old mister, how do I address you?”

That Heaven Demon couldn’t stop his expression from darkening. Old mister? He was the strongest existence of the Netherworld, so how had he suddenly become an old mister?

“Young friend Ling, what do you want to be willing to hand over the Celestial King technique?” a third Heaven Demon asked. This was the proper business here; Ling Han couldn’t be allowed to bring them off track again.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and turned to the grand elder of the Tan Clan, deliberately pasting an expression of shock on his face. “Yi, why is this old geezer still here?’

The grand elder of the Tan Clan wanted to make a move again. Previously, someone called you brat, and you claimed that it was disrespectful, yet now you yourself were calling others ‘old geezer’, so why were you not talking about respect now?

But when he recalled Ling Han’s previous threat, he could only suppress this kind of urge, though his expression looked considerably worse than before. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I was willing to come out to meet you all, and this is my sincerity. So, you all should show some of your sincerity, all right?” Ling Han pointed at the grand elder of the Tan Clan, and then waved his fingers as if he was driving someone away.

The Heaven Demons felt like they were close to being driven mad. Previously, it was Ling Han himself who wanted the grand elder of the Tan Clan to come here, yet now he was driving the latter away. ‘Your attitude has changed a little too fast, hasn’t it?’
