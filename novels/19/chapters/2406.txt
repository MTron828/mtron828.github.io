Chapter 2407: Chairperson of Alchemy City!

“Daring to harm members of our Qin Clan, you people are truly outrageously bold!” that Dividing Soul Tier elite of the Qin Clan stated coldly.

Though he was only a Yang Soul, how could that not be enough to suppress mere Severing Mundane Tier?

“Just average,” Ling Han replied, smiling.

“Humph, today, Young Master Yun is also here. We will give you a chance. Kowtow and beg for forgiveness, then agree to the conditions that we have previously set, and we will spare your lives!” that Yang Soul elite of the Qin Clan declared. “Otherwise, this town will be pacified, and whether male or female, young or old, everyone will be executed!”

“Execute, execute your head!” Fu Gaoyun suddenly flipped out, grabbing hold of that Yang Soul elite and thrashing him immediately.

Firstly, he was superior by two minor levels, and secondly, he had the aptitude of a king tier, so how could the other party be his match? Thirdly, which was also the most important point, if the young master of the Fu Clan wanted to beat anyone up, would the latter dare to dodge?

But no one from the Qin Clan knew why this young lord had suddenly flipped out; could it be that he had lost his senses?

But Young Master Fu was presently at the height of his temper, so who would dare try to play mediator? They were all feeling uneasy, hoping that Young Master Fu would quickly stop his rage. Otherwise, what if he did some even stranger actions, like ***** or something, who could take that?

“Brother Ling!” After Fu Gaoyun had beaten up that Yang soul elite of the Qin Clan, he was immediately all smiles as he raced towards Ling Han.

Oh no, oh no, Young Master Fu was really quite ill, actually calling someone brother!

This was Young Master of the Fu Clan, the heir of a three-star force, and he actually called a member of a mere Severing Mundane Tier force brother. He was probably so ill that his brain had been burnt out, right?

But realization still dawned on some of the smarter ones. They felt like their b*tt cheeks were actually trembling, terrified beyond description.

Ling Han nodded. “You’re living quite well, having gotten so many lackeys.”

Fu Gaoyun was almost scared to death, and hurriedly exclaimed, “Brother Ling, don’t tease me. How could these be my lackeys? We were just going the same way, and there is absolutely no relation between us at all.”

He drew a clear, distinct dividing line between them, naturally because of who Ling Han was.

Who was Ling Han?

Aside from his freakish talent, merely in terms of status, he was the chairperson of Alchemy City. He was the leader of a four-star force. To say nothing of himself, even if his old man came, he would still have to be very respectful towards Ling Han.

It could be claimed that the fact that he had been able to become the only heir, when he had only been one of them, was also because of his relation with Ling Han.

Then it was naturally easy for him to take sides. Furthermore, the reason why he had come was indeed because he was too bored. What friendship did he have with the Qin Clan?

The people of the Qin Clan were all dumbfounded. In their eyes, Fu Gaoyun was the greatest big shot in the world, but just in the blink of an eye, this Young Master Fu became an obedient child. Their eyeballs were practically about to pop out of their heads in their shock.

This, this, this, this, just who exactly was this young man? He was a little too terrifying, wasn’t he?

Fu Gaoyun turned his head, and immediately shouted at them fiercely, “Get over here and pay your greetings to Brother Ling!”

“G-greetings, Brother Ling!” Though the members of the Qin Clan were still dazed, how could they possibly disregard the words of Fu Gaoyun? They hurriedly lowered their heads and bowed. Merely Fu Gaoyun alone was not someone they could trifle with, what more when Ling Han seemed have an even more powerful background.

Ling Han chuckled. “I would not dare presume. Aren’t these people here to get revenge?”

“Brother Ling, please don’t harbor any grievances.” Fu Gaoyun hurriedly mediated the strife. If Alchemy City really raged because of this matter, then to say nothing of the fact that Qin Clan would be finished, even their Fu Clan would not be having a good time, either.

Now, he could put himself in the shoes of the clan leader of Fu Clan to consider problems, or his reaction would definitely have been “It has nothing to do with me, so why do I need to interfere?”.

Ling Han looked meaningfully at Fu Gaoyun. They had parted for several tens of thousands of years, and this guy had also grown enough—not in cultivation level, but rather mindset.

He nodded. “Fine then, this matter is considered over and done with.”

“Thank you, Brother Ling!” Fu Gaoyun was overjoyed, and then delivered a series of punches and kicks at the members of Qin Clan. “What are you guys waiting for? Hurry up and thank my brother Ling.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Thank you for your magnanimous generosity, Brother Ling.” Everyone hurriedly bowed down again.

Ling Han did not like this kind of thing, so let them stand back up with a wave of his hand.

“Gaoyun, since you are already here, let’s have a cup of tea.” Ling Han turned and left.

Fu Gaoyun agreed, and was just about to walk forwards when he heard the other Dividing Soul Tier elite of the Qin Clan ask, “Young Master Yun, who exactly is this Brother Ling?”

This question also caused a great many members of the Qin Clan to prick up their ears.

They were too curious. Even Fu Gaoyun would lower his head and bow to this guy, so just how powerful would his background have to be?

At first, Fu Gaoyun was planning to ignore them as these people had almost caused him a heart attack, but upon further thought, to prevent them from causing further trouble, he asked, “Do you all know of the Alchemy City?”

Everyone nodded. As long as they were cultivators, there was no one who did not know of Alchemy City. That was the holy land for all alchemists, and practically every single alchemist would have come from the Alchemy City.

“Brother Ling is the new chairperson of Alchemy City!” Fu Gaoyun threw a bombshell at them.

Boom!

Every member of the Qin Clan was gaping in shock, feeling their heads go numb and a chill take over their whole bodies.

As it turned out… Ling Han’s background was actually so astonishing!

Everyone was terrified. This was the new chairperson of Alchemy City, who had overwhelming authority and power. Still, Ling Han was a little too young, wasn’t he? He looked completely like a young brat, so it was hard to believe.

But if that wasn’t the case, how could Fu Gaoyun need to be so humble in front of him?

Everyone was feeling even more anxious. If Ling Han was not willing to let go of the issue, he would only need to say a few words, and it was guaranteed that there would be a lot of people that would come to destroy the Qin Clan.

Who did not want to curry favor with an alchemist? What more when Ling Han was also the leader of the field of alchemy of the Eastern Celestial Realm. Even Celestial Kings would probably have to give him some face when they saw him.

The members of the Qin Clan hurriedly followed them in, begging for Ling Han’s forgiveness again.

Ling Han was very irritated, and tossed them all out. The members of the Qin Clan all felt very uneasy, and could not calm their emotions no matter what.

Meanwhile, Ling Han entertained Fu Gaoyun. The relations between this brat and Ling Han were considered quite amicable. Immediately, he shamelessly called his sister over as well, along with the weirdo, Situ Xiaozhen.

When Fu Xiaoyun saw Ling Han, she first curtseyed respectfully, sighing internally. This predestined chance was really missed. Otherwise, if she had expressed true love and affection for Ling Han, who knew, she might have been able to become one of his women.

Since Situ Xiaozhen was a weirdo, her behavior was naturally out of the norm. She surveyed Ling Han for a while, and then asked curiously, “With how many wives you have, where do you find the time?”

Even if Ling Han was already extraordinarily shameless, he couldn’t help but flush when he heard this. This was truly a female hooligan; from the look of things, there was no chance of changing ever.

He acted like he had not heard her, and simply toasted cups with Fu Gaoyun and drinking.

He stayed for a few days in Separation Resentment City. The higher-ups of the Fu Clan all came to pay him a visit one after another, and for Fu Gaoyun’s sake, Ling Han also entertained them.

However, Yue Zhen Shan and the others were not willing to leave with Ling Han to the Western Celestial Realm. They were already accustomed to living here, and even Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing already had their respective lovers, and were no longer willing to just roam the world again.

Ling Han expressed that he would respect their wishes.

Ling Dongxing and his wife also expressed that they would like to stay here. After all, there were people that they knew here, so it could be considered their hometown.

Ling Han nodded. There was only one thought in his head now—to help his parents and the others reach the peak stage of the Ascending Origin Tier in 30,000 years as much as possible. Then, when he concocted Celestial King Pills, everyone could become Celestial Kings, and he could also head to a transcendent dimension without any lingering worries.
