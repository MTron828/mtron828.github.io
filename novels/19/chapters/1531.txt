1532 Who Can Withstand a Single Strike of Mine?

Hu Yingmu’s body was shrouded in a layer of dazzling light. Looking closely, the cultivators discovered that this was actually a precious robe. There were several glowing divine patterns on this robe, and it was as if heaven and earth were expounding some profoundly mysterious notion.

Hu Yingmu hadn’t been able to resist the attack of the Great Saint because of his own abilities, but rather because of this precious robe!

In fact, this was much more understandable. If he truly had been that powerful, then wouldn’t he have suppressed the Tranquil Heart Saint and the other Small Saint long ago?

“Hahahaha!” Hu Yingmu roared with laughter. “You people are nothing but a smattering of ants! Yet, you actually attempted to injure me? Where is your confidence coming from?”

‘Audacious! How incredibly audacious! In any case, it’s not as if you genuinely have the power to resist the attack of a Saint!’

Hu Yingmu peered down at the cultivators, and said, “What a bunch of trash. You people will still be trash even if you manage to reach the Saint Tier!” This was the sense of superiority that those from the Forbidden Lands possessed. Hu Yingmu held an innate disdain for those of the Immortal Realm, especially since he had viewed himself as a descendent from the Celestial Realm since the very beginning. He was convinced that he would one day return to the Celestial Realm.

The Star Sand Saint’s voice rang out again. “Your precious robe isn’t truly woven from Saintly Material. Rather, it’s like a decree in that there’s a limit regarding how long it can be used for. So, how long can you withstand my attacks for?”

“I can withstand 100 of your attacks without a problem,” Hu Yingmu replied confidently. He retrieved a drum, and said, “This is a Child-Parent Drum, and once I strike it and channel my divine sense into it, I’ll be able to instantly teleport to the location of the parent drum.

“You’re a Great Saint, and I’m indeed unable to rival you. However, there are three Saint Kings in the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, and any one of them possesses the ability to reign supreme over the entire world. Are you sure you want to provoke the ancestors of my clan?”

This was a blatant threat.

However, this threat was very effective.

Saint Kings!

What kind of concept was this? These were beings who were unrivaled throughout heaven and earth. They were the most powerful beings of the Immortal Realm!

The gulf between Saint Kings and Great Saints was like the gulf between Great Saints and Small Saint. They would possess a definite and overwhelming advantage.

If they truly provoked a Saint King, what kind of calamity would they be bringing upon themselves?

‘Heavens! There are genuinely Saint Kings in this world?’

‘Is he bluffing?’

The 10 Saints all shook their heads. With their experience, they could naturally determine the level of the divine patterns on Hu Yingmu’s precious robe. It had indeed surpassed the level of Great Saint. In other words, there was indeed a Saint King within the Eight Stones Forbidden Land.

Of course, it was still anyone’s guess if there was one Saint King or three.

The Star Sand Saint remained silent, and his nine disciples also remained silent.

“Hahahaha!” Only Hu Yingmu’s wanton and arrogant laugh reverberated throughout the surroundings. “What a bunch of weaklings. It’s not that I’m looking down on you, but I can withstand the strike of a Great Saint. However, which of you can withstand a single strike of mine?”

‘Is this even comparable?

‘You’re wearing a precious robe, and this is the only reason you were able to withstand the attack of the Great Saint. It wasn’t through your own abilities. However, you’re using this as a foundation for your arrogance, and you’re even looking down on the 10 Saints. This is crossing the line!’

However, who dared to retort him?

He had withstood the attack from the Star Sand Saint. However, among those below the level of Great Saint, who could withstand a single strike of his?

“Is there anyone? Is there?!” Hu Yingmu shouted arrogantly. “You’re nothing but a bunch of weaklings. Am I wrong to say this?”

“You’re pushing it!” the Star Sand Saint humphed. Hu Yingmu was a Small Saint, yet he actually dared to display such unbridled arrogance before him. How many years had it been since he had experienced such provocation and disrespect?

Hu Yingmu reeled himself in a little, but there was still a cold sneer on his face. “My request still remains the same. Hand the culprit over, hand the treasures over, and hand that woman over! Otherwise, you can also select a person from among you. If they can withstand a single strike of mine, I’ll retract my previous statements and even offer an apology. I’ll then leave straight away.”

The nine Saints were infuriated upon hearing this. Hu Yingmu still dared to issue such blatantly unfair challenges!

They were already showing incredible restraint by allowing him to go free.

“If you refuse, I’ll invite the ancestor of the Forbidden Land over!” Hu Yingmu said menacingly. “At that time, all of you will only have the option of death!”

‘How incredibly arrogant!’

The disciples were all outraged. ‘Even if you’re a Saint, you’re still taking things too far!’

“Let me go!”

“Let me go!”

“I’ll face his attack!”

Numerous hot-blooded youths stepped forward and volunteered to accept Hu Yingmu’s challenge. In fact, there were many big shots among these volunteers. These were supreme prodigies, and they were cultivators who were birthed and nurtured by heaven and earth. They possessed power that was unimaginable to most people. Moreover, they were only a step away from reaching the Saint Tier. However, this single step was like the insurmountable gulf between heaven and earth.

“All of you get back!” the Tranquil Heart Saint chided.

The disciples all felt extremely aggrieved. The Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was a holy land for the hundreds of nearby galaxies. Whenever one mentioned the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, it was as if they were talking about a pilgrimage site. This was a holy land that had produced countless powerful elites.

Now, however, a single outsider had intruded and trampled all of them under his feet!

This was both humiliating and infuriating!

“In fact, I won’t mind if one of you nine accepts this challenge, either!” Hu Yingmu said as he looked toward the nine Saints.

This... They were all Small Saints, so how could the nine Saints fail to block just one of his strikes?

The Tranquil Heart Saint stepped forward, and said, “I’ll battle against you!”

“You’re not worthy!” Hu Yingmu said with a shake of his head. There was disdain in his voice, and he continued, “You definitely won’t be able to withstand a single strike of mine!”

Upon seeing the expression of fury on the Tranquil Heart Saint’s face, he asked, “Did you think I was fighting with my full power just then?”

‘What?!’

The Tranquil Heart Saint pondered this question for a moment. In the end, he couldn’t help but shake his head. He refused to believe that Hu Yingmu was this powerful.

“If you can withstand a single strike of mine, I’ll immediately turn around and leave.” Hu Yingmu lifted a finger and made a tapping motion at the Tranquil Heart Saint.

Weng!

His precious robe lit up, with all of the divine patterns unleashing a brilliant glow. At the same time, a small black dot formed on the tip of his finger. However, this small black dot gave one a feeling of profoundness and boundlessness.

Peng!

His attack landed, and the Tranquil Heart Saint was instantly sent flying. His face was frighteningly pale, and he was coughing up large mouthfuls of blood.

Just how powerful was the Tranquil Heart Saint? Yet, he was still unable to withstand the power of a single finger from Hu Yingmu? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone was aware of what had happened. It was thanks to the might of his precious robe that Hu Yingmu had been able to defeat the Tranquil Heart Saint with a single strike. However, since this precious robe was being worn by Hu Yingmu, it could also be considered as a part of his abilities.

After all, could one request their opponent to remove all of their high-level God Tools in battle?

Of course not!

“Is there anyone else?” Hu Yingmu’s expression was full of arrogance. Sweeping his gaze over the nine Saints one by one, the corners of his lips started to curl up in an even more disdainful smile.

Even though the nine Saints were bursting with rage, not a single one of them opened their mouth to accept his challenge.

Although the Tranquil Heart Saint was the Star Sand Saint’s eighth disciple, he ranked in the top three when it came to battle prowess. However, even he had failed to withstand a single strike of Hu Yingmu. Thus, the other Saints would certainly suffer an identical fate if they stepped forward. That being the case, they would merely be seeking humiliation if they accepted Hu Yingmu’s challenge.

However, looking at his arrogant expression, how could they not shake with absolute fury?

“Is there no one else? What a bunch of weaklings!” Hu Yingmu shook his head, and continued, “Remember to inscribe the word ‘weakling’ in your minds in the future. That’s how tiny and insignificant you people are! Now, hurry up and hand me what I want!”

He was incredibly conceited. He had come from a Forbidden Land, after all, so it was as if he were a Heavenly Emperor coming out to survey the world. Those of the Immortal Realm were only worthy to kneel down in his presence.

“I’ll accept your challenge!” At this moment, a calm voice suddenly shattered the silence. At the same time, a young man stepped forward from the crowd of disciples.

Shua!

Everyone immediately turned around to look at the source of the voice.

‘Ling Han!’

No one could have ever imagined this. Even the nine Saints were unable to withstand Hu Yingmu’s might, yet Ling Han was actually stepping forward to accept his challenge.

“Senior Brother Ling!” the new disciples couldn’t help but shout. They were all incredibly moved.

They naturally didn’t believe that Ling Han was more powerful than the nine Saints. However, Ling Han had still stepped forward even after seeing one of the nine Saints being defeated with a single strike. What kind of courage did this take?

The senior disciples were also moved upon seeing this. They had all heard about Ling Han’s audacity in daring to retort the Saint Missus before. He was truly a courageous individual. However, his opponent this time was a Saint! Moreover, this was an unfathomably powerful Saint. Ling Han was gambling with his life!

Some of the disciples felt that Ling Han was incredibly foolish. They felt that he shouldn’t have acted so recklessly. However, they still admired his courage.

Perhaps he was seeking death by accepting Hu Yingmu’s challenge. However, he was also raising the morale of the entire martial arts academy!

There were things that couldn’t be abandoned, and there were also times when they couldn’t keel over and submit!
