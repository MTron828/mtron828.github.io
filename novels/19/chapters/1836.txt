Chapter 1837: Background of the Large Black Dog

“What did Ling Han do?” they all asked in curiosity.

Lin Fang glanced at Bewitching Maiden Rou before replying, “Ling Han didn’t only kill Bei Xuanming. He also killed Beiyu Xiong, Qianzhao Tian...” She reeled off a long list of names, each of which corresponded to the Holy Son, Holy Daughter, or successor of a three-star sect or three-star clan.

‘This... th-this...!’

Everyone was transfixed with shock and disbelief upon hearing this. At the same time, cold sweat trickled down their foreheads.

That Ling Han was an absolute demon! How many king tiers had he already killed?

Fortunately, he hadn’t gone on a rampage just then.

However, everyone was also feeling extremely puzzled. How would Ling Han escape after exiting the mystery realm? With so many three-star forces targeting him, could Ling Han escape death? Why did he insist on acting so wantonly?

Lin Fang didn’t reveal the news of Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng being killed by Ling Han. This was because she, along with Teng Sen and Wei Nian, wanted to personally report this news. Although they would have to face the wrath of the Celestial King Tier forces, they would also be able to make some connections with them.

Everyone shook their head upon hearing this. It was inevitable that Ling Han would be killed. Perhaps the Fu Clan could rival the Lunar Sect, but what about all of the other three-star forces? As such, Ling Han wouldn’t be able to escape death.

***

Ling Han and the Empress exited the canyon, and entered a land that no one could enter.

Ling Han was still feeling fine, yet the Empress had to channel the Flame Control Technique. Otherwise, she would be instantly incinerated by the fire particles in this region.

After arriving here, Ling Han’s Nine Heavens Flame started to pulsate in excitement, and it was as if it wanted to leap out from his dantian.

Ling Han humphed upon detecting this. Regardless of what relationship this Nine Heavens Flame had with the Celestial King of this place before, it was now a Source Power that belonged to him. As such, it could only listen to his commands. Otherwise, he would rather abandon it than keep it in his body. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After all, what use was a disobedient power? Moreover, this was a power that resided in his body. If it went wild, that would lead to unimaginable consequences.

The Nine Heavens Flame instantly calmed down and became obedient. Like a scolded child, it even expressed a feeling of grievance.

However, Ling Han was completely unfazed. When it came to matters that affected his power, he definitely had to make sure that there were no risks and mistakes.

Several hours passed, and they had already reached the foot of the volcano. Along the way, they had also obtained a huge number of Blood Dragon Stones. This was because no one else could venture into this area. As such, their yield was naturally very impressive.

This was an accumulation of hundreds of millions of years, and it could be said that they would obtain a Blood Dragon Stone each time they bent down. They didn’t need to explicitly look for them at all.

Their yield was bountiful, and Bewitching Maiden Rou was also having a great time picking up Blood Dragon Stones in the outer regions behind them.

She couldn’t reach the same depth as Ling Han and the Empress, yet she could still venture further than all of the other people. As such, her yield was naturally very impressive as well.

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s eyes were filled with curiosity as she watched Ling Han and the Empress disappear from her sight. What would they find in that volcano? When the mystery realm returned to a state of wild chaos, how would they flee from the clutches of the three-star forces?

Once news of his actions spread, almost half of the forces would target Ling Han and yearn for his death. Among these forces, there were even two Celestial King Tier forces!

‘Although you two are freakish, with one of you being at the third severance and the other at the second severance, I can’t think of any way for you to flee from the grasp of these forces.’

Ling Han and the Empress started to climb the volcano. There was no path here, yet this naturally couldn’t hold them back. They climbed the volcano with their hands and feet. Flying wasn’t an option, as the volcano was surrounded by a chaotic aura that could easily kill anyone who came into contact with it.

The erupting volcano could only suppress this chaotic aura. However, there would still be remnants of this deadly aura swirling around the volcano.

“Little Han! Hi, Little Han!” someone behind them shouted in an enthusiastic voice. They turned around, only to see the large black dog quickly bounding over. He was only using his hind legs, yet his speed was still astonishingly quick. It wasn’t long before he caught up to Ling Han and the Empress.

Ling Han was astonished, and he asked, “Why have you come over here?”

“Grandpa Dog is about to embark on a long journey, so I especially came over here to say goodbye.” The large black dog rested a paw on Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “See, Grandpa Dog is a loyal individual, isn’t he?”

Ling Han chuckled in reply. How much trouble had this detestable dog already caused for him?

‘Hang on a second...’

“You’ve never practiced the Flame Control Technique before, so how are you resisting the fire particles here?”

Even Blood Dragon Armor didn’t possess such a powerful protective ability!

Moreover, even Immortal Palace Tier elites didn’t dare to venture into this area, so how had this detestable dog managed to enter?

“Ah, this...” The large black dog scratched his head before suddenly gazing up at the sky, and saying, “The weather is fairly nice today. The moon is hanging high, and the sun is shining with such radiance!”

‘F*ck the hell off!’

Ling Han couldn’t help but ask, “Little Black, who in the world are you?”

The freakish nature of the large black dog had already exceeded the abilities of Severing Mundane Tier cultivators. Not long ago, he had even bitten a fourth severance grand elder while he was only at the Genesis Tier. This was also an incredible feat.

At the very least, Ling Han had never heard of such a freakish individual before.

The large black dog’s eyes darted about, and after a long while, he finally said, “Since it’s come to this, Grandpa Dog won’t keep you in the dark anymore. Truth be told, I’m actually your long-lost father...”

“F*ck off!” Ling Han said as he kicked the large black dog. He actually dared to take advantage of him!

The large black dog pondered for a moment before finally saying, “Alright, since I’m about to leave, I’ll tell you the truth so you aren’t always trying to rely on me.” He paused for a moment before continuing in a haughty voice, “I’m actually a Celestial King!”

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered with laughter. This detestable dog was a Celestial King? Which Celestial King would look like this? He couldn’t help but roar with laughter. However, his laughter became quieter and quieter, and in the end, he silently stared at the large black dog.

This was because the large black dog was wearing an extremely solemn expression. It didn’t look like he was joking.

If this were any other place, Ling Han would be convinced that the large black dog was joking, even if he wore such a solemn expression. However, this was indeed a place that even Immortal Palace Tier elites couldn’t reach. In other words, the large black dog was at least as powerful as an Ascending Origin Tier elite.

‘Gasp! This detestable dog wasn’t joking when he said he wanted to steal the panties of Celestial King Ling Miao?

‘This detestable dog!’

“Are you truly a Celestial King?” Ling Han asked with a serious expression.

The large black dog snickered before saying, “Just how impressive was I when I used to stride through the world? Countless female Celestial Kings yearned to become my mounts, yet I only chose the most beautiful few. Mm-hm, they were only slightly inferior to your wife.”

He glanced at the Empress as he said this.

Ling Han’s expression was solemn, and he asked, “Why are you helping me?”

The large black dog pointed at Ling Han’s dantian with a smile, and he asked, “He didn’t tell you?”

‘Small Tower?’

Ling Han’s heart shuddered. Sure enough, the large black dog and Small Tower were acquainted. They were definitely good friends! He shook his head, and replied, “No.”

The large black dog scratched his head, and said, “Back then, I was a supreme Celestial King. If I wasn’t at the ninth heaven, then I was at the eighth heaven. However, for some reason, I suffered severe wounds and entered a state of slumber in order to recover. When I opened my eyes again, eons had already passed.

“At the same time, my cultivation also fell to rock bottom. I was unable to recall the events of the past, and only when I entered the Celestial Realm did I finally regain some of my past memories. My cultivation has also returned to somewhere above the Ascending Origin Tier and below the Celestial King Tier.

“After all, it’s far too difficult to advance to the Celestial King Tier.”

Ling Han felt as if he were in a dream as he listened to the large black dog’s explanation.

Not only was this detestable dog a Celestial King, but he had even reached the pinnacle of the Celestial King Tier? He had been at the eighth or ninth heaven?

“But I still don’t understand. Why are you helping me?” Ling Han asked again.
