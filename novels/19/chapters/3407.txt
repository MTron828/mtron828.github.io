Chapter 3408: Exposed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the sky, the Demonic Monkey did not care about the people below. It was filled with hostility as it waved its iron rod and kept smashing at the white tiger.

So what if you’re a Divine Beast? I’ll beat you into submission.

This was a kind of arrogance. It was just that domineering.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The iron rod kept falling down, and the white tiger was only left with the power to parry. After hundreds of strikes, although the white tiger was not injured at all, its figure became illusory again.

It no longer resisted. Instead, it stared intently at the Demonic Monkey. Peng, with another strike, its body instantly dissipated.

The Demonic Monkey held its rod and stood proudly between heaven and earth, as if it could lift the sky even if it collapsed.

However, its figure was also blurry and suddenly disappeared.

The battle was over, in a shocking and dramatic way.

Ling Han stood, and Hu Sihai had fallen.

Who would have thought that the battle between these two would actually summon Demonic Saints from ancient times and cross the long river of history to carry out a battle of a different kind? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Was the Demonic Monkey stronger?

Perhaps, perhaps it was because the white tiger bloodline of Hu Sihai was really too thin, causing the white tiger phantom summoned to not have enough battle prowess.

‘Who knows?’

If such an existence were to appear, who knew how terrifying it would be.

Putting everything else aside, the white tiger’s body was even larger than the Celestial Sea Planet. It could shatter the Celestial Sea Planet with a single palm strike, and who would be able to survive?

“Ling Han, you’re really special!” Princess Bixiao said. “To be able to withstand the impact of aura of a Demonic Saint from the Primitive Age, what exactly is your background?”

Of course, she was exaggerating. Previously, the White Tiger and the Demonic Monkey were only phantoms. If they had actually appeared, the aura they emitted was definitely not something they could contend with.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Princess is also very extraordinary. I’m impressed.”

Princess Bixiao’s eyes emitted killing intent. Right now, everyone had fainted from the shock. If she killed Ling Han, there would be no witnesses. She would be able to escape perfectly and throw this blame to the two Demonic Saints from the primitive age.

As one of the parties involved, Ling Han had been killed by the White Tiger.

Why didn’t Hu Sihai die? It was very simple. The White Tiger had defeated the Demonic Monkey.

She thought about it and felt that it was feasible.

As for his optical computer?

Hehe, under the impact of the two Primitive Age Demonic Saints, everyone’s optical computers were destroyed. They were not damaged on the surface, but the critical parts were burned. Therefore, there would definitely be no evidence left behind.

Alarm rose in Ling Han’s heart. He knew that this Princess of the Demon Race had already wanted to kill him several times, and this time, she might really have seized an extremely good opportunity.

Still.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Sixth Baby, give me a fruit.”

“Okay, Father,” Sixth Baby agreed crisply.

Princess Bixiao couldn’t help but narrow her eyes. A fresh fruit floated up into the air and “floated” towards Ling Han.

This seemed to be the work of Spiritual Power, but Princess Bixiao was sure that this was definitely not Spiritual Power. She had also released her Spiritual Power, but she did not find any other Spiritual Power around the fruit.

Also, she heard Sixth Baby’s voice.

Hiss, an existence that could turn invisible!

Princess Bixiao immediately gave up on the idea of killing him. If she couldn’t silence all witnesses, the risk was too great. Once Chen Fengyan found out, she would definitely be buried with him.

“So, Grandmaster Ling still has this trick up his sleeve. It’s really beyond Bixiao’s expectations,” Princess Bixiao said indifferently. Suddenly, her pretty expression changed drastically, and a layer of redness appeared on her face. “You’re that thief!”

She had lost a spatial Spirit Tool. Until now, she had not discovered how it was lost. Moreover, because her undergarments were still inside, she did not even announce it.

It was only now that she realized who this mysterious thief was!

At the thought that Ling Han might have touched her undergarments with both hands, she instantly felt an indescribable sense of shame and anger.

Ling Han was stunned. He did not expect that in order to intimidate this Demon Race princess, he would accidentally expose the truth of his past actions. However, he naturally denied it, and shook his head righteously. “I wonder what the princess is talking about.”

“Keep pretending!” Princess Bi Xiao humphed. She had already determined that Ling Han was that thief. Of course, the one who had acted was “Sixth Baby”.

She really wanted to see what this Sixth Baby looked like.

Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “You’re really trying to frame me. I say, Your Highness, you can’t wrongly accuse a good person.”

Sixth Baby stuck out her tongue and thought to herself that this father was really shameless. However, she liked this. It would be too boring if he went by the rules too much.

Ling Han walked up to Hu Sihai and stopped in his tracks.

“What do you want to do?” Princess Bixiao asked, her voice slightly cold. If Ling Han dared to take the opportunity to harm Hu Sihai, she would definitely not sit idly by.

Although the Demon Race was subservient, they would definitely not be at the mercy of the humans.

Ling Han smiled, took out a brush, and drew a few strokes on Hu Sihai’s head, saying, “Don’t worry, I’m not taking the opportunity to take his life.”

When Princess Bixiao saw this, she couldn’t help but feel both angry and amused.

“Yup!”

“Eh?”

“Ah—”

At this moment, everyone woke up one by one. Those with high cultivation level and natural talent came back to consciousness earlier, while those with low cultivation level and natural talent woke later. However, there was not much difference between waking up earlier or later. It was only a few minutes. “What in the world happened?”

“I think I saw a huge White Tiger, even bigger than a planet.”

“There’s also a Demonic Monkey that seems to be holding up the sky.”

“The Demonic Monkey and the White Tiger fought.”

“And then we passed out.”

Everyone talked at once and gradually pieced together what had happened previously.

“You fainted?”

“You fainted too?”

Meanwhile, Ling Han beckoned to Princess Bixiao, and said, “Come, my bet.”

“I didn’t lose!” Hu Sihai roared.

Ling Han chuckled, and pointed at Hu Sihai’s forehead.

Hu Sihai was stunned. He looked at the person beside him and saw the other party burst out laughing.

‘What do you mean, what’s so funny about me?’

“Brother Hu, your forehead—” The man stopped.

“Hahaha!” Everyone was still shocked by the White Tiger and the Demonic Monkey, but after being reminded, many gazes landed on Hu Sihai’s face and they immediately burst out laughing.

Hu Sihai didn’t know what was going on and hurriedly went to look in the mirror. He almost fainted from anger.

It turned out that the word “King” had been drawn on his forehead?.

Needless to say, it was definitely done by Ling Han.

This meant that if the other party wanted to take his life, it would have been easy.

But damn it, what do you mean by ‘king’? Do you think I’m a tiger?

Although I am indeed a tiger, it felt very awkward to have the word “King” painted on my face.

He was too ashamed to see anyone, so he quickly flew away.

Princess Bixiao was begrudging, and could only throw the Green Algae Gold to Ling Han.

Ling Han coughed, and said, “If you want to challenge me, you can register with Xuanyuan Dingguo. I will reply within three days whether I will accept the challenge or not. However, don’t forget my rules. Remember to clearly state what bet you have placed.”
