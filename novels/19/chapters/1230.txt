Chapter 1231: Admit I’m Stronger

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘Is he bluffing?’

Han Xinyan wasn’t sure. The man before her was far too confident. Either he was truly confident, or he was an absolute madman.

“Fine then, we’ll refine Level Eight Divine Pills!” she said solemnly.

Right now, she was genuinely taking him seriously. She didn’t dare to underestimate Ling Han anymore.

“I’m going to refine... the Nine Emperor Golden Bell Pill.” This was also a Level Eight Divine Pill, but it was inferior to the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill both in terms of medicinal effects and in terms of refinement difficulty. After all, the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill could almost be regarded as a Level Nine Divine Pill. Thus, regardless of what pill she chose, its refinement difficulty definitely couldn’t surpass the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. That being the case, her choice of pill naturally didn’t matter too much.

As long as Ling Han succeeded in refining the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill, he would be crowned the victor, regardless of the quality of his pill. On the flipside, Ling Han would lose if his cauldron exploded and she succeeded in refining her pills.

“Please!”

Both of them started to prepare their ingredients. When Ling Han retrieved a Red Rain Divine King Fruit, a serious look appeared in Han Xinyan’s beautiful eyes. Now that Ling Han had retrieved this kind of Divine Fruit, it was clear that he wasn’t joking.

Otherwise... the price of his joke would be far too high.

‘Has he really grasped that ancient recipe? Can he truly refine the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill?’

She found this notion absurd. However, for some reason, she had a slight feeling that Ling Han might succeed.

This caused her to become a little discomposed. ‘Our match hasn’t even started yet, so why am I predicting my own defeat?’

The onlookers were all crowded outside the door. Moreover, there was a restriction that stopped their voices from traveling into the palace. This was to prevent them from disturbing the two competitors.

Right now, Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan could only choose to trust Ling Han, even though they were still unable to accept that he had advanced another level in just half a year.

Boom!

Divine flames soared into the air as the two young alchemists began to refine their pills.

Ling Han quickly entered a trance-like state.

Among all the pills he had come across, the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill was the most difficult to refine. Moreover, it was the limit of what he could refine. Thus, even he had to be extremely careful. Otherwise, a small mistake would undo all of his previous efforts.

The refinement of Level Eight Divine Pills would take an entire month. This tested not only one’s patience and determination, but also the strength of one’s Origin Power and divine sense. Refining Level Eight Divine Pills was akin to battling at full power. How many people could battle at full power for an entire month?

Any pause would result in their cauldron exploding.

Thus, the higher the level, the fewer the alchemists.

Ling Han rid his mind of all unnecessary thoughts. This wasn’t merely a match. The Berserk Blood Spirit Pill was a pill that he needed at this moment, and thus him refining it was both to win the match and to benefit himself. Thus, he naturally had to treat it with utmost seriousness.

During this month of refining, the onlookers came and went, went and came. Apart from alchemists, who had the patience to watch from beginning to end? Anyhow, this was a truly a grand feast for alchemists. Witnessing the techniques of two Level Eight alchemists was of immense help to them.

When the final day arrived, almost everyone in the city squeezed over to witness the final results.

“Open!” Ling Han and Han Xinyan slapped their cauldrons at almost exactly the same time.

Peng!

The lids of their cauldrons instantly flew up. This time, Ling Han didn’t hold back anymore. He activated the Three Fire Guide, his most familiar technique.

“Ah!” Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan instantly gasped in shock. Their mouths hung so wide open that even an egg could be stuffed in.

‘Three Fire Guide! That’s definitely the Three Fire Guide!’ they exclaimed in their minds.

However, the Three Fire Guide was clearly the ultimate technique of their master. Moreover, he had only taught it to them two. Meanwhile, they hadn’t gone around teaching it to other people in the Lower Realm. So, where had Ling Han learned it from?

‘Perhaps... he’s master’s intergenerational disciple?’

Xiu!

Bringing with it a brilliant glow, a pill soared from Ling Han’s cauldron. It danced about in the air.

This was the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

He had succeeded!

Han Xinyan took a single glance, and sighed in her mind. With her skills, she had known that Ling Han was definitely refining the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill just by seeing that there was a Red Rain Divine King Fruit among his ingredients.

Now that his pill had formed, the result of this match was clear.

She had lost, and Ling Han had won!

“I’ve lost!” she said sincerely.

The onlookers were stunned. Who could believe that Ling Han had actually become a Level Eight alchemist? Moreover, he had defeated Han Xinyan, a prodigy among prodigies!

The members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion were all frozen with shock.

They had spent the past half a year waiting for that Level Eight alchemist who was studying an ancient pill recipe in seclusion. However, he had remained in seclusion the entire time. Coincidentally, Han Xinyan had come to visit Lin Yuqi. Thus, Lin Yuqi asked for her help to challenge the Han Lin Pavilion.

Han Xinyan was a renowned young alchemist, and there were all kinds of titles and feats attributed to her. Simply put, she was a prodigy who was born for alchemy. She was one of the 10 most talented alchemists in the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire.

Now, however... she had lost to an even younger alchemist!

Unbelievable! This was absolutely unbelievable.

Han Xinyan was indeed a proud individual. However, she wasn’t one to swallow her words. She immediately brought Ling Han a cup of tea, then used her finger like a sword, and carved “I admit you’re stronger” at his feet.

A defeat was a defeat, and she took it on the chin.

Ling Han nodded in his mind. This woman had a good character, and she was also extremely talented in alchemy. He felt an urge to take her as his sixth disciple.

However, their alchemy level was identical at this moment, and they were also representing opposing forces. If he asked to take her as a disciple, perhaps everyone would roll their eyes in reply.

He sipped some tea, and said, “We’ve completed our match, and I’ve also drunk my tea. So, farewell!”

“Wait!” Han Xinyan called. She bit her lip, and said, “I’ll definitely challenge you again!”

“Heh, no problem. However, that’ll have to wait until when I’m free,” Ling Han replied with a smile. He wasn’t trying to avoid her challenge. Rather, his main focus was on cultivation, so he couldn’t concentrate on alchemy all the time.

Ling Han left with Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan.

The onlookers naturally dispersed as well. However, when the three of them arrived back at the Han Lin Pavilion, they immediately discovered that the number of customers had increased fivefold compared to when they had left. Moreover, this was just the beginning.

When they returned to the Han Lin Pavilion, Kang Xiu Yuan couldn’t contain himself anymore, and he asked, “Senior Elder, dare I ask, did you use... the Three Fire Guide just then?”

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Correct!”

Through his observation during the past half a year—in fact, it wasn’t his observation, but Guang Yuan’s and Zhu Wu Jiu’s observation—he determined that these two disciples had no relationship with the Cloud Phoenix Sect. They most likely hadn’t forgotten their roots.

“Senior Elder, w-where did you learn this secret technique?” Yun Yong Wang asked.

“Where?” A look of reminiscence appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “I was the one who invented this technique!”

Teng, teng!

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan instantly jumped up, expressions of fury on their face.

He actually dared to claim their master’s Three Fire Guide as his own invention? This was far too shameless! Regardless of how much he had helped the Han Lin Pavilion, there were some things that couldn’t be said, and there were some lines that couldn’t be crossed.

That was about their master—he was like a deity, like a true immortal! His name definitely couldn’t be soiled!

“I think it’s time for Senior Elder to leave!” Yun Yong Wang said coldly.
