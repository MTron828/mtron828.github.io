2839 A strange change

One of the three big shots of the Celestial Realm was now being hoisted like a dead dog. This made the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, Ji Wuming, and the others all feel rueful.

However, the large black dog was clapping his paws gladly. He had been longing to see this scene for a very long time.

“Ling Han!” Rong Yang roared. No matter what, Jiuwu could also be considered his subordinate, and now he was being humiliated like this, so it was also an embarrassment for him. However, he had already been thrashed severely by Ling Han, so he actually was already embarrassed.

Ling Han shook his head. “Don’t be excited yet. Let’s see what this guy would say first.”

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate sneered. “Ling Han, I only rue that I had not killed you earlier, which was what led to today’s disaster!”

“En?” Rong Yang faltered slightly. With his intelligence, how could it be that he could not deduce the fact that the two of them had known each other long before from these words of Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate? Furthermore, they had an existing grudge between them.

Rong Yang thought deeper—could it be that it was Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate who had egged Rong Xinkuan on to come here? His motive was so that he could use the latter as a tool for his crime.

“It was you who egged on Rong Xinkuan to come here?” Rong Yang questioned Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had already thrown everything on the line. He only laughed loudly, his eyes glaring at Ling Han in fury. “Junior, I have had countless chances to kill you before, but I have underestimated you too much, and thought that you were nothing but an ant, and disdained from making a move on you personally.”

“Very sorry, I have disappointed you,” Ling Han said calmly. “Looks like you do not have the slightest intention to reflect on the error of your ways. If so, I can’t be bothered to waste any more time, either. I’ll just send you on your way now.”

“Ling Han, there will come a day that you will find out that there will always be someone stronger and more talented than you. You are definitely not the strongest in this world!” It was like Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was cursing him, tears of blood dripping from his eyes.

He resented everything; he was filled with overwhelming resentment. Ling Han had been nothing more than the most negligible ant of the Celestial Realm, yet now he had turned around to subdue him, which filled him with defiance and regret that he had not killed Ling Han earlier.

Ling Han humphed, frightening power surging from his right hand. Peng! Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was immediately blasted into a shower of blood.

A Heavenly Venerate had died, but there was no movement from the heaven and earth, as if it was just a cat or dog that had died.

“Yi?” Ling Han paused.

“Ling Han!” Rong Yang shouted in fury. He had not investigated the whole matter thoroughly yet, so why had you killed him?

Ling Han was thinking pensively. He ignored Rong Yang, and merely swept Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate’s soul over to Rong Yang with a wave of his hand.

‘Whatever questions you have, you can find out the answers on your own.’

Rong Yang was just about to speak, but after a moment of consideration, he still stretched out his right hand, and grabbed Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate’s soul as he began to flip through his memories.

His expression became gradually more livid because he had already flipped through the process of how Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had tricked Rong Xinkuan into coming to Ling City, as well as the origins of the enmity between Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Ling Han and the others. He now knew that the Rong Clan had been manipulated by Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

How despicable!

He wanted nothing more than to kill Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate again. A mere Third Tier actually dared to manipulate a Sixth-Tier force; that was too outrageously bold.

“Ling Han, though it was this villain that caused this event to happen, you have indeed killed a member of our Rong Clan. This matter… you have to give our Rong Clan an explanation.” He suppressed his fury. It was indeed Rong Xinkuan who had started this, but there was no member of the Rong Xinkuan that would die for nothing.

Ling Han ignored him because an intense change was taking place presently inside his body.

When he had killed Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate just now, Ling Han discovered that there was a powerful force that was surging into his body. When he sensed it carefully, it was actually the vitality of Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han was very shocked. He had not been cultivating any kind of evil or demonic cultivation technique, so why would he swallow the life essence of Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate?

He had never heard that anyone who had advanced to the Second Tier would possess this ability.

This kind of change was too sudden and too strange, so he was completely in no mood to pay any regard to Rong Yang. Instead, he was focused on the change within himself.

Jiuwu’s life essence turned into endless nutrition that was rapidly advancing the Powers of Dimension within every cell inside his body.

If he could continue to advance like this, he probably would not need a few thousand years before he would be able to attempt breaking through to the Third Tier.

Ling Han was not too pleased. This kind of ability shocked him, and even filled him with a kind of terror.

This was equivalent to devouring other Heavenly Venerates and turning them into nutrition for himself. The rate of his advancement through the cultivation levels was astonishingly rapid. If this could be easily copied, wouldn’t the whole world go crazy?

Heavenly Venerates would hunt down other Heavenly Venerates, creating rivers of blood. The Genesis World would soon be left with only a few scattered Heavenly Venerates who were the strongest.

“Ling Han!!” Rong Yang roared in fury. Ling Han actually dared to ignore him.

Wasn’t it just defeating him for now? What was there to be so smug about?

Ling Han snapped out of his daze, and asked, “What kind of explanation do you want for me?”

“Go to our Rong Clan and beg for forgiveness on your knees!” Rong Yang demanded.

Ling Han instantly scoffed. “Are you an idiot? Could it be that you don’t know it was Rong Xinkuan himself who had come here? Moreover, he has also killed a member of our Ling Clan, so I, too, should demand an explanation from the Rong Clan, right?”

Rong Yang was indignant. How could the life of a servant be compared to a member of the main branch of Rong Clan?

“Hehe, let me be the mediator here.” There was a long laugh, and Lin Xiaoyang appeared, Lin Piaoxue following closely behind.

“Greetings, Lord Lin!”

“Greetings, Senior Lin.”

Both Ling Han and Rong Yang bowed in respect. This was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, so who could afford to treat him with disrespect?

Lin Xiaoyang raised his hand, and said, “It was indeed Rong Xinkuan who started this whole matter. With his character, hehe, there is a reason why he is dead!”

Rong Yang wanted to explain, but seeing how Lin Xiaoyang’s glance swept towards him, he immediately fell silent.

In front of a Sixth Tier, there was no room for him to refute.

Though he could not resign himself to this, since Lin Xiaoyang had already passed judgment, then he was not worthy to continue debating the matter, unless his old man made a personal appearance.

“Rong Yang, come.” Lin Xiaoyang beckoned Rong Yang over towards him.

Rong Yang had no choice, and could only leave with Lin Xiaoyang. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Lin Piaoxue winked at Ling Han, and also turned around, leaving with her father.

“Ling Han!” With the departure of the three great Heavenly Venerates, the Empress and the others all gathered around him.

They were all pleased. Now that Ling Han had advanced another step further, Ling City now possessed a Fourth-Tier powerhouse, which would mean greater safety in this chaotic world.

Ling Han very much wanted to ask someone else regarding this ability that he had suddenly gained, but the Empress had just advanced to the Second Tier, and had not killed any Heavenly Venerate before, so it was naturally impossible that she would know whether she had this kind of ability or not.

And this was not something that could be easily experimented with… Oh, where should he find a Heavenly Venerate for the Empress to kill?

...

Ling Han really missed the Realm Battlefield. If they were still warring with Hysteria now, the speed of his progression through cultivation levels would be very fast. He only had to breach the barrier between cultivation levels, and even attaining Seventh Tier would not take too much time for him.

He instinctively felt that he could not let any outsiders know this, or it could possibly lead to great trouble.

Ling Han set this matter aside for the moment, and found out after some queries that Ling Xi had already set out two days ago, heading to various dimensions to harvest the Power of Dimension there, pioneering her own path of Heavenly Venerable Tier.

In Hu Niu’s case, she was still in seclusion. Apparently, she would not come out of seclusion unless she reached the Third Tier.

Calm returned for the moment. With Lin Xiaoyang stepping out to mediate, Rong Xinkuan did not come to call for an accounting of old debts over the matter of Rong Xinkuan’s death again, but after several tens of thousands of years, Rong Xinkuan appeared once more at Ling City.
