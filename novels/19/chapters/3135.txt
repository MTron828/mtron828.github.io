3136 The Elders’ Shock

Ling Han tried to get closer for a closer look, but he discovered that when he was about three meters away from the ancient corpse, a terrifying killing intent immediately assaulted him.

It could be clearly seen that the initially calm air had actually turned into multiple sharp blades, and the blades were all aimed at him.

If Ling Han advanced one step further, he would be struck by the sharp blades, and be pierced into mush.

A corpse that had been dead for who knew how long actually had such might?

It could be imagined that when this ancient corpse was alive, it must have been a super elite. Perhaps, it had advanced above Meridian Opening Tier and stood on an even higher peak on the mountain of martial arts.

But now, he had turned into a corpse, lying in this dark world. Who knew how many years he had been dead for.

How could a civilization disappear all of a sudden?

Ling Han thought back to the Lower Realm of his past. That was because there was the control of the Five Sects of the Immortal Realm, turning the Lower Realm into a massive cauldron, using all living creatures as ingredients to concoct a great alchemical pill.

Was it the same here?

If that was the case, then it would still be very different. There were no spies or eyes and ears of the Five Sects here.

He took a few steps back, and arrived beside those lizard eggs. Now that he was here, the killing intent was no longer apparent.

Perhaps, an ordinary lizard had come here by accident, and then eaten the blood here, beginning its rapid path of evolution.

It gave birth here, wanting its descendants to also absorb this kind of precious blood, so that they could develop their own pack into a powerful force in a short period of time.

Perhaps it was precisely because there was too little time, that these ferocious creatures had not developed intelligence.

When that female lizard reached a certain cultivation level, she had gone to find food for the small lizards, which resulted in the disappearance of the whole group of miners.

As for that ancient site… it should be a coincidence. Coincidentally, the miners dug through there, and before they could report it, they had already suffered a calamity.

No matter what, this explanation still made sense.

Ling Han looked at the blood on the ground, slightly apprehensive.

This was human blood, and it was unknown how many years he had been dead for. Even if it was very nutritious, he still felt a psychological barrier stopping him from actually wanting to consume it.

After hesitating for a while, he decided to let it go.

He began to return, and as his power increased explosively again, his speed naturally also increased to a new height. He only spent a day and a half, and he had already returned to the Ancient Dao Sect.

After seeing Sun Jianfang, he told him the whole story from beginning to end.

He didn’t feel the slightest bit of guilt about this matter, so he naturally didn’t need to hide it. Moreover, he had already consumed the Treasured Fruits, so he wasn’t afraid of others coveting it.

“What, there’s actually such a thing!” Sun Jianfang was furious. Li Changdan, Rui Yuanliang, and Yang Fei were too arrogant. They actually dared to commit a crime in the territory of the sect?

Fortunately, the Dao Child that he had chosen was truly freakish. Not only had these three people failed to kill Ling Han, but they had even lost their lives.

“An ancient historical site appeared in the mine?” Sun Jianfang was stunned again. “This must be the real site of the Ancient Dao Sect. However, the transformation of heaven and earth isn’t complete yet, so only this part of it has appeared now.”

He was extremely excited, and immediately convened an elder-level meeting to inform them of this matter.

Ling Han also attended. He was the Dao Child, the future sect master, so he was naturally qualified to attend. Moreover, he was also the one who had discovered it, so it was naturally up to him to explain.

Hearing his words, Elder Zhu and Sun Jianfang’s expressions were the same. They were both extremely excited.

The discovery of a new ancient site, what did that mean?

Books left behind by an ancient great elite!

They were all trapped at the Ten Meridians, the Eleven Meridians, the Twelve Meridians, and so on. Firstly, it was possible that it was because they themselves were not talented enough, and secondly, it might be that they lacked the guidance of more talented seniors, and did not have a systematic cultivation method.

They were sure that in the previous civilization, the Twelve Meridians was definitely not the end of martial arts. The level of development of martial arts was probably unimaginable.

Thus, if one could obtain a sect’s martial arts insights, studying them would definitely be extremely beneficial.

This was a huge opportunity.

So how could these people not be excited?

Yet Ling Han remained calm and collected, thinking that there was no chance.

His talent in formations could be said to have surpassed anyone else, and added with that purple pendant capable of suppressing formations, he just barely managed to pluck three Treasured Fruits, but was still unable to enter the buildings.

As for others?

Hehe, he now possessed Ten Meridians-level power, and he didn’t believe that anyone could surpass him.

Thus, these people could only be disappointed in the end.

He didn’t say anything, nor did he mention the purple pendant. He only said that he had some accomplishments in formations. Otherwise, some old geezers would definitely become greedy.

Soon, Sun Jianfang and the others reached a consensus. They were going to immediately head to the Jade Dragon Mine.

Ling Han also hurriedly washed up, then took some dried meat and rations with him, and similarly set out.

After more than a day’s journey, they once again arrived at the Jade Dragon Mine. Ling Han was in charge of leading the team, and they all held lamps in their hands. They first arrived at the site of the historical site.

Li Changdan’s corpse was still lying there. When they saw his fatal injury, the elders all looked at Ling Han with strange expressions.

They were all experienced in battle, and could tell with a single glance that Ling Han had used his overwhelming power to crush Li Changdan and kill him.

A Nine Meridians had killed another Nine Meridians with his bare fists in a head-on confrontation. Furthermore, it was a prodigy like Li Changdan. What did this mean about Ling Han’s strength?

It had only been around four months, and this brat had already reached such heights.

Some were wary, while others had other thoughts. For example, He Guan. He was thinking, could his granddaughter be betrothed to Ling Han?

Previously, he had wanted to marry her to Li Changdan because of Li Changdan’s future potential. Now, compared to Ling Han, Li Changdan was practically trash.

However, everyone’s attention quickly turned to the ancient site ahead of them. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Such a large area of buildings was something that no one had ever set foot in before. It was very likely that there were martial arts books from the civilization of the last era hidden inside. If one obtained them, one might be able to soar in terms of cultivation level.

They tried to advance, and all of them were cautious. However, they had only taken a single step, and they had all fled back in an incredibly sorry state. Some had their clothes slashed, and some had even suffered superficial injuries.

Fortunately, no one had their arms or legs broken. After all, everyone was on guard.

The treasure was right in front of their eyes, yet they could only look on?

Everyone felt an itch in their hearts, feeling an indescribable gloom.

“Let’s go and take a look at that ancient corpse!” Sun Jianfang waved his hand and made a decision.

They arrived at the other part of the mine. Before they had even reached it, the stench had already assaulted them, causing everyone to involuntarily cover their noses.

The ancient corpse appeared before them, but no one dared to approach. They had a feeling that they would die if they did.

“This should be that cultivation level above Meridian Opening Tier!” Gu Tang declared excitedly, “The path hasn’t been severed, the path hasn’t been severed!”

He didn’t have any descendants, and what he loved most was money and beautiful women. However, only cultivation was his true pursuit. It was just that he had long since lost all hope of advancing further, so he could only chase after women and money.
