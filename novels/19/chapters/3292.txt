Xuanyuan Dingguo and the others all stared at Ling Han, their faces filled with surprise.

‘Yi, the direction of your surprise is wrong, right? What I’m telling you is about the Demonic Rat.’

“I do know a bit about formations, but—

“Heavens, you’re proficient in alchemy and formations, so why don’t you just go to the heavens while you’re at it!” Xuanyuan Dingguo mocked.

“What, he can concoct alchemical pills?” Qin Xinghuo and the others were even more stunned. They looked at Xuanyuan Dingguo, then looked at Ling Han.

Only then did Xuanyuan Dingguo realize that he had let the cat out of the bag. He hurriedly laughed and said, “Tsk, the weather is quite nice today.”

“Xuanyuan, don’t change the topic!” Yin Xiujing rebuked delicately.

The moment this bewitching woman spoke, Xuanyuan Dingguo knew that he couldn’t fool her anymore, because her ability to pester others was at the grandmaster level. He said casually, “Ling Han and I opened an alchemical pill shop together.”

“Just that simple?” Qin Xinghuo said with a smile, his face filled with disbelief.

If Ling Han only knew a little about alchemy, would Xuanyuan Dingguo need to open a pharmacy with him?

Ling Han sighed. ‘Don’t you guys interrupt, focus, focus!’

“That Demonic Rat is extremely powerful. Although it’s still in a weak state, the feeling it gives me definitely surpasses the Inscription Tier!” he said seriously.

This time, the attention of Qin Xinghuo and the others finally turned around, and they were similarly solemn. “Are you sure?”

“Positive.” Ling Han nodded.

“According to you, if that Demonic Rat recovers its abilities, perhaps its cultivation level would be above the level of Inscription Tier?” Tang Yue asked.

“It should be more than that.” Ling Han continued to nod, then countered, “Have you guys heard of any Inscription Tier Demonic Beast that can speak human language?”

The four of them shook their heads. Although His Majesty, the Holy Emperor, was the only one in the world who had advanced to the Enlightenment Tier, there were still many elites of Inscription Tier, and this included some Demonic Beasts in the primitive mountains.

The heavy responsibility of the Four Great Generals was to stand guard at the borders and prevent these Demonic Beasts from leading troops to invade the Dark North Nation. However, they had never heard of a Demonic Beast in the Inscription Tier being able to speak human language.

Theoretically speaking, the Demonic Rat’s strength was very likely to be above the Inscription Tier.

Hiss, then in this whole world, only the Holy Emperor, His Majesty, would be able to suppress it. What kind of terrifying damage would this kind of Demonic Beast cause when it appeared?

“We must immediately return to the Imperial Capital and report the news.” The warship sped up and returned to the Imperial Capital.

After a little more than six days, they had returned to the Imperial Capital.

Xuanyuan Dingguo and the others immediately went to report to their elders. This matter was too important.

In just half a day’s time, Ling Han was invited out of the Academy by the Imperial Guards, and entered into the Imperial Palace.

Not only was the Imperial Palace the residence of the Emperor and his harem, but it was also the central hub for dealing with matters of the nation. Even if the current Emperor was presently in seclusion, dealing with government affairs could only be done in the imperial study of the Imperial Palace.

To cut to the chase, not only was the current emperor outstandingly powerful, but his harem was also extremely shocking. At a rough count, there were at least several hundred of them, and the majority of them were the result of political marriage.

—The rise of the Dark North Nation had led to the conquest of various nations and tribes. In order to stabilize these nations and tribes, political marriage was naturally a very good method. This also caused the number of princes and princesses in the Dark North Nation to be astonishing, all of them numbering in the hundreds.

He was fertile, very fertile.

Led by the Imperial Guards, Ling Han entered into the Imperial Palace. After walking for a while, two people walked towards him.

One of them was a young man in a full suit of armor. He was handsome, and his entire person was emanating heroic spirit.

Gu Xiangming.

The other person was a woman. She was exquisitely beautiful, and had an elegant bearing.

Ling Han also recognized this person. She was none other than Feng Ruoxian, the daughter of the city lord of Huju City.

What a coincidence.

When he saw Ling Han, Gu Xiangming’s expression immediately changed to one of mixed feelings.

He was displeased with Ling Han. He had once wanted to deal with him, but he had not even made his move, and Ling Han had already entered into the Imperial Capital Academy. This had exceeded the scope of his authority. Even if he stretched out his hand, he would not be able to touch him.

Subsequently, before he had thought of any good ideas, he heard that Ling had defeated Hu Yang three times.

He naturally knew who Hu Yang was. He was a Fifth Change Blood Transformation Tier elite, and was stronger than him.

However, this kind of elite had been defeated by Ling Han three times. If the first time and the second time could be forgiven, then the third time would be a complete and utter defeat. He had been outmatched by Ling Han in raw strength.

This caused Gu Xiangming to completely lose all desire for revenge. He was only a Third Change, so how could he possibly match Ling Han?

Now that he saw Ling Han appear in front of him, he naturally felt disgusted and uncomfortable, as if he had swallowed a fly.

Feng Ruoxian, meanwhile, showed a hint of anger.

Of course, she was angry. He had once been her father’s subordinate, yet now, he had completely turned his back on her and refused to even obey her commands.

What an ingrate!

In her eyes, it was only natural that Ling Han saved her. Wasn’t this something that subordinates should do?

But Ling Han wanted to fly solo, and this displeased her, and she saw it as betrayal.

She would not allow betrayal!

“Big Brother Ling!” Feng Ruoxian broke into a smile, gentle and beautiful, not revealing her inner thoughts in the slightest.

Ling Han clasped his hands in greeting, “Miss Feng.”

“How many times have I told you? Just call me Ruoxian,” Feng Ruoxian said, pretending to be displeased.

Hehe.

Ling Han smirked coldly in his mind. He naturally didn’t think that Feng

Ruoxian would be so familiar with him. Moreover, the reason why Feng

Ruoxian had done this was because she wanted to use him as a stepping stone.

—It was said that there were a considerable number of Imperial Princes that were interested in her. If news spread out that he and Feng Ruoxian had an intimate relationship, or were even in fact ambiguous in their relations with each other, what would those Imperial Princes do?

It was extremely likely that they would target him in exasperation.

A dragon may have nine sons, and they were all different, what more when the present Holy Emperor had given birth to over a hundred sons. How could all of them be prodigies?

This woman was really black-hearted.

Ling Han saw through Feng Ruoxian’s intentions with a single glance. After all, he had not been living for an epoch for nothing. He did not expose her, and merely said calmly, “There is a difference between the upper and lower levels. Miss Feng may marry into the Imperial Family in future, so it would be best for me to maintain a respectful address.”

Feng Ruoxian was rendered speechless. She hadn’t expected Ling Han to be so stubborn.

“Young Master Ling, the Lord Chairperson of the Council is still waiting in the imperial study,” the Imperial Guard that had brought Ling Han in said. He could not bear the responsibility of causing a delay. Ling Han nodded, and said, “Miss Feng, we’ll meet again.”

He ignored Feng Ruoxian and strode forward.

In Feng Ruoxian’s eyes, this was another great display of disrespect towards her, causing her hatred towards Ling Han to increase further.

There was a layer of darkness on her beautiful face, and she looked a little frightening.

Gu Xiangming saw this, and couldn’t help but smirk coldly. Looks like there was hope for his revenge.

Led by the Imperial Guard, Ling Han soon arrived at the study. Knock, knock, knock. The Imperial Guard knocked on the door.

“Enter.” A deep voice rang out from within.

The Imperial Guard pushed open the doors, then made a gesture of invitation.

Ling Han strode in. Though this place was called a study, it was actually incredibly huge. It was practically like a palace.

There was a man dressed in crimson robes seated behind a massive study table. He looked to be in his seventies or eighties, and though his hair was already slightly grey, his skin was extraordinarily rosy and smooth. If it was claimed that he was only in his forties or fifties, there would probably be others who would believe it.

This was Yang Bai, the Council Chairman of the Majestic Empire, an elite of Inscription Tier.
