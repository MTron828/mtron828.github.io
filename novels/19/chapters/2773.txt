2774 Standing alone

Ling Han killed till the whole world became dark.

He had powerful battle prowess, comparable to that of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Furthermore, this power came from himself entirely. It was like a dimension was transmitting power to him. It was endless and continuous, but under such intense fighting, he actually felt a hint of weariness.

This was because he was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, after all. The Power of Dimension in his body was only a model, and had not transformed into an actual dimension, so the power supplied to him was naturally limited.

Usually, it would be fine. Even if he had to battle a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, he would not be anxious, but there were really too many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates here. With several hundred of them blasting him at the same time, it was extremely exhausting for him. This time, it was not like how it had been an epoch ago. Not only were there more of Hysteria’s troops, they were also protected by Divine Metal, so it was more difficult to kill them now.

Even Ling Han felt slightly strained, so it was even worse for the Empress. Even her smooth hair was slightly disheveled, and she was breathing heavily.

“You should rest first.” Ling Han drew the Empress into the Celestial Guest Residence. Their recovery would only have to begin from themselves, and there was no need for them to communicate with the heaven and earth. Thus, it could be done anywhere.

The Celestial Guest Residence was naturally safe.

Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword, and went all out.

One after another, sword rays sliced forwards. He used the Five Elements Lightning Technique, continuously blasting out terrifying lightning. A single strike was capable of killing several dozen monsters. However, there were really too many monsters, and they were still surging towards him endlessly. Very soon, Ling Han was completely drowned by their numbers.

The main troops retreated, and they very soon arrived at the second line of defense. There were still construction works for the defense ongoing here, and the city defense was far from completion.

One of the Heavenly Venerates in charge of overseeing and commanding here asked, “What is going on? Why have you all retreated here?”

Zhou Yan informed him truthfully, and the other Heavenly Venerate paled in great shock.

The frequency of Hysteria’s assaults was increasing further and further. Originally, a large-scale attack like this would only occur once every several million years, but they were continuously increasing in frequency in the last several hundred million years, going from once in several hundred thousand years to once in tens of thousands of years, and then to once for every several thousand years.

When was the last occurrence of such an assault?

700 years ago.

Just this little bit of time had passed, and a super large-scale assault had happened again?

What were they supposed to do?

Though they were already speeding up the construction of the second line of city defense, it would take another 200 years at the very least.

“We can only fight to the death!” Zhou Yan declared. “This place definitely cannot be conquered. Otherwise… we would be allowing Hysteria’s troops to invade directly unchallenged.”

The other Heavenly Venerate nodded. He told everyone to stop the construction works and prepare for battle.

Only a while later, Hysteria’s main troops attacked.

“Just so few of them?” The other Heavenly Venerate asked. He had heard Zhou Yan say how Hysteria had unleashed a super large-scale assault, but from the look of things now, this should not have been enough to force Zhou Yan and company to abandon the city and flee.

Zhou Yan was also taken aback. Though Hysteria’s troops that had pursued them were still everywhere, compared to what had been visible from above the barrier, there was no comparison.

“Ling Han!” Zhou Yan murmured.

“What?” The other Heavenly Venerate looked strangely at him. What did he mean?

“I think that the reason why Hysteria’s troops have become so few is probably because of one man.” Zhou Yan breathed out deeply, the expression on his face indescribably complicated.

“How could that be!!!” the other Heavenly Venerate exclaimed in shock. “There is suppression from heaven and earth here. Even a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate would be affected should they come here. Even compared with a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, their strength would be limited. How could anyone possibly have blocked a super large-scale assault?”

“Because… this man is Ling Han!” Zhou Yan answered.

“Ling Han? Which Ling Han?” The other Heavenly Venerate’s expression was filled with confusion.

“The Ling Han who had left behind his name on the general leaderboard an epoch ago,” Zhou Yan replied. As expected of Ling Han, he was incredibly freakish and powerful.

“That Ling Han?” The other Heavenly Venerate also recalled by now. At this time, Hysteria’s troops had already reached them, and he joined the battles as well. Though cultivation levels would be suppressed here, and he could only unleash power on the level of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, he was a Heavenly Venerate, after all. His battle prowess far surpassed Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“Hasn’t he already become a cripple?” he asked in confusion.

Zhou Yan shook his head, and laughed in spite of himself. “If he is a cripple, then I will be the trash of all trash.”

“Hmm?” The other Heavenly Venerate was surprised. He knew that Ling Han had indeed been freakish in the past, but was there any need for Zhou Yan to demean himself like this? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zhou Yan did not speak any further. The battle situation was really too intense.

Without city defense, every single person could only immerse themselves in blood as they battled. Who knew how many people would be sacrificed in battle.

But because the number of Hysteria’s troops that had rushed forth had greatly diminished, the front line had been extended, and they still steadied themselves, the war situation entered into a stalemate.

This naturally was because of Ling Han, but no one could be concerned about this hero now, because the consequences would still be more than terrible once they failed here.

10 days, and then a month!

This battle continued for a whole 47 days, so long that even the second, third, and fourth spatial levels dispatched elites as reinforcements, and only then did they manage to completely eliminate all of Hysteria’s troops.

“What? Ling Han is actually battling the main troops alone at the barrier?”

When they heard this, everyone was stunned speechless.

Led by elites, the Flaming Frost Realm began to recover their lost territories, and when they came to the barrier, they could see that most of the city wall had been destroyed, and there was one hill after another of dead bodies outside the city wall.

‘This…!’

“…There are still sounds of battle ahead!” someone with sharp hearing exclaimed.

“It can’t be that the battle is still going on!” someone said shakily.

This was too terrifying. Any single “hill” of monsters consisted of numbers that could kill a First Tier Heavenly Venerate under ordinary circumstances… and here, with suppression from the dimension, these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could bury even a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Yet now, there were countless hills, and they were all piled up by Ling Han and the Empress with their kills.

How could this be believed?

They advanced forwards, walking past one “hill” after another, and shuddering at the sight.

It was probable that the number of monsters killed by Ling Han and the Empress together would be more than all of theirs added together!

They walked another few steps forwards, and there they saw a scene that they would never forget.

…Ling Han was standing alone above a pile of corpses, and several hundred monsters were still surging towards him from various directions. However, he would kill each one that approached, with no exception. That figure that stood upright was like a great mountain that would never collapse.

In just a few breaths’ time, all the monsters were eliminated, and only Ling Han was left, standing proud and high, and looking down on everything below him, invincible and mighty.

Everyone was captivated.

Whoosh!

Still, Ling Han plopped down, sitting down. After battling intensely and consecutively for close to 50 days, even he had reached his limits. The power inside his body was only a slight trickle, and he was filled with weariness.

The intensity of this kind of battle was so great that even a freak like Ling Han was strained.

“Ling Han!”

“Ling Han!”

“Ling Han!”

Below him, everyone was calling out, looking at him as if they were worshiping a god.

This was a cripple?

A considerable number of young people knelt down. It was Ling Han who had saved their lives. Previously, when Ling Han had pushed the enemies back inside the city, annihilating countless monsters, his actions had also saved countless people.

Some of them were even weeping inconsolably. Previously, they had mocked and ridiculed Ling Han so many times, but not only did Ling Han not fault them, he repaid their misdeeds with kindness, saving their lives. They felt extremely ashamed and guilty.
