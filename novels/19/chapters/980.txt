Chapter 981: Want to Make Some Money?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han greeted the arrival of the heavenly tribulation.

Initially, it was an incredibly simple matter for someone with his physique to safely endure the heavenly tribulation. His physique was on par with Level Two Godly metal, and he could allow the tribulation to blast him as it liked, yet he would still be steadfast and unmoving.

But if that was the case, his body would not be tempered, and his physique would only remain on its original level.

Hence, for the sake of becoming stronger, he could only choose to take the initiative to shatter his own body, letting his Godly bones, blood, and flesh suffer the barrage from the tribulation to be tempered and pounded in all ways. Then, he would use the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to rebuild the body after the destruction, forming the true him, so his physique could improve to another level.

Still, the last time he endured the heavenly tribulation had happened just over half a year ago, and now he had to endure it a second time... Even Ling Han shuddered internally at that.

The feeling was really not something pleasant.

“If you want to become the strongest amongst your equals, and an invincible existence in the future, then you would have to endure difficulties others would not be able to. If not, what right would you have to be stronger than others?” Small Tower’s voice rung out in his mind.

This tsundere Tower always acted like it was lecturing him.

Ling Han naturally knew that logic, but it was just saying empty words, without experiencing it personally. This was really pain agonizing enough to cause him to want to die, yet he wasn’t even allowed to complain a bit?

Kuang!

The heavenly tribulation did not care how he felt. It would merely strike down one frightening attack after another, intending to erase him.

Ling Han shattered his Godly bones to endure the baptism by the heavenly tribulation.

Someone was enduring a heavenly tribulation. This commotion was too huge, and naturally attracted the notice of those in the Academy. However, there were really too many students inside the Scarlet Heaven Academy, so even if it was not every day that someone would be enduring a tribulation, there would indeed be someone enduring one here once every few days.

Hence, some people had taken note, but it was only the few people that just happened to be in the vicinity, and it hadn’t become a public spectacle.

Moreover, at this moment, the heavenly tribulation had formed. Brilliant white lightning was dancing in the sky, and it was very difficult for any normal person to distinguish Ling Han’s appearance, so he would naturally not garner more attention than this. Additionally, Ling Han was destroying his own body, and had become a mass of flesh of blood, so who could recognize him in that bloody pile?

Some of them even thought Ling Han had become like this from being struck by the tribulation, and couldn’t help but shake their heads as they wondered internally who this person could be. He was about to endure a tribulation, yet did not make adequate preparations. The tribulation had just begun, and he was already looking so horrible; he would definitely not be able to endure what came after.

But what stunned them was that even if that “idiot” was more or less a pile of scrambled flesh, the heavenly tribulation still did not look like it was going to stop, and was still blasting down attacks quickly; it was apparent that that person was not dead yet.

... He didn’t die even from that?

The scene dumbfounded them. Half a day passed in the blink of an eye, and Ling Han had reformed his physical body. In the instant the tribulation dissipated, he wrapped a cloak around himself, and disappeared into thin air.

There was nothing that could be done. He was now completely naked, so how could he see anyone like this?

“Yi, did you guys see that person’s appearance?”

“No, he ran away too fast.”

“This is really shocking. He had obviously been blasted so horribly by the heavenly tribulation, so how could he still come back to life?”

“Could it be that he has consumed the alchemical pill that only exists in legends, Nine Deaths Reincarnation Divine Pill?”

“That supreme Divine Pill that would still grant revival even after experiencing nine deaths?”

“Aside from this kind of Divine Pill, what else could have such nature-defying effects?”

Amidst the sounds of discussion of these people, Ling Han had already returned to his new courtyard. He hurriedly took a bath, then dressed himself, took out food ingredients, and began barbequing, planning to reward his stomach. He had not eaten or drunk already for a few months.

“Damn brat, where have you gone these few days? You made me look so hard for you!” The big white cat appeared on the courtyard wall. Its nose was extremely sharp, and it had found its way here after smelling the delicious aroma of barbequed meat.

This aroma was too familiar.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and said, “Are you actually a cat or a dog? Your nose is so keen!”

“I am a descendant of the White Tiger!” The big white cat meowed, and pounced on Ling Han.

“Yi, you can speak?” Ling Han was astonished. When the big white cat made its move, he immediately discovered that its cultivation had reached the Mountain River Tier.

Apparently, when Demonic Beasts advanced into the Mountain River Tier, they could take human form, so it would not be strange that this Cat Demon could speak human language. Instead, the strange thing was it had not assumed human form yet.

“I am a descendant of the White Tiger, so what is so strange about me being able to speak?” The big white cat attacked repeatedly. However, white it was true that it had advanced into Mountain River Tier, and it was also a fact that it was a descendant of the White Tiger, Ling Han’s cultivation level was higher, and his abilities were similarly freakish, so how could he be afraid of it?

Ling Han casually parried, merely defending without attacking, wanting to see how strong this Cat Demon was.

It was really quite powerful. The big white cat’s cultivation level was merely in the early stage of the low extreme, yet its battle prowess had astonishingly surpassed four stars, which was extremely shocking.

“Humph, my bloodline has not completely awakened, or I would be even more awesome!” it declared in a very tsundere manner.

“Is that right?” Ling Han smiled, and suddenly threw out a furry ball of wool.

“Meow!” The fat white cat immediately threw Ling Han off, and turned to pounce on it. Only when its claws had found the ball of wool did it erupt into a bout of meowing with anger. “You damn brat, you actually dare to tease me!!”

“Hehe, eat some meat. If you’re not eating, then forget it.” Ling Han sat back down. Since he now knew the abilities of this big white cat, what meaning was there to continue the fight further? He could suppress it with a single finger now.

The big white cat strolled over in displeasure, but after a few pieces of meat ended up in its tummy, it was immediately radiant with delight, declaring Ling Han its brother.

It had just entered into the Mountain River Tier not too long ago, and had just learnt how to speak. Hence, it spoke quite a lot. It was practically a chatterbox, making Ling Han want to directly stuff its mouth, or stuff up his own ears.

The big white cat ate and drank at his place every day. After two days passed, Li Weiwei came to visit.

“Damn blockhead, where did you run off to in this half a year?” The moment she entered, Li Weiwei interrogated him energetically.

“Oh, cultivating in seclusion,” Ling Han answered indifferently.

“What did you go into seclusion for? Do you know that I was very embarrassed because of you?” Li Weiwei said, panting in rage.

“What did I do to you?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

Li Weiwei flopped down, and began eating the moment she grabbed some food, not the slightest bit reserved. “Tang Feng issued a challenge to you, yet there was not even a sign of you. Hence, he made a public declaration and said that you were a coward that did not dare to accept the challenge. I spoke up for you and said you were not a coward, and would very soon come out to accept the challenge.

“And what happened? You actually did not appear for half a year. Now, everyone in the Imperial Capital is saying you are not living up to your reputation, calling you a coward and a wimp!

“I spoke up for you, and now I’ve become a joke!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “So I’ve caused you to feel some grievance. Still, there was nothing that could be done. I was in seclusion, after all, so I didn’t know anything.” Because he feared he would be disturbed by others, he had stayed all that while inside the Black Tower. It became impossible for anyone to find him.

“Also, also...!” Li Weiwei looked excited. “Zhao Lun has already advanced into consummate level, has won a consecutive 20 battles in the Iron Blood Stadium, and is acclaimed as a ruler of the present young generation, with no equal!

“Now, everyone is talking about when you can catch up to him and have a good battle. For this, there are even betting pools set up!”

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily lit up, and he asked, “What are the stakes?”

“1:10 if it is within a year, 1:9 if it is within two years. Then, it would be 1:2 if it happens 10 years later, 2:3 if it is after 20 years, and after 100 years, it would be 10:12. In any case, the longer the time, the lower the stakes are.”

Ling Han showed a smile, and asked, “Want to make some money?”
