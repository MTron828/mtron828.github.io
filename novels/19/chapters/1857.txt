Chapter 1858: Dao Regulating Pill

Ling Han knew that Liu Yu was deliberately making trouble, but the problem here was that he really did not have the habit of humbling himself to please others.

‘Have I trifled with you? Then why should I have to treat you with a humble attitude!’

There was nothing that could be done. That was who Ling Han was.

He similarly slanted a glance sideways at Sun Dong, and asked, “Do I need to look up to or down on you?”

To be honest, he really had not taken the other to heart. By now, the only people he could consider as a match for him would have to be the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters that had walked out from great sects that were at least at the level of Fifth heaven Celestial King Tier and above.

For someone like Sun Dong, he would only be insta-killed in his hands. Even looking down on him was considered bestowing a very great “worth” on him.

Sun Dong faltered for a moment, and then laughed loudly. He clapped his hands, and exclaimed, “Indeed, you are arrogant enough! I heard that you have a wife that is quite pretty. Let her come out so I can take a look.”

This was a complete provocation. So what? I was completely treating your wife like a woman from the brothel.

Ling Han raised a brow, and his expression became sinister. “Did you not see this good example?” He pointed at Liu Yu. “It was because his mouth was too filthy that I had beaten him black and blue. If you don’t immediately swallow the stuff that you have just spat out, then just wait to become exactly like him.”

Sun Dong laughed loudly, and said, “Brat, you want to me too? Just for that, I will have to find 80-100 strong men to make you cry.”

“Young Master Dong, why don’t we find some other creatures like wild hogs or bears?” Liu Yu put forward plans and ideas from the sidelines. His a*s was still hurting, and great hatred filled his heart.

“This is not a bad idea!” Sun Dong rubbed his hands, willing to take his idea on.

“Just crouch down obediently!” He moved, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han did not counter. When Sun Dong’s attack was close to reaching him, he shot a glare at him. A terrifying murderous aura surged out, and Sun Dong’s whole body instantly became as cold as ice, and his movements slowed.

It should be known that Ling Han had cultivated heaven’s might from the lightning in the first place, and only king tiers could resist that. Now, he had also cultivated Regulation of Slaughter, so how terrifying was that?

Sun Dong felt his heart clench. The icy coldness spread throughout his body. To say nothing of continuing his attack, even standing had already used up all his energy and willpower. Otherwise, he would definitely have knelt down by now.

He was almost scared out of his wits. How could there be someone so strong? Though Sun Dong was not a king tier, he was only a step away from king tier level. But he actually couldn’t even manage to fight in front of Ling Han. Just what kind of gap was there between the two of them?

“, , your sister!” Ling Han was furious, and kicked Sun Dong into a crouching position on the ground. “I cultivated my moral character and behavior, planning to keep a low profile for a while, yet all of you insist on stepping on my nerves. Do you think I am an easy target to bully?”

These really were honest words. This time, he had no plans to crush any profligate, and merely wanted to quietly concoct alchemical pills, and become famous in this way. From there, he could draw out Commander Guan, and continue his journey to Roc Palace.

This time, he really had been modest enough. In fact, he had even almost given up the cultivation chamber, and what happened?

Stepping on one was not enough, here came another that insisted that he step on him. Did they think that he would not step on them?

Shua, a bamboo pole appeared once more, and with a pu, it was stabbed into Sun Dong’a a*s.

“Ah!” Sun Dong immediately released a tragic cry. He had violated many people’s a*ses before, but it was his first time having his a*s violated, and furthermore, it was with something as thick as a bamboo pole.

Liu Yu’s face had turned green from watching from the sidelines. At that time, he had only felt pain, but when he personally saw something so thick sink into Sun Dong’s a*s, he couldn’t help but feel his a*s clenching as well. Even now, his injuries hadn’t recovered yet.

“And you!” Ling Han grabbed Liu Yu over. “I already spared you once, but you still insist on being beaten! You still haven’t learned your lesson even having been beaten, have you gotten addicted to being pierced? Fine then, I will oblige with your wishes!”

Pu, another bamboo pole was stabbed into Liu Yu’s a*s.

Ling Han clapped his hands. These two people were kneeling on the ground, their bottoms raised high. The two bamboo poles trembled very rhythmically, causing him to feel as if he had created a work of art.

Sigh, if he stayed too long with the large black dog, it was inevitable that he was going to be influenced.

Ling Han walked out of the cultivation chamber, and rushed to the administration office of the first level. He had submitted his application here, and also had to collect his approval here. There would be a plaque that granted him entry, and he could enter the second level with that.

“What, it was not approved?” He looked at the investigator, appearing to be very shocked. That was because he was in the Severing Mundane Tier, and this application should only be mere formality. How could it possibly be rejected?

“You have come at a coincidental time. Grandmaster Zi Cheng has just concocted a Dao Regulating Pill. He is a rather eccentric man, and never sells pills. Thus, he has also offered this Dao Regulating Pill as a reward to be contested over by all the Severing Mundane Tier cultivators in the whole city,” that investigator said. “By now, every level is undergoing a selection process. To prevent some from having failed the selection in this level and register again after they enter into the second level, the application for entry into the second level for Severing Mundane Tiers has been temporarily put on hold.”

What a coincidence.

Ling Han asked, “May I ask what effects this Dao Regulating Pill has?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Even if I tell you, it is of no use. There are a great many people that covet this precious pill, and it is absolutely nothing that you can obtain... Hehe, do you know the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King?” This investigator was definitely a chatterbox. He already said that it was useless to tell him, yet still talked so much.

Ling Han exercised patience, and smilingly replied, “No.”

‘You don’t know? Good.’

That investigator had even more time to show off, and said, “Speaking of the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King, that is truly a powerful overlord! You know how there are Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier, and every step is like ascending the heavens?”

Ling Han was exasperated, and said, “That I do know.”

“Hehe, that Eternal Prosperity Celestial King is an Eighth heaven Celestial King. The Eternal Prosperity Sect has existed throughout the ages, and has perpetually been prosperous!” the investigator said.

Ling Han felt a little frustrated. ‘I asked you what are the effects of the Dao Regulating Pill, yet you are talking to me about the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King. Just what kind of thoughts are going through your head?’

“This time, even the Eternal Prosperity Palace has sent an important figure here, and that is one of the four Heavenly Kings under Holy Son Yan Xianlu, Zhao Qingfeng. He has come here to obtain the Dao Regulating Pill under the command of Holy Son Yan Xianlu.

“Say, even Zhao Qingfeng, Lord Zhao, is going to make a move, so how could you possibly obtain the Dao Regulating Pill?” the investigator said.

So after beating so much around the bush, Ling Han finally understood what he meant. Firstly, there was no hope for him, and secondly, it was clear how coveted the Dao Regulating Pill was. Even the Holy Son from an eighth heaven Celestial King Tier-level force had sent someone here.

Eighth heaven Celestial King!

A fighting spirit rose up in Ling Han. The Holy Son of an eighth heaven Celestial King Tier-level force. He should be able to rank amongst the strongest in the world, and that was the kind of top-tier prodigy that the large black dog had talked about. However, the prodigy that had been nurtured by an eighth heaven Celestial King Tier-level force might not be capable of ranking above average, but there should not be any problem for him to be in the average ranks.

Too bad, the person who had come was only one of Yan Xianlu’s subordinates.

Ling Han asked further, and only then did the investigator explain the effects of the Dao Regulating Pill. As it turned out, this Celestial pill could strengthen one’s dao foundation, and for a normal severance, it was practically useless, but for prodigies, this was a precious treasure.

To use an analogy, cultivation was like piling up stones. Prodigies could use the same number of stones to build higher, but it was also because of this that their foundations were not strong enough, so the tower could possibly sway and be on the verge of collapse. If they built even higher, there would be risk of complete collapse.

The Dao Regulating Pill could strengthen one’s foundations further, and from there, he could continue to climb higher.

Precisely because of these effects, even Yan Xianlu was tempted. However, it was unknown whether he considered himself too important, and so had not come personally, or had been detained by other matters, and had thus sent out only a subordinate.

However, since Ling Han now knew, he was determined to take this Dao Regulating Pill for his own!
