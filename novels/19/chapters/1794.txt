Chapter 1795: Opening of the Mystery Realm

The Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm finally opened.

It opened once every 30,000,000 years, and when it did so, a volcano inside the mystery realm would erupt and launch huge amounts of Blood Dragon Stones into the surroundings. At the same time, this volcano would also suppress the violent aura of the mystery realm and allow cultivators to enter.

This would cause a massive commotion that could be felt from tens of thousands of kilometers away. Thus, Ling Han and the others could naturally sense the opening of the mystery realm.

Numerous figures leaped down from the battleships, and flew toward the entrance of the mystery realm. Most of them were dressed in a suit of crimson red armor, and only a small number of cultivators were dressed in ordinary clothes.

The crimson red armor was naturally the Blood Dragon Armor. If one didn’t wear this, they would definitely die if they dared to enter the mystery realm. Those who were dressed in ordinary clothes definitely had a suit of Blood Dragon Armor hidden underneath their clothes.

If they didn’t? That would be seeking death!

“Huh? Where’s my Blood Dragon Armor?” someone suddenly exclaimed in a tragic voice.

“It’s with Grandpa Dog. Let me borrow it for a while, and I’ll return it to you later,” the large black dog said as he flew into the distance. Instead of wearing his usual iron underwear, he was now dressed in a suit of crimson red armor.

However, because the armor had been designed for humans, the detestable dog naturally looked extremely peculiar after wearing it. Moreover, he was forced to stand upright. However, his speed was still astonishingly quick.

“Give it back!” the person roared as he chased after the large black dog.

“Pei! How stingy! And to think that Grandpa Dog specifically chose you!” the large black dog said in disdain. With a few bounds, he instantly disappeared from the person’s sight.

‘Who wants to be chosen by you?!’

The person cursed in his mind, yet he didn’t dare to follow the large black dog into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. He could only stomp his feet in anger and frustration.

He had waited for 30,000,000 years, and after much difficulty, he had finally obtained a spot to enter the mystery realm. However, his Blood Dragon Armor had been stolen from him just like that! He could only stare at the others in envy and jealousy.

‘No, I also have to steal a suit of armor!’

He gazed at someone beside him and immediately leaped over, attempting to steal their armor. However, his target naturally started to resist and counterattack.

Moreover, how many people were crowded near the entrance? It was inevitable that their battle started to affect the nearby cultivators as well. A massive brawl instantly broke out.

Peng, peng, peng!

This was a scene of absolute chaos, with flashes of divine light and bursts of Regulations soaring through the air.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel impressed. The large black dog was definitely a supreme troublemaker.

“Ling Han, die!” Several elites of the Fu Clan started to attack Ling Han.

Ling Han had “violated” Zihe Bingyun just then, and even though Fu Gaoyun had already drawn a line between himself and Ling Han, just this alone wouldn’t be enough to appease the Celestial King Tier force. The Fu Clan had to make a statement no matter what. Of course, the underlings of Fu Xiuping, Fu Bingbing, and Fu Tonghai genuinely wanted to kill Ling Han.

These three potential successors all had underlings who were freaks among the Severing Mundane Tier, and these freaks could be regarded as invincible at their cultivation level. Right now, three of them had charged forward to attack Ling Han.

Ling Han raised a brow, and he was just about to charge over to meet their attacks. On second thought, however, he grabbed the Empress’ hand, and started to sprint toward the entrance of the mystery realm instead.

There was no need to fight against them at this moment. After all, defeating each of them would take a huge amount of time and effort. In fact, he might even need to unleash his trump cards in the form of Nine Heavens Flame and the Xuanyin Source Water. Moreover, defeating them wouldn’t yield any benefits. As such, why should he fight against them?

As for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, she had already entered the Black Tower. They only had two suits of Blood Dragon Armor, so she couldn’t enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm anyway.

A menacing glint flashed across the Empress’ eyes.

These people actually dared to unleash killing intent toward her husband? Had they grown tired of living?

After activating his Lightning Flash, Ling Han and the Empress quickly disappeared in the mist that shrouded the entrance of the mystery realm. Even though the mystery realm had already opened, the expanse of mist before it still hadn’t fully dissipated. It was simply less dense than before.

Outside the mystery realm, Qianzhao Tian, Beiyu Xiong, Teng Sen, and the others all appeared with their underlings. There was killing intent in their eyes as they gazed at Ling Han’s disappearing figure.

If they managed to kill Ling Han, wouldn’t it mean that they could potentially become acquainted with the Zihe Clan? If Zihe Bingyun just so happened to develop feelings for one of them, perhaps they would be able to marry the successor of a Celestial King Tier force?

At that time, they could then walk toward the pinnacle of life?

‘Die!’

They came to a decision in their minds. If they came across Ling Han in the mystery realm, they would kill him without any mercy!

“Let’s go!” They started to enter the mystery realm. After a while, Zihe Bingyun also flew over from her battleship. However, she looked to be brimming with confidence as she entered the mystery realm alone.

Not long later, Luo Changfeng also appeared and entered the mystery realm by himself. There was a faint smile on his face, and it was as if everything was in his grasp.

“Let’s go,” Fu Gaoyun said with a wave of his hand. Upon seeing Ling Han enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, he silently prayed for his safety in his mind. He hoped that Ling Han could take advantage of the mystery realm to escape from the Zihe Clan.

Cheng Zhong and the others nodded in acknowledgment as they followed Fu Gaoyun into the mystery realm. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Separation Resentment City.

This three-star city was as calm as always. Although there were still two major tiers above the Immortal Palace Tier—the Ascending Origin Tier and the Celestial King Tier—there would be fewer and fewer elites at such profound cultivation levels. Thus, three-star forces were definitely powerful and influential forces in the Celestial Realm.

The soldiers stationed outside the city gates were feeling extremely relaxed. After all, the previous time that Separation Resentment City had been assaulted was over 1.7 billion years ago. At that time, there had been an intense conflict with the Qi Clan, the neighboring three-star force, and the Qi Clan had sent 11 Immortal Palace Tier elites to attack the Separation Resentment City.

The Fu Clan had paid a huge price that time, with one Immortal Palace Tier elite dying and five other elites suffering grave wounds. Even up until now, they still hadn’t managed to fully recover from their wounds. Meanwhile, the Qi Clan hadn’t fared much better. As such, they had no option but to end the battle.

If the battle had continued, both clans would have been digging their own graves and benefiting the other forces.

However, it was also because of this extended period of peace that the soldiers stationed outside the city gates had become lazy and carefree. Some were sitting with their legs crossed, and others were lying on the ground and sleeping.

“Enemy assault!” a guard suddenly exclaimed in astonishment. He had only noticed the black figure that was streaking toward Separation Resentment City after coincidentally raising his head.

“Hurry, sound the alarm!” a guard shouted as he hurriedly jumped off a rock.

The other soldiers glanced up, only to see that the black figures were actually numerous Dragonhawks. There was a female rider on each Dragonhawk, and the woman in the lead was dressed in a suit of golden armor. She was beautiful and mighty, and she looked much like a goddess of war.

The soldiers fell to their knees upon seeing this. They felt as if their hearts were about to explode in apprehension.

That woman was far too powerful!

“Who comes? Since you’ve come to my Fu Clan, is there any need to act so haughty and domineering?” an aged voice asked. This voice had traveled over from Heaven Departing City, and it was as loud and deafening as the toll of a bell.

The woman in the lead casually waved her hand, causing her Dragonhawk to immediately stop and hover in the sky. At the same time, the 10 Dragonhawks behind her also stop in unison.

“Is there someone called Ling Han in Separation Resentment City?” the woman asked. Her voice wasn’t loud, yet it clearly traveled into the city.

“Friend, you’ve barged into my Fu Clan, and you’re acting with such arrogance and haughtiness. Do you think my Fu Clan is an easy target?”

Xiu!

A figure instantly shot over before proudly standing in the sky.

This was an ancestor of the Fu Clan, and he was an Immortal Palace Tier elite!
