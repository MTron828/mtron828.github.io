Chapter 2516: Killed with a Single Punch

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng!

The palm swung over, triggering power fluctuations of the Regulations.

The Celestial King in black was just about to turn around and reenter the fog, yet his eyes suddenly bulged out.

Had he seen a ghost?

Ling Han was still standing there, safe and sound. In fact, he even cracked a grin, although this grin didn’t make the man feel any sense of friendliness. Instead, he felt as if his head were about to explode in fear. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

‘How is this possible?!’

“So you’ve been concealing your strength!” the Celestial King in black exclaimed, immediately coming to a realization. Being able to block his attack was a clear sign that Ling Han’s strength had definitely reached the Celestial King Tier. Thus, regardless of whether he looked like a Celestial King or not, there was no doubt that he was indeed a Celestial King. Otherwise, his reaction would have been impossible.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Did I offend you? Why do you insist on killing me?”

“Humph! You’re clearly a Celestial King, yet you’re still being so pretentious and purposely obscure. Your intentions deserve death!” the Celestial King in black said in a baleful voice. Even if Ling Han were a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he would still be unafraid. This was because the Nine Deaths Formation would suppress everyone’s cultivation level to the First Heaven.

Here, everyone was a First Heaven Celestial King.

As such, what did he have to fear?

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Your words put me at ease. Now I can kill you without feeling any guilt at all. See, I’m a fairly friendly and kind person, aren’t I? Unlike you. Not only are your clothes black, but even your heart is as black as charcoal.”

The expression of the Celestial King in black instantly fell dark. Just how proper and solemn were Celestial Kings? Yet, Ling Han actually dared to taunt him like this? How immature!

......

He didn’t speak another word. Instead, he simply stared at Ling Han with killing intent.

He would simply kill this person. There was zero need for so much drivel.

“Die!” He immediately lashed out.

Boom!

His large hand transformed into a black sun that radiated with a scorching heat that could easily melt high-level Pseudo-Divine Metal.

This was the lunar fire essence.

Ling Han was astonished. This lunar fire essence couldn’t be refined by any random person. Instead, it could only be refined by those who had a deep understanding and comprehension of the Great Dao of Fire.

In his view, only monarch tiers and above could possibly refine lunar fire essence. However, would a monarch tier be unable to pass the Nine Deaths Formation and enter the martial academy?

“You didn’t refine this yourself, did you?” Ling Han asked. As he said this, he casually threw a punch.

Peng!

The black sun was instantly obliterated, unable to withstand the might of his punch.

The Celestial King in black was shocked. Not only had his ultimate attack been blocked, but even his secret had been exposed.

The lunar fire essence indeed hadn’t been refined by him. Instead, he had extracted it from bones that he had found in the tomb of an ancient Celestial King.

However, as a mighty Celestial King, he was actually using power that he had obtained from a corpse?

Now that he had been exposed by Ling Han, he involuntarily felt a sense of shame and anger. This was even though Ling Han didn’t know where exactly he had obtained this lunar fire essence from.

He then felt a cold chill run down his spine.

Just how devastatingly powerful was the lunar fire essence?

Even he didn’t dare to come into contact with it. This was naturally because it hadn’t been refined by him, so he was only using it as a precious tool. He would only release it when he needed it.

He trembled in fear. To unleash such might, just how insane was his opponent’s battle prowess?

A thought suddenly occurred to the Celestial King in black, and he stammered, “Y-you’re the person who defeated Yang Zhixuan with a single punch before!” When news of this had spread, it had caused a huge commotion and argument, with most people adamant that this was only a baseless rumor. After all, how could a person below the Celestial King Tier achieve such a feat?

Now, however, he had also come across an equally freakish person whose cultivation level clearly appeared lowly. Yet, his strength was as domineering as could be.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Your guess is correct! Now, why don’t you take another guess? Will I spare you or not?”

If this person hadn’t especially come out from the fog to kill Ling Han, the latter would have also ignored such a “minor character.” However, not only had the Celestial King in black revealed killing intent toward Ling Han, but he had even acted on this intent. Thus, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t show any mercy.

This was a completely different situation from the one with Yang Zhixuan.

A thought occurred to the Celestial King in black, and he suddenly turned around to flee.

He charged into the fog. This fog had a powerful ability to separate people, so even if two powerful Celestial Kings walked into it hand-in-hand, they would still be gradually separated without them noticing. They could only challenge the formation using their own strength.

Thus, once he entered the fog, he would reach absolute safety. In the future, he would also flee far away from this place, avoiding this murderous person forever.

“Heh, can you flee?” Ling Han said with a soft chuckle. He bent his knees before unleashing an explosive burst of power.

Peng!

His speed was terrifying as he caught up to the Celestial King in black in a flash, throwing a punch at his back.

The Celestial King in black was petrified to death. He hurriedly channeled all of his power to his back, aiming to block this strike. At the same time, he would also borrow its momentum to charge into the depths of the fog. This was his only way to survive.

Peng!

The punch landed, and the Celestial King in black’s defense was instantly ripped apart as if it were wet paper. Like a hot knife through butter, the punch then ripped through the Celestial King’s body, eventually protruding out the front of his chest.

The Celestial King in black was still running, yet he suddenly discovered that his power was rapidly draining away. His expression was dazed as he stared at the fist that had suddenly appeared before his chest. His eyes dimmed, and his head drooped. He was dead.

Boom!

Blood rain fell from the sky.

Ling Han casually tossed the corpse of the Celestial King aside. However, he didn’t forget to search his body. After all, there was no reason to abandon his spoils of battle.

Without a second glance, he strode into the fog. This wasn’t the first Celestial King that he had killed, so there was no need to think much about it.

“Brother Lin, what do you think about this brat?” Inside the martial academy, two young men were currently enjoying a game of go. There were no ribbons of iridescent light around them, and it was as if they were ordinary people. However, their eyes were incredibly sharp and intense, and even heaven and earth would tremble under their gaze.

“Brother Lin” smiled faintly, and replied, “This brat has experienced a greatly fortunate encounter. He’s clearly at the Third Heaven, yet he’s already been tempered by fundamental power. His battle prowess is simply astonishing.”

“However, he’s no well-behaved person. He’s already started killing people immediately upon arriving,” the other man said with a smile. “This person was brought over by your Junior Brother Zhou, so in the future, he’s also going to become a disciple under Lord Lin. The power of your branch is truly going to defy the heavens.”

He performed some calculations with his fingers, continuing, “Your esteemed master is a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, and Brother Lin is a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Brother Zhou Heng and Brother Chu Hao are also Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates. Counting this brat, your branch will have five Heavenly Venerates, with each having the potential to reach the Seventh Tier.”

“Brother Lin” laughed heartily. However, he shook his head, and said, “Even though Junior Brother Zhou, Junior Brother Chu, and I are all at the Sixth Tier, trying to advance to the Seventh Tier… will be as difficult as trying to ascend the heavens! In terms of this brat… He’s indeed got a good background and foundation, so it won’t be difficult for him to become a Heavenly Venerate. However, whether or not he can reach the Sixth Tier or even Seventh Tier is up to his fortunes.”

The other man nodded in agreement. Becoming a Heavenly Venerate wasn’t dependent on talent alone. It would also be affected by countless other complicated matters.

If someone heard this conversation, they would definitely be shocked to the core. This was because their words revealed that they were Heavenly Venerates. Moreover, one of them was a paramount Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate!

Indeed, this “Brother Lin” was none other than Lin Xiaoyang, son of the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, Lin Luo. Meanwhile, the other person was Fu Yueyun. Both of them were Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates.

“However, I still admire Brother Lin the most!” Fu Yueyun said with a smile. “Brother Lin’s cultivation talent isn’t outstanding, and in the past, you even lagged far behind your two senior brothers. Now, however, you’ve already caught up to them. In fact, you might even advance to the Seventh Tier before them!”

Lin Xiaoyang shook his head with a smile, saying, “That’s all thanks to the hard work of my father. Meanwhile, Junior Brother Zhou and Junior Brother Chu are genuinely accumulating their cultivation for the future. Once they release it, their accomplishments will be no less than that of my father. As for me, the Sixth Tier is most likely my limit.”
