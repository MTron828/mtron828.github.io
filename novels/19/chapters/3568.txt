Chapter 3569: One Star Celestial medicine

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han rested for a while, then joined forces with Princess Bixiao to raze the Seven Shattering Sect to the ground.

Of course, before razing the sect to the ground, they had first ransacked the entire treasure chamber of the sect. This naturally had to be handed over to the National Treasury, but how much would be handed over would depend on what the two Department Chiefs decided.

Only now did Ling Han discover that there was a reason why Pang Haifeng had established the Seven Shattering Sect in this place that was neither close to the mountains nor a water source. That was because there was a Celestial medicine here.

Of course, it was not the mother tree. Furthermore, even if Pang Haifeng had really obtained the mother tree, he would not dare to take it for his own. Instead, he would offer it to the elites, to avoid attracting trouble.

This was a One Star Celestial medicine, and in terms of relations, this was the seventh “grandson” of the mother tree. If it were to have more descendants, then it would not be qualified to be called Celestial medicine, but rather Spiritual Herbs and Treasured Fruits. Its effects would fall below Celestial Path, and even if Foundation Building Tier cultivators took it, there would be no benefit.

“Dragon Saliva Crimson Sun Fruit!” Princess Bixiao knew its value, and immediately called out.

Ling Han nodded. Previously, he had read the introduction of countless Celestial medicines, so he could also recognize this One Star Celestial medicine with a single glance.

“However, the fruit has just ripened, and is at least a dozen over years away from maturity,” he said. Celestial medicines matured slowly, flowering and bearing fruits slowly, and fruits also ripened slowly. From flowering to bearing fruit, it was very normal to wait one to two hundred years.

“No wonder Pang Haifeng established his sect here. His purpose is to hide this Celestial medicine,” Princess Bixiao said.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Celestial medicines have extremely high requirements for the environment in which they grow. Pang Haifeng doesn’t dare to transplant it, as he’s afraid of killing the Celestial medicine.”

“Then aren’t you afraid that if we transplant the Celestial medicine, it would kill the Celestial medicine as well?” Princess Bixiao asked.

This was a problem.

Ling Han frowned. If he brought the Celestial medicine back to the Imperial Capital, the chances of the Celestial medicine dying was extremely high. Furthermore, the fruits on the Celestial medicine would only ripen after at least a dozen over years. This was a very long time.

“Forget it, I’ll just leave it here. It would take too long for the fruit to ripen, and there are too many variables.” In the end, he still gave up on the idea of transplanting it.

He missed the Black Tower very much. In the past, when he discovered Spiritual Herbs, he only had to transplant them into the Black Tower, but now, he was only left with the Essence Nurturing Gourd. Though it could store living things, if he used it to grow Celestial medicines, the effects should not be too good.

Sigh!

The two of them dealt with this place, mainly to hide the Celestial medicine. Now, though the Seven Shattering Sect had become ruins, there was no guarantee that no one would come here to try their luck, and search for the treasures that had been left behind.

Even though a dozen years was a long time, Foundation Building Tier cultivators could live for over a thousand years at least. Thus, for Pang Haifeng, a dozen years was naturally no big deal.

“I really don’t know if we’ll have another chance to come here,” Princess Bixiao suddenly said with emotion.

Now that the situation was changing, and elites had appeared from the prison, Chen Fengyan couldn’t suppress the world all by himself like he had in the past. Who knew what this world would become in the future.

At present, territory was divided among the five top powers, but one’s ambition would definitely slowly grow with time. Who knew when a great turmoil would happen.

“There’s no need to be so pessimistic. A dozen over years later, who knows, we may have already become Spirit Transformation True Lords, and would no longer be interested in this One Star Celestial medicine,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Princess Bixiao rolled her eyes, “Do you think that above Celestial Path, it is as easy as Extreme Bone Tier and Inscription Tier to cultivate? After advancing into Celestial Path, it would be extremely difficult to even attain the slightest bit of improvement in ten years.”

“Oh?” Ling Han smiled faintly.

“For me, I am presently in the early stage of Human Dao Foundation. As the foundations of the Celestial Path are perfected, I will slowly transition into the middle stage, late stage, and directly reach the consummate level.” Princess Bixiao said, “The so-called small improvements are from the early stage to the middle stage, middle stage to late stage.”

“Hence, merely reaching the peak stage of Human Dao Foundation would need at least forty years’ time.”

“Then, I still have to build the foundation of Heavenly Dao, Ultimate Dao, and cultivate these two cultivation levels to Consummate level. Only then would I have the slightest hope of forging the Celestial Cauldron and advancing into the second tier of Celestial Path.”

“Do you still think that you can become a Spirit Transformation True Lord after a dozen years?”

Princess Bixiao shook her head, and said, “To say nothing of Spirit Transformation True Lord, one would have to experience at least a thousand years of hard cultivation to become a Core Formation Tier elite!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, “Who knows, if we are lucky, and eat Celestial medicines like carrots, then it would not be impossible for us to become True Lords in a dozen over years.”

Princess Bixiao was rendered speechless. Why was this guy so confident?

Forget it, she couldn’t be bothered with him.

The two of them spread the news of the destruction of the Seven Shattering Sect through the Wide Star Vine, which instantly shook all the sects.

The Dark North Nation was planning to cause trouble. It was clear that five elites had divided the world among them, but the Foreign Affairs Departmen acted in such a high-profile manner. Wasn’t that looking down on the other four elites?

When Ling Han and the princess arrived at the next sect, the sect master there immediately presented a surrender notice, expressing that he would completely abide by the laws of the Dark North Nation, and when Ling Han and the princess arrived at the third sect, they saw that there was already no one here.

Obviously, even if they could not afford to offend them, they could still avoid them, right?

Ling Han searched for a while. The people here were really ruthless. Not only had they emptied out the entire treasure chamber, they had even emptied out the medicinal field, leaving nothing valuable for Ling Han and Princess Bixiao.

The two of them were naturally furious, and flattened this empty shell of the sect.

They swept through the area. There were those they had successfully taken in, and there were also those that had fled before they arrived. However, there were also those who were stubbornly resisting. Furthermore, they had also invited Foundation Building Tier elites. This was not something that Princess Bixiao could stand against, and could only flee with Ling Han in tow.

True, on their way here, their backgrounds should have been figured out by others, so it was impossible for them to take advantage with the help of the Battle Armor.

“Let’s go back. We’ve gained quite a lot this time.”

The two of them returned to the Imperial Capital. This time, they had secured the submission of four sects, scared off five, and destroyed one. Their battle merits could be considered quite astonishing.

After returning to the Imperial City, Ling Han finally remembered that there was still the matter of the Seventh Imperial Prince, so he called someone over to ask.

“On the afternoon that you left, the Seventh Imperial Prince was rescued by the Second Imperial Prince and the others,” Lian Xuerong said.

“En?” Ling Han was surprised. The Eldest Imperial Prince and the others had publicly come to the Foreign Affairs Department to break him out?

“We tried our best to resist, but firstly, the abilities of the Eldest Imperial Prince and the others were too strong, and secondly, they are Imperial Princes, after all. We had many reservations, and in the end, they succeeded.” Lian Xuerong shook her head.

Ling Han knocked on the table, “At first, 1 had planned to make an example of him to intimidate the others, but now, not only are the others not intimidated, they are instead stepping on us?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ling Han, those are the Imperial Princes, after all. Let’s not become too hostile with them,” Lian Xuerong advised. She would never have imagined that this person that she had brought out from an incredibly remote, small place would be standing at such a height.

“From the moment I took down the Seventh Imperial Prince, relations have already become strained.” Ling Han smiled, “I have returned now, so I will play with them.”

“I believe that there is no need for me to seek them out. When they get the news, they would also deliver themselves to my door..”
