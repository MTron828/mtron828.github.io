Pa, that Demonic Beast sent Sun Jianfang flying with a single slap.

Sun Jianfang slammed heavily into the wall. His entire body sank into the wall, as if he was embedded in it.

Fortunately, Blood Transformation Tier elites weren’t so weak. He was only disoriented, and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.

Ling Han raised his sword and was about to attack when he heard the little pink pig roar.

This was a genuine pig’s cry, but the strange thing was that the Demonic Beast suddenly paused. It looked at the lecherous pig, and its eyes flickered, as if it was hesitating about something.

The little pink pig let out another cry, and the Demonic Beast immediately turned around and fled with its tail between its legs.

Ling Han was astonished. How scared must it be to flee with its tail between its legs?

Once this lecherous pig roared, a Blood Transformation Tier Demonic Beast would flee in fear?

Ling Han looked at this pig again, and it was winking at him, as if to say, “Aren’t I super powerful?”

This lecherous pig could actually intimidate other Demonic Beasts apart from having an indestructible defense?

Could he also be a spirit-type?

“Stupid pig, I’ve really underestimated you.” Ling Han grabbed the lecherous pig. “You actually didn’t use such an ability earlier?”

The pig spread out its two front paws, meaning, “You didn’t ask me.”

Ling Han nodded to himself. From the looks of it, the little handmaiden was able to survive the beast tide unscathed not only because of Sun Jianfang, but also because of this pig.

“Come, open the path!” He led the way.

“Gu! Gu!” The little pink pig let out a strange cry. It did not want to be carried by Ling Han like this. What it needed was the embrace of a beauty.

It was just that its defense was invincible, and it could scare away Blood Transformation Tier beasts. However, its battle prowess was only five, and it couldn’t be any worse than that, so it could only cry out in vain.

However, it was really effective. Ling Han carried the little pink pig and led the way in front. When the Demonic Beasts that were charging over saw this, they all stopped in their tracks. They growled at Ling Han a few times, then turned around and ran.

Ling Han wanted to go and get Lian Xuerong, Mo Guohao, and the others, but the situation was chaotic now, and all he could do was guard the people by his side.

Furthermore, he had a nagging feeling that this pig was not very reliable. Right now, it could intimidate other Demonic Beasts, but who knew if it would suddenly not work after a while?

He decided to leave the city. This was a dangerous place and they could not stay for long.

“Ah!” A scream sounded like a thunderclap in the sky above the entire city.

Ling Han turned around to take a look, and his expression became solemn.

The battle between Feng Zisheng and the bird king had already been decided. Feng Zisheng’s chest had been pierced by the bird king’s sharp claws, and he spat out blood. Although he was not dead yet, he clearly could not last long either.

It was over. Even Feng Zisheng would be dying; who could stop that bird king?

“Quick!” Ling Han turned around and dashed forward without hesitation. Gradually, the roars of the beasts around the three of them became softer and softer, and finally completely disappeared.

They ran out of the city and came to a river.

They stopped and looked back. The entire Huju City had already turned into a sea of fire. Even from such a distance, they could still see the figures of those huge Demonic Beasts.

After resting for a while, they walked along the river and walked for a long time before stopping to truly rest.

After a long night, the white light of dawn appeared in the east. The three of them woke up one after another. Only the lecherous pig was still sleeping soundly in Huan Xue’s arms, drooling everywhere.

“I really didn’t expect such a calamity to happen!” Sun Jianfang sighed.

However, Ling Han knew that this was not a natural disaster, but a man-made one. However, what puzzled him was how exactly that mysterious force controlled those spirit-type Demonic Beasts..

Logically speaking, it should be a spirit-type Demonic Beast controlling them.

Ling Han did not explain to Sun Jianfang. This mysterious organization seemed to be really powerful, so it was better not to involve Sun Jianfang.

Moreover, he had been poisoned and had not resolved this problem yet.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han suddenly raised his head. He heard the sounds of fighting coming from ahead, and they were approaching him.

He thought for a moment and said, “Let’s hide first and see what happens.”

“Yeah.”

Sun Jianfang and Huan Xue nodded. The three of them hid in the bushes by the river. They were so densely packed that it was impossible to discover them if others did not search carefully.

After a while, two people ran over. One of them suddenly staggered and fell to the ground.

“Uncle Mu! Uncle Mu!” Another person exclaimed, her voice filled with panic.

Ling Han was astonished. These two people were actually Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian.

Were they being chased by Demonic Beasts?

Of course, he wasn’t sure if that lecherous pig could scare off a Demonic Beast in the Extreme Bone Tier, but if he didn’t step forward bravely, this would become a thorn that would forever prick his heart..

There were some things that a man should do and some things that a man should not do. Now, he would never be a coward.

However, before he could rush out, another person appeared. It was an old geezer with white hair.

Eh, Hu Can?

Ling Han was stunned. The pursuer was actually Hu Can? Or could it be that he was actually also a fugitive, just a step behind Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian?

“Hahahaha, run! Just continue to run!” Hu Can sneered. He stared at Butler Mu and then glanced at Feng Ruoxian with a crazed expression.

What was going on?

Hu Can, who was at the Fifth Change in Blood Transformation Tier, was actually chasing after Butler Mu, who was at the Extreme Bone Tier?

Ling Han took a closer look at Butler Mu, and came to a sudden realization.

It turned out that there was a deep wound on Butler Mu’s abdomen that kept bleeding. In this short while after he had fallen, a pool of blood had appeared on the ground.

He was seriously injured. No wonder he was not Hu Can’s match.

But why did Hu Can want to kill Butler Mu? Didn’t he know that Feng Zisheng — that’s right, Feng Zisheng had already died in the city.

“Hu Can, you’re just a dog. Do you have the right to bark in front of me?” Butler Mu struggled to support his body. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“If you weren’t injured and still maintained the battle prowess of the Extreme Bone Tier, then even if you gave me a great humiliation, I would only be able to swallow my anger,” Hu Can said proudly. “However, who asked you to be heavily injured now?”

“You didn’t expect this, did you? The day before yesterday, you were still awe-inspiring and ruthlessly humiliated me. But now? You’ve already fallen into my hands. The heavens are really just.”

Butler Mu was cold and silent for a while before saying, “Since it’s a grudge between you and me, let Young Miss leave.”

“Hey, hey, hey, don’t make decisions on your own!” Hu Can waved his hand. “How boring would it be if there’s no one around to admire it? Young Miss, you should stay!”

Butler Mu’s expression changed. “If Young Miss saw you kill me with her own eyes, would you let her live?”

“Aiyo, that’s right!” Hu Can suddenly clapped his hands and revealed a look of realization. “Then there’s no choice. I can only make Young Miss shut up forever!”
