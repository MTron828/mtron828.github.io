Chapter 1243: Disciple of the Heaven’s Sword Palace

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This slash was incredibly quick. In fact, it was so quick that it arrived in front of Ling Han before the sound of its swing even traveled over.

Ling Han replied with his fist.

His fist collided with the sword light, instantly causing it to shatter into pieces. A human figure flew back in retreat.

However, that person was fairly skilled, and they dispelled most of the force from Ling Han’s punch by doing a backflip through the air. They landed on the ground steadily.

It was a female, and she looked to be around 20 years old. She was quite beautiful, yet there was an air of arrogance on her face. If she weren’t the darling daughter of some powerful family, then she was probably the beloved young miss of some clan. She had clearly been spoiled.

Behind her, another seven people were briskly walking over. They were all men, and only one of them was a white-haired elder. The other six were all spirited young men.

“Junior Sister!” The six young men immediately ran over and surrounded the young beauty. Their voices were filled with care and concern.

“Junior Sister, are you okay?”

“That person didn’t hurt you, did he?”

“Despicable! He actually dares to attack Junior Sister!”

These young men glared at Ling Han as they expressed their concern for the young beauty. It was as if they wanted to kill him with their glare. Meanwhile, they completely ignored the fact that it was the young woman who had attacked him first.

Ling Han couldn’t help but find this funny. This woman had attacked him out of the blue, and he had simply retaliated in self-defense. Why were they glaring at him as if he had done something abhorrent? He shook his head, and said, “Don’t you guys think you owe me an explanation and apology?”

“Explanation?”

“Apology?”

The young men chuckled coldly. This person had “injured” their junior sister, yet he actually wanted them to offer an explanation and apologize? Had his brain been kicked in by a donkey?

“Humph! You’re a mere looter who deserves to be killed! Yet, you actually want us to offer an explanation and apologize? Keep dreaming!” one of the young men shouted.

Ling Han’s anger subsided a little when he heard this.

Indeed, one didn’t need to hold back when attacking a looter. Otherwise, they would be risking their own life. However, which part of him looked like a looter?

“You people think I’m a looter?” Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Your observation skills are truly trash. It’s time to get your eyes checked!”

“Despicable thief, the map in your hands belonged to one of our senior brothers. If you aren’t a looter, why is the map in your hands?” the young woman asked angrily. She had already caught her breath.

“I’m not sure if you’re joking!” Ling Han said with a mocking laugh. “Couldn’t I have killed another looter and snatched it from them?”

“Heh, young man, if that’s the case, please return the map to us,” the elder said. His voice was low, and it possessed a powerful might.

He was an elite at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, so he naturally wasn’t afraid of Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed in anger, and said, “Let’s forget about whom this map belongs to first. Since I obtained this map, shouldn’t you people be more polite if you want it back?

“I’m not your slave, yet you people are acting all high and mighty. What, do I owe you people something?”

“Bullsh*t!” a young man chided. “That map was originally ours, so isn’t it natural that you return it to us?”

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Originally yours? This map has existed for tens of millions of years, and it’s an item from the ancient past. Its original owner has died years ago. So, how is it ‘originally yours’? At most, it’s something that you people snatched from someplace else. There’s no need to act so righteously.”

“Young man, are you asking for trouble?” the elder said with a humph.

“Seventh Uncle, there’s no need to speak nonsense with him. Seize him!” the young woman shouted. Out of everyone present, only she dared to speak to the elder like this. Who told her to be so spoiled and pampered?

The elder pondered for a moment, and then said, “Fine. Try not to hurt him.”

The seven young men all chuckled coldly. They only needed to “try” not to hurt him—in other words, hurting him would be fine.

The strength of these young men was far above the strength of the looters from before. Apart from the elder being at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, the seven young men were also at the Sun Moon Tier. Their cultivation levels ranged from the early stage of the low extreme to the peak stage of the low extreme. However, none of them were at the medium extreme.

This made sense. If they weren’t powerful enough, how would they dare to look for that group of looters?

Judging by their attitude, the treasure map was genuinely a valuable item.

With a thought, Ling Han placed both the treasure map and the egg back into the Black Tower. He then turned to them, and coldly said, “Although you people aren’t looters, you’re not much better than them. I’ll give you people one final warning. Apologize to me. Otherwise, pray for the blessings of heaven.”

“Laughable! It’s already come to this, yet you still dare to threaten us!”

“Kill him and be done with it! It’s not like his Spatial Spirit Tool will run away!”

“That’s right, kill him! We’re disciples of the Heaven’s Sword Palace!”

The seven young men all voiced their opinions.

‘Heaven’s Sword Palace?’

Ling Han’s killing intent instantly soared. He hadn’t gone looking for the Five Sects yet, yet they had coincidentally crossed paths here.

‘As expected of the Five Sects—they’ve always been this arrogant and domineering!’

“Aren’t you afraid that I have a powerful background? One that can annihilate the Heaven’s Sword Palace with a flip of their hands?” he asked calmly.

“Haha! People with powerful backgrounds don’t go running around alone. They definitely have people guarding them in secret,” a young man scoffed. Did this person think they were fools? They knew very well whom they could offend and whom they couldn’t.

“Let me tell you something else,” another young man said. “Those from powerful clans or powerful sects all have clear symbols on their clothing!” He lifted his sleeve, revealing a small sword that was sewn into it. It was very small, and one wouldn’t notice it if they weren’t paying attention.

‘So that’s how it is.’

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Thanks for the information. As your reward, I’ll send you all on your way!”

He planned to obliterate the Five Sects, but he didn’t plan to kill every single member of the Five Sects. He believed that no matter how despicable a sect, there were always members who were just and noble. Thus, he only intended to disperse the Five Sects and kill all the higher-ups—he would let everyone else leave.

However, these people in front of him... Heh, they stirred his killing intent.

“How bold and shameless!” the seven young men sneered. Although they were young, they had all cultivated for at least 100,000 years. Moreover, their hands were stained with blood. So, how could they possibly be lenient toward him?

“The treasure map is of utmost importance and secrecy. We can’t let him live!”

“Die!”

The seven young men ruthlessly charged toward him.

Ling Han humphed coldly. He then snapped his fingers, sending a torrent of ferocious Sword Qi toward his opponents.

He had held back before not because of soft-heartedness, but because he didn’t have a habit of killing for no reason. However, these people were seeking death now, so he naturally didn’t mind sending them into the afterlife.

“Sh*t!” The elder’s expression changed drastically when he saw Ling Han unleash his attack.

This was far too terrifying. He had only snapped his fingers, yet the battle prowess that he unleashed was already nearing his level.

One had to realize that Ling Han was already at the middle stage of the low extreme. Moreover, he possessed power that could surpass six stars. Thus, his true power was already at the peak stage of the medium extreme. Just how terrifying was this?

Pu, pu, pu!

The torrent of Sword Qi instantly crushed the heads of the seven young men. None of them had a complete corpse.

Although the elder had dashed over, he was a step too late. He could only watch on as his seven juniors were massacred before him.

These were prodigies that the sect had raised for over 100,000 years!

The elder’s heart bled.

He glowered at Ling Han, and spat, “Brat, I’m going to slice your flesh off piece by piece and feed it to dogs!”
