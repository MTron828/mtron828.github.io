Chapter 3286 - 3286: Returning the favor

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han nodded, and said, “To be precise, it’s an increase of 11 times the effect.’

Xuanyuan Dingguo felt his scalp go numb. What kind of concept was that?

The mystical power of a cultivator was stored in the meridians, and the meridians were only so wide. The amount that could be stored was naturally limited. Once it was used up, it would be gone.

Therefore, as cultivators fought, they would encounter an awkward problem. Their power would suddenly completely disappear, and an absolutely advantageous position could have the tables instantly turned. It was very normal for them to lose and die.

At this time, the Qi Return Pill would be of great use. It was equivalent to extending one’s life.

Although there was no limit to the number of Qi Return Pills one could consume, there was a problem with the conversion rate. If one ate one or ten at the same time, the amount that could really be converted into mystical power was basically the same.

Therefore, if this Qi Return Pill with an increased effect of 11 times was taken out, it would be fought over by Blood Transformation Tier elites.

“Ling Han, do you still have such Qi Return Pills?” Xuanyuan Dingguo hurriedly asked. He could smell the immense value of these pills.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “There are still a few left.”

“Can you sell them to me?” Xuanyuan Dingguo asked expectantly.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “I’m not selling, but we can work together to do business.’

“How?” Xuanyuan Dingguo asked.

“I have 10 improved Qi Return Pills here. Take them and auction them. At the same time, hire alchemists to refine the improved version of the Qi Return Pill. After they become popular overnight, do something like sell only a limited number,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Xuanyuan Dingguo was taken aback. “You mean you’ll offer the pill recipe?”

This was even more shocking than the fact that Ling Han possessed an improved version of the Qi Return Pill. This was a pill recipe! Who wouldn’t hide it? As a unique ultimate knowledge, who would offer it out for others to learn?

However, Ling Han did not care at all. The great dao had just begun to rise, and the Qi Return Pill was only worth some money for now. In the future, no one would be interested in it, and it would be of little value.

Therefore, he naturally had to seize the opportunity to make a fortune. Other than the Qi Return Pill, there were also the Mystical Power Pill and the Meridian Exploration Pill. They had all been improved by him. He had originally given them to MO Guohao, but MO Guohao had died in Huju City.

“You’re really willing?” Xuanyuan Dingguo’s eyes lit up. To him, selling an improved version of the Qi Return Pill from his own hands was not only a matter of earning money, but it would also give him additional points from General Xuanyuan and even in fact gain the favor of the Holy Emperor, His Majesty.

The significance of this was completely different.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “If I was not willing, then why should I tell you so much?”

“Haha, hahaha, good!” Xuanyuan Dingguo was overjoyed. He had personally come to see Ling Han only to express his appreciation of Ling Han. He had not expected to receive such an unexpected reward.

“Then how should we split the profits?” He looked at Ling Han. Ling Han had the upper hand in this matter.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Not only do I provide the alchemy method for the Qi Return Pill, but I also provide the same for the Mystical Power Pill and the Meridian Exploration Pill. They are all improved versions, and you can let someone test their effects. In terms of profits, how about 50/50?”

He only offered three pill recipes but took half of the profits. This ratio was not low.

Xuanyuan Dingguo thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay!”

If this was another person, or another business, wasn’t it a joke if he wanted to take 50% of the profits without any effort on his part?

However, this was different. In addition to making money, it also had a greater political significance. Therefore, Xuanyuan Dingguo was willing to do it even if he didn’t earn a single cent.

Moreover, the improved version of the Qi Return Pill could definitely dominate the pill market. It could also be sold for several times the price. Even 10% of the net profit was extremely impressive.

At that thought, Xuanyuan Dingguo’s slight dissatisfaction disappeared.

Earning money, fame, and prestige were simply gold ingots that had fallen right into his lap from the skies.

Ling Han directly handed over the three pill recipes to Xuanyuan Dingguo. It was his principle to use people without suspicion.

Xuanyuan Dingguo naturally thought more highly of Ling Han. This young man really knew how to behave. Such trust made him a little excited, and he wanted to completely trust Ling Han and vice versa.

“Ling Han, there’s a place I don’t know if you’re interested in going,” he suddenly said, deciding to return the favor.

“Oh, what place?” Ling Han asked, his expression a little strange. This fellow wouldn’t want to invite him to a br*thel to celebrate, right?

“A catacomb. I found it not long ago,” said Xuanyuan Dingguo.

“A historical site of the previous civilization?” Ling Han asked.

“I don’t think so.” Xuanyuan Dingguo shook his head. “There are three levels in the catacombs, and a large number of Purple Wasps live there.”

“Purple Wasps?” Ling Han had never heard of them.

Xuanyuan Dingguo smiled, and said, “Purple Wasps are a type of Demonic Beast. At most, they are at the Blood Transformation Tier, but because they live in groups, their numbers are huge. If they attack in groups, not to mention an Extreme Bone Tier, even an Inscription Tier would have a headache.”

“However, the honey brewed by the Purple Wasps is an incomparably precious body tempering material.” Xuanyuan Dingguo continued, “We once sent a mini drone into the catacombs to investigate the situation. There’s a lot of honey inside.”

“Moreover, there’s a Vermillion Fruit on the third level of the catacombs.

According to our speculation, it’s at least a thousand years old.”

Ling Han was delighted. The Vermillion Fruit was also a Godly medicine that strengthened one’s life and vitality. If he wanted to break through to the Second Change, then the Vermillion Fruit would be a timely help.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“What was the result?” he asked.

Xuanyuan Dingguo nodded. “When you reach the Second Change in the future, the thousand-year-old Vermillion Fruit will be of great use.”

“Alright!” Ling Han immediately agreed, and then asked, “When are we setting

Xuanyuan Dingguo couldn’t help but smile. “Why are you more anxious than me?” He didn’t keep him in suspense. “The tentative date is ten days later, we need to be fully prepared.”

In that catacomb, there were millions of Purple Wasps, and they were at least in the Meridian Opening Tier. There were also quite a number of Blood Transformation Tier beings, and the poison of the bees was fatal. Thus, it would probably be bad even if it was an Inscription Tier elite that rashly entered.

However, the General Vajra guarded the border. How could he set everything aside to get some honey?

Thus, when a few Blood Transformation Tier elites entered the catacombs, they had to be fully prepared, or else they might lose their lives.

Ling Han was not afraid. He had the Essence Nurturing Gourd. Worse come to worst, he could hide inside. He believed that with the Purple Wasps’ intelligence, they would not be able to discover the secret of the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

Of course, he would not reveal the secret of the Essence Nurturing Gourd. Just the spatial attribute alone made it incomparably precious, not to mention that it could nurture divine sense.

‘Let’s wait.’

Taking advantage of these few days of time, Ling Han actively refined medicinal pills. These were all not for sale, and he would only use them for himself.

He calculated the time. There was still a month before the test. Then, when he returned from the catacombs, he would go and certify himself as a formations master. It would be just right in time for him to participate in the formations competition after the new year.

In just seven days, the improved Qi Return Pills began to be auctioned.

Ordinary Qi Return Pills were sold for 10,000 Dark North Coins each, which was already very expensive. After all, they were consumables. However, the improved version of the Qi Return Pill could be sold for at most 230,000 and at least 200,000.

After Ling Han learned of this, he smiled slightly. He could happily earn money again..
