3109 Excited

It was just like when a hyena hunted a bison. When it came to head-on confrontation, the hyena would definitely be instantly killed by the bison. However, if the hyena went behind the bison and *** it, what would it matter if the bison had great power? It would still die.

Zheng Tongfeng was full of confidence. Ling Han was that wild bison, while he was the hyena. As long as he could seize an opportunity, his strike would definitely take Ling Han’s life.

However, when he moved, he was horrified to discover that Ling Han’s speed was actually not inferior to his.

‘What?!’

He was stunned. What kind of rare treasure could cause a qualitative change in both a person’s strength and speed?

Ding, ding, ding! As they clashed repeatedly, Zheng Tongfeng’s expression looked like he had seen a ghost.

Was the other party really only a One Meridian?

Ling Han gave him the feeling that he was a Five Meridians. He was too powerful.

Zheng Tongfeng was completely suppressed. To speak nothing of killing Ling Han, if they continued to fight, he would definitely lose his life.

The moment this kind of fear rose up in him, he had lost all his fighting spirit.

He had to flee.

He thought of this, then turned around, and was about to flee to the sect.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Still want to run?”

He was not Zheng Tongfeng. He was a man who had experienced countless bloodshed in his life. He took a big stride forward, and the longsword in his hand aimed directly for the other party’s back.

Zheng Tongfeng didn’t even turn his head as he parried with his sword. Ding, his strength was far inferior to Ling Han’s, and his sword was instantly diverted by Ling Han’s sword, and the latter continued to stab forward.

Zheng Tongfeng’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as he hurriedly called out, “Junior Brother Ling, let’s talk things out.”

“Alright,” Ling Han said. “Then tell me, who asked you to bring me to the casino?”

Zheng Tongfeng didn’t respond. He didn’t dare to betray Li Changdan. Otherwise, his ending wouldn’t be any better.

“You’re not going to tell me?” Ling Han said with a cold smile. “I don’t care anyways.”

He thrust his sword forward. Pu, the cold blade pierced through Zheng Tongfeng’s body. This weapon was made of Earth Element Iron, and it was incomparably sharp and sturdy.

Although Zheng Tongfeng was a Four Meridians cultivator with a power of 1,500 kg, his physique was no different from an ordinary person’s. Of course, his body wouldn’t be able to withstand this strike.

Zheng Tongfeng turned his head and stared blankly at Ling Han. Then, he slowly closed his eyes, lowered his head, and took his last breath.

Ling Han really didn’t care who was plotting against him behind his back. Such a person would definitely jump out again. As long as Ling Han had sufficient strength, then he would kill whoever came, so why would he care who it was?

They were just clowns in his eyes.

He withdrew his sword, thought for a moment, and dragged Zheng Tongfeng into the forest in the distance.

This way, Zheng Tongfeng’s body might wait months or years to be discovered, or it might even stay there forever.

If it were someone else, their legs might have gone soft, and their hands might have trembled at this moment. However, Ling Han had killed decisively all his life. The number of elites and prodigies he had killed was innumerable, so how could he take this to heart?

‘If people don’t offend me, I won’t offend them. If anyone offends me, I’ll return the favor tenfold.’

This was Ling Han’s principle, and he had always been someone who adhered to his principles.

“Sigh, I’ve clearly accommodated the entire Genesis World. Luck and affinity should all be soaring straight off the charts, so why am I still encountering trouble?” Ling Han scratched his head, appearing rather depressed.

“Could it be that my halo of trouble is the strongest attribute, and can overwhelm everything?

“That’s the only explanation.”

Ling Han returned to his residence and called Huan Xue over. Then, he handed over three alchemical pills. “Take them.”

“Young Master, what is this?” Huan Xue was curious.

“Oh, Meridian Guiding Pills,” Ling Han said casually.

Huan Xue was speechless, and could only open her mouth wide.

What? Was this the Meridian Guiding Pill?

Although she wasn’t a martial artist, she had grown up in the Ancient Dao Sect, so she had naturally heard of the Meridian Guiding Fruit and Meridian Guiding Pill.

This thing was very expensive, especially the Meridian Guiding Pill, which was even more valuable than the Meridian Guiding Fruit. It cost more than 100 jade seeds, and one jade seed was enough to buy her.

Ling Han had actually given her three pills in a single stroke. How could she not be dumbfounded?

“Young, Young Master, I, I, y-you…” It took her a long time to come back to her senses, but she was still stammering.

“Take them.” Ling Han nodded, and said, “Later, I’ll teach you the Four Directional Fists. After you’ve mastered it, take an alchemical pill at dawn when the sun rises, and start practicing the fist technique.”

“Thank you, thank you, Young Master.” Huan Xue’s speech was incoherent. Such a surprise was really going to knock her unconscious. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At this moment, she was truly willing to die for Ling Han.

In such a chaotic world, what was the most important?

Strength!

She didn’t know if she could step onto the path of martial arts, but at the very least, Ling Han had given her a chance, and if it were anyone else, they probably wouldn’t give her such an opportunity.

Ling Han taught Huan Xue the Four Directional Fists. After mastering that unknown cultivation technique, to say nothing of this simplified version of the Four Directional Fists, even the real Four Directional Fists would be nothing to him.

Of course, the Four Directional Fists should still be very useful against enemies.

Huan Xue wasn’t stupid, and her zeal was also ignited. If she couldn’t learn it once, she would practice it a second time and a third time. No matter how sore her hands and feet were, she gritted her teeth and persisted.

It was only when Ling Han called for her to stop that she took a break.

After spending a few days, Huan Xue finally learned the Four Directional Fists. However, she had only learned the stances, and many details were not perfect enough.

After another two days, she finally mastered the Four Directional Fists.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. If he were able to nurture a maid at Twelve Meridians, would others get a huge fright from this?

He then thought of something else. Right now, his wealth was supported by the Meridian Guiding Pills, but the raw materials for the Meridian Guiding Pill were restricted, so he couldn’t obtain the pill in large quantities. ‘There are two more days before the deadline I agreed on with Sect Master Sun. Can I get another Meridian Guiding Fruit?

‘Can I buy the raw materials?

‘It should be very difficult. As long as one doesn’t reach the Twelve Meridians, everyone will keep the Meridian Guiding Fruit for themselves.

‘Eh, there actually is something I can do!’

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. He had thought of a solution. However, he had already used up all the Meridian Guiding Pills, so he still had to slow down for now.

Another two days passed, and Ling Han had already widened his fourth meridian to the extreme.

He now had 4000 kg of strength, and normally speaking, a peak Four Meridians cultivator would only have 1750 kg of strength.

However, the higher one’s cultivation level was, the slower one’s cultivation would be. This was because the total amount of energy Ling Han absorbed remained unchanged, but the more meridians there were, the harder it would be to widen them.

Therefore, he needed more jade seeds to set up a Spirit Gathering Formation to accelerate his cultivation.

There were also Precious Fruits, which could directly increase one’s cultivation. No matter how many there were, he wouldn’t mind.

As his strength skyrocketed, Ling Han’s physique also improved. His muscles became denser, and his bones also became much more robust. Otherwise, if he delivered a punch, then even if it could shatter rocks, his fist would also explode into pieces.

He realized that this enhancement came from the Precious Fruits he had eaten in the Monkey Valley.

Those seven days had really been an eye-opener for him. The monkeys in the valley had extremely powerful physiques, and they wouldn’t die even if they fell from a high place. In fact, in order to satisfy their appetites, they had even hunted down a ferocious tiger.

They had only dispatched three male baboons, but not only had all of them returned safely, but none of them had been injured.

The strength of their physique was evident.
