3044 Obtaining the secret code of life again

Under Ling Han’s coercion, Shatter Mountains was forced to enter the main battlefield to face Hysteria.

Ling Han did not care whether Shatter Mountains would go all out to deal with Hysteria, or whether it would just be perfunctory effort.

He only wanted Shatter Mountains to enter the main battlefield, even if it was just for show.

This was because the more Shatter Mountains did not want to face Hysteria, the more Ling Han wanted to do the opposite of what the former wanted.

He guarded the passageway in case Shatter Mountains had any thoughts of getting lucky and turned back.

After guarding for a year, Ling Han finally returned.

When Shatter Mountains appeared, it naturally surprised Lin Luo and the others.

What was going on? Why was Shatter Mountains back?

“Shatter Mountains, why did you come back? Did you come to watch the excitement?” Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows couldn’t help but complain. He only felt that he had been wronged. He had just advanced to the Seventh Tier, and hadn’t even shown off enough, yet he was repeatedly frightened by Ling Han.

Now that he had encountered the matter of the five ultimate elites withdrawing from the Realm Battlefield, he also wanted to quit.

Shatter Mountains’ expression darkened. Of course, he was too embarrassed to say that he had been forced into this place by Ling Han.

At this moment, he was actually a little grateful. If he had been fighting with Ling Han all the way here, he would naturally have lost even more face.

“Since you’re here, let’s deal with Hysteria together.” Lin Luo waved his hand. He was looking at the big picture, and did not want everyone to discriminate against Shatter Mountains and make him leave again.

When dealing with Hysteria, the more people there were, the better.

Shatter Mountains joined the battle. It seemed like he would have to stay here for a while. He couldn’t just watch.

‘Die!’

He vented his anger on Hysteria and began a fierce battle.

***

Ling Han returned and quietly waited for the birth of his third child.

He waited and waited, but his third child was successfully born only 10,000 years later.

It was a boy.

Ling Han was overjoyed. Moreover, this was his child, and no one could deprive him of the right to name his child.

He had been thinking about it all these years, so he had naturally thought of a name.

Ling Kang.

It was very simple because he wanted his son to grow up healthy and well, living every day peacefully[1].

Ling Han didn’t ask for much. It was just that simple.

Of course, Ling Han still prepared a large amount of cultivation resources for Ling Kang, guaranteeing his son the best conditions for growth.

Of course, this was a joyous occasion. Ling Han invited his friends and family, and held a small-scale banquet.

The little fellow’s rate of growth followed Ling Xi’s slow style. Year after year passed, but he almost didn’t grow at all, and the speed at which his intelligence developed was also extremely slow. Every day, he would just smile foolishly, causing Ling Han to constantly sigh at the fact that he had gotten a silly son.

In the end, he was beaten up by Yue Hongchang, who said that it had been the same for him when he had been small.

Ling Han was speechless. In this world, if there was anyone who could make Ling Han unable to retaliate, it would definitely be his mother.

Several million years passed again, and Ling Han decided to take a look at the Celestial Realm.

100,000,000 years had passed. He had to go and take a look at the situation. Furthermore, he had created many new devices over the years. He also had to send them to various dimensions to further increase the speed of his search.

This time, he brought the women along as if they were going on vacation. After traveling through several dimensions, they arrived at the Celestial Realm.

The result made Ling Han very disappointed. After so many years of hard work, the Celestial Kings had only searched about 1% of the living beings. They were still far from the entire number. Furthermore, how many new lives had been born after 100,000,000 years?

There was simply no end to this.

Ling Han distributed many more scanning devices. This was a long-term plan to land a big catch. He believed that there would definitely be some gains.

He then went to the Foreign Realm and visited the dimensions one by one to see if there were any results while distributing more testing devices.

One had to have a long-term vision.

After arriving at a medium-level dimension, Ling Han finally received good news. Such a person had finally been discovered.

This made Ling Han overjoyed, and he hurriedly went to take a look.

This was a young man, and his natural talent in cultivation was very high. At present, he was under the tutelage of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King. He had already reached the peak stage of the Ascending Origin Tier, and was about to advance to the Celestial King Tier.

When they had first discovered him, he had been just a little kid in his teens, and he had been able to reach the peak stage of the Ascending Origin Tier in 100,000,000 years. This cultivation speed was not low at all.

This young man’s name was Ba Tai.

Ling Han taught him what to do, and the two of them extended their divine senses, entering into each other’s minds to touch that speck of light.

Ling Han had already obtained the life code in his ball of light. There was no need for him to comprehend anymore. Instead, it was up to Ba Tai.

A few days later, although Ba Tai did not unlock the secret of his own sphere of light, he gave all the information he had obtained to Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, and gave Ba Tai a large amount of cultivation resources. This brat might enjoy endless development in the future, so it was better to nurture him.

He began to enter seclusion to digest the information he had obtained.

Very slowly, it took Ling Han several million years before he was able to analyze the profound secrets contained within.

He revealed a satisfied smile and filled in a few more holes in the secret code of life.

Boom! In his body, every dimension was undergoing drastic changes. Previously, there was only grass that was less than an inch[2] tall, but now it was growing sturdily, reaching a foot[3] in length. Furthermore, they were no longer pure green in color. Instead, there were green, blue, purple, and red. They were all colorful, showing a variety of hues.

Although there were still only plants, Ling Han’s dimensions had made great progress in their level of existence.

Every dimension was exuding vigorous life energy that was nourishing the said dimension. This speed was comparable to Ling Han’s full efforts at cultivation.

If he obtained a few more secret codes of life, wouldn’t his cultivation speed be able to soar?

Ling Han’s biggest headache was the dimensions in his body. Although they gave him powerful battle prowess, they also hindered his advancement. However, if this problem could be solved now, then it would be perfect. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Most importantly, these dimensions were growing on their own. He didn’t need to spend any effort at all.

Great!

Ling Han did not take Ba Tai as his disciple, but still brought him to the Profound Negative Realm. In this place, Ba Tai had even more room for growth.

He continued to travel through the various dimensions. After having gained once, his confidence soared, and he naturally became even more proactive.

Heaven had truly blessed him. In the next few million years, he met two more prodigies like this.

One was called Ma Chenggao, and the other was An Feiyue. At first glance, there was nothing special about them, but one had a particularly powerful divine sense, and the other had outstanding talent in formations.

Ling Han went into seclusion for a long time, and once again digested these two secret codes of life.

Of course, Ma Chenggao and An Feiyue were also brought to the Profound Negative Realm by him. No matter what, they were still worth nurturing.

After Ling Han digested these two secret codes of life, the dimensions in his body underwent another drastic change.

These were two abnormally rapid evolutions, causing birds and beasts to appear in every dimension.

From plants to animals, this was naturally an incomparably drastic evolution with huge changes.
