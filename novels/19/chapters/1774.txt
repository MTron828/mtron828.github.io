Chapter 1775: Southern Cup Rock Sun Water

Fu Junyong left in misery and dejection.

The wounds that Ling Han had given him weren’t the most important. He could fully recover from these wounds in a dozen or so days. However, the spot to enter the mystery realm...

Anyhow, following Fu Junyong, several more people visited Ling Han to ask for the spot to enter the mystery realm.

Some of them were relatively polite, and they were willing to use Star Stones, Saintly medicines, or even cultivation techniques to exchange for this spot. However, there were also some who were incredibly arrogant, and they directly ordered Ling Han to yield his spot.

When facing the former, Ling Han would also be polite and nicely ask them to leave. Facing the latter, however, Ling Han would directly beat them out of his residence.

Peng!

There was a violent shudder, and it was as if the entire courtyard were about to collapse. It finally stabilized after a moment, and it was also at this time that a cold and eerie voice suddenly traveled over. “Where’s Ling Han? Get the hell out here to greet me!”

There was a terrifying might in this voice, and it definitely didn’t belong to someone at the Severing Mundane Tier. Instead, it belonged to an elite at the Dividing Soul Tier!

Ling Han stood up and started to fly out.

At this moment, a young man was standing before the entrance to his residence with his hands clasped behind his back.

Although Ling Han regarded him as a youth, judging by his tumultuous vitality, he was at least tens of billions of years old. In fact, he might even be hundreds of billions of years old. His youthful appearance simply signified that he had severed the mundane at a relatively young age. Thus, his appearance had been locked into one of youth. In other words, he would appear young forever.

In order to make themselves appear more mighty and dignified, some elites would purposefully age their appearance. However, this person clearly hadn’t done so.

Anyhow, there was also another person standing behind this “youth”. This was someone who Ling Han recognized.

Fu Zhengtong.

‘Oh? You lost to me, so you’ve brought a Dividing Soul Tier elite over to redeem your pride?

‘What a sore loser!

‘Perhaps you’ll run back sobbing and ask for help from your elders every time you’re defeated by someone in the future?’

“You’re Ling Han?” the Dividing Soul Tier elite asked as he gazed at Ling Han with a cold expression. His name was Fu Siyuan, and he was an elder in the branch that Fu Zhengtong belonged to. In reality, there was a difference of many generations between them. However, because everyone had lived for so long, people usually ignored how many generations existed between them, and they all referred to those of the older generations as elder.

Ling Han glanced at him, but he remained silent.

Fu Zhengtong couldn’t help but rebuke, “My senior is asking you a question!”

How was this brat so audacious?

Ling Han wore an indifferent expression, and he said, “Oh? So he’s actually talking to me? Heh...”

‘What kind of attitude is this?’

There were flames of anger in Fu Siyuan’s mind. How was there such an ignorant and naive junior? When those at the Severing Mundane Tier saw those at the Dividing Soul Tier, shouldn’t they all piss themselves in fright? His voice was solemn, and he said, “You used underhanded methods to defeat Zhengtong, so now, I want you two to engage in a fair battle again.”

‘Underhanded?’

Ling Han chuckled coldly in his mind. How much of a sore loser was this Fu Zhengtong? He had actually made up such a sh*tty excuse? Moreover, if Fu Zhengtong truly wanted to redeem his pride, he could have simply returned here by himself. Why bring a Dividing Soul Tier elite with him?

Was this not to frighten Ling Han?

Did he dare to win? If he won, he would need to face the rage of a Dividing Soul Tier elite. In fact, Fu Siyuan might even interfere with their battle and directly target Ling Han. Most of the students in this academy were only at the Severing Mundane Tier, so they most likely wouldn’t be able to detect Fu Siyuan’s underhanded techniques.

They were blatantly bullying Ling Han.

“Fine, then let’s battle again,” Ling Han said indifferently.

Fu Siyuan’s and Fu Zhengtong’s expression was as if they had already expected this outcome. In their eyes, Ling Han naturally couldn’t reject the request of a Dividing Soul Tier elite.

Meanwhile, Fu Zhengtong also felt like he had lost unfairly. His battle prowess was no weaker than Ling Han’s, and it was because of Ling Han’s high-level Pseudo-Celestial Tool that he had been riddled with wounds. As such, they would both be banned from using Pseudo-Celestial Tools during the following battle. However, he had received a precious treasure from his elder, and this would help him obtain definite victory.

His battle with Ling Han didn’t simply represent himself and Ling Han. Instead, it also represented the conflict and competition between Fu Gaoyun and Fu Tonghai, two of the potential successors of the Fu Clan.

The more outstanding a potential successor, the more powerful elites they would naturally attract to their alliance. Similarly, the quality and strength of a potential successor’s followers would also directly reflect their influence and power.

After leaving the courtyard, Fu Siyuan unleashed a deafening roar that shook the surroundings. It wasn’t long before people started to fly over. The more time that passed, the more people that gathered. They had all been attracted here by the loud commotion.

“What’s going on?” everyone asked. They were confused as to what was happening.

Fu Siyuan immediately explained that this was a simple sparring match.

‘A sparring match? Then why do they need a Dividing Soul Tier elite?’

Everyone watched on in curiosity.

Meanwhile, Ling Han faced off against Fu Zhengtong.

“Ling Han, you relied on your Pseudo-Celestial Tool to achieve a slight advantage over me last time. This time, however, we’ll simply compete using our celestial techniques. We’ll spar using our true strength!” Fu Zhengtong said. His face was filled with indignance.

He truly believed that he had lost because of Ling Han’s Pseudo Celestial Tool. Thus, he would decisively turn the tables and achieve victory this time.

Ling Han shrugged his shoulders, and said, “Alright, so are you going to fight or not? If you want to fight, then stop uttering nonsense. Otherwise, your words will come back to bite you when you lose again!”

Fu Zhengtong humphed upon hearing this. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Weng!

With a single thought, a water dragon surged out from his body. This was a crystalline and semi-transparent dragon whose scales were all formed from the symbols of the great dao. Its might was utterly terrifying.

“Southern Cup Rock Sun Water!” someone immediately exclaimed in astonishment.

“After transforming and developing for hundreds of millions of years, this is the formation of intelligence and form of the Great Dao of Water!”

“Gasp! Unleashing something like this?”

Southern Cup Rock Sun Water—this was a spiritual matter nurtured and birthed by heaven and earth. In essence, this was an extremely nutritious and beneficial matter. If a cultivator refined it, not only would their Origin Power rise by an explosive amount, but even their control over water-element Regulations would improve by a significant degree.

However, such precious treasures could only be discovered by chance. In fact, even Celestial King Tiers couldn’t necessarily obtain such treasures.

Moreover, the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water could still continue to evolve. It could still develop a spirit and gain awareness, thereby becoming a true life form.

This was quite terrifying. According to rumors, the most powerful of these spiritual matters could even reach the Ascending Origin Tier—this was only a single major tier below the Celestial King Tier. If these spiritual matters advanced to the Celestial King Tier, they wouldn’t be spiritual matters anymore. Instead, they would become Source Power.

For example, ancestral flames and source water.

Thus, everyone was stunned upon seeing the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water that Fu Zhengtong had unleashed, especially since it had already developed intelligence.

“No, no, no, this Southern Cup Rock Sun Water doesn’t have enough spiritual awareness yet. It doesn’t seem like it’s developed a true life,” a sharp-eyed person immediately said.

“It was most likely captured by an elite while it was forming intelligence and awareness. They then disturbed the process, resulting in it having a spirit, but not enough spiritual awareness.”

“Even so, this is still Southern Cup Rock Sun Water that has developed a spirit. Its power and might is simply astounding.”

Fu Zhengtong was brimming with pride and haughtiness. An ancestor of his branch had coincidentally obtained this Southern Cup Rock Sun Water a very long time ago. However, few people knew about this. If he hadn’t been humiliated so greatly, and if it weren’t because of his lack of confidence against Ling Han, his ancestor definitely wouldn’t have let him borrow this precious treasure.

Right now, he was unleashing this precious treasure to obtain victory in one fell swoop.

The water dragon roared, unleashing an astounding might into the surroundings. It was at least at the Dividing Soul Tier.

How would Ling Han resist?

Everyone shook their heads upon seeing this. To say nothing of Severing Mundane Tier cultivators, even elites at the yang soul of the Dividing Soul Tier wouldn’t be able to rival this Southern Cup Rock Sun Water.

However, there was a strange expression on Ling Han’s face. This was because a wisp of power had been aroused inside him.

The Xuanyin Source Water.

This was one of the Nine Great Source Waters of the Celestial Realm. It was the source of all water, and it was the mother of all water.

Right now, the Xuanyin Source Water was releasing a feeling of greed—it wanted to consume the water dragon.

Because the Xuanyin Source Water had already become Ling Han’s Source Power, he could clearly determine that he possessed the ability to consume the water dragon. In other words, he possessed the ability to consume the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water. This was because he belonged to a higher level, thereby allowing him to comprehensively suppress this spiritual matter.
