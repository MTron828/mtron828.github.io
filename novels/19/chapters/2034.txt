Chapter 2035: Arrival of Ruan Dongxiang

Ling Han exited the Black Tower with Guo Ming, and shouted, “You can all enter now.”

“Brother Ming!” Liu Xueyan exclaimed as she immediately rushed in. She focused her gaze on Guo Ming, who was currently lying on the bed.

After observing him for a brief moment, she was instantly as moved as could be.

His face was a healthy shade of red, and his aura was also extremely stable. There were no signs of any wound.

He had been healed, fully healed. Moreover, it had only taken a single day!

She immediately fell to her knees, and said, “Benefactor!”

Ling Han made a waving motion, pulling her up from the ground. He then shook Guo Ming awake.

“X-Xueyan.”

“Brother Ming!”

The pair of lovers erupted into tears as they embraced.

They had just escaped from the clutches of death, so they were naturally filled with an overwhelming sensation of relief.

“Brother Ming, have you truly recovered?” Liu Xueyan murmured.

“Yes, I’ve made a full recovery.”

“I’m not dreaming, am I?”

“No!”

They were overtaken with emotion, and they surprisingly started to passionately lock lips as if no one were around.

“So moving, so moving!” Fu Yue remarked.

Upon seeing Fu Yue’s reaction, Ling Han felt like he could never take him seriously anymore. He would definitely be blinded by his emotional displays.

“Ling Han, Niu also wants a kiss!” Hu Niu said. She stuck her lips out as she shuffled over.

Ling Han laughed heartily, and he quickly turned around to peck Hu Niu’s lips.

Bewitching Maiden Rou shuffled over, and said, “I also want one!”

“Go find some shade.”

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but feel disappointed. This stinky man. All she wanted was a kiss! Did he really need to be so stingy?

“Kiss! Kiss!” Shi Lei and Shi Yu shouted from the side.

“Liu Xueyan!” someone roared in a thundering voice.

Liu Xueyan’s and Guo Ming’s expression instantly changed. They were far too familiar with this voice. This voice belonged to none other than the person who had caused them so much pain and suffering.

Ruan Dongxiang!

“Did you think you could escape from my palm?” Ruan Dongxiang asked. “I only remained hidden to let you suffer the consequence of daring to steal my woman.

“In three days, the poisonous wound on Guo Ming’s body will fully erupt. In seven days, he’ll die a violent death.

“I’m going to accompany you as we watch this trash die an agonizing death. After that, I’ll take you back!”

“What should we do?” Liu Xueyan asked as she looked at Guo Ming. They had finally healed his wounds after going to so much trouble, yet Ruan Dongxiang had already caught up to them. It was as if he were driving them to death.

Guo Ming gritted his teeth before suddenly kneeling down to Ling Han, and saying, “Benefactor, I know that I already owe you a life, so I shouldn’t beg you for any more help. However, I genuinely have no other options, so I can only beg you for help!

“I hope that you can help my wife safely leave this place. As my gratitude, I have a treasure that I’m willing to give you!”

“Brother Ming, no!” Xueyan exclaimed as she leaped onto Guo Ming. “We either live together or die together!”

“Xueyan!” The two of them wrapped their arms around each other.

“Hahahaha! Cry, cry to your heart’s content! Savor your last moments together!” Ruan Dongxiang roared with a wanton laugh.

As he gazed at this pair of lovers, Ling Han involuntarily thought of his own parents. At that time, they had most likely gone through a similar experience. The difference was that his mother had already been pregnant with him.

Since he had just saved Guo Ming’s life, he naturally couldn’t watch him die just like that.

He chuckled to himself before exiting the small house.

“Hmm? Who are you?” Ruan Dongxiang asked as he saw this unfamiliar man walking out of the house. His face involuntarily darkened.

‘F*ck! This b*tch isn’t cucking me, is she?’

However, several women followed after Ling Han, and each of them was breathtakingly beautiful. He couldn’t help but gulp in lust. At this moment, he completely forgot about the fact that Liu Xueyan might have cucked him.

“Me?” Ling Han asked with a faint smile. “I’m just a passerby.”

Ruan Dongxiang humphed, and said, “Since you know that you’re a passerby, you also understand that this has got nothing to do with you, right? Don’t stick your nose into other peoples’ business.”

“I’ve never liked sticking my nose into other peoples’ business. I simply want to pummel you,” Ling Han said.

“Pummel me?” Ruan Dongxiang faltered for a moment. When he came to his senses, he involuntarily laughed, and said, “Do you know who I am?”

“I do. You’re a piece of trash.”

Ruan Dongxiang’s expression instantly darkened. “I’m the great-grandson of the seventh elder of the Star Moon Sect! My great-grandfather is an Immortal Palace Tier elite!”

In the Celestial Realm, Immortal Palace Tier cultivators could indeed be referred to as elites.

“Oh… What’s that got to do with me?” Ling Han asked. “Does it have anything to do with me pummeling you?”

“I’m also an Earth Soul elite!” Ruan Dongxiang continued. “With my strength, and with my background, you still want to challenge me?”

“You speak too much nonsense!” Ling Han said as he strode toward Ruan Dongxiang.

“What a troublemaker!” Ruan Dongxiang spat in disgust. However, a sinister smile crept across his face when he swept his gaze over the Empress and the others. “However, I should thank you for bringing me so many beauties.”

Smack!

His smile had barely spread across his face when he suddenly suffered a heavy punch to the cheek. He was instantly sent flying.

“You actually dared to hit me?!” Ruan Dongxiang asked in incredulity as he picked himself up from the ground. He rubbed his nose and glanced at his hand, only to see that it was filled with blood. He couldn’t help but tremble. He wasn’t trembling in fear, but rather in fury.

From birth until now, who had ever hit him before? Moreover, this was a strike to the face!

“You’ve made me angry now!” He shook his right hand, and strands of light immediately appeared in the air. There were seven strands in total.

“Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike!” Xueyan exclaimed. She had also walked out with Guo Ming.

There was intense fear in her voice. After all, her lover had been tortured by this poisonous attack for so many years. In fact, he had almost been tortured to an agonizing death.

“Be careful, benefactor,” Liu Xueyan hurriedly said in warning. “This poisonous palm strike is the ultimate technique of the seventh elder’s branch. According to rumors, he learned this technique from an ancient ruin. In fact, it might even be an Ascending Origin Tier secret technique!”

Ling Han simply replied with a smile. He didn’t take this warning to heart.

Cleansing the poison from Guo Ming’s body had indeed been difficult. However, with his physique, only those at or above the Immortal Palace Tier could hope to poison him. After all, poison was also a Regulation of heaven and earth. This was no different from any other Regulation.

“That’s right. This is the Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike,” Ruan Dongxiang said with pride. “Those who are struck by the Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike will suffer for an entire seven years, during which time seven flowers will bloom on their bodies. When these seven flowers reach full bloom, the victim will die of decomposition within seven days!”

He glanced at Guo Ming with a cold chuckle, and said, “The seventh flower has most likely bloomed inside him already. Death is already knocking on the door— Huh?!”

‘Strange… Why is his face such a healthy shade of red? Why does he look completely fine?

‘Impossible! This is far too strange!

‘Perhaps my poison was cleansed?

‘How is that possible?!’

Ruan Dongxiang was confident that even Immortal Palace Tier elites couldn’t cleanse the poison of the Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike. The reason for this was simple. Destruction was far easier than construction.

His poison had already become one with Guo Ming’s body, so trying to cleanse the poison would inevitably require destroying Guo Ming’s body. Thus, cleansing the poison would be equivalent to killing Guo Ming.

That being the case, his poison naturally couldn’t be cleansed. Perhaps Ascending Origin Tier elites could give it a try. However, since the most powerful member of the Star Moon Sect was only at the Immortal Palace Tier, he naturally couldn’t invite an Ascending Origin Tier elite to try and cleanse his poison.

Guo Ming’s eyes were bloodshot, and he said, “Ruan Dongxiang, you didn’t expect this, did you? Your poison has actually been cleansed!” His expression was as if he wanted to eat Ruan Dongxiang alive.
