Chapter 361: Going Underground

Ling Han almost stumbled. What did this guy see that caused him to arrive at that conclusion?

“When did you become blind?” he asked in annoyance.

Yue Kai Yu laughed lightly, and said, “If you hadn’t conned the little girl, why would Hu Niu keep chattering to me and say that you are Niu’s?”

Ling Han was dumbstruck. Hu Niu was a really mischievous child, plus she was clever! She knew that Yue Kai Yu was his cousin, so she switched her strategy to getting on good terms with his family. If they managed to find his mother, then with this little girl’s skill, wouldn’t she be perfectly capable of charming Yue Hong Chang so much that she would recognize her as her little daughter-in-law?

And after another ten or so years, this little girl would have grown up to become a young girl, and for a genius like Ling Han, it was practically a definite fact that he would break through to the Flower Blossom Tier. Then compared to a lifespan of at least a few hundred years, wouldn’t ten years pass in what might seem to be the blink of an eye?

Ling Han could not help but shake his head as he wondered what thoughts were flying around in Hu Niu’s little head.

“Since you like the little girl, then just yield the other two beautiful girls to me!” Yue Kai Yu said, slinging an arm around Ling Han’s shoulder.

“Ha, ha!” Ling Han laughed dryly, and said, “One of them is my little female attendant, and the other is my alchemist apprentice. Just think, if you marry either one of them, what are you going to address me as?”

“Pei, you are really too devious, just holding onto them and not doing anything but not letting anyone take over, either. I look down on you!” Yue Kai Yu exclaimed, filled with righteous indignation.

“Speak less nonsense. We’ve arrived at the Duan Residence.” Ling Han lowered his hand. They had arrived in front of the Duan Residence.

“Yi, isn’t this Duan Zheng Zhi’s house?” Yue Kai Yu looked confused.

“You know him?” Ling Han asked.

“Kind of. He came to pay a visit to the sect before. After all, he is in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and is quite a strong martial artist. Furthermore, the Sea Breeze City is located right below the sect, so we are very closely linked together. Now that an elite of this level has appeared, he would naturally have to report to the sect and make his stand clear so that we can ensure that he would not break the rules of the sect,” Yue Kai Yu pointed out.

He paused, then continued, “What are we doing here? You couldn’t have possibly fallen for his daughter who’s just a few years old, right?”

“F*** you!” Ling Han rolled his eyes. As he dismantled the alarm array, he said, “You’ll see later, but I hope you won’t yell crazily with your big mouth.”

“Who do you think I am, you think that I don’t even have that little bit of self-control?” Yue Kai Yu humphed.

Ten minutes later.

“Ghost! Ghost!” Yue Kai Yu looked a little pale. “Is this f******* place really the home of living people? Why isn’t there any single living person inside?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han and Guang Yuan exchanged a grin. They had deliberately brought Yue Kai Yu around the manor on a tour, resulting in this empty manor and eerie surroundings causing Yue Kai Yu to feel his hair stand on end.

“Come on!” As they advanced, Ling Han explained the disputes between Guang Yuan and Duan Zheng Zhi for Yue Kai Yu’s benefit.

It was only now that Yue Kai Yu understood why they had come here. However, he was curious himself by now. What was going on with this Duan Residence? Why had everyone disappeared in the middle of the night?

They arrived at the hall that they had seen at daytime and began to search carefully throughout it.

However, this secret passage seemed to be extraordinarily well-hidden. They had searched for about an hour, but still had not managed to find it.

Ling Han stopped and activated the Eye of Truth.

‘Ow ow ow ow!’

Previously, when he had battled the Seven Sons of Ao Family successively, he had overused the Eye of Truth. Even now, it had not fully recovered. Thus, the moment he activated the Eye of Truth, bloody tears streamed out of his right eye; the sight was very chilling.

He quickly withdrew the Mystical Power. The sweeping glance just now was enough for him to discover the location of the secret passage. It was really easy.

However, the secret passage was easy to find, but it might not be that way to find the mechanism to reveal it. Because they still did not want to alert anyone, they naturally could not cause too much damage and use the most direct and violent method to directly crash in.

Thankfully, the three of them were all in the Spiritual Ocean Tier, and had a very sensitive divine sense. After confirming the location of the secret passage, it would be much easier to look for the mechanism to open it. After over another ten minutes, they found the secret on one of the walls. They moved a painting slightly, and ka, ka, ka , a dark, cold cave opening had appeared on the floor tiles.

“Are we really going in?” Yue Kai Yu asked with a bit of hesitation.

He was not the slightest bit foolish. There were so many places inside the Duan Residence, yet it appeared to be like a ghostly manor. Furthermore, there was a secret passage here, and it was possible that everyone had hidden within. Choosing to stay underground when they had perfectly comfortable rooms to sleep in... there was definitely something strange going on.

Moreover, Duan Zheng Zhi was in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and if he discovered them... would they be killed to ensure that the secret was not leaked out?

“Of course!” Ling Han nodded. His curiosity was completely ignited.

“Aren’t you scared that we won’t be able to come back out?” Yue Kai Yu asked sullenly, feeling like he really had boarded a ship of thieves.

“It’s fine. I’m here,” Ling Han said with full confidence. This was not an exaggeration on his part. With the Black Tower for them to hide themselves in, they need not worry about anything that will threaten their lives, at least in a “small place” like this world.

How would Yue Kai Yu know what Ling Han was thinking? However, he was also certain he could not convince Ling Han otherwise, what more when he himself was curious as well, as well as slightly alert—under the eyes of the Winter Moon Sect, what was Duan Zheng Zhi planning to do?

They entered the secret passage and went downwards all the way. It was very dark, and after they had walked for about a hundred metres, the stairs stopped. Instead, a long corridor had appeared in front of them; there were doors on both sides of the corridor, which likely meant that there were many rooms behind these doors.

Ling Han stuck close to one of the doors and listened for a while. He made a gesture of pushing the door open, and Guang Yuan and Yue Kai Yu nodded, signalling that they were prepared. If there was anyone inside, they would swiftly subdue him.

Ling Han pressed his hands against the doors, used a bit of force, and the doors were opened. The doors were not locked.

“Wu!” The three of them immediately covered their noses. There was a powerful stench wafting out from inside the room.

Xiu, xiu, xiu . However, they still instantly leaped in. When their eyes swept over the inside of the room, shock filled their expressions.

This room was very small, so small that it could only contain a large bed. What was shocking was the fact that it was not a bed that was set inside, but rather a coffin.

“Unlucky! Unlucky!” Yue Kai Yu hurriedly retreated. No wonder there was a powerful stench. This was a tomb and the corpse had all rotted, so of course there would be a strong stench coming from inside.

Guang Yuan was right behind him, whereas Ling Han was the last.

“We don’t have to look anymore, right? This should be an underground tomb,” Yue Kai Yu said.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “If this is an underground tomb, then where have all the living people gone to?”

This was indeed something they could not figure out.

“Let’s go and take another look.” The three of them continued to advance, and a crossroads appeared in front of them, where even more doors could be seen ahead.

“Let’s continue on.” Ling Han was determined to get to the bottom of this matter.

They continued to advance, and suddenly, they could smell an overwhelming stench, as if there was a mountain of corpses ahead of them. The smell was strong enough to cause someone to pass out from suffocation.

The three of them wore very ugly expression, and disgust had turned their faces pale.

They held their breaths. With the ability of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, it was definitely not a problem for them to hold their breaths for about an hour.

An underground river appeared in front of them, and there were multiple corpses floating in it!
