Chapter 925: Smacked to Death with a Single Slap

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Who would have thought? The two main characters had not yet begun their fight, but another person popped up all of a sudden, causing a disruption.

Hong!

Luo Ba and Ye Chengyuan exchanged a blow, and a brilliant light burst out in between them like a great explosion in the universe, giving rise to a hurricane, which swept out in all directions.

This was a clash above battle prowess of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, and eventually caused a small ripple in the Immortal Realm.

Teng, teng, teng , both fighters stepped back repeatedly, not too much, and not too little—exactly 11 steps back.

With this clash, the two of them had actually come out even.

“What?! Luo Ba has actually become so powerful!”

“That is Ye Chengyuan of the Eastern Institution, the top elite of the Shattering Void Tier!”

“I heard that he has already reached 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier quite a number of years ago, but never attempted to break through to the Mountain River Tier. Obviously, he wants to walk even further in the Shattering Void Tier.”

“Perhaps his present battle prowess has already exceeded 20 Stars.”

Everyone was exclaiming in surprise. Ye Chengyuan’s power was as they had expected. He was, after all, the top elite of the Shattering Void Tier in the Eastern Institution, and was the top elite of the younger generation in the Imperial Capital 40 years ago just like Luo Ba was in the top in this new round.

Yet, he had cultivated an additional 40 years, but was actually unable to suppress Luo Ba?

Too astonishing!

No wonder Luo Ba dared to challenge Ling Han to a duel to the death. His abilities had actually increased several fold, no, perhaps even over a dozen fold, in the short time of a few days.

“Haha, true enough, battle prowess of 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier!” Ye Chengyuan laughed loudly. He immediately shot out, and charged towards Luo Ba.

Peng! Peng!

The two exchanged another two blows, and the fight was still undecided.

“Is this enough?” Luo Ba asked coldly. His target was Ling Han.

“Has it been three moves already?” Ye Chengyuan said in discontent. “All right, then when you’re done fighting, we can still have a spar.” He sensed that he had reached a bottleneck. In the Shattering Void Tier, there was none that could match him, and he was incapable of advancing further.

Yet Luo Ba had actually reached battle prowess of 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, which gave him a bit of hope. Perhaps if he battled endlessly with Luo Ba, he might be able to break through his stagnancy.

Although Luo Ba was internally feeling very displeased, he also knew that Ye Chengyuan was a close rival for him. The two of them would possibly have to fight for a few days and nights before the victor could be decided, and where would he have that kind of time to waste right now? He was impatient to defeat and kill Ling Han.

He quickly advanced and arrived at the plaza halfway up the mountain. Looking at Ling Han, who was currently resting with his eyes closed, he smirked coldly, and said, “I really never imagined that you would actually dare accept the challenge!”

If the previous battle with Ye Chengyuan had not taken place, everyone would’ve definitely said that Luo Ba boasting shamelessly. Ling Han was an emperor that had come through opening the skies. That was an absolute guarantee of battle prowess of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, and if there was power of the nation to give him an additional boost, it would be a piece of cake for him to surpass 20 Stars.

But now, everyone knew that Luo Ba’s ability had reached 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier!

Even if this power was not his own, but rather obtained after refining a Bloodtear Stone, this could not change the fact that he was now incomparably powerful.

Would Ling Han... still dare to accept the challenge?

It was not absolute that either party had to die in a duel to death to decide the outcome, and either side could completely give up the fight midway. A duel to death only meant that if one of the fighters died, there was absolutely no need for the other party to bear any responsibility at all.

Ling Han was just pondering on the profound mysteries of the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique. In the eyes of others, Luo Ba was powerful to the extent that he could not be opposed. However, in his eyes... so what if his battle prowess was 21 Stars? A careless slap and he would be smacked to death, so was there any need to take particular note of him?

His thoughts having been interrupted, he was naturally not going to be in a good mood, and the expression on his face immediately revealed that.

Others did not know that, and thought that Ling Han was afraid. They all shook their heads covertly, thinking that this battle was probably not going to happen.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and asked, “What about the payment for my participation?”

Pu . Abruptly, a great many choked.

‘You are really greedy for money, aren’t you? Didn’t you see how awesome Luo Ba was just now?’

Yet Luo Ba laughed loudly, and carelessly tossed out 10 True Origin Stones, saying coldly, “This is for you to arrange your funeral!”

Sigh, after extorting 2,000 True Origin Stones from the Luo Clan, this mere sum of 10 True Origin Stones seemed to have lost its attractiveness all of a sudden. Still, it was better than nothing. If he did not take it, it would be a waste anyways. No one would grumble about having too much money anyway—no matter how much they already had.

Ling Han put away the True Origin Stones, and asked, “There’s another hundred?”

“You think you can defeat me?” Luo Ba was instantly infuriated.

Ling Han snickered, and said, “Rules are rules; where do you come up with all this nonsense? Are you going to fight or not? If not, I’m going home to sleep.”

“Yes!” Luo Ba gritted his teeth, and took out 100 True Origin Stones with another wave of his hand.

This time, Ling Han did not put them away. After all, the battle was not won yet. However, it was only a matter of time.

“Can we fight now?” Luo Ba asked sinisterly, the killing intent in his heart boiling.

‘Just take this chance to win the verbal battle now, but later... you’re finished!’

In the Academy, there were also a few higher-ups that had come to observe the battle, though they stood quite far away. One of them was Luo Kaifeng—a junior of his own clan was involved in a duel to death, so he naturally had to pay attention. There was also Zhang Deman. He was quite fond of Ling Han, and was of a mind to take him as his disciple.

In addition, Wei Qianshu was also present. Since the last time he had been dragged along by Luo Kaifeng, he had also become interested in Ling Han.

Duels to death were very uncommon nowadays, what more when both sides possessed extremely high battle prowess. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

There were many spectators, and the students in the Shattering Void Tier division of the Northern Institution numbered the most. There were also some from the other three Institutions, but altogether, they were fewer than the students from the Northern Institution.

“Let’s fight, then. Where do you come up with so much nonsense? Are you afraid of death?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

Luo Ba was enraged half to death; it was obviously you that had been spouting too much nonsense, all right? However, the battle finally began now. Haha, he would slowly torture Ling Han, and make the other suffer in his agony for daring to actually slap him.

Xiu , he pounced out, and shot out a palm strike. The image of the Divine Beast, Imperial River, appeared once more, bringing along a great power of dominance with it.

Ling Han placed his left arm behind his back, and was standing in a very casual pose. He waited until Luo Ba had come close enough. Then, he waved out a palm and pressed down on Luo Ba. Multiple divine patterns interwove together, forming an incredibly complex pattern.

Earth Overturning Seal!

Peng!

With a palm strike, Luo Ba was undoubtedly sent flying. Then, his body split apart in midair, separating into pieces and producing a shower of blood.

Pa , his corpse landed on the ground, his expression one of disbelief. It seemed like he was wondering why he was smacked to death with a single slap when he obviously had battle prowess of 21 Stars.

This was illogical, and unacceptable!

All around was dead silence, and the only thing that could be heard was the whistling wind.

Who would have thought that the previously awe-inspiring Luo Ba would actually be smacked to death with a single palm strike! Was this really a f****** elite who had battle prowess of 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, and not a fly?

No, no, no. Luo Ba was definitely not a fly. On the contrary, he was incredibly powerful, and exchanged three blows with Ye Chengyuan with neither coming out on top. This was enough to prove that he was powerful.

Everyone felt their scalps go numb; it was because Ling Han was even more powerful.

What kind of battle prowess was this?

22 Stars?

Actually, the majority did not have much of an idea how much strength could be attained with every improvement of a single Star of battle prowess from 20 Stars onwards. That was because it only existed in theory and legends, so how could it be measured in detail?

Ye Chengyuan felt a muscle twitch in his cheek, and his whole body was covered with cold sweat. Ling Han’s power caused him to lose even the courage to issue a challenge.
