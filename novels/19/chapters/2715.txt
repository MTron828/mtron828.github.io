2716 The first battle

A rookie was incredibly fresh, yet actually killed all the way to make it to the top of the recent leaderboard in a single stroke.

“Take a look at his battle merits.” Everyone hurriedly looked.

“Just entered the Realm Battlefield, but before coming, he has killed over 10,000 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.”

It was very simple, and just contained these few words.

“F***, more than 10,000!”

“He has just come to the Realm Battlefield. Don’t tell me that he has killed so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates in these short 1,000 years.”

“I don’t believe it.”

“I don’t believe it, either!”

“Hold on, this kind of battle merit… Wouldn’t he be able to make it to the general leaderboard?”

Though the general leaderboard would also be updated, the truth was that they would not be paying much attention to it, because it comprised merits that had been accumulated through endless years. It wasn’t that you would be able to be ranked on the general leaderboard just because of a powerful battle prowess.

Thus, it was fine just to glance through the general leaderboard. Perhaps only one person would be able to find their name there through trillions and trillions of years.

But Ling Han’s battle merit… was probably enough to be ranked on the list.

They searched through the general leaderboard, and as expected, they found Ling Han’s name around the 800s. It was still the same assessment; this ranking was far superior to those of Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian.

“This is mad. This must have created a whole new record. Someone made his way onto the list for the first time, and is ranked in both the recent leaderboard and general leaderboard.”

“This has never happened before!”

“Just how did he manage to kill over 10,000 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates?”

This quickly caused a great deal of curiosity. Everyone was guessing. In fact, they did not even take note of the changes in rankings for others on the recent leaderboard.

In the crowd, He Yufeng was gaping, the expression on his face extremely colorful.

This Ling Han… Was it that Ling Han that he knew?

‘Impossible!’

He had only been a Seventh Heaven Celestial King before, and now he should have just advanced to the Eighth Heaven at most. Even if he was already a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, how had he managed to kill over 10,000 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates?

More importantly, were there so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates for him to kill?

It should be known that when the troops of Hysteria attacked the city, everyone would be staying on defense behind the city wall, using the heavy weapons of the city defense to attack. This would not be included in their battle merits. Then, charging out of the city to hunt down the lingering dregs of Hysteria’s troops, just how many would they be able to kill?

Over 10,000 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, where had they come from?

This was also everyone’s question. There were indeed some people who usually kept a low profile, and would abruptly become an overnight celebrity, but no matter how strong you were, you would still have to find over 10,000 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates for you to kill.

“I don’t believe it. I’m going to ask the one who organizes this ranking list how it’s being done.”

“Let’s go!”

Everyone went to seek out the person in charge of the rankings noisily.

The rankings were very simple because everyone was wearing a special ring. Every person they killed would be recorded, and it would also be recorded in the Celestial Administration. As long as a timeline was drawn, making a comparison was easy.

Thus, though there were a total of seven people in charge of the rankings, they were all just Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Having so many people gather around them, their faces involuntarily twitched.

What was going on?

Once they found out what the matter was, they all shook their heads, saying that they did not know the exact reason, either. The only thing they knew was that when they were arranging the rankings, a Heavenly Venerate came over, and stuffed Ling Han’s results into their pile.

In truth, they were also very curious. Who exactly was this Ling Han? How were his battle merits so incredibly great?

Everyone exchanged looks. Ling Han’s battle merits were actually not genuine, but had rather been decided with a single word from a Heavenly Venerate.

This… There had to be some exaggeration in this.

But to demand answers from a Heavenly Venerate was something none of them dared to do, so they could only mobilize their own connections to investigate the situation.

Finally, someone was the first to find out the facts.

“It is like this. Hysteria bewitched a disciple of the martial academy, and commanded him to enter into the Celestial King Graveyard, drawing the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings there to a certain location through deception. They were then modified by Hysteria’s power, and became Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

“Ling Han coincidentally uncovered this, and those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had still been ‘hatching,’ so they were not able to react at all. Thus, one strike after another, he killed all of them, so there were indeed more than 10,000 of them.

“At that time, Ling Han had not arrived here yet, so his battle merits were not recorded by the ring.”

With such words, everyone understood; so that was how it is.

“So he has just picked up an astronomical advantage.”

“Sigh, why have I never encountered this kind of great fortune? If I had, my name would have resounded throughout the whole world.”

“It cannot be helped; while we are all humans, different people would have different destinies.”

Everyone sighed, feeling only jealousy and defiance towards Ling Han, and thinking that it was only because his luck was really too good, and that was why he had gotten this massive advantage.

Ling Han only found out much later. Very long after the great commotion, he only realized that he had actually made his way to the number one position of the recent leaderboard in this round of rankings, and his name had also even progressed greatly in the general leaderboard.

However, he was not much interested in the rankings in the first place, and when he found out that he was ranked at the top, he only smiled, and did not take it to heart at all.

The large black dog was roaming around outside every day, searching for Heavenborn’s whereabouts. With his strong sense of smell, there was no need for Ling Han to help at all. He alone was able to do this job.

Not many days later, news came back from the large black dog. He had discovered Heavenborn.

However, the Celestial Administration had just issued a warning in the last few days. It was possible that Hysteria’s troops would launch an attack soon, and everyone was warned not to exit the city, and stay on their guard at all times. That was because once the attack from Hysteria came, they would not be reminding anyone.

In such an atmosphere, everyone was on alert. The atmosphere in the city became extremely tight-strung, so Ling Han could not find any chance to make a move.

Then, he’d just have to wait until this period of time passed.

The storm was about to come, and the atmosphere in the city appeared considerably oppressive because every time Hysteria attacked, it would cause tremendous damage, leading to a great amount of bloodshed and casualties. Who could be sure they could still continue living in this world after this battle?

But it was also this kind of war that would help prodigies rapidly mature and grow to become top-tier elites.

Three months later, without any warning, the troops of Hysteria assaulted.

Boom! A massive bang resounded like thunder.

“Enemy attack!”

“Man your stations!”

The two Heavenly Venerates issued their commands, and immediately set up the defenses.

The initially dark city wall immediately glowed, streaks of green light flowing before being shot out, and launching a solid blow as they swept outwards of the city wall.

The barrier was the fundamental reason that the Flaming Frost Realm could continue to exist. It allowed the combined power of countless people to be gathered together and launched as a massive strike through the barrier, a gigantic precious tool which combined both attack and defense.

It was said that only the eighth spatial level did not have any barrier, because there was nothing in this world that could withstand the power of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. Even a Heavenly Venerate Tool could not.

Ling Han and the company all stayed beneath the wall. They were in charge of striking down those that had dodged the “city light wave” and slipped through the net to charge into the city.

This city wall was built from a special material. Not only was it extremely sturdy, it also cut off divine sense, so the people inside had completely no idea what the situation was like outside.

But only a short while later, a gigantic dark shadow passed through the city wall, and rapidly descended from the skies.

Shockingly, it looked like an octopus, but the number of its tentacles was far more than any normal octopus possessed. It was also extraordinarily large, reaching a few hundred meters in height. The moment it appeared, it waved its long limbs, whipping them out in all directions.

At the same time, even more that managed to slip through the net appeared. They were all octopus monsters.

“Kill!”

Ling Han charged out, sword in hand. At this kind of time, there was no need to have any reservations. They had to draw out their full battle prowess at the very first moment. Otherwise, should their companions be wounded, or even killed, because they were holding back, it would be too late for regrets.

His first battle in the Realm Battlefield had officially begun.
