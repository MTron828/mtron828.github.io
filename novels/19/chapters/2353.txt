Chapter 2354: Savage

“Yi, why would there be trash from a super-low-level dimension here?” Xu Xing was the first to ask.

Firstly, he was indeed curious, and secondly, he was deliberately trying to strike up a conversation with Zi Shuang.

This question voiced the confusion in everyone’s hearts, and they all turned to look towards Zi Shuang.

“Oh, when exalted Master personally arrived in the super-low-level dimension of the Celestial Realm, he killed innumerable elites, and at the same time also captured some. They are the descendants of those human elites,” Zi Shuang said calmly. It was clear that she had since lost her curiosity.

“Why is it necessary to keep these pieces of trash alive?” Xue Ge asked as he bared his mouth, revealing a bloodthirsty expression of cruelty.

That trash was only worthy of being his food.

Smiling, Zi Shuang replied, “Master wishes to study these humans. Who knows, he may be able to find some way for us to be unafraid of the restrictions placed on us by the heaven and earth of that realm.”

“What, Lord Desolate Eternity actually has such a great ability?” Everyone was stunned. Aside from Ling Han and the others, they all looked excited.

The Foreign Realm was stronger than the Celestial Realm, yet had not been able to conquer the Celestial Realm even after so many years because, firstly, the Regulations of the two realms were different, so they could not fight too long, and secondly, after they entered into the Celestial Realm, they would be restricted by the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm.

If this second problem could be resolved, the elites of the Foreign Realm would be able to penetrate deeply, and use their advantage in numbers and quality to eliminate a great majority of the beings of the Celestial Realm. In this manner, the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm would also be severely wounded, and the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm would be able to easily devour the Celestial Realm.

This was a Realm War. To eliminate a realm, it was necessary to eliminate all the living beings of this realm. Otherwise, even if several dozen or over 100 Heavenly Venerates joined forces, they could not possibly be a match for the heaven and earth itself.

...It was unknown if there were even stronger Heavenly Venerates in high-level dimensions that could truly defeat the heaven and earth.

Yet Ling Han’s heart throbbed widly. The Foreign Realm was really working tirelessly to invade the Celestial Realm. If the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity really succeeded, there would definitely be no worse news for the Celestial Realm than this.

Thankfully, now that the Two Realm Passageway was hindered, and the storm of energy raged like an ocean, even an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King could not pass through. Even if a Heavenly Venerate barged through forcefully, they would be severely wounded, and once they were further targeted by the heaven and earth, they would probably be forcefully killed.

Hence, there was at least several tens of billions of years that the Celestial Realm was still safe.

“Haha, that super-low-level dimension thinks that just because the storm of energy is there as a barrier, we would have to wait several tens of billions of years, right?” Xu Xing smirked coldly. “There has long since been several Heavenly Venerates that have been dealing with that. At most in a billion years, we will definitely be able to sweep aside the storm of energy, and begin the war once more.”

“Senior Sister Zi Shuang, how long is Lord Desolate Eternity away from success?” Jing Zhongyue asked.

“I am not sure about that, either.” Zi Shuang shook her head. “However, from the occasional words that exalted Master has spoken, it is probably a matter of just a few dozen billion years or so.”

Everyone was excited. Compared with a Realm War that would last for epochs, several dozen billion years was really just the blink of the eye.

Ling Han’s heart clenched. He had been too optimistic. He had not thought that the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm would be so proactive in the invasion. True, they, too, were being attacked by the Dark Inverse Realm. If they did not conquer the Celestial Realm as soon as possible, they themselves would be done for.

“The Heavenly Venerates of the Celestial Realm are also working together with us, speeding up the dispersal of the energy storm,” Zi Shuang continued.

This was a piece of incredibly shocking news. Ling Han, too, could not help but raise a brow, feeling an urge to curse.

It was enough that the Heavenly Venerates of the Celestial Realm offered no resistance, they actually helped the Foreign Realm to undermine the Celestial Realm’s forces. What was the meaning of this?

The expressions of Hu Niu and the other women also shifted greatly, but Huai Jian and the others did not show any change in expression. It seemed as if this kind of news was very normal for them.

It looked like the betrayal of the Heavenly Venerates of the Celestial Realm was no secret in the Foreign Realm at all. Otherwise, everyone would certainly be exclaiming and look surprised when they heard this kind of information.

Presently, the expressions of Huai Jian and the others were clearly normal, and it was too normal at that.

“Esteemed guests, please have tea!” That human servant served aromatic tea to each of them, his demeanor respectful.

Ling Han sighed internally. This person should have been brainwashed with the mentality of a slave since birth. To say nothing of merely serving tea now, even if he was commanded to go into the battlefield and kill his Celestial Realm companions, he would surely execute the command without any hesitation.

“Senior Sister Zi Shuang, do you have a lot of such servants here?” Xue Ge suddenly asked.

“A great many.” Zi Shuang nodded.

“Then I will not hold myself back!” Xue Ge said, suddenly turning into his original form. With a flash, he had turned into a bloody streak, darting into the head of that human.

That human did not even have the chance to groan. His legs directly weakened as he collapsed loudly onto the ground.

The gap between their cultivation levels and strength was really too wide.

Xiu, with another flash, Xue Ge leaped out of the forehead of that human once more, returning to his human form.

He licked his lips, and said, “Though the Celestial Realm is backwards, the taste of the beings that the realm nurtures isn’t too tbad. Furthermore, we can gain a sliver of the Regulations of the heaven and earth by devouring their souls and brain juice. If the amount is sufficient, and quality is good enough, we will have a chance to cultivate the Regulations of that heaven and earth.”

His sudden burst into murder was too fast, and even Ling Han had not managed to stop him in time. He had really not imagined that Xue Ge would actually be so deranged.

...In the eyes of the beings of the Foreign Realm, what difference was there between the beings of the Celestial Realm and normal food?

“Hehe, I have absolutely no interest in consuming those filthy beings. We had best wait for Lord Desolate Eternity to create the secret technique, and enter into the Celestial Realm after cultivating it,” Jing Zhongyue said. “By then, we should become Ancestral Kings too.”

“I do not mind myself,” Xu Xing said, revealing a sinister expression.

Xue Ge was just about to speak, when peng, a punch landed heavily on his face. It just happened to land on his mouth, and he immediately spluttered out a mouthful of blood, half of his teeth broken.

He looked at Ling Han in shock, his mouth wide and his eyes filled with doubt and fury. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

‘Why had you hit me? Why?’

‘Did I trifle with you?’

Ling Han withdrew his fist, and stated calmly, “I suddenly thought you looked very detestable, so I hit you. What is it? Dissatisfied?”

‘F***, of course I am!’

Xue Ge almost roared, yet forcefully suppressed the urge.

So what if he was dissatisfied? So what if he fought with all his might? Was there any chance he could defeat Ling Han?

Ling Han was indeed unreasonable, but the most important thing in this world was strength. You could only make the rules if you were strong enough.

“I will remember this!” he said as he gritted his remaining teeth, gritting his teeth so tightly that there were cracks heard.

Ling Han was completely unconcerned. Because he would not see anyone from the Celestial Realm after entering into the Foreign Realm, he had not witnessed any scenes of the residents of the Foreign Realm slaughtering beings of the Celestial Realm, so he had temporarily forgotten about the savage nature of the living creatures of the Foreign Realm.

But in truth, this was the disdain, contempt, hatred, and thinking that beings of the Celestial Realm were only their toys and food that was rooted in their bloodlines. It would never change.

In this moment, Ling Han really wanted to kill Xue Ge, but this kind of action would be too rash.

He could not just look at the details, and forget about the bigger picture.

Killing one Xue Ge would not be able to solve the problem for the Celestial Realm. After the death of this Xue Ge, the Foreign Realm still had 1,000 or 10,000 Xue Ge that could even be 10 or even 100 times more savage and crueler than Xue Ge.

After he became a Heavenly Venerate, he would turn the entire Foreign Realm upside down!

Huai Jian and the others were also very confused. This punch from Ling Han was really too inconceivable, and even Zi Shuang felt surprised. Though the internal strife in the line of the Desolate Eternity was very intense, this kind of irrational attack was still too bizarre.
