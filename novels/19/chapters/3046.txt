3047 Getting Information

“The World’s Will of the Genesis World of the last era seems to have communicated with you before, right?” Ling Han said. “I want to know, what did it say to you?”

The expressions of the five ultimate elites changed at the same time. This was their greatest secret.

“Humph, don’t even think about finding out!” Chong Yan immediately said. So what if they would be suppressed beneath the lavatory? Ling Han would have to stand there and constantly instill his power at all times. Otherwise, how could he possibly keep them trapped there?

However, in comparison, they were even more unwilling to reveal the secrets in their hearts. Once Ling Han also participated in the competition, would they still be able to obtain that opportunity?

Ling Han shifted his butt and sat down more comfortably. “There’s no point in you guys trying to hide it. After all, I’ve also come in contact with that World’s Will.”

What?

The expressions of Chong Yan and the others clearly changed, but it was impossible for an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier not to have some shrewdness, so they were all very calm.

Ling Han continued to probe. If he wanted someone to reveal their secrets, he would have to reveal some information first.

“Not only did I come into contact with the World’s Will, but I also chatted with it for a while. Moreover, it also allowed me to see a scene where many marks of life were planted in your bodies,” he said indifferently. He stopped and quietly observed the expressions of Chong Yan and the others.

As expected, the expressions of these five people changed again.

“So what?” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper also said indifferently, as if he didn’t care at all.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You guys really aren’t cooperating! But it doesn’t matter, I’m a person who likes guessing the most.”

He revealed a contemplative look, and said, “You guys are already at the peak of the Seventh Tier, so there shouldn’t be many things that could move you.

“First, an increase in strength.

“Second, a threat to your life.

“Theoretically, you can’t advance any further. Furthermore, you’re immortal and indestructible. Hence, it couldn’t be these.

“However, back then, when Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand was being killed, Extermination was also torn into pieces. This proves that even the immortality of an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier has a prerequisite—if Hysteria really devours the Genesis World, it will be difficult for you all to escape misfortune.

“However, this raises another question. Since your lives are also in danger, why did you escape from the Realm Battlefield?

“This brings us back to the original topic. Perhaps your strength can still increase, allowing you to avoid such a threat.”

Ling Han’s words were slightly ambiguous, but the logic was very clear.

Therefore, although there was no substantial information revealed, Chong Yan and the others’ expressions continued to change.

If this continued, it was very likely that Ling Han would really be able to guess what it was.

Ling Han glanced at these five people, and decided to drop a heavy bomb.

“World’s Core!”

“What?!”

All of a sudden, Chong Yan and the others could no longer maintain their composure. They all blurted out, and their expressions were filled with disbelief as they looked at Ling Han.

How could Ling Han have known such a secret? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “How about it? Let’s have everyone be transparent and honest so we can have a nice conversation, alright?”

Chong Yan and the others were sly old foxes after all, so they quickly calmed down.

“Tell me first, how many secrets do you know about the World’s Core?” Chong Yan asked.

F*ck, how could he have known that the World’s Will had just let the word slip?

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t admit it, and said, “Heh, how much do you know? Don’t try to get information out of me when you don’t know anything.”

“Since that’s the case, there’s nothing to talk about.” How could Chong Yan and the others fall for it? All of them were very tight-lipped.

“You’re not going to tell me, are you?” Ling Han smiled faintly. “Do you want to be suppressed beneath the lavatory for 10,000 years?”

“Haha, in any case, we’re immortal and indestructible, unaffected by all techniques, so where wouldn’t we be transcendent?” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper laughed coldly.

Ling Han frowned inwardly. It seemed that he could only humiliate these five old bastards now, but it was still a little lacking if he wanted them to truly be afraid.

…Unless he advanced to the Seventh Tier, cultivated a transcendent dimension in his body, and possessed the ability to kill Seventh Tiers, at which point, he believed, one of these five people would definitely submit.

“Forget it, I can’t be bothered to play with you guys anymore.” Ling Han shook his head, grabbed the five ultimate elites, and flew toward the Realm Battlefield.

This time, he would send the five of them to the battlefield together.

In just over 10 days, Ling Han arrived at the place. With a wave of his hand, he tossed the five ultimate elites into the passageway of the main battlefield.

“Do what you should do. If I catch you outside, you’ll really have to be prepared to stay beneath the lavatory for 10,000 years!” Ling Han said coldly.

Chong Yan and the others were all staring at him. Their hearts were boiling with rage, but what could they do? Their ability was lacking.

Forget it.

The five of them turned around, and walked into the depths of the main battlefield.

When they came within the sight of Lin Luo and the others, it naturally caused them to be surprised.

What was going on? Why were these five people here again?

Especially Shatter Mountains. Didn’t he run away last time? Why did he come back?

The five ultimate elites were naturally too embarrassed to explain, and they immediately joined the fray to vent their anger on Hysteria.

***

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then walked into the passageway of the secondary battlefield.

It had been a long time since he left the Realm Battlefield. It was time for him to take a look. Moreover, there were some old scores that had yet to be settled.

When he arrived at the front line, he happened to encounter an attack from the Hysteria’s army. It was a black mass that seemed to be able to topple mountains and overturn seas.

On the Profound Negative Realm’s side, everyone was extremely nervous. Hysteria’s army was getting stronger and stronger, while their numbers were decreasing. How could they go on like this?

After this battle, how many people would never live to see the next day?

Peng!

Right at this moment, they saw a beam of light shooting over from afar. It streaked across the top of the city wall, and then disappeared in the midst of Hysteria’s army.

A scene that made their scalps tingle appeared. As the brilliance of light flashed, the troops of Hysteria’s army exploded one after another, turning into a rain of blood.

It had to be known that the composition of the Hysteria’s army was extremely complicated. From Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier to the Sixth Tier, wherever that brilliance flashed, be it a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate or a Sixth Tier, they all turned into a rain of blood.

With just one strike, the entire army of Hysteria could be said to have been wiped out. There were only a dozen or so individuals left.

This…

Which big shot made such a move? Wasn’t that too terrifying?

They all looked into the distance, and saw a young man walking over from the sky. His slender body seemed to contain a mighty power that could suppress the universe, making people want to worship him.

“That’s…”

“Ling Han!”

“He’s back.”

Everyone was both excited and terrified. Back then, Ling Han had wiped out 90% of the Hysteria’s army with a single strike. Now that the king had returned, his abilities had risen to a whole new level. With a single strike, he had wiped the enemies out entirely.

Having such a helper was naturally exciting, but at the same time, it was also terrifying. He was too powerful. Was there anyone who could keep him in check?

However, more people still harbored optimistic thoughts. Previously, Ling Han had been forced to leave by Chong Yan’s group of five, and he was still able to return now. With the presence of such relations, how could he possibly harm others?
