Ling Han’s eyes focused—the technique the youngster used just now was the Mysterious Three Thousand!

However, the youngster advanced into the Flower Blossom Tier, so a casual attack had supreme might, killing two at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tiers instantly. Therefore, from this attack alone, the youngster’s aptitude on the Mysterious Three Thousand couldn’t be perceived at all; this also best demonstrated a sword user’s strength in the path of the sword.

...The Mysterious Three Thousand was driven by Sword Qi, and the more Sword Qi one cultivated, the more rays of sword light were fired out and the stronger it was.

In the sky, the youngster said indifferently, “Now, will someone answer my question?”

“I’ll say, I’ll say, Fairy Zhu should have headed towards the depth of the forest. First, to search for Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass, and second, she might contend for the Heavenly Luck Stone,” someone hurriedly said in quavering voice.

The youngster revealed a smile and said, “The Heavenly Luck Stone? Xuan Er is only at the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, refining a Heavenly Luck Stone would be of great benefit to her when she breaks through to the Flower Blossom Tier in the future.”

He paused, and then went on, “Zhi Ming, if I obtain the Heavenly Luck Stone and gift it to Xuan Er, would she be very happy?”

Zhi Ming revealed an envious expression. The Heavenly Luck Stone... for martial artists below the Flower Blossom Tier, it was the most precious treasure! He was now at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, if he could use a Heavenly Luck Stone... Tsk tsk!

However, he immediately forgot such envy and said respectfully, “Fairy Zhu would definitely be extremely happy.”

“Hahaha!” The youngster laughed loudly. “Alright, then I’ll make an exception and play with the people here.”

With that said, he turned to leave, each step equaling one sword pattern like a resplendent blossoming flower.

Tong Zhi Ming sneered at the people all around and hurriedly followed. Although he couldn’t fly, a Spiritual Pedestal Tier elite’s speed wasn’t slow. He passed through on the treetops, following behind that youngster.

Until this moment, everyone sighed in relief. Many people even slumped down onto the ground, drenched in sweat.

However, not everyone was shocked to point of losing the will to fight. Shen Zhong Cheng stared a the place where that youngster disappeared, clenching his sword tightly with his right hand and revealing an undying will to battle.

Ling Han was also no different as the battle intent inside him burned.

That youngster was comparable to Sword Emperor back in those years!

Unfortunately, he was focused on alchemy in the previous life and only pursued tier improvement on martial arts, never contending with the six Heaven Tier monarchs. However, in this lifetime, his regrets could be made up, and that youngster’s talent or comprehension on the sword path was extremely surprising, just like a second Sword Emperor.

Contending to be the best with such a prodigy, Ling Han was filled with fighting spirit.

“I know who that person is!” someone suddenly cried out. “I once heard that an elite from the Heaven’s Sword Sect traveled to north region for pleasure and fell in love at first sight with Fairy Zhu, even having the intention to invite her to the Heaven’s Sword Sect. That’s the man!”

“The World’s Second Best Sword, Yao Hui Yue!”

As those words dropped, it instantly brought on repeated cries of surprise. Who was this person, daring to proclaim himself as The World’s Second Best Sword—didn’t he fear eating his own words? Yao Hui Yue was certainly strong as a Flower Blossom Tier at this age segment was absolutely unattainable, but to say “the world’s second?” This was truly brazen.

There were plenty of sword users in the world, and would the Spiritual Infant Tier and the Deity Transformation Tier sword users be inferior to him?

“It’s said that Yao Hui Yue had thought of claiming to be The World’s First Sword, but to show respect to the older seniors of the Heaven’s Sword Sect, he stepped back to claim second.”

“Hiss, World’s Second, that’s called modest?”

“However, already being a Flower Blossom Tier elite only in his twenties, this world’s second at his age segment should be fully worthy.”

“My god, are our martial arts standards so greatly different from that of middle state’s?”

“Everyone says that middle state is the holy land of martial arts... not wrong at all.”

Everyone exclaimed. They had been foolishly conceited before; only after seeing a true expert—a genius—did they realize that the world was far vaster than they’d imagined.

However, two ninth layer Spiritual Pedestal Tier elites were annihilated, so this stronghold was no longer safe and could be destroyed instantly by a Spiritual Pedestal Tier beast’s assault. Therefore, everyone went their own way, either harvesting medicine and capturing beasts or heading to other strongholds.

Ling Han also headed towards the core area of the forest.

He exclaimed, thinking that his cultivation advancement was fast enough, but when compared to Yao Hui Yue, his speed might not be slow, yet it couldn’t be said as much faster.

After all, a millennia-old sect such as the Heaven’s Sword Sect... could the abundance of their cultivation resources be compared to what normal forces have? If they focused on a few genius disciples, then Yao Hui Yue and other prodigies’ cultivation progress naturally wouldn’t be slower than Ling Han’s.

However, after crossing into the Flower Blossom Tier, the spirit medicines above sixth tier were pathetically meager, such that even a large sect like the Heaven’s Sword Sect would feel that they were poor, not being able to speed up fostering of the sect’s pupils at all.

Ling Han didn’t need to feel inferior—how long has it been since he started cultivating? One year and a teeny bit, rocketing from the second layer of the Body Refining Tier to the fourth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier. Could Yao Hui Yue compare to such advancement speed back then?

After all, Ling Han never needed to worry about tier comprehension.

“However, now that Yao Hui Yue, Ao Feng, and others have appeared, the difficulty in obtaining the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass and Heavenly Luck stone has increased quite a bit.” Ling Han stroked his chin. These two things were something he was determined to get, but from the looks of it now, it was beset with difficulties.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu suddenly ran towards a location.

Ling Han followed, only to find that Hu Niu stopped at the side of a plant. This plant was pure red, as if burning.

“What, Fiery Sun Grass!” Ling Han was shocked; this was truly a case of an untended willow. He came to the Dark Demon Forest this time for something other thant he Fiery Sun Grass, but he actually just came upon it along the way—what kind of luck was this?

No, it wasn’t that he was lucky, but Hu Niu seemed to have the ability to find medicinal ingredients.

This was pretty good; his chances of obtaining Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass were a bit greater. As long as he obtained it first and hid inside the Black Tower right away, it wouldn’t matter which ‘sword’ you were in the world—nothing would work!

Since he encountered it, then he naturally wouldn’t leave it. Ling Han dug up the Fiery Sun Grass by the roots, planning to transplant it into the Black Tower. These spirit medicines had to grow for a hundred years to blossom and have seeds, but inside the Black Tower, it took only one month to complete the entire process.

Thus, harvesting one Fiery Sun Grass meant that after a few months, this spirit medicine would grow like white cabbage.

“In case I really return to the Winter Moon Sect, I can report on fulfilling my duty.” Ling Han smiled, but immediately straightened up, feeling an intense sense of danger.

“As expected of the person who destroyed the stronghold at Sea Gust City.” An old man’s voiced came from behind. It was like the friction of metals, making people pained to the point of wanting to cover their ears.

Ling Han turned around slowly, only to see an emaciated old man standing behind him silently, holding a red crutch and hunchbacked, looking old and shaky.

“Elder Nine Clouds, right?” He revealed a smile. “Do you Flower Blossom Tier cultivators have the habit of being like ghosts, appearing behind other people soundlessly? Are you not worried about frightening them?”
