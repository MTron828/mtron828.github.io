Chapter 2212: Counterattack

Why did the Nine Heavens Flame have such an ability?

That was because Ling Han had split it out so that it had become one of his divided souls, giving it independence. Otherwise, if it was just a Source Power inside Ling Han’s body, how could it possess such an ability?

Thus, it might seem as if Ling Han splitting the Source Powers of heaven and earth out was weakening himself, yet it had allowed the Nine Heavens Flame to become stronger.

This was also a kind of confidence for him. He had a firm belief in his own strength. Ultimately, external powers could not be depended on.

“Ling Han, are you still unaware of propriety?” Hu Yan shouted harshly.

Ling Han ignored him. The Nine Heavens Flame was decoding the profound secrets within the Inextinguishable Burning Flame. Once it succeeded, it would be able to easily absorb the might of the flames, unlike now, when it was only depending on the height of its essence to repress it.

Furthermore, after decoding this kind of profound secrets of Regulations, the Nine Heavens Flame would be able to possess a corresponding power of Regulation, and that was a great strengthening factor for it.

For Ling Han, this was a good thing as well. He could also observe and study it through the Nine Heavens Flame.

“You are too arrogant!” Hu Yan was furious. He was already surrounded by his Inextinguishable Burning Flame, and Ling Han actually still dared to ignore him. What kind of disdain was this towards him?

He charged over, and sent out a punch, flames soaring to the heavens.

Ling Han, too, shot out a fist.?Boom, the two fists collided, flames rose in all directions, and lava sprayed out.

Hu Yan roared, shooting out punch after punch, determined to suppress Ling Han.

Ling Han countered carelessly. Hu Yan was indeed very strong, but if he wanted to suppress Ling Han, he was being delusional.

…It might be difficult to decide who was stronger between Hu Yan and the Rain Emperor, but there was absolutely no way he could be Ling Han’s match.

Ling Han did not make a harsh move, because he was very intrigued by the Inextinguishable Burning Flame.

Hu Yan spoke of it so proudly, probably because this Inextinguishable Burning Flame was not easily obtained. Thus, since it was here already, Ling Han would naturally prefer to slack off, and take a shortcut.

In essence, the Nine Heavens Flame was forcibly decoding the profound secrets of the Inextinguishable Burning Flame. This speed was too slow, so Ling Han could only continue to exchange blows with Hu Yan, unwilling to easily defeat this opponent.

Of course, Hu Yan was indeed strong, and Ling Han, too, would need to put some effort if he wanted to defeat him.

Hu Yan used all his powerful moves, celestial technique after celestial technique channeling from his hands, and boosted by the Inextinguishable Burning Flame, his battle prowess was astonishingly strong. Even Ji Yutang would probably not last over 100 moves in front of him.

This was a monster that had been nurtured in the Imperial Void Sect?

Ling Han mused ruefully that this was as expected of the Imperial Void Celestial King, who was the disciple of a Heavenly Venerate and one of the strongest Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Even the disciple that he nurtured could be so strong.

However, if Hu Yan was already so strong, then what about Hong Huang?

This guy… could it be that he was a member of the Sealed Emotion Palace?

It was very possible. There was no rule that determined that a disciple of a Heavenly Venerate could not come and play around here. After all, if one were to be overly subjective and disregard the outside world, then even if he had the guidance of a Heavenly Venerate, his accomplishments would still be limited. Cultivators should battle all the way until they became the strongest.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han’s thoughts wandered idly, and after who knew how long, the Nine Heavens Flame suddenly sent a message to him: it had already obtained all the secrets of the Inextinguishable Burning Flame.

Ling Han spread open his palm and looked, and the Nine Heavens Flame had turned into an ancient seal, but compared to before, this seal had another stroke to it. Though it was pitifully tiny, it did indeed exist.

This was just like how a single petal had already bloomed on a flower, and now the tip of the second petal had slightly extended. Though it was still very far off from blooming fully, it was still a start, after all.

Understanding dawned on Ling Han. When the flower’s nine petals had bloomed, the Nine Heavens Flame would have reached the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, but this was the pinnacle because the apex number of heaven and earth was nine, and it could not be surpassed.

As long as you were still living in this galaxy, you would have to adhere to the Regulations of heaven and earth.

Ling Han frowned. Then, how did an “illegitimate child” like the Heavenly Venerable Tier came to be?

Everyone was inferior to Regulations, so how were they supposed to break through the Regulations?

Could he go to the Foreign Realm?

When this thought arose, Ling Han shocked himself.

To say nothing of how he was going to pass through the connection point of the two Realms, even if he could, the Regulations he cultivated would be absolutely useless in the Foreign Realm, and it might be that his strength would be even weaker than Severing Mundane Tier. Then, wouldn’t it be just treading on dangerous ground?

How exactly could he leap out of the pond of this heaven and earth?

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel vexed, and a feeling of annoyance rose up in him.

“Haha, do you now know fear?” Hu Yan smirked coldly.

He thought that Ling Han was frowning because he was afraid.

Ling Han narrowed his eyes in a glare. ‘I’m currently irritated, so are you asking for a beating?’ With his anger stoked, he immediately began a fierce counterattack.

Boom, the Nine Heavens Flame unfolded, instantly expelling the lava, and opening up space for Ling Han’s movements.

‘What?!’

Hu Yan mouthed this word, his face filled with disbelief.

Even though a Fifth Severance could be considered monarch tier, and would definitely become a Celestial King in the future, even when both were Celestial Kings, there wouldn’t be a massive disparity in battle prowess. Why?

Because every cultivation level that had been cultivated would affect the battle prowess of the Celestial King, such as Dividing Nine Souls, or such as the Mystery Realms that he had formed when he had been in the Immortal Palace Tier.

Why did Hu Yan look down on Ji Yutang, and see him as trash? That was because how Ji Yutang had cultivated his Mystery Realm was trash in his eyes, and the gap between their battle prowess was also incredibly obvious.

Monarch tiers would have to cultivate every single cultivation level to perfection. Otherwise, even a monarch tier could degrade to become an emperor tier or a king tier.

So what if he was destined to become a Celestial King? That would only be trash among Celestial Kings, or he would have long since been killed before that.

Ling Han was unconcerned, and only sent out his fists in a mad barrage of punches.

Once he could ignore the Inextinguishable Burning Flame, Hu Yan’s battle prowess would have declined greatly, in relative terms, so how was he supposed to stop Ling Han’s burst in attack?

“Impossible!” Hu Yan finally called out. He had not gained his Inextinguishable Burning Flame with his own power, but it was rather the Imperial Void Celestial King that had moved personally, and helped him to suppress the murderous and destructive power within the flame, which allowed him to obtain it after studying it for 90 years.

This kind of fierce flame could even match the might of a Celestial King—the prerequisite was that he himself had already reached the Celestial King Tier. This was also the basis of his arrogance. How many people in the Immortal Palace Tier could reach this kind of height?

Yet he had only managed to trap Ling Han for a while, and then the latter suddenly showed his divine might, and unravelled the Inextinguishable Burning Flame. How was he supposed to believe this?

“There is nothing that is impossible. In my eyes, you are only trash, so what would be all that difficult about defeating trash?” Ling Han asked calmly, flames exploding on his fist, and forming an ancient and majestic seal.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

At first, Hu Yan could have lasted about 100 moves before defeat, but because his willpower had weakened, and his fighting spirit had also declined greatly, how was he supposed to stand off against Ling Han like this?

He was thrashed harshly, and yowled continuously in pain.

In just over a dozen moves, Hu Yan collapsed on the ground. The lava that covered the ground no longer bubbled and surged, having lost its source, and was quickly suppressed by the formation here, turning into nothing.

Ling Han looked towards Qi Ya, and this fiery woman couldn’t help but take a step back, a powerful fear in her expression, as if she was worried that Ling Han would beat her up as well.

“Go back and tell Jia Lan”—Ling Han picked Hu Yan up—”and you as well, go and tell Hong Huang, if they want to pay me a visit as guests, I welcome them. But they need to show some sincerity, and not let minor characters like you two come and bother me!”

“Scram!” With a toss, Hu Yan was immediately thrown off a far distance away..
