Chapter 3621: Forcefully seizing

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You ” Pang Li was enraged, and he was just about to attack. However, he immediately suppressed his anger and said, “Brat, do you have to complicate a simple matter?”

Ling Han pretended to be a hothead, “What is it? I’m not selling, so could it be that you guys want to snatch it by force?”

Pang Lili laughed loudly, “No, why would our Pang Clan do something like robbery?”

At least, in the Azure Spirit City, they wouldn’t. Although this was their territory, on the surface, they had to be even more just. Otherwise, who would come to the Azure Spirit City to do business?

“Then what do you guys want to do?” Ling Han asked.

Pang Li chuckled, “You will know when the time comes! Who asked you to be so stupid? In future, you will regret it. If only you had agreed to my request

today.”

“I don’t believe it!” Ling Han said resolutely, the image of a foolish young man vivid and lifelike.

Pang Li humphed and strode off.

Another day later, the auction began. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han naturally participated as well. If there was anything good, he too wanted to join in.

For those below Celestial Path, the common currency was jade seeds, and for Celestial Path elites, the common currency was Dao Stone.

Ling Han could only sigh helplessly. Though he had once possessed three, he had spent them all on the war colossus.

However, there was nothing good that was being sold. He just watched the excitement.

in the end, the Water Element Crystal was the climax item as expected.

“The base price is too jade seeds,” the auctioneer said.

too jade seeds?

A cold smirk appeared at the comers of Ling Han’s lips. In his previous exchange with the auction house, the latter had said that the starting price would be measured in Dao Stones.

Though this was for Mystery Realm Tier, its significance was too extraordinary, so it could completely be auctioned off at a price measured in

Dao Stones.

Now, not only had it been switched to jade seeds, but the starting price was only a hundred jade seeds at that?

Hehe, needless to say, it was definitely the Pang Clan that was behind this.

If Ling Han really wanted to auction off this Water Element Crystal, he would definitely explode at this moment. However, he merely sneered at this moment. ‘Pang Clan, Pang Clan, you think you’ve gained an advantage now, but you’ll know later just how great a loss you’ve suffered!

-The Pang Clan had begun to concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill, and this definitely meant that they had already obtained the other four types of Element Crystal. Then, the result of the concoction would be wasting all five portions of ingredients. In fact, it would even cause who knew what kind of consequences for that prodigy from the Pang Clan who would be consuming it.

Even he was slightly expectant.

“100 jade seeds.” Someone raised their plaque.

“The bid is at too jade seeds. Is there anyone who would like to make a higher bid?” the auctioneer called out loudly. “Is there anyone?

“too jade seeds once, too jade seeds twice, too jade seeds three times, sold!”

The auctioneer made the final decision.

The climax item was auctioned off for the “high price” of too jade seeds?

Wasn’t this the biggest joke in the world?

Even if Ling Han knew that the Pang Clan was shameless, he still detested the way they treated him.

It was no wonder that the Pang Clan was getting weaker and weaker with each generation. With such a narrow-minded mindset, what great things could happen?

Ling Han left “infuriated”. When he arrived outside the auction house, he saw that Pang Li was already waiting for him.

“Young man, do you regret it now?” Pang Li laughed loudly, extremely proud of himself.

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and said, “You people have gone too far. Aren’t you afraid of drawing public indignation?”

-What are you saying? Firstly, we didn’t snatch it, and secondly, we didn’t steal it. How could we possibly cause public indignation?” Pang Li smiled, and said,

“Are you dissatisfied?”

Ling Han humphed before turning around to leave.

“Wait” Pang Li said. Shua! He tossed a bag over, and said, “This is your too jade seeds’. Don’t forget to take it. Then, get out of Azure Spirit City and never come

back again!”

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t pick it up. Right now, he was playing the role of a naive and stubborn youth.

“Hahahaha!” Behind him, Pang Li’s arrogant laughter was heard. After walking far away, Ling Han finally smiled. The mine had already been buried, but who knew when it would explode.

At that time, who knew what kind of expressions Pang Li and the Pang Clan would have.

Hehe.

Ling Han’s next stop was the Ironwood Forest.

Among the lands of Five Elements, this was a place that could nurture Wood Element Crystals.

Three days later, Ling Han finally arrived at his destination. Ling Han pondered for a moment. Should he ask the seven babies for help? That was because it was possible that they would expose his identity. But upon further thought, the babies had not died in the first place, so what was so strange about them coming here?

Moreover, even if the Pang Clan and Lei Clan knew that he had not died yet, so what? Worse come to worst, they could send someone over again. What need was there for him to be afraid?

After suffering a loss once, he couldn’t fall for it a second time. Moreover, the situation in the Ironwood Forest was different.

Ling Han still disguised himself as Can Ye, and acted separately from the seven children. Now, he had to concentrate on fighting the monsters. If he could avoid trouble, it was best to avoid trouble.

The Ironwood Forest was extraordinarily huge, and was more than ten times the size of the Cold Water Lake. However, taking into account the fact that the Cold Water Lake was a three-dimensional space, and had a depth of more than thirty thousand meters, if this was taken into account, the Cold Water Lake wasn’t small at all.

Ling Han and the children split up, agreeing to meet once every five days.

Ling Han drew the little loli into the gourd. This little girl was the easiest to expose Ling Han’s identity.

Regarding this, Tang Yun’er naturally protested. However, she couldn’t withstand Ling Han’s brute force, and she was forcefully stuffed into the gourd. Ling Han strode forwards. He would first gather essence of Wood, then fuse it into the Wood Crystal Element.

As for the essence of Wood, it naturally came from Wood Element creatures. The majority of them were Tree Men that could run, jump and kill. Usually, when they stuck their roots into the ground, they would look like a very ordinary tree.

However, if it wanted to make a move, or if it was attacked, it would pull out its roots, and in an instant, it was no longer an ordinary tree, Aside from that, there were also Demonic Beasts that had yet to develop intelligence in the forest, and this was also a great threat. Additionally, there were also fellow travellers that had come to collect the essence of Wood. In truth, these fellow travellers were the ones that he had to guard against the most.

Ling Han activated his eye technique, and with a single glance, he could clearly see whether it was an ordinary tree or a Tree Man.

After walking for a long time, he finally discovered his first target.

This was a large tree that was as tall as 90 meters, and the trunk of the tree was so wide that it would take five to six adults to wrap their arms around it. Ling Han saw the majestic life essence, which was incompatible with the surrounding trees.

Ling Han didn’t immediately attack. Instead, he walked over and sat down. However, though he looked relaxed, his divine sense had long since spread out. He “saw” that one of the branches of this great tree was slowly stretching over. When it was close to him, it suddenly sped up, as fast as lightning, wanting to entangle him tightly.

Ling Han immediately leaped up, dodging the large tree’s attack.

Boom, at this time, the great tree no longer put on any pretences. It dug itself out of the ground, and its body instantly grew another thirty over meters tall.

Ling Han took the initiative to attack the large tree. Frequency Attack was activated, and as he threw a punch, 70 layers of power stacked together.

The Tree Man hurriedly waved its branches to parry. Peng, it was only a single strike, and this branch was rapidly disintegrating, and the damage was even spreading towards its main body. Pa, pa, pa! Its main body continuously released explosive sounds, and was shattered into pieces.

Ling Han’s current destructive power was too terrifying. With just a single punch, he had blasted the Tree Man into dozens of pieces.

“Is this the true might of the Demonic Monkey Fists?” Ling Han mused..
