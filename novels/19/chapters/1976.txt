Chapter 1977: Sword Technique

The Empress, Hu Niu, and Yan Xianlu also wore expressions of eagerness.

Prodigies would seldom admit defeat.

Ling Han released Bewitching Maiden Rou from the Black Tower as well, and the five of them all walked toward the stone tablet.

Weng! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Flashes of sword light slashed over again.

However, Ling Han was prepared this time, and he immediately waved his right hand, launching a counterattack at the flashes of sword light. He wasn’t reactively defending. With Ling Han’s example, the Empress and the others also emulated his actions. They all unleashed powerful celestial techniques.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

There were flashes of brilliant light as the first wave of attacks from the stone tablet ended.

Even though they had been prepared, they were still sent sliding back far into the distance. None of them had managed to advance.

These flashes of sword light were extremely overwhelming and powerful.

However, even though they had all been pushed back, the distance that they had been pushed back was different. For example, Ling Han had been pushed back the least. This time, he had only been pushed back 200 or so steps. After him was Hu Niu, who had been pushed back a dozen or so steps more than him. After her, the Empress had been pushed back seven more steps. Yan Xianlu fell a further 20 or so steps behind. Last was Bewitching Maiden Rou, who had been pushed back a whopping 600 steps.

It was because Ling Han had already faced this attack once that he had been pushed back the least. Discounting him, the strength of the others was clear for all to see.

“Come again!” Hu Niu shouted in excitement. She immediately dashed forward.

Ling Han and the others also charged forward again.

Peng, peng, peng!

Each time they charged forward, they would be pushed back by the attacks of the stone tablet. However, Ling Han, Hu Niu, and the Empress were being pushed back a shorter and shorter distance. In other words, they were continually advancing with each charge.

Meanwhile, Yan Xianlu and Bewitching Maiden Rou were also advancing. However, their advance was incredibly slow, especially Bewitching Maiden Rou’s.

Tang Minglong involuntarily stroked his beard upon seeing this. His wrinkles became less bunched together, and it was as if he were feeling extremely delighted. ‘It was not in vain for me to battle against that person and exhaust several of his trump cards. When these young ones grow up, they’ll definitely become the main pillars to resist the storm of darkness,’ he said in his mind.

At this moment, he suddenly clutched at his chest. His body shuddered, and his face instantly became as white as a sheet. Blood seeped from his fingers.

‘Even after reincarnating and recultivating, and even though we’re both at the fifth severance, the gulf between him and me is still so great. Who would’ve thought? I didn’t die while battling against the storm of darkness, yet I’ll actually die here.

‘So be it. I can lay to eternal rest in my homeland, so I can at least die with a smile.

‘Moreover, as long as these youths can grow up, what does it matter even if I die? Did I not battle in that place for countless years to protect this piece of land?’

He turned around, preventing Ling Han and the others from witnessing his miserable state. With a leap, he quickly vanished without a trace.

Just like Ji Wuming had said before, it was impossible for Tang Minglong to kill him. Meanwhile, he would only need to exhaust a single trump card to kill Tang Minglong. However, Ji Wuming had clearly miscalculated, and he had ended up exhausting more than one trump card.

This was also why Ji Wuming hadn’t targeted Ling Han just then, even though he knew that Ling Han possessed some incredible treasure. He had expended far too many trump cards, so it would have been impossible for him to suppress Ling Han. He hadn’t spared Ling Han out of goodwill.

Ling Han glanced over, and he couldn’t help but feel surprised. ‘Tang Minglong left just like that?’

He wasn’t aware of what had happened before, so he simply thought that Tang Minglong had arrived here earlier, and already mastered this sword technique. Thus, he didn’t pay much heed to this. If others didn’t provoke him, he naturally wouldn’t provoke them, either.

Ling Han returned his attention to the stone tablet.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Bursts of sword light slashed over again.

Ling Han humphed as he extended his right hand, and counterattacked with the Regulation of Slaughter.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, peng!

This was a fierce exchange, and Ling Han continued to slide back. However, he only retreated seven steps in total before stabilizing himself. He then launched a ferocious counterattack as he pushed forward with determination.

He could already resist the full might of the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords. At the very least, he could resist the might of these four words.

This sword technique was incredibly powerful, and it was more so created on the foundation of the Regulation of Slaughter. Ling Han was delighted upon discovering this. This was because he already had a solid grasp of the Regulation of Slaughter, and he had also obtained the true meaning of the great dao just then. In the future, he could definitely obtain a comprehensive grasp of the Regulation of Slaughter.

Combined with the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords, he could definitely unleash the full might of the Regulation of Slaughter.

Moreover, just the words “Heaven Destroying Nine Swords” alone could already allow Ling Han to taste a powerful sword intent, as well as a certain influence from the Regulation of Slaughter. He had a feeling that he could also unleash such a sword technique.

Enlightenment instantly arose in his mind. The words on this stone tablet were not for one to comprehend. Instead, these words would directly transform into attacks to battle against those who arrived before them. In this way, one could comprehend the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords through actual battle.

If one wasn’t strong enough, they would end up being trapped in the outer regions. If that were the case, they could only settle for comprehending the words “Heaven Destroying Nine Swords”.

‘Interesting.

‘Then let’s test out how powerful the following sword technique is.’

Ling Han stepped forward. This time, the second row of symbols of the stone tablet lit up.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

These symbols transformed into seven swords that slashed over, and each of them was brimming with a murderous aura. It was as if they lusted for blood.

Ling Han reached over to counterattack. He didn’t draw on the power of the Black Tower, and he was instead relying on his own strength.

Ding, ding, ding, ding!

There was a series of crisp clanking sounds.

During this exchange, bursts of sword light soared into the sky, severing the clouds and seemingly aiming to shatter the heavens.

Ling Han was forced to retreat again. This was only the second row of symbols, yet its might was already several times greater than that of the first. As such, he had underestimated it, and this had resulted in him being pushed back further than anticipated.

“Haha, come again!”

Ling Han immediately charged forward again.

Boom!

Flames burst from his body, and it was clear that he had already activated the power of his Divine Fetus. This elevated his battle prowess by a significant amount.

Weng!

The attacking swords shuddered, and it was as if they had been enraged. They started to frenziedly slash down at Ling Han.

Ling Han continued to resist. With the Nine Heavens Flame dancing around him, it was as if he were an indestructible God of Fire. When he punched, it was as if he could combust the entire heaven and earth. His might was formidable and domineering.

However, the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords wasn’t weak, either. It became locked in a ferocious battle with Ling Han.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

This was a strange battle, and it was hard to determine who was enjoying the advantage. Only bursts of devastating light continued to soar into the sky, continuously exploding like fireworks. At the same time, symbols of the great dao also continued to materialize and explode, with their destructive power simply overwhelming and astonishing.

After battling for almost seven days, Ling Han finally gained the upper hand. He slowly walked forward, forcefully pushing the sword attacks back as he did so.

However, when he reached some limit, the second row of symbols suddenly dimmed down. Surprisingly, however, the third row of symbols didn’t light up. It was as if the stone tablet were malfunctioning.

‘What’s going on?

‘Did the ancient battle between the Celestial Kings damage this stone tablet?’

Ling Han stroked his chin in thought. He then glanced over at Hu Niu and the others. Right now, Hu Niu and the Empress had also entered the second region, meaning that they were also facing the attacks from the second row of symbols. Hu Niu was unleashing her Roc secret technique, while the Empress had summoned all nine of her doppelgangers.

Meanwhile, Yan Xianlu was still in the first region. However, he was already on the verge of entering the second region. As for Bewitching Maiden Rou, she was still far behind him. She was essentially still stuck at the starting point.

‘Hmm?’

A thought suddenly occurred to Ling Han. He retreated before charging forward again.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.

Sword attacks swept over, carrying with them a tumultuous aura of murder.

Ling Han drew his Divine Demon Sword, and activated the sword technique that he had learned just then—the first technique of the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords.

‘Something’s changed!’

Ling Han immediately made a discovery. Even though the attacking swords were still as powerful as before, it was as if their hostility toward him had decreased by a slight amount. They had become slightly “gentler”.
