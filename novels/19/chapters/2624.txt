Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Even though Chang Zhi’s words were extremely exaggerated, none of the surrounding Celestial Kings could refute his claims.

After all, Miao Yingwei’s strength had been displayed for all of them to see. Once he unleashed his Seventh Heaven battle prowess, he could massacre all of them with ease.

“His battle prowess is nothing more than the Seventh Heaven,” someone muttered quietly. “The stunning beauty from before was only at the peak stage of the Fourth Heaven, yet she possessed a battle prowess at the peak stage of the Sixth Heaven.”

Someone beside them nodded, saying, “Even though that was thanks to her Celestial Tool, her strength alone was still at least at the Sixth Heaven.”

“To surpass two cultivation levels… She’s even more powerful than monarch stars!”

!!

“Even more powerful than me?” Miao Yingwei asked. None of them had noticed that he had already split apart the lightning and returned at some time.

The two people who had spoken hurriedly shut their mouths. Even though they were also at the Sixth Heaven, they knew that they were no match for Miao Yingwei. If conflict occurred, their only option would be to flee. Otherwise, they would definitely be killed.

“Speak!” Miao Yingwei said with a cold humph. “Who can surpass me, Miao Yingwei?”

The two people didn’t want to leave, thus they obediently told him about the Empress and her feats.

“She merely relied on her Celestial Tool!” Miao Yingwei said in disdain. His voice became low, so low that only he could hear what he said as he muttered, “To possess a Celestial Tool… Either she’s a descendent of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King from this place, or she’s an outsider who’s come here to train.”

His eyes were gleaming. Even though he was extremely talented, he didn’t have the support of a Heavenly Venerate, so he naturally didn’t possess a Celestial Tool.

His eyes were red with lust. Regarding the Empress’ beauty, however, he didn’t believe this at all. Before entering the Celestial King Graveyard, he had also been surrounded by countless beauties. What kind of stunning beauty hadn’t he seen?

The bumpkins in the Celestial King Graveyard had seen far too few beauties, so even those who were slightly more attractive would be regarded as stunning beauties.

He pointed to the bridge, and asked, “You’re telling me that those two people are inside the balls of lightning?”

After receiving an affirmative answer, he replied with a shake of his head. Even with his strength, he still couldn’t withstand the attacks of such lightning for too long. This was to say nothing of enduring it for several thousand years.

Heh, these two people were definitely spreading rumors! How could measly Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings achieve such a feat?

“Heh, let me have a look!” He strode toward the bridge.

“You can’t!” someone shouted. “If you attempt to cross the bridge without beating the elder in a game of go first, you’ll be tossed into the river and killed!”

“Humph! Do I, Miao Yingwei, have anything to be afraid of?” Miao Yingwei said as he strode forward. He didn’t believe the nonsense of these people at all.

He quickly arrived at the foot of the bridge. After hesitating for a brief moment, he ultimately decided to stride forward.

Whoosh!

There was a flash of lightning as the elder eerily appeared on the bridge. He then reached over to grab at Miao Yingwei.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Miao Yingwei said with a sneer. He replied with a palm strike of his own. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Peng!

The elder’s hand swooped down, and Miao Yingwei’s counterattack crumbled into a feeble heap. He was easily captured.

“N-Ninth Heaven Celestial King!” he exclaimed through clenched teeth. The gulf between them was far too great. Facing such an elite, his only fate was being suppressed.

The elder didn’t speak at all. Instead, he simply swung his hand.

Pa!

Miao Yingwei was tossed into the river.

“Aaah!” A burst of brilliant light erupted around Miao Yingwei as he surprisingly dashed out of the river, hovering in mid-air. His eyes were filled with anger and resentment.

“He didn’t die!”

“This is unbelievable!”

“As expected of a prodigy! He’s far too powerful!”

Everyone exclaimed in astonishment. This was the first time they had seen someone survive after being tossed into the river.

However, Miao Yingwei didn’t appear proud at all. When he was tossed into the river, his cultivation had actually been sealed. Thus, his only option had been to await death. However, he possessed a rare treasure, one that he had obtained from an ancient site. This rare treasure would only activate when he came across a life-and-death situation, and it could only be used a single time.

Just then, this rare treasure had unleashed its might. This signified that he had already died once.

He had obtained nothing, yet he had wasted a life-saving treasure. How could he be happy?

He sat down cross-legged next to the river. Right now, he was even more intent on obtaining the Celestial Tool. Otherwise, he would feel far too much regret.

100 years, 200 years…

Finally, the lightning became weaker and weaker, revealing Ling Han and the Empress.

As if sensing this, Miao Yingwei immediately opened his eyes. Upon glancing over, astonishment instantly swept over his face.

Surprisingly, there were indeed two people inside the balls of lightning. Moreover, they were only at the Fourth Heaven and the Fifth Heaven. This was absolutely unfathomable!
