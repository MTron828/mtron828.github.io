Chapter 3444: Hong Tianbu Arrives

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Ninth Prince had been wounded.

In a head-on clash, the Ninth Prince, who was most skilled in defense, was actually wounded.

Heavens, this was really too hard to accept.

“Thank you for your guidance!” Luo Jintang was no longer crazy. He was calm and indifferent, and the golden bell protecting his body had also disappeared, especially that ancient character. When it disappeared, the large rock weighing down on everyone’s hearts finally moved away, allowing everyone’s breathing to recover.

The Ninth Prince could still fight, but his strongest defense had already been broken. What was the point of continuing the battle?

Moreover, he had already used the means of Enlightenment Tier. If he continued to be a pest, that would really be too embarrassing.

He nodded at Luo Jintang before turning around to leave. He couldn’t bring himself to say anything else.

Ling Han was extremely curious, and he asked, “Where did that character come from?”

“That guy’s ancestral line should have produced an impressive character. This is a kind of inheritance of Dao, and you can borrow a sliver of that person’s Dao Intent,” Eldest Baby said first.

Fourth Baby, Fifth Baby, and the others were all very depressed. Their words had been snatched.

The two children tried again, and just as they were about to say something different, they heard Sixth Baby say, “Inheriting this kind of Dao, it must be that ancient ancestor did not die. Then, the fortunate descendant would be able to obtain this kind of ability; it is like like a Mystical Power.”

F***, their words had been snatched again.

Fourth Baby and Fifth Baby were even more depressed.

If even Eldest Baby was praising him as impressive, then Luo Jintang’s ancestor must be an extraordinary person. Most importantly, this mighty figure was actually still alive.

Ling Han made a comparison in his mind. Would he be able to dispel this ability? That ancient character was really too terrifying, making him feel like he didn’t want to face it.

“Father, you don’t have to take it to heart.” Second Baby comforted him, “This kind of inheritance of Dao is equivalent to possessing a sliver of the might of an ancient ancestor. It would indeed have an effect on anyone.”

Second Baby was still the most considerate.

“Furthermore, awakening the inheritance of an ancient ancestor’s Dao, this would only appear in Inscription Tier, at least. When inscribing an inscribed pattern in one’s internal organs, the Dao Manifestation could stimulate the Dao inheritance hidden in one’s body, so this is the means of an Inscription Tier,” Third Baby said.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’. He hadn’t broken through to the Inscription Tier yet, so without a means of attack or defense, he was naturally in a disadvantageous position.

However, what if a mortal duel broke out between him and Luo Jintang?

Then, firstly, the other party would not suppress his cultivation level, and secondly, he would not hide the ancient character and choose not to use it.

En, he could directly use the Heavenly Pattern Jade, which was simple and straightforward.

Only then did Luo Jintang sit down and begin to heal the injuries on his hands. At the same time, he continued to accept challenges.

Some people wanted to take advantage of him, but were defeated in a single move.

Everyone’s morale was extremely low. How could it be that there was really no one that could suppress Luo Jintang?

How was the Imperial Capital Academy going to survive in the future? Who would still join?

Ling Han prepared himself. There was one thing that he shared with Chen Fengyan, and that was the more chaotic the world was, the more they needed to unite and clench their fists. Otherwise, if they were all separated, they would only be defeated one by one. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Thus, he couldn’t allow Luo Jintang to ruin the current situation of the Dark North Nation.

“En?” He was just about to leap down from the tree, when he suddenly stopped, and looked into the distance.

In a mere instant, a tall, slender man walked over elegantly, as if he was riding on the wind, extremely carefree.

Hong Tianbu!

Hong Tianbu had returned?

“It’s Hong Tianbu!” The others also discovered this, and they all called out.

“Once Hong Tianbu arrives, he’ll definitely be able to defeat this person.”

“If it’s Hong Tianbu, he’ll definitely succeed!”

Everyone was filled with confidence in Hong Tianbu. This was an invincible legend, and his cultivation level was above Ling Han’s, which naturally made people trust him even more.

Hong Tianbu strode over, and the people on either side of him stepped aside, allowing him to calmly walk past.

Luo Jintang’s eyes lit up, and he stood up, “Hon?”

“I’ll wait for you for an hour.” Hong Tianbu stood still, his hands clasped behind his back. It was only a single action, yet it was as if he were a lofty mountain that could only be admired.

Luo Jintang nodded, and said, “All right.”

The old man beside him couldn’t help but sigh internally. He knew that in the first clash between the two of them, Luo Jintang had already lost.

—Luo Jintang agreed to rest for an hour, obviously thinking that he was no match for Hong Tianbu when he was not in his prime condition. This was a display of his lack of confidence.

However, the elder had no choice but to agree. This young man in front of him was indeed outstanding, and even he couldn’t help but cherish his talent.

Heclearly wasn’t a Divine Physique, yet he had an even higher opinion of him because of this.

As he saw it, the Divine Physique only had an inherent advantage, but the path of martial arts was long, and what was more important was comprehension, fate, perseverance and hard work.

From the very beginning, this Hong Tianbu had suppressed Luo Jintang in terms of aura. Even if the two of them were equal in strength, if it really came down to a fight, Luo Jintang had already lost part of the battle..

This young man… had a certain kind of power. It was as if heaven and earth were on his side.

The area was completely silent. They were all waiting for Luo Jintang to recover, and then battle Hong Tianbu. Then, he would be horribly defeated, and the result would be perfect.

Ling Han activated his Eye Technique and looked at Hong Tianbu.

White bones meant that he had broken through at Sixth Extreme.

There were six inscriptions inscribed in his body, which meant that he had reached Six Inscriptions.

Additionally… there were actually more than 30 spots of light on his body, like starlight.

Ling Han was shocked. Enlightenment Tier!

His advancement was rapid, and Hong Tianbu’s advancement wasn’t slow either. He was already in the Enlightenment Tier.

‘Hmm?’

Just as Ling Han was surveying Hong Tianbu, Hong Tianbu suddenly raised his head and looked towards him.

Their eyes met, and it was as if two sharp swords had collided.

Hong Tianbu smiled faintly before withdrawing his gaze. It was as if he couldn’t care less about Ling Han.

“Looks like a battle is unavoidable today,” Ling Han murmured, but a strong fighting spirit appeared on his face. He had always wanted to have a battle with Hong Tianbu, but the gap in their cultivation levels was too wide. If he made a move, he would definitely lose.

However, this time was different. He had Absolute Fairness.

The question was, was ten minutes enough?

“Father, this person is very strange.” Second Baby also looked over. “This person has a strange energy. En, it should have been newly obtained. It’s very powerful, and also very unstable. It also has an indescribable evil nature.”

Ling Han knew that Hong Tianbu had been exploring all kinds of ancient sites. This should have been an opportunity that he had obtained, but Second Baby still said that it was filled with “evilness”, so it was unknown whether this was a good thing or a bad thing for Hong Tianbu.

As they conversed, an hour passed quietly.

“Hong Tianbu, come fight me!” Luo Jintang called out loudly. After such a long time, not only had he adjusted his physical condition, but he had also adjusted his mentality.

So what if it was Hong Tianbu? Today, his legend would be destroyed.

Hong Tianbu, meanwhile, was extremely calm, and replied calmly, “All right.”

Hong, starlight flashed on his body. These were the acupuncture points that he had opened, communicating with the resonance created by the heaven and earth, “I am an Enlightenment Tier, and have sealed myself to the level of Inscription Tier.” As he spoke, the starlight on his body immediately dimmed.

Luo Jintang’s expression changed drastically..
