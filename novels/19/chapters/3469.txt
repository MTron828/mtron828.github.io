Chapter 3470: Playing Go

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“That’s Li Shuangyi.” Someone recognized the identity of this challenger.

“Oh, the one who is known for being a master of both qin and chess?”

“That’s right. He is Zhou Shangren’s disciple, and his abilities are quite extraordinary.”

“Since he is known as a master of both qin and chess, it should be possible for him to win.”

“En, let’s quickly memorize the way he makes every single move. Later, if he wins, we will do the same.”

“Yes, yes, yes.”

With this reminder, everyone became excited.

The game of go began, and both sides exchanged blows. You would take a soldier from me, and I would take a pawn from you. The pieces collided and shattered, and there were fewer and fewer pieces on the field.

The victor was about to be decided, right?

Li Shuangyi remained calm and composed the entire time. He could also move around, but this was only limited to the nine squares of the commander-in-chief position. Moreover, he had to play according to the rules of the game of go, so he couldn’t run around randomly.

“Cannon five moves six steps horizontally… Horse six advances four steps…” He kept issuing commands, directing his own pieces to begin their offensive.

“Winning, he is going to win!” Everyone was excited. Even if their chess skills were inferior, it was not difficult for them to judge the situation.

Li Shuangyi was already completely on the upper hand, and it was only him that could attack. A horse, a carriage, and a pawn that crossed the river bore down on him, forcing the latter to parry repeatedly. In a few moments, another three pieces had been taken.

At this point, the outcome was already decided.

As expected, after only three moves, the opposing general was killed, and the chess game ended.

Li Shuangyi smiled proudly, and strode towards the opposing side. None of the chess pieces attacked.

When he had walked past, the game quickly recovered. The pieces that had previously been shattered had also returned to their original state, as if they could reverse time.

“You all saw how I won, right?” Li Shuangyi turned around, and swept an eye over the masses. His expression was filled with pride, as if he was waiting for everyone to worship him.

“Brother Li, you are really amazing, I’m impressed!” someone immediately said.

“It’s all thanks to Brother Li that we were able to pass this time.”

“Brother Li, I owe you a favor.”

As expected, a considerable number expressed their stand, but there was also a minority that did not make a sound.

“Humph, a bunch of ingrates!” Li Shuangyi declared in displeasure, but did not get angry. Instead, he said slowly, “The game of go is ever-changing, and even if you guys follow my path, there would still be changes. With your trashy chess skills, isn’t that just courting death?”

This… When everyone heard this, they all felt a chill in their hearts.

That’s right, especially at the beginning, where there were too many changes. Even if it was the same move, it was impossible that the opposide side would react exactly the same.

With this thought, everyone’s attitude changed. They all expressed goodwill towards Li Shuangyi, hoping that when such a situation really appeared, he would be able to give them some guidance.

Li Shuangyi smiled faintly. However, he thought to himself, ‘I don’t mind letting people who aren’t competitive pass the test and reaping some reputation and favors. However, if you make me feel threatened, then I’m sorry. It would be best that you die.’

It wasn’t long before someone entered the board for a game of go. Sure enough, even though he had followed Li Shuangyi’s lead, there was still a slight change. It was all thanks to Li Shuangyi’s guidance that he managed to draw the game back to its original course, helping that person achieve victory.

This was clearly a mistake, so why could the people beside him give him pointers?

Ling Han thought for a moment, then shook his head. Looking at the layout and arrangements of this trial ground, there shouldn’t have been such an obvious mistake, but it should have been deliberate.

Just like the garden from before. After the first person passed through, all the flowers stopped blooming, allowing people to easily pass through.

Those who had passed were naturally very grateful to Li Shuangyi, and Li Shuangyi put on airs, completely ignoring them.

Next, another person took the field for a game of go.

After the game changed, Li Shuangyi still offered some guidance, helping the other pass.

Two, three, four, more and more people passed, but on the ninth, an accident happened. The Formation Spirit’s chess skills seemed to have improved greatly, and no matter how hard Li Shuangyi tried, it was useless.

Naturally, this person’s only fate would be to be crushed by a chess piece.

Li Shuangyi immediately sighed. He had made a mistake, and in a game of go, a mistake would result in a complete loss.

“Young Master Li, don’t take it to heart. People will make mistakes eventually.”

“That’s right, that’s the logic.”

“Young Master Li, don’t think that this is your fault.”

Everyone comforted him, and spoke up for Li Shuangyi.

Although that was what they said, no one immediately stepped forward to issue another challenge. Who knew if Li Shuangyi would make another “mistake”?

However, their yearning for abilities ultimately surpassed their fear. Not long after, another person finally stepped forward to issue a challenge. In the end, he won.

Everyone regained their confidence, and began to scramble to take the field again, because who knew if Li Shuangyi would suddenly leave?

Ling Han observed, but it was not that the change in the chessboard, but rather a change in the circulation of the formation.

He had gathered a great deal of information, and there was one very important detail, and that was after every move, both sides would only have a minute to consider. If it was too late, the result would be a direct loss.

Previously, there were some that had considered for too long, and were directly crushed to death.

Ling Han felt that it was unrealistic for him to resolve the formation in a short amount of time, but if he only had to block the channelling of the formation, so that it could not move within a minute, he was still capable of doing so.

Of course, he still had to accept the challenge first. There were some changes that he had to personally experience.

Thus, after the person who was currently playing the game won, Ling Han took the lead and stepped into the position of general.

“Hey, hey, hey, why aren’t you going down according to Young Master Li’s arrangements?” someone immediately shouted.

Previously, Li Shuangyi had even arranged the order of who would be taking the field, and used this to establish his authority. Everyone needed his help, so naturally, they could only obey his arrangements.

“How dare you!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You actually dare to disobey Young Master Li’s command?”

Those who had not passed all spoke up at once, all of them very defiant.

Meanwhile, Li Shuangyi smiled proudly, “Don’t worry, I will not give him any guidance.”

“Haha, then this brat is done for. His only fate is death.”

“Hehe, for the sake of getting the first turn, you have to sacrifice your life. How foolish.”

“He deserved it. Who asked him to disobey Young Master Li’s command? Even if he died, he deserved it.”

Everyone roared with laughter. This unruly person most likely wouldn’t live for long. He would soon die on the chessboard.

Ling Han ignored them, and the game of go had already begun.

He had not considered winning the game at all. Thus, he was very careless in his moves, and it could be said that every move he made was a mistake.

“You’re actually not going to play by Young Master Li’s rules?”

“Sigh, even if I’m not skilled in chess, I can tell that this is completely playing blindly.”

“He actually dares to come up with such terrible chess skills?”

“Is your brain muddled from the heat?”

Everyone shook their heads. This brat was really muddleheaded, and too stupid.

Ling Han walked around randomly, and the pieces were continuously taken, while the other party practically did not lose any pieces.

Li Shuangyi smirked coldly. This time, even if he personally took the field, it was still impossible for him to win the chess game.

What a reckless guy.

“He’ll definitely die within the next three moves,” someone said with certainty.

“One move.”

“Two moves.”

Right at this moment, Ling Han suddenly moved. Xiu, he threw out the Destructive Formation.

Then, he issued a command, and casually made a move.

Originally, there should have been a general on the other side, but the Destructive Formation had been thrown just right, cutting off the channelling of the formation. Instantly, it was as if the formation had died, and was no longer channelling..
