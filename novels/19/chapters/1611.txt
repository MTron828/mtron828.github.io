Chapter 1612: Open Clouds Forbidden Land

Jing Yi smiled. “Miss Long, at present, Lady Yushan is with our young master, so it would be best that you two do not disturb them for now.”

“And who is your young master?” Long Xiangyue’s brows wrinkled in a frown.

“Open Clouds Forbidden Land, Zhong Badu!” Jing Yi and Yang Zige announced simultaneously, their tone filled with respect as if a supreme god was standing in front of them.

Ling Han was startled. The Open Clouds Forbidden Land?

Open Clouds King?

All those years ago, the Heavenly River King had been betrayed by the Open Clouds King, so he faced enemies both in front and behind him. Otherwise, with how he had cultivated a Celestial King technique, it was very possible that he would be able to open the doors to the Celestial Realm. This also filled the Heavenly River King with great resentment, and he strongly requested his heir to kill the Open Clouds King in his will.

So this Open Clouds King established the Open Clouds Forbidden Land after that?

“Never heard of it!” Long Xiangyue raised a brow. “Out of the way, I want to see my aunty!”

“Apologies, Miss Long.” Jing Yi smiled apologetically, but showed no intention to move out of the way and let them pass.

Long Xiangyue was angered. This was the Long Tribe, and two outsiders like you actually dared to stand in her way. Was there any more law in this place? With a qiang, she drew her sword, her expression dark, and she was already filled with killing intent.

She was just about to move when her shoulder suddenly felt a weight. No matter how much she tried, she could not take another step. She turned to look, and saw that one of Ling Han’s hands was pressing down on her shoulder.

“You are no match for them,” Ling Han said. Though Long Xiangyue’s rate of advancement could not be considered slow, she presently was only at the peak stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier, while Jing Yi and Yang Zige were in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier.

‘He is worrying about me!’

Long Xiangyue couldn’t help but feel a sweetness in her heart, all her fury suddenly dissipating into thin air.

Ling Han withdrew his hand, and said to Jing Yi and Yang Zige, “Those who are guests should behave like guests, it is not proper for the guest to overwhelm the host.”

“Who are you?” These two people looked at Ling Han, a sliver of seriousness in their expressions. Similarly in the Eternal River Tier, they naturally realized how strong Ling Han was, and treated him seriously and cautiously. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ling Han.”

“Ling Han?” Their expressions were filled with confusion, obviously not having heard of Ling Han’s name. But since his surname was Ling, it meant that he was not related to the Long Tribe, causing the two of them to dispense with their wariness.

“Hoho, so you are only a guest. What right do you have to fault us?” Yang Zige asked calmly.

“It is true that I don’t. However, if I wish to enter, what right do you two have to stop me?” Ling Han pointed at the main doors.

“Do you have that strength?” Jing Yi’s fighting spirit blazed. Every king tier was definitely battle-thirsty. Otherwise, without experiencing multiple battles, how could they possibly reach that kind of height?

Ling Han did not say a word, and only took a step forwards.

Sensing the movement in the air, Jing Yi and Yang Zige also took a step forwards at the same time, both of them raising their hands, and planning to make a move.

But in the next moment, they were shocked because they had not even made their move, and Ling Han’s palms were already pressing down on their respective shoulders. It was as if their senses had experienced a momentary lapse, and after a dazed moment, the situation had come to this.

If Ling Han had not placed his hands on their shoulders, but rather on their heads?

The two of them couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Then Ling Han would only have to exert strength, and he would be able to directly shatter their spirit. No matter how prodigious they were, so what? Their only result was death.

Ling Han patted their shoulders, and said, “Behave and stand aside.”

He withdrew his hands, and Jing Yi and Yang Zige hurriedly dodged to either side. They were so shocked that their hearts were throbbing violently. It was clear that they were all in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, so why was the gap between them so wide? It was as if they would not be able to last one single move from Ling Han.

“Young Master has commanded us, no one is to disturb them!” Yang Zige forced out through clenched teeth, and drew his weapon. It was a battle dagger-axe. Divine patterns glowed one after another, boosting his aura to an incredibly strong level.

Jing Yi did the same. She used a pair of blades, and the aura that he exuded was not the slightest bit inferior to Yang Zige.

Ling Han smiled carelessly, and said, “Seeing as the two of you are only obeying orders, I will be more merciful.”

Jing Yi and Yang Zige both exclaimed lightly, and charged in attack, wielding their respective weapons. Weng, divine patterns glowed, their aggression spreading out like an ocean.

Long Xiangyue’s pretty face couldn’t help but pale. Though she was conceited, she definitely did not think she would be able to match this kind of battle prowess. Putting aside the question of emerging victorious, it was a question whether or not she would be able to even parry a single attack.

However, she was filled with confidence in Ling Han. He was a man who had even killed two Saint Kings, so what were mere Eternal River Tiers worth?

Ling Han very casually waved his hand, and banished their two attacks. He easily arrived in front of Yang Zige, and shot out a punch. “Ah”, Yang Zige suddenly shouted, and stumbled backwards, his nose bleeding wildly.

Ling Han turned around, and looked towards Jing Yi.

Jing Yi couldn’t help but take a step back. The gap between the two of them was too wide; she would not be a match for him even if she put her life on the line.

“Humph!” At this moment, a stern voice rang out from within the courtyard, and the doors to the courtyard opened on their own. A young man was standing afar within the courtyard. It was as if his whole person was the center of the heaven and earth, and others could only worship him.

“Young Master!” Both Jing Yi and Yang Zige hurriedly knelt, and paid their greetings to this young man.

The young man raised his hand slightly, allowing Jing Yi and Yang Zige to stand. Only then did he turn his eyes to Ling Han and Long Xiangyue. His gaze did not linger for long on Ling Han. Instead, he stared at Long Xiangyue for a long time, a strange smile involuntarily appearing on his lips.

“Aunty!” Long Xiangyue suddenly called out. A woman appeared in the courtyard, and she looked to be in her twenties. Black locks cascaded down her shoulders, while there were two small dragon horns growing on her head.

Needless to say, this woman was Long Yushan.

“What impressive courage, to actually dare wound my subordinates!” Zhong Badu exclaimed coldly, finally fixing his eyes on Ling Han directly.

“Hoho, are you dissatisfied?” Ling Han asked calmly.

Zhong Badu’s eyes narrowed; he was a Saint!

A mere Eternal River Tier actually dared be insolent in front of him; what justice was there left in his world? He definitely could not be considered a good-tempered person. Furthermore, what need was there for a Saint to have reservations in doing things? Immediately, he stretched out his hand to press down on Ling Han.

Pa!

His hand had not even landed when Long Yushan swiftly moved. An intimidating dragon’s might spread out, and this attack from him was forcefully blocked.

“Don’t move!” Long Yushan declared in displeasure.

Zhong Badu’s expression shifted slightly, but he immediately smiled, and said, “Fine, just for the sake of Yushan, I will spare this person just once.” With a flutter of his sleeve, he left proudly, and Jing Yi and Yang Zige hurriedly followed behind him.

“Aunty, who is this guy, so arrogant!” Long Xiangyue hurriedly ran to Long Yushan’s side, pulling on her hand, and began to act like a spoiled child.

Long Yushan cast a doting look on her, and evenly answered, “He is my fiance.”

Pu!

Long Xiangyue abruptly spluttered. What? She hurriedly shook her head, “Aunty, that guy looks to have a repulsive countenance. You definitely cannot marry him, or you will definitely suffer in future!”

“Silly girl, you don’t understand!” Long Yushan shook her head. Actually, she did not want to marry, but the Open Clouds Forbidden Land was too strong. They had a Saint King in their ranks. A few years ago, when the Open Clouds Forbidden Land came to ask for marriage, it was a Great Saint that had come, and he had also brought a betrothal gift that the Long Tribe could not afford to refuse.

A Saintly medicine!

Though the Long Tribe was powerful for this moment, no one knew that the grand elder of the Long Tribe had actually always had internal injury. That was a Dao injury that had been left behind when he had forcefully broken through many years ago, and could only be healed by Saintly medicine.
