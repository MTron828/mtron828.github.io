Chapter 2554: Astonishing Revelation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

He Runhai was initially astonished. However, he immediately sneered in reply. This was only natural.

He was in possession of the formation core, so the conclusion was already foregone.

“Ancient ancestor, abandon your futile struggle. Alright, it’s time for me to use your divine sense as a core to condense the fruit of cultivation!” he said in a calm voice. The metal tree had already absorbed enough blood essence. It was time to complete the final step.

The United Origin Manifestation Fruit wasn’t a naturally occurring fruit. Instead, it was an artificial one. Thus, rather than calling it a celestial fruit, it was probably more accurate to refer to it as the product of a unique alchemical technique. After plucking the divine sense of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate and nurturing it for countless years, one could ultimately refine this paramount “pill.”

Of course, everything that He Runhai had said before was a lie. Only a single United Origin Manifestation Fruit could be produced, and only those at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven could consume it, allowing them to ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

He retrieved the white stone and attempted to extract Celestial King He Feng’s divine sense from within it. However, as he channeled the stone, his expression suddenly changed.

It wasn’t responding!

‘Impossible!’

He had clearly gained control of the formation core, and He Feng was nothing but a damaged divine sense. That being the case, why was it not responding?

“Sigh!” He Feng heaved a long sigh again. “You indeed misunderstood me. This was originally a huge opportunity that I left for the descendants of the He Clan, and it could have helped you take that final and most critical step. You could have ascended to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“However, it’s a shame that you were blinded by greed, and it’s a shame that you never trust others. In the end, your genius has led to your own demise.”

He Runhai wore a twisted expression, shouting, “So what? Right now, I’m in control of everything! Since you care about your descendants so much, obediently offer me your divine sense to become the core of the fruit of cultivation!”

“How can the United Origin Manifestation Fruit require my divine sense to mature? You’re wrong; you’ve been wrong from the beginning,” He Feng replied with a chuckle.

“Bullsh*t! Utter bullsh*t!” He Runhai chided. He channeled the white stone with all his might, attempting to extract He Feng’s divine sense from the core of the formation so that he could complete the final and most critical step.

Weng!

A beam of light appeared in the center of the formation. In the next moment, a figure appeared, formed from countless rays of light. It was difficult to see his appearance, and in fact, it was difficult to even make out his figure. He appeared extremely blurry and elusive.

“H-how in the world did you manage to break free?” He Runhai asked in utter shock. It was as if he had seen a ghost.

This was because this figure was none other than his ancient ancestor, He Feng!

Their bloodline relationship allowed him to immediately determine that this was He Feng, his ancient ancestor. However, it was exactly because of this that he was transfixed with shock.

How was it possible for He Feng to appear?!

He was nothing but a damaged soul that had been hiding inside the formation. It was only because of this that he had managed to avoid retribution from heaven and earth. Now, however, he had actually broken free? This was simply impossible! Otherwise, why had he schemed here for several epochs? Was it not to wait for the United Origin Manifestation Fruit to mature?

“Who told you that I was trapped here?” He Feng asked in a calm voice. However, there was a domineering edge to his voice.

‘If you hadn’t been trapped here, then why had you stayed here? For fun?!’

He Feng waved his hand, causing the metal tree to clink and clank.

Pa, pa, pa!

The Imperial Void Celestial King and the others were all tossed down. They could barely stand, and they were all as white as a sheet. They had lost a huge amount of blood essence, which caused their vitality to be extremely deficient.

However, they hadn’t died. Everything would be fine as long as they hadn’t died.

He Runhai couldn’t help but roar, “You’ve gone mad! They’re all nutrients, nutrients! You’ve schemed for so long, and was it not in order to extract their blood essence to nurture the United Origin Manifestation Fruit? Was it not to revive yourself?”

“I already told you just then. I actually prepared this United Origin Manifestation Fruit for my descendants. However, your actions have bitterly disappointed me, so why should I leave it for you?” He Feng replied calmly.

He Runhai refused to believe this. How could such a good person exist in this world? Someone who would abandon their chance at revival to help his descendants?

Ling Han interjected, saying, “Senior, perhaps you successfully reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier?”

Perhaps he had succeeded, but he might have also suffered severe wounds in the process. Thus, he required countless years to heal and recuperate. During this time, he decided to prepare some schemes in order to benefit the descendants of his clan. However, it seemed like the members of the He Clan were all paranoid people. It was almost certain that if he had clearly explained the situation, none of this would have happened.

However, he had, for some reason, decided to test the loyalty of his descendants as well. Coincidentally, He Runhai was the type of person who would do anything to benefit himself, even being ready to go as far as to sacrifice his own son. Thus, problems naturally arose.

Whom could they blame?

He Feng faltered for a brief moment. He then chuckled, and said, “Young one, you’re pretty smart, aren’t you? However, it’s a shame that you’re not my descendant. Shame, what a shame!”

“How is this possible?!” He Runhai yelped. “Since you succeeded in ascending to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, why did you still bury yourself here? You’re lying to me! You’re definitely lying to me!”

He Feng’s body slowly solidified, with his facial features becoming increasingly clear. It was now possible to make out his appearance.

He looked to be around 20 years old, handsome but filled with an indescribable and overwhelming aura.

“Heavenly Venerate!” the large black dog exclaimed. He had followed the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable for countless years, so he was naturally familiar with the aura of Heavenly Venerates.

This was a genuine Heavenly Venerate.

He Feng clasped his hands behind his back, saying, “I’ve indeed succeeded already. I’ve genuinely become a Heavenly Venerate. However, I’m also aware of my own limitations. To become a Heavenly Venerate is to ascend to a transcendent dimension. This is a relationship wherein my Regulations further approach the fundamental power. However, if I want to advance further and interact with the fundamental power of the Genesis World… This is simply impossible.”

Becoming a First Tier Heavenly Venerate entailed being able to master the unique power of a dimension. This wasn’t genuine transcendence. Indeed, if a First Tier Heavenly Venerate went to a foreign dimension, they would need to master the unique power of that dimension in order to possess the power of a Heavenly Venerate again.

Only after advancing to the Second Tier could a Heavenly Venerate truly grasp one of the six fundamental powers of the Genesis World. Only then could they peer down at the world and travel to any dimension that they wished.

“So, I thought to myself, since Hysteria can engulf the heavens and swallow the earth, even surpassing the limits of the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, why can’t I?” He Feng continued nonchalantly. His voice was calm, yet the meaning of his words caused everyone’s heart to shudder.

“That’s right. I destroyed my physical body on purpose. During these countless years, I was fusing together with this.”

A tail appeared behind him.

Heaving a tail was no strange matter. After all, there were many demi-humans in the world, some with horns, some with tails, and some with other non-human parts. However, He Feng’s tail was shrouded in black light, and exuding an indescribable might.

Ling Han was truly stunned at this moment. In fact, white-hot fury washed across his face. “It’s Hysteria’s tentacle!”

He had seen this in the Celestial Realm before. When Zhou Heng had traversed the dimensions to visit the Celestial Realm, Hysteria had tailed behind him, almost killing the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate in a single blow.

What Ling Han and the others had seen was none other than a squid-like tentacle.

This image had been seared into Ling Han’s mind. At this moment, He Feng’s tail was none other than Hysteria’s tentacle! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He Feng faltered upon hearing this, and he involuntarily said, “As a measly Third Heaven Celestial King, you’ve actually seen Hysteria?” One had to realize that even those at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven were only cannon fodder in the Realm Battlefield. They could die at any moment. Thus, it was preposterous to think that Ling Han had actually seen Hysteria.

Ling Han nodded in reply, saying, “Yes!”

He Feng chuckled in reply. “So be it. I’m willing to tell you about this, and I never planned to keep it a secret in the first place. Indeed, I’ve fused together with a tentacle of Hysteria. I’ve spent all of these years fusing together with it, and soon, I’ll go to a low-level dimension to massacre all of their elites. I’ll then engulf the entire dimension. I’m confident that I can become a second Hysteria in the future.”

He had truly gone mad!
