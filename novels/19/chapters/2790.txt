2791 Re-establishment of space

As for Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate?

Here, the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates would be suppressed. Previously, they could only be considered First Tier Heavenly Venerates, and now they were still only Third Tiers. There were just a few of them here, so how could they turn their disadvantageous position around?

He Liqun’s expression was instantly ugly. The thought naturally came to him as well. At present, their advantage in numbers was no longer effective. On the other side, there were more than 100 with Third Tier’s battle prowess, and as for their side? They only had 20-30 of them. Moreover, this number could not possibly further increase.

Ling Han smiled. “No need. I can deal with this kind of trash on my own.” He took a few steps forwards. “He Liqun, I will give you a chance. Battle me.”

‘Hmm?’

It was not just He Liqun. Everyone was taken aback. ‘Do you really think that you are invincible?’

Now that space had reestablished itself, the power restriction had already relaxed to the level of Third Tier. For you, a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, your power would not be raised accordingly, so why did you have the courage to issue a challenge?

He Liqun felt slightly embarrassed. If he accepted the challenge, he would become a bully, but if he refused… then wouldn’t it mean he did not dare to accept even the challenge of a First Tier Heavenly Venerate? But he immediately humphed. As long as Ling Han was labeled a traitor, what would it matter?

To get rid of traitors was everyone’s responsibility.

He strode forwards, bearing down on Ling Han.

The 12-headed lionman frowned. “Young friend?”

“It’s all right!” Ling Han waved a hand carelessly. He feared no one below Fourth Tier.

“You were the one to ask for this.” He Liqun moved, grabbing out towards Ling Han.

As he saw it, Ling Han would definitely fall into his grasp easily.

Ling Han clenched a fist, and met the oncoming attack from He Liqun.

Peng!

In an exchange of blows, the giant hand that He Liqun had extended shattered instantly.

“Urgh!” He Liqun grunted. He raised his hand, and saw that a bloody mark had appeared on his palm.

Though the hand that he had previously extended was condensed from his power, it had still been destroyed with a single blow from Ling Han. Along with the backlash of power, his hand had also been wounded from the impact.

‘What?!’

Everyone was flabbergasted. A mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate… How could he possibly possess battle prowess at the Third Tier?

Could it be that now that space was reestablished, the power suppression affecting those above the First Tier had returned?

However, the expressions of those elites in the Second Tier, Third Tier, and Fourth Tier shifted. They naturally were very clear it wasn’t the case. Their battle prowess had already recovered to normal, or was suppressed to the Third Tier.

Then, it was either that He Liqun had not used his full power at all, or that Ling Han possessed battle prowess on the level of the Third Tier.

They were all willing to believe the former scenario. Otherwise… Ling Han’s strength had reached a level that they could not believe or understand.

“You…” He Liqun pointed at Ling Han, the expression on his face very colorful. “I have not expected this. Not only have you not been crippled, you have improved even further, and are freakish to this extent!”

For a First Tier to possess Third Tier’s power was truly unbelievable.

“Cut the crap. Do you dare to battle me?” Ling Han demanded coldly. “This time, it is a battle to the death!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After all, Ling Han had not had a good reason to kill He Liqun previously. But this guy actually dared to smear his good name with the accusation of being a traitor; Ling Han could not tolerate this.

Attacking from the shadows and a poor character.

He Liqun took a deep breath. “Fine, we battle!”

The reason why he had suffered a loss in that last exchange was because he had underestimated Ling Han—this was normal. Who would have thought that a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could possibly be so powerful? However, He Liqun was a Fourth Tier, and even if his power was suppressed to the level of Third Tier, his battle prowess was definitely still top-grade among Third Tiers.

Would He Liqun lose to Ling Han? He refused to believe it.

When he had been at the First Tier, he had already lost to Ling Han once. If he still did not dare to accept a challenge to battle when he was now a Third Tier, then there would really be no need for him to continue living.

He Liqun charged out once more, unleashing a fierce offensive against Ling Han.

Boom, boom, boom! With the former waving both hands repeatedly, multiple spheres of light were shot from his hands, barraging madly downwards.

Ling Han approached without fear, going against the flow of the light spheres and towards He Liqun.

The two of them charged close to one another, and an intense battle immediately erupted.

This time, He Liqun did not lose indeed. His power had reached the peak stage of the Third Tier, and Ling Han was also at the Third Tier. It was possible that Ling Han had not attained peak-stage Third Tier, so He Liqun would definitely have the upper hand in an exchange of blows.

As expected, in the intense exchange, Ling Han was clearly slightly inferior, but his disadvantage was not very large.

Everyone was astounded. He Liqun being so powerful was naturally what they had expected. When a Fourth Tier was suppressed to the Third Tier, it would only be strange if he was not strong. However, Ling Han was only a First Tier, so how could he be so strong?

Those like Geng Xuandan, Shi Mengyu, and Shi Zhonghe felt their mouths twitch. They had probably guessed the reason for Ling Han’s overwhelming strength: the latter had extracted the unique power of not just a single dimension when he was in the First Tier.

Actually, Ling Han had not been the first to have such an idea of fusing more Powers of Dimension together. After so many years of development of cultivation, various possibilities had naturally long since been studied.

However, the predecessors had all encountered a bottleneck that they could not break through, and that was the fact that there was a limit to the number of Powers of Dimension that they could fuse together. The one who had fused the most had only fused as many as over 900, and no one could reach 1,000.

For example, they had fused together several dozen Powers of Dimensions, so they just barely could battle against an opponent that was a tier superior to them, but prodigies like them were rare. Only the top 100 on the recent leaderboard of every spatial level could possibly achieve this.

In the Genesis World, not even a whole dimension could produce one on average, which showed just how few of them there were.
