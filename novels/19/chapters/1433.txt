Chapter 1434 S-small Galaxy?

Had the heavens collapsed? Why was Zhang Qing showing such urgency?

Everyone here was a king tier, so their vision was naturally incredibly powerful. Right now, Zhang Qing was truly climbing the mountain as if his life depended on it. It appeared as if he was only sweating, but in reality, he was actually forcefully raising his speed and gritting his teeth as he resisted the might of the mountain. The damage that was done to him was invisible and intangible, yet it would be serious enough to severely wound his vitality for several years or even decades to come. His cultivation would barely be able to advance an iota.

In fact, it was even possible that his cultivation might fall.

Liu Juntian naturally recognized that this was his follower. He couldn’t help but feel astonished. What serious matter had occurred? It was actually serious enough to force his follower to such a state?

He rushed over to meet Zhang Qing, worry growing in his mind.

Ling Han didn’t so much as glance at them. He simply introduced himself to the king tiers. The Rain Emperor, Xu Ran, and the Notionless Saint all followed suit. Of course, the Notionless Saint didn’t refer to himself as a Saint anymore. Otherwise, he would definitely be pummeled by everyone present. Impersonating a Saint was far too arrogant an action.

Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden didn’t speak to introduce themselves. Instead, they each retrieved a chair from their Spatial Spirit Tools before sitting down gracefully. Their movements were elegant and intoxicating, and they instantly attracted the gazes of numerous king tiers.

“Brother Ling, are you all from the same galaxy?” someone asked.

If everyone were from the same nation, they would ask which region they had come from. After all, people from the same region would definitely feel closer to each other. Expanding this notion to galaxies, those from the same nation or same planet would naturally feel closer to each other.

Further expanding this notion to the universe—an even larger realm—those from the same galaxy would naturally be “fellow friends”.

To king tiers, this was more so a source of reputation and glory.

This was because this could represent the cultivation level of their galaxy. Who didn’t want to bring glory to their galaxy? This was much like representing a sect in battle—they would naturally feel hostile toward other sects. This was their sense of pride and glory playing up.

Ling Han exchanged a glance with the others before replying, “Eastern Light Galaxy.”

Indeed, Joint Peace Planet belonged to the Eastern Light Galaxy.

Since the Lower Realm had ascended to the Joint Peace Planet, they naturally belonged to Joint Peace Planet, and thus the Eastern Light Galaxy.

“Eastern Light Galaxy?” Blank expressions appeared on the king tiers’ faces. They had never heard of the Eastern Light Galaxy before. Which large galaxy was this? It had actually produced six king tiers at once!

“Eastern Light, Eastern Light... Ah, I know!” a king tier suddenly said with a clap of his hands. There was a look of realization on his face.

“Which large galaxy is it?” the others asked.

The king tier who had exclaimed in realization wore a strange expression as he shook his head.

“What, is it a super-large galaxy?”

In the Immortal Realm, those galaxies that had Eternal River Tier elites were referred to as large galaxies. However, this required the galaxy to have at least 10 Eternal River Tier elites. Moreover, one of these elites had to be at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. Meanwhile, if a galaxy had a Saint, it could be referred to as a super-large galaxy—of course, this didn’t require the Saint to be a Great Saint or Saint King. It was fine as long as they were a Saint. There was no numerical requirement, either. After all, producing a Saint was far too difficult.

“Neither of them!” the king tier replied with a shake of his head. “The Eastern Light Galaxy is a small galaxy!”

‘Small galaxy?’

The galaxies that couldn’t meet the requirement of a large galaxy were all referred to as small galaxies.

The king tiers all wore strange expressions. This small galaxy had actually produced six king tiers? This was incredible! One had to realize that even large galaxies could only produce a maximum of two to three king tiers. If they produced four to five, they would definitely be entering a golden age of cultivation.

However, a small galaxy? If they prayed day and night, perhaps they would be able to produce one king tier. However, the majority of the time, they would fail to produce even a single king tier!

“Moreover...” The king tier paused momentarily as if he were testing the ability of the other king tiers to accept his words. “This small galaxy only has a single Eternal River Tier elite. Not only that, but this elite is only at the low extreme...”

Pu!

Many of the king tiers spluttered in astonishment. This wasn’t because they were uncultured, but because this piece of information was far too difficult to accept!

This galaxy barely even had an Eternal River Tier elite! In reality, there had indeed been no Eternal River Tier elite in the Eastern Light Galaxy for the past 100 or so years. As such, it could be regarded as a bottom-ranking galaxy even among small galaxies. Yet, it had suddenly produced six king tiers? How could the king tiers from the large galaxies accept this?

To compare themselves against others was sure to drive them crazy.

“Is this true?”

“It’s impossible, right?”

“Brother He, have you remembered things incorrectly?”

The king tiers all expressed their doubt over this astonishing revelation. It was simply unfathomable.

The king tier simply smiled, and said, “Why don’t we ask Brother Ling and the others? They can easily confirm this for us.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Han didn’t refute the king tier’s information, confirming that the Eastern Light Galaxy indeed only had one Eternal River Tier elite. Moreover, this Eternal River Tier elite had already passed away.

The king tiers all yelped in astonishment. This was a rare occasion where they were losing their composure and cool.

‘F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!’

“Humph!” However, there was suddenly a menacing humph at this moment, and they all say Liu Juntian striding over, a harrowing killing intent on his face. His eyes were fixed on Ling Han, and he roared, “Ling Han!”

Although Zhang Qing didn’t know Ling Han’s name, Ling Han had already introduced himself just then. As a king tier, concentrating on several different things was naturally an easy task for Liu Juntian.

Ling Han picked at his ears, and asked, “What’s wrong? I’m not deaf, you know?”

“You killed my younger brother!” Liu Juntian said gravely. His expression was incredibly dark. His father had passed away early, and he only had this one younger brother. It was evident that he would never get a second younger brother. Thus, regardless of how wanton and profligate Liu Shiyuan was, Liu Juntian still cherished him immensely. As the saying went, an older brother was sometimes like a father.

However, his only brother had been killed by Ling Han!

“Mm-hm,” Ling Han replied indifferently, appearing completely uncaring.

He truly didn’t care.

“You!!” Liu Juntian was beside himself with rage. This person had killed his younger brother, yet he didn’t feel an ounce of guilt or sorrow?

“Shouldn’t I have killed him?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “I’m sure you’re the most familiar with your younger brother’s personality. His only use in life is to bring harm and misery unto others. Apart from killing him, what else could I have done?”

“Very well! Very well! Very well!” Liu Juntian repeated this three times, a ball of flames materializing above his head with each repetition. These flames then transformed into a fire dragon that arched its back and roared.

Roar!

A burst of divine sense fluctuated outward, causing the hearts of the king tiers to shudder.

‘So powerful!’

This burst of divine sense possessed a powerful might that caused them to feel unwilling to become enemies with Liu Juntian.

Rank two king tiers were indeed powerful!

“Then there’s nothing more to say. Pay with your life!” Liu Juntian said coldly. He stared at Ling Han, ready to attack at any moment.

Ling Han simply replied with a smile. He had no time to debate the debauchery of Liu Shiyuan. He had only been carrying out justice, ridding the world of a sinister person. If Liu Juntian had understood his intentions, he wouldn’t have allowed Liu Shiyuan to become so wanton in the first place.

So, what more was there to say? They could only resolve this conflict through battle.

“Heh, they’re about to do battle.”

“Who do you think is going to win?”

“Liu Juntian, of course. He’s a rank two king tier, and it’s difficult for a galaxy to produce even one such king tier. I admit that the Eastern Light Galaxy or whatnot is extremely incredible, being able to produce six king tiers at once. However, I’ll eat this piece of stone if someone tells me that this small galaxy even managed to produce a rank two king tier!”

“Haha, I think the same.”

The king tiers all shook their heads, none of them confident in Ling Han’s ability to win.

What a joke. He had come from a small galaxy that didn’t even have an Eternal River Tier elite, so how could such a galaxy produce a rank two king tier?

Empress Luan Xing suddenly stood up, asking, “If my husband wins, are you people willing to eat a stone?”

Were her grace and elegance qualities that could be hidden by a mere piece of fabric? Of the people who had witnessed her true appearance, which of them didn’t treat her as the goddess of their dreams? Now that she was standing, her dress fluttered lightly in the mountain wind, making her appear like a divine celestial maiden who was about to drift away with the wind.

What did it matter that the others were king tiers? All of them involuntarily held their breaths, dazzled by her beauty.

She hadn’t shown her face, yet she was still able to intoxicate the entire crowd of king tiers. This was the charm of the empress!
