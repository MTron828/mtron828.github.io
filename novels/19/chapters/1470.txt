Chapter 1471 Petrified

“No!” The senior disciples all tilted their heads in defiance. How could they do this? They were the senior disciples! Not only had they failed to uphold the tradition, but they were even being bullied by their junior disciples now? How could they accept this?“I’m not asking for your opinions!” Ling Han said as he lashed out.

Pa, pa, pa!

He mercilessly broke their legs before forcing them to crawl through the dog flap.

When the first person crawled through, there was initially silence from behind the gates. However, shouts of delight quickly broke out.

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

Everyone was shouting Ling Han’s name, excitement and exhilaration in their voices.

Which of them wasn’t a king tier? Had they ever suffered such humiliation before? However, they were weaker than the senior disciples, so what could they do? Just a single Eternal River Tier elite was enough to suppress them all. Moreover, their backgrounds would be of no help, either. After all, the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy had 10 Saints!

However, in the blink of an eye, those haughty senior disciples were given a taste of their own medicine. They were forced to get down on all fours and crawl through the dog flap just like they had. This naturally tugged at their emotions and caused them to become incredibly excited and worked up.

At this moment, they were willing to wade through fire and water for Ling Han!

Meanwhile, the senior disciples who were crawling through the dog flap were all beet-red in the face. They were feeling incredibly stifled. However, who told them to provoke the new disciples first? They naturally had to face the consequences of their own inflammatory actions.

“It’s your turn!” Ling Han said as he looked at Yi Gaoning. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yi Gaoning gritted his teeth. He definitely couldn’t kneel. It didn’t matter as much for the other senior disciples, as they were only at the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, it wasn’t overly humiliating that they had lost against someone at the same cultivation level. However, he was different. He was an Eternal River Tier elite, and he represented the face of the older disciples.

If he crawled through the dog flap, that would be equivalent to all of the senior disciples being slapped across the face. He definitely couldn’t shoulder such a responsibility.

If he kneeled, he would become the eternal shame of the senior disciples!

“No!” Yi Gaoning was burning with fighting spirit. In order to break free from the large black dog just then, he had combusted his life force. Thus, he was brimming with energy right now, searing hot energy.

“You actually forced me to this extent... I’m going to make you pay!” he roared. Combusting his life force meant that his cultivation wouldn’t see any improvements for the next several million years, unless he obtained some Saint Level natural treasures.

He had genuinely suffered a massive loss.

He aggressively lashed out, aiming to suppress both Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing. At the very least, he had to win back some face.

“Wife, let’s beat him together!” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Sure!” the empress replied with a gentle nod.

Generally speaking, supreme king tiers like them would find it beneath themselves to team up with others and gang up on someone. However, who told Yi Gaoning to be at the Eternal River Tier? To say nothing of them two teaming up, it wouldn’t raise an eyebrow even if 100 people teamed up.

After all, could a team of 100 Heavenly Body Tier elites erase the gulf in power between them and an Eternal River Tier elite? No way!

Ling Han unleashed heaven’s might. It didn’t matter that Yi Gaoning was at the Eternal River Tier, with his power still being suppressed by two stars. After advancing to the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, Ling Han could now be considered as a pseudo-Eternal Rive Tier elite. Thus, Yi Gaoning would naturally be affected by heaven’s might.

Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing swung a brick at Yi Gaoning. This was the Absolute Beginning Stone, and it was a brick that could absorb all power as long as the said power wasn’t at the Genesis Tier. Quite simply, this was an invincible brick.

Pa, pa, pa!

The combined power of Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing was incredible.

What did it matter that Yi Gaoning had combusted his life force and advanced to the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier for the time being? His power had been suppressed by two stars, and his attacks were more so dissolved by the Tide of the Ages. For those attacks that Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing couldn’t block, wasn’t there still the Absolute Beginning Stone?

In terms of cultivation, Yi Gaoning was a king tier who possessed a tremendous advantage over his opponents. However, he was actually struggling to contain two Heavenly Body Tier cultivators? In fact, he was actually being suppressed by them instead?

The surrounding disciples could barely believe their eyes. It was as if they were in a dream.

These new disciples weren’t just impressive. Rather, they were boundlessly impressive!

Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing were flawless in their cooperation. They unleashed all kinds of powerful techniques, quickly translating their advantage into victory. They had successfully defeated and captured Yi Gaoning.

“Are you sure you don’t want to crawl through the dog flap?” Ling Han asked.

Yi Gaoning kept his mouth tightly shut. He definitely wouldn’t bow his head. At this moment, he wasn’t representing just himself.

“Little Black, come!” Ling Han said with a wave of his hand.

“Who’s calling Grandpa Dog?” the large black dog asked as he appeared from out of nowhere again. He slowly ran over, and upon discovering that it was Ling Han, he stood up on his hind legs like a human. He clasped his front paws behind his back, and said, “Brat, how audacious of you! You actually dared to call Grandpa Dog Little Black?”

“Then Big Black?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“It’s Grandpa Black!” the large black dog corrected. He then waved his paw, and said, “Brat, why did you call Grandpa Dog?”

“Think of a way to force him through the dog fl—”

The large black dog cut Ling Han off, and shouted in displeasure, “Dog your mom! That’s a rat hole!”

Ling Han was unfazed, and he continued, “Think of a way to make him crawl through!”

The large black dog was full of evil tricks, and he greatly enjoyed screwing other people over. There was a glimmer in his eyes, and he said, “Grandpa Dog is great at these things!” Judging by his excited expression, Ling Han’s request had definitely piqued his interest. In fact, even his tongue was hanging out of his mouth, with drool freely flowing down.

A cold chill shot down down Yi Gaoning’s spine.

He genuinely wasn’t afraid of Ling Han. After all, Ling Han wouldn’t dare to kill him—he was certain of this. Moreover, in just a while, many more senior disciples would naturally arrive to check on the situation. At that time, his crisis would have been eliminated.

However, this large black dog was far too depraved. Heavens knew what kind of debauched method he would use. Just thinking about this made him tremble uncontrollably.

An Eternal River Tier elite was trembling after hearing his words—the large black dog could feel very proud of this.

“Huh? Why are you trembling? Are you afraid of Grandpa Dog? You truly hurt Grandpa Dog’s heart! Grandpa Dog is so kind-hearted that I won’t even kill an ant! If anyone calls Grandpa Dog a bad person, then there definitely exists no good person in the world!” the large black dog spoke with great emotion.

However, Ling Han uncovered him from the side, saying, “Of course you’re not a bad person... After all, you’re a dog!”

“Woof! Believe me, I’ll bite you to death as well!” the large black dog threatened.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “Hurry up and give me an idea!”

“Pei! If it weren’t for you continually interrupting me, this brat would’ve been shaking in submission already!” The large black dog’s eyes darted around, and he said to Yi Gaoning, “If you don’t obey, Grandpa Dog will find a sow and then feed you some medicine. I’ll have you mate with the sow right here in front of everyone!”

Pu!

Ling Han instantly coughed and spluttered. Sure enough, this large black dog was an incredibly depraved dog. He was far too malicious. He could even concoct such a debauched idea!

Yi Gaoning was drenched in cold sweat. If he genuinely mated with a sow, would he still have the face to remain in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy? Whenever others saw him, they would “warmly” refer to him as the “Brave Sow Rider”!

“I’ve changed my mind,” the large black dog suddenly said with a shake of his head.

Yi Gaoning breathed a sigh of relief as a feeling of exhaustion washed over him.

However, the large black dog immediately said, “It’s better if I find a boar. We can have it sodomize you.”

“No!” Yi Gaoning instantly shouted in alarm. He could barely fathom this scenario.

Meanwhile, the surrounding disciples were also drenched in cold sweat. This was far too malicious. Mating with a sow was already humiliating enough. However, being sodomized by a boar? That was even worse!

Despicable dog... This dog was genuinely despicable, all the way into his bones!

“I’ll crawl! I’ll crawl through the dog flap!” Yi Gaoning’s willpower finally crumbled.

“What dog flap? You dare to insult Grandpa Dog?” The large black dog was enraged, and he lashed out with his paw, saying, “No, Grandpa Dog has changed his mind again. We’ll have you mate with 100 sows first. We’ll then have you sodomized by 100 boars. 100 times!”
