Chapter 2404: Rock Demon King

After staying a great many days in Alchemy City, Ling Han set out once more, heading towards Separation Resentment City so that he could reunite with his uncle, cousin, and the others. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

With their present strength, they naturally had a smooth journey. Even if they encountered bad people, the latter would be the ones that would be beaten. Thus, after half a year’s time, they arrived at Separation Resentment City.

On their journey, Ling Han was also consistently strengthening his level of mastery of Tenth Refinement, as well as concentrating his attention on his studies of the Celestial King Pill, concocting it in his mind more than 10 million times.

Failure definitely could not be accepted. Every single portion of ingredients was too valuable, and a single failure would be an indescribably enormous waste.

He had also imposed time effects on himself, so the time of half a year was actually around 500 years or so, allowing his grasp of Tenth Refinement to become more proficient. More or less, he would only fail once in every 100 attempts.

Yet Ling Han was still dissatisfied. His lowest standard was to fail once in every 1,000 times, and the best scenario was to fail once for every 10,000 times. Only then would he refine Celestial King Tier alchemical pills.

Celestial King Tier Great Herbs were really too valuable and rare; he could not afford the waste.

After entering Separation Resentment City, they headed directly to the desolate mountains where Yue Zhen Shan and the others had previously settled down, but when they arrived, they couldn’t help but get a shock. That was because a large town had now been built here. It was situated at the foot of the mountains, and there were various magnificent palaces halfway up the mountains and at the peaks.

Looks like Yue Zhen Shan and the others were developing like wildfire.

Ling Han and his group walked towards the town, and could see people coming in and out. There were a great many traders and servants, and they were pulling cart after cart of goods out of town. There were also cart after cart of goods being moved into town.

Ling Han and his group entering did not draw anyone’s attention. Perhaps everyone thought that they, too, were traders.

They entered the town. This place was actually exceedingly huge. If this was the Ancient Realm, it would be comparable to a large city.

Roaming around for a while, they arrived at a restaurant. This kind of place was always the most convenient location to get information.

As expected, after hearing the guests chatting, Ling Han soon found out that Yue Zhen Shan and the others had indeed gained a bit of a reputation, and had built a trade business here, but it was not a very large-scale one.

Otherwise, what Ling Han and the others saw when they came would not have been caravans, as they would be completely capable of stowing away the goods in their respective Spatial God Tools.

“Once we’re done eating, we’ll go and visit Uncle and the others.”

Ling Han and his group left the restaurant, heading up the mountains. The higher-ups here were all residing on the mountains, where there was more abundance of Spiritual Qi, which was more suited to cultivation.

However, while there weren’t any restrictions on entering and leaving the town, was it the same in the case of wanting to ascend the mountains?

“Stop right there!” Two guards immediately stopped Ling Han and his group. “This place is the forbidden land. Do you all have a permit for entry?”

Ling Han smiled, and shook his head. “No!”

“Then please return. This is not a place for sightseeing!” one of the guards stated seriously.

Ling Han asked, “What is it? Have you all occupied the mountains and declared yourselves the rulers?”

The two guards were both a little baffled. ‘Are you stupid? Don’t tell me that when you barge into the place of another and are refused entry, you will require the person to show proof that this house belonged to them?’

“Go, go, go!” They were no longer in the mood to converse with Ling Han, and chased them off directly.

Ling Han was only teasing them, and said, “Please go and inform Yue Zhen Shan or Yue Kaiyu, or Feng Po Yun or Murong Qing would do as well, and say that Ling Han has returned.”

“Ling Han?”

“Ling Han!”

The two guards were both stunned. They naturally knew who Ling Han was, but was it this guy in front of them?

They both shook their heads. “Young man, you have grasped a bit of information, and have deliberately come to impersonate him, right? Leave quickly, or when the lords come, you will not be in for anything good!”

It was mainly because Ling Han’s previous attitude had left a poor impression on them, or who knew, they would really have gone to make a report, but now? They did not believe him the slightest bit.

The women were also laughing delicately. Who asked Ling Han to enjoy speaking cheekily? Now, he was actually being looked down on by several minor characters in the Heavenly Body Tier, and they were even chasing him off.

Ling Han shook his head helplessly, and could only release a loud cry, his voice rumbling across the sky like thunder, even the heaven and earth paling.

He was close to attaining the Celestial King Tier, and had that kind of strength.

“Who is it!”

“Who dares to behave impudently in our Coiled Clouds Mountains?”

“Who is the insolent, arrogant man?”

Countless people leaped down from the many mountains, but none of them could fly. Clearly, not a single one of them was at the Severing Mundane Tier. They rapidly traversed between the mountains, and soon arrived here, gathering closely around Ling Han.

Seeing how there were more women than men in Ling Han’s group, with a seriously unbalanced ratio, and when there were a few indescribably exquisite women as well, they felt a kind of dizziness overcome them. They were too beautiful, so they had lost all other thoughts. Their only wish was to just continue looking at them forever.

However, there were definitely people with stronger wills among them, and they immediately shouted, “Who are you people? Why are you behaving with such impudence here?”

Ling Han smiled. “My name is Ling Han. I have come to visit old friends.”

When everyone heard this, they were all doubtful.

They had already heard a great many times the story of Ling Han, and admired him very much as well. But in their hearts, tens of thousands of years had already passed, so even if Ling Han returned, he would look like a middle-aged man.

This man in front of them… was younger than the majority of them. How could he possibly be Ling Han?

“You actually dare impersonate Lord Ling Han!” quite a number of people exclaimed menacingly. In their hearts and eyes, Ling Han was a god that could not condone the slightest blasphemy.

Immediately, one of the quick-tempered people moved, stabbing out with a spear that moved like a silver viper.

Ling Han casually grabbed the long spear, and smilingly asked, “Why is it just you youngsters here? Where are the lords?”

“The lords are presently discussing a serious matter— wu…” Someone who was more honest truly explained, and as a result, one of the others naturally covered his mouth.

Ling Han gave an “oh.” No wonder he had not seen Feng Po Yun and the others come out. As it turned out, they were occupied by something. It looked like what they were discussing was something very serious at that. Otherwise, they would have at least sent a few Severing Mundane Tiers here, right?

“We attack together!” a young man called out. He seemed to have great authority, as with a single command from him, they all made their moves.

Ling Han pressed down a hand casually, and the Regulations of Space surged. Everyone was bound. They still maintained the posture of preparing to attack, but could not move the slightest bit.

They were stunned. Who exactly was this? He was too powerful. He was just one person, and they were all completely restrained just with him pressing down a hand casually.

“Roar!” A roar rang out, and waves of dust appeared in the mountains, rapidly extending towards here.

“It is Lord Rock Demon King!” someone immediately exclaimed in pleased surprise. Ling Han had only restricted their ability to move, but had not prevented them from speaking.

“Haha, Lord Rock Demon King would definitely beat him to tears!”

“Just wait and you’ll be crying soon!”

The young men were all filled with anticipation. In their hearts and eyes, the Rock Demon King was practically invincible.

The dust and dirt rolled out in waves, and a stone figure was also revealed. He was rushing forth at an astonishing speed.

Close, closer!

Some young people couldn’t help but look shocked, because the Rock Demon King did not look like he was going to slow down at all. From the look of things, he was going to make a move on Ling Han directly. But they were still there. If the Rock Demon King crashed into them, they would definitely be turned into blood and mush.

Ling Han smiled, and with a flip of his hand, the people that were stuck between them were immediately separated like waves, providing an obstruction-free passageway for the rock golem.

Peng!

The rock golem suddenly crashed towards him, and everyone could feel the ground releasing a moan. This collision was really domineering and powerful.

‘Hehe, after this blow, this brat must be done for.’
