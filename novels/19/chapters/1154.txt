Chapter 1155: Unleashing Trump Cards

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Wu Zhe was naturally aware that he could only transform his arm into a Divine Sword because of the cultivate that he practiced.

However, he couldn’t channel this cultivation technique forever. If he channeled it for too long, his body would be irreparably damaged. Meanwhile, it didn’t seem like Ling Han was channeling any cultivation technique at all. It was as if his physique was innately as powerful as Godly metal.

‘This is far too terrifying!

‘Do such freaks really exist in the world?’

He took a deep breath. The might of his opponent was a bit beyond his expectations. He waved his arm-sword, and roared, “Heavens above and netherworld beneath; slay all the countless heroes in the world!”

Boom!

Sword light burst from his body, and his aura instantly soared to a new height.

‘I am the sword!’

He launched a flurry of attacks at Ling Han, each of his strikes bold and powerful. He wished to defeat Ling Han with his supreme sword intent.

Ling Han met Wu Zhe’s attacks with his finger. Since his opponent wasn’t using a God Tool, he wouldn’t use his Divine Demon Sword, either. He was going to overwhelm his opponent in every single aspect and leave him with no room for excuses.

“Suppress him!” Ling Han unleashed his divine patterns of gravity to affect his Wu Zhe’s movements.

They were at the same cultivation level right now, so Wu Zhe couldn’t avoid the fate of being affected. The only difference was how much he was affected. He staggered forward before immediately regaining his balance and continuing his attack on Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, and continued to unleash his divine patterns of gravity as he blocked Wu Zhe’s attacks with his finger. Although his divine patterns of gravity only had minimal effects, even the smallest of effects were of great significance in a battle between elites.

Indeed, Wu Zhe was extremely annoyed by the divine patterns of gravity. Although they had little effect on him, they would cause his attacks to veer slightly off course every single time. This ticked him off immensely.

During battle, one’s mental state was especially important.

However, Wu Zhe’s battle prowess was elevated to a new height after he unleashed one of his most powerful techniques, and it seemed as if he were about to turn the tables on and suppress Ling Han.

Ling Han’s pride was also like a raging fire, and he used his fingers like a sword as he activated his divine patterns of flame. Roaring flames instantly burst to life on his right hand.

These weren’t ordinary flames, but rather flames that had been formed from the Regulations of the great dao. These were flames that could incinerate even Godly metal!

Wu Zhe frowned deeply. Even he felt pressure in front of these divine flame. His opponent looked much younger than him, so how could he engrave so many Regulations of the great dao in his body?

He couldn’t lose!

Wu Zhe’s fighting spirit soared into the sky. He was one of the six kings tier prodigies, so how could he lose to others? Being defeated by the other five king tiers was not an option, either. After all, if he lost, how could he still maintain an equal status with the other king tiers?

“Duo!” He roared in a low voice, and the sound waves of his roar transformed into a sword that slashed toward Ling Han1.

Ling Han casually swung a fist at this sword.

Pa!

The sound wave sword exploded into pieces. However, a sharp pain instantly stabbed at his mind. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

‘Huh? Spiritual attack?’

Ling Han couldn’t help but click his tongue in wonder. Who would’ve thought that the sound wave attack was only a facade? The true attack had actually turned out to be a spiritual attack. However, his opponent would never guess that he had already cultivated his divine sense to an extremely powerful level. It had been tempered by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so, like his physique, it was one minor level stronger than his current cultivation level.

“What?!” A look of shock finally appeared on Wu Zhe’s face when he saw that his spiritual attack had been ineffective. He had unleashed the Perishing Shock Wave just then, which was an extremely profound spiritual attack technique. In fact, it was one of the Majestic Heaven Sect’s secret techniques.

He had only been taught this technique because he had reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier. If one didn’t reach the pinnacle level, this technique wouldn’t be taught to them, regardless of how prodigious they were.

Ling Han had only just entered the sect, so of course he hadn’t been taught the Perishing Shock Wave yet. Anyhow, even if he had learned it, it would only elevate the offensive ability of his divine sense, not the defensive ability.

Wu Zhe had roared to cover up his spiritual attack, and his opponent had taken the full brunt of this attack. However, he had come out of it completely unscathed. This was unbelievable!

‘What kind of freak is he?!’

Ling Han cracked a grin, and said, “That was a fairly good surprise attack. I’ll give you nine out of 10. I’ve deducted one point to prevent you from becoming too arrogant.”

‘F*ck! Do you really think you’re my senior brother?’

Wu Zhe’s expression became icy, and he finally retrieved a God Tool. It was a slightly damaged sword. However, it was radiating an ancient and profound aura.

“Three Clouds Three Flower Sword!” he said solemnly.

“Three Clouds Three Flower Sword!” someone shouted in astonishment.

“That’s an inherited precious treasure of the Wu Clan! According to rumors, this is a sword that was used by the ancient ancestor of the Wu Clan. Both he and his sword perished during his final battle, yet the precious sword absorbed the ancient ancestor’s soul. As such, one can comprehend the sword intent of the Wu Clan’s ancient ancestor if they cultivate with this sword.

“At that time, the Wu Clan’s ancient ancestor was a supreme elite at the Heavenly Body Tier. According to legends, he was a freakish talent who could even exchange a few blows with Eternal River Tier elites!”

“No wonder Senior Brother Wu’s sword intent is so powerful! It’s because he received the inheritance of the Three Clouds Three Flower Sword!”

This wasn’t a replica, and it was the genuine Three Clouds Three Flower Sword.

“You should be proud that you’ve forced me to use the Three Clouds Three Flower Sword!” Wu Zhe said.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Regardless of what you do, you still won’t be able to avoid defeat!”

“It’s not a good habit to make such bold claims. Be careful of slapping your own face!” Wu Zhe leaped forward, slashing with his sword as he did so. Countless clouds and flowers materialized in the air.

Ling Han felt as if he had been drawn into another world, one that was brimming with clouds and flowers. However, if he moved even just a little bit, these clouds and flowers would exude a terrifying and wicked killing intent.

Every step was thorny, and every step was dangerous!

However, Ling Han was unafraid. Even if this genuinely was a high-grade God Tool, how powerful it was would still depend on who was wielding it. Although Wu Zhe had formed five Mountains and Rivers, it was clear that he still hadn’t reached the true pinnacle yet. Thus, it was impossible for him to possess power at the Sun Moon Tier’s level.

Meanwhile, Ling Han’s physique determined that he would definitely have the last laugh. The only question was whether he won easily or won with some difficulty.

He moved his right hand and retrieved the Divine Demon Sword. A murderous aura instantly soared into the sky.

This was Devouring Metal, a metal that could evolve into Divine Metal in the future. Even though its current level was still low, it possessed immense potential. Moreover, it had been tempered by several heavenly tribulations, and thus it was engraved with Ling Han’s comprehension of dao.

One was engraved with its wielder’s dao, while the other was a damaged weapon used by someone tens of thousands of years ago. How could their affinity with their owner be the same?

A brilliant light instantly burst from the Divine Demon Sword, appearing tremendously mighty and astounding.

The Rain Emperor and Ding Ping immediately sprang up, a look of excitement on their faces.

They naturally guessed Ling Han’s identity upon seeing him retrieve the Divine Demon Sword. They also understood why he had stepped forward to challenge Wu Zhe. This was because Wu Zhe had wounded the Rain Emperor, and his tactics had more so been sly and shady.

With Ling Han’s personality of protecting his own people, how could he let such a matter slide?

Their swords clanged together, and their martial intent collided violently. Strands of divine patterns materialized in the air and transformed into chains of Regulations that fluttered in the sky.

If the Three Clouds Three Flower Sword were in its original condition, Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword would have been no match for it. After all, it was still just a “seedling” that was far from fulfilling its potential of becoming Divine Metal. However, the Three Clouds Three Flower Sword was damaged, and it would’ve been a block of useless metal had it not fused together with the soul of the Wu Clan’s ancient ancestor.

Now, however, it was evenly matched with the Divine Demon Sword.
