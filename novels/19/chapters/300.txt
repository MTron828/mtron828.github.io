Chapter 301: Who Dares to Resist

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“Brother Zhong, kill him!”

“Yes, kill him!”

“We of the Nine Nations of the Desolate North aren’t weaklings!”

The crowd was infuriated, but Cheng Fei Jun made no sound. He recognized the mark on Bao Xin Ran’s sleeve—this was a large sect’s disciple, so it wasn’t worthwhile for him to offend the latter.

Anyways, it was just Zhong He Guang, so what if he died. There were still many talents left, and it didn’t matter if there was one less or one more.

Ling Han frowned and said, “Zhong He Guang’s going to suffer.”

“Why?!” Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan asked with surprise.

“Because that little brat is already at the fifth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier!” Guang Yuan followed.

What!?

Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan revealed a shocked expression at the same time—a Spiritual Ocean Tier warrior in his twenties? No way, one couldn’t even be found in the Rain Country! Erm, recently one certainly emerged... Feng Yan was one, and Yan Tian Zhao was even younger, only fifteen!

Normally speaking, people were over thirty before they entered the Spiritual Ocean Tier... even thirty-year-old Gushing Spring Tier warriors were already not bad.

No wonder the people of the north region were so impressive; any random person that came running out was a martial arts genius?

“This fight mustn’t be fought!” Zhu Wu Jiu shot up onto his feet; this was definitely an unfair battle.

Ling Han nodded and said, “You go stop it, and have Can Ye return.”

“Yes!” Zhu Wu Jiu hurriedly left following the order, but it was already too late. Zhong He Guang was already unable to suppress his anger, lashing his whip at Bao Xin Rang. Shua , the long whip turned into a spirit snake as Origin Power surged and layers of ripples swept through the air, extremely shocking.

Bao Xin Rang simply smiled coldly and pointed with a finger on his left hand. It was strangely accurate, touching the middle of the whip, and an even stronger Origin Power surged. The long whip was instantly softened as if it had been hit at its weakest point.

Zhong He Guang was stunned. He was just about to bounce back by lashing his whip, but Bao Xin Ran already flew out. His speed was unusually fast—as his feet moved, he already appeared in front of Zhong He Guang, cracking a smile.

Zhong He Guang was extremely panic-stricken and was about to attack without his whip, but Bao Xin Ran flicked at his forehead, and with a pa , he was instantly sent flying. When he was in midair, his head fiercely exploded, red and white stuff splashing everywhere.

Hiss!

Everyone shivered as they watched; this was one of the strongest prodigies of the Nine Nations of the Desolate North, but now he was killed like a mole cricket—how could they accept this?

Frightened and trembling with fear, they started to wonder what the hell were they going to the Winter Moon Sect for if the north region was filled with such monsters. In order to enter the mountain gates, they’d definition have to experience intense competition, and anyone could casually kill them.

They came out to seek higher martial arts tiers, not to give their lives!

In that instant, the thought of retreating occured to quite a few people.

“Don’t you guys think that it’s most beautiful when a person’s brain explodes?” Bao Xin Ran said with a hint of indulgence, then changed to a chilly voice and said, “It was truly unexpected for me that you mole crickets of the Desolate North can actually be this beautiful when dying. Truly inconceivable!”

This wasn’t a complement, and it enraged everyone. However, thinking about the other party’s strength, no one dared to clamor.

“You’re not at the Gushing Spring Tier!” Yu Shui Yun said. Zhong He Guang was at the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier, and it would be impossible for anyone at the Gushing Spring Tier to kill him in two moves—only one at the Spiritual Ocean Tier had such ability.

Pa, pa, pa, pa, Bao Xin Ran started to clap his hands and said with smile, “Finally a smart one. Of course I couldn’t possibly be a Gushing Spring Tier warrior. How could a prodigy like me already at the age of twenty-five possibly be a dreg at the Gushing Spring Tier?”

“The Spiritual Ocean Tier!” everyone cried out, and became extremely furious at the same time. What was a Spiritual Ocean Tier expert coming here to sadistically kill the Gushing Spring Tier warriors trying to do?

Bao Xin Ran stepped down. Lines of fabric expanded, forming a green sign.

Martial intent manifesting outside—the mark of a Spiritual Ocean Tier.

“Sir, you’ve gone too far. A dignified Spiritual Ocean Tier expert hiding his cultivation and killing people at every turn... Don’t you think bullied us intolerably?” Bai Yu Quan said with power and resonance.

“Good! Well Said!” Everyone cheered him on. One at the Spiritual Ocean Tier shouldn’t bully people like this, and it wasn’t as if there weren’t any Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors in the Nine Nations of the Desolate North. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Bao Xin Ran picked his ear and said, “Gone too far what? I’m the same age as you guys. As for why my tier is higher and my strength surpasses you guys, this is because my talent is greater, and you’re all just dregs. As dregs, you should have the resolution of being stepped on by me.”

“Utterly detestable!”

“Go at him together, at worst few dozens will die, but we have to kill him no matter what!”

“Yes, we of the Nine Nations of the Desolate North aren’t to be trifled with!”

Bao Xin Ran’s provocations finally made everyone suppress their fear, and only endless rage remained. They had to kill this arrogant guy no mater what to vent their anger.

“Oh, kill me?” Bao Xin Ran sneered, raised his left hand high up, circled it around everyone and said, “Dregs, do you see this mark? This is the the Cold Water Sect’s sleeve mark, I am a disciple of the Cold Water Sect. Not to mention whether you guys can kill me or not, even if you pull it off, not only will you guys die, but also the families behind you will die and even your country will be destroyed!

Because I am the Cold Water Sect’s disciple, understand, you dregs!?”

Bao Xin Ran loftily placed his left hand down. “Now, which dreg is still not convinced?”

In an instant, the entire crowd lost its voice.

The Spiritual Ocean Tier was of course nothing—unified, they could still kill him while putting up a desperate fight. But the Cold Water Sect? Being called a sect meant that there was at least one Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator guarding it, and that was an unimaginable power.

Even those with great valor had to consider their families and their own country behind them. What kind of calamity would it be if they attracted a leviathan like the Cold Water Sect?

“Now, get back to your kennels. Whoever dares to leave the Fallen Moon Gorge, I’ll cut off their damn head!” Bao Xin Ran said coldly.

This time, everyone finally knew that the other party intentionally stopped them from entering the north region. At this critical juncture, there were only two possibilities... first, Bao Xin Ran didn’t want them to attend the auction tomorrow, and second, he didn’t want them to attend the Winter Moon Sect’s entrance exam.

Or both were possible.

“What are you all still so hesitant about?” Bao Xin Ran glared. His personal strength could crush them, and on top of the leviathan, the Cold Water Sect, which stood behind his back, he naturally had the confidence to be unbridled.

Damn it!

Everyone clenched their fists tightly, so tightly that their bones made a crackling sound. Were so many of them actually going to go back home with their tails between their legs just because of a youngster?

“That’s right, I think I also heard earlier that there are many hundred year ginseng and ganodermas!” Bao Xin Ran revealed a smile and greed flashed before his gaze. “Before leaving, leave all the ginseng, ganoderma, and Origin Power Crystals. If anyone dares to stash it, I’ll kill them no matter what!”

The crowd was in uproar.
