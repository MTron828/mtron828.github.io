Chapter 1421 Exhausted

in terms of a domineering mannerism, even ling han was no match for the rain emperor.

after all, the rain emperor had been born as an emperor, and he more so possessed the mind of a ruler. as such, his domineering temperament was naturally unmatched.

it was as if the rain emperor was born to be an emperor and to be transcendent above others.

under his domineering display, the remaining elites all felt numb with fear. they felt a strong urge to retreat from this battle.

this was the true might of a ruler.

“you’re but an elite who has just advanced to the consummate level. how dare you act with such arrogance!” the eternity sky emperor said in disdain. he immediately slashed with his sword.

he refused to believe that the rain emperor would be as difficult to kill as ling han!

ling han unleashed heaven’s might, while the rain emperor charged forward. the two brothers were going to work together in this manner.

peng!

just like in the past, the rain emperor unleashed his son of heaven fist technique. however, he had already elevated this fist technique to a completely new height. with a single punch, it was as if all beings under heaven were going to submit to him. with overwhelming power, this fist smashed toward the eternity sky emperor.

it was evident that although the rain emperor had obtained the inheritance of an eternal river tier elite, he still hadn’t abandoned his own path. quite the contrary, in fact. he had merely used his received inheritance to rapidly raise his cultivation level. meanwhile, he was still walking his own path.

this was the quality of a true king tier. he wouldn’t settle for repeating the path of an ancestor.

ling han had a feeling that if the rain emperor had accepted the inheritance and followed its path, he could have already advanced to the eternal river tier at this moment. however, if he had done so, he would have simply limited himself to a path that had already been taken by someone in the past. he would merely be a follower.

boom!

the attacks of the rain emperor and the eternity sky emperor collided together with a resounding rumble. the rain emperor wasn’t using a god tool, yet his attacks were far more aggressive, each punch immediately followed by another punch. he showed little care for how powerful or mighty his opponent’s god tool was.

this was his style of battle. regardless of whether his opponent was stronger or weaker than him, he definitely had to obtain an advantage in terms of demeanor and disposition.

meanwhile, ling han trained his gaze in on the jade drop emperor. the rain emperor didn’t possess a powerful defense, nor would he be able to rise from the ashes if he were killed. thus, ling han naturally couldn’t allow the two emperors to team up against him.

this was a chaotic battle between four powerful elites.

however, ling han and the rain emperor were at a clear disadvantage. this couldn’t be helped. even though the rain emperor possessed a battle prowess that could surpass six stars, his cultivation level was already at a disadvantage of three stars compared to his opponent. moreover, the eternity sky emperor was also a four-star genius. not only that, but he also wielded a god tool, and could draw on the power of the nation. even after having his battle prowess suppressed by two stars by ling han, he was still slightly more powerful than the rain emperor.

however, he was only slightly more powerful. otherwise, without the freakish physique and insane recovery ability of ling han, the rain emperor would have already been beaten into oblivion long ago.

even so, the rain emperor’s situation still wasn’t looking too good. this was because more elites had joined the battle, with several of them at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier. xu ran naturally joined as well, and he attracted the attention of one elite at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier. however, it was only one out of many.

the two brothers were both drenched in blood. although most of the attacks were blocked by ling han, the rain emperor would still be heavily wounded by those that slipped through.

ling han and the rain emperor furiously ingested alchemical pills to help their cause. however, such wanton ingestion of pills would naturally cause them to develop immunity to the effects of these pills. their recovery became slower and slower, and they were already close to exhausting all of their power.

‘do we still have any reinforcements?’

ling han shook his head. if the stone emperor and north emperor arrived and used their supreme treasures to defend against these attacks, they would naturally be invincible against anyone at the heavenly body tier. in fact, they could even withstand the attacks of eternal river tier elites for a short period of time. however, it would be useless even if he were on cloud apex planet, to say nothing of the fact that he was on joint peace planet. after all, where would he find them?

‘what to do? what to do?’

“second brother, you return first!” ling han said. he could still hold on for a short while. meanwhile, even though the rain emperor had become significantly more powerful, he was still far inferior to him when it came to defensive ability and recovery ability.

by return, ling han was obviously referring to the black tower.

“no need to hurry!” the rain emperor replied, rejecting ling han’s proposal. he knew that ling han wanted to rescue empress luan xing, and he also knew that she was one of his brother’s future wives. thus, he would fight alongside him until the last moment.

right now, he could still battle!

“humph, both of you are destined to die here!” the eternity sky emperor said with a cold chuckle.

“you two can accompany each other in the afterlife!” the jade drop emperor added, killing intent exuding from his body.

boom, boom, boom!

a dozen or so heavenly body tier elites charged over, their might overwhelming and earth-shattering.

peng!

ling han and the rain emperor were both sent flying backward, blood exploding from their bodies. they then landed heavily on the ground.

neither of them had reached the pinnacle of the heavenly body tier, so how could they withstand the attack of so many elites? being able to resist until now was already a miracle in and of itself.

the eternity sky emperor sneered coldly, and the jade drop emperor also sneered coldly. in fact, the heavenly body tier elites of the two majestic empires were all sneering coldly. only qu qiuxue, the left minister, and the others wore expressions of utter despair. they could naturally see that ling han and the rain emperor were already nearing the limits of their power.

because of a traitor, the chaotic stars majestic empire was now on the verge of death.

they couldn’t bring themselves to accept this!

ling han crawled up, and he was just about to transport the rain emperor into the black tower. right now, he couldn’t care less about revealing this secret.

however, he suddenly faltered at this moment.

tong!

the was soft beating sound, and it would have been impossible to hear it unless one had been concentrating hard enough. however, just how sensitive was ling han’s divine sense? he immediately pricked his ears.

because... this sound had come from within the small mountain!

this was the sound of a heartbeat!

previously, there hadn’t been any sound from the mountain. yet, right now, there was the sound of a heartbeat. what did this signify?

had empress luan xing exited her state of cultivation? was she about to exit seclusion?

tong!

there was another beating sound, and it was even louder this time.

boom!

a column of light exploded from the small mountain and soared into the sky.

this instantly caught everyone’s attention.

was the empress... about to exit seclusion?

the elites instantly halted their battles, all of them turning to gaze at the stone door.

peng!

the stone door was violently shattered, causing shards of broken stone to fly everywhere.

pa, pa, pa, pa!

these stone shards burst into the surroundings, their terrifying power forcing everyone to dodge or block. when this rain of stone shards finally settled, everyone saw a breathtakingly beautiful woman appear at the door of the secret room.

empress luan xing!

‘huh? why is it only her? didn’t she enter seclusion with the nine kings?’

however, upon seeing empress luan xing alone, ling han knew that she had successfully broken through. her nine clones had returned to her main body, allowing her cultivation to take another step forward.

pinnacle level of the heavenly body tier!

he breathed a sigh of relief. in fact, it wouldn’t have mattered even if empress luan xing hadn’t broken through to the pinnacle level. after all, he could easily transport her into the black tower.

“your majesty!” qu qiuxue, the left minister, and the others finally found the source of their confidence, all of them kneeling down to greet empress luan xing. none of them had ever felt so fragile and helpless before.

“empress luan xing!” the pupils of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor constricted when they saw empress luan xing appearing at the door of the secret room. this was an elite who could genuinely match their power. in fact, she had even managed to forcefully suppress the eternity sky emperor with a slab of stone before, forcing him to hand over the nine demons sword.

“humph, you’re already devoid of the power of the nation, while we can draw the power of the nation that’s at least three times more powerful than before. you stand no chance against us!” the jade drop emperor immediately said. “follow me, and i can even give my throne to you. moreover, if we team up, the entire world will one day become ours!”

“bullsh*t!” the eternity sky emperor immediately shouted. “what he can offer you, i can also offer you! in fact, i can definitely do better than him!”

at this moment, were they still two supreme emperors? they were more like two ordinary men fighting over a woman.

kuang!

before empress luan xing could even open her mouth to speak, tribulation clouds had already gathered in the sky, thunder rumbling as heavenly tribulation prepared to descend.

‘it can’t be! empress luan xing has clearly reached the consummate level already. if she faces another heavenly tribulation... gasp! eternal river tier!’
