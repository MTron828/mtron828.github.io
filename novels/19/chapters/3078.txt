3079 Fading Away, Regardless of Success or Failure

The Celestial Realm was destroyed, and the Genesis World was annihilated. Everything was engulfed by Hysteria, and all that remained was a boundless expanse of nothingness.

Seventh Tier elites were undying, so were they all going to wander in this vast and empty void forever?

“Hahahaha! Hahahaha!” Hysteria roared with laughter. It had waited for this day for far too long.

From its past life to its present life, and after experiencing the destruction of two Genesis Worlds, it had finally succeeded.

Extermination flew over, and said, “Why are you laughing like an idiot?!”

“I’ve already put up with you for too long!” Hysteria howled as it lashed out at Extermination. Right now, it had already become the Genesis World. The longer that passed, the more powerful it would become.

Before succeeding, it had still needed to rely on Extermination to hold Ling Han back. Now that it had succeeded, however, was there still any need for Extermination?

Hysteria didn’t need to share this success with anyone.

Peng!

Extermination naturally wouldn’t stand there and allow Hysteria to attack her as it pleased. She moved to block its attack, yet she was immediately sent flying.

She stabilized herself after flying 50,000 kilometers into the distance. There was a cold smile on her face, and she was surprisingly calm as she said, “I initially thought that you would remain composed for a while longer. At the very least, I didn’t expect you to turn on your ally so quickly.”

Since things had already come to this, Ling Han was no longer in a hurry like before. The Genesis World had already been engulfed by Hysteria, so Hysteria was now the new Genesis World. If one entered Hysteria’s body, they would then be subject to Hysteria’s rules.

Ling Han wanted to see what Extermination’s true purpose was. After doing so many unreasonable things to help Hysteria, just what was she truly after?

Hysteria was also slightly puzzled. Even though its body was colossal, it had indeed been a person at the very start. It was just that this person had entered their current body using their divine sense. Afterward, they had then transformed themself into a dimension.

In any case, there was nothing wrong with Hysteria’s intelligence, so it naturally realized something was off about Extermination’s attitude right now.

Firstly, why had Extermination helped it?

Hysteria didn’t care much about this, and it only cared about the outcome.

Secondly, why was Extermination completely unsurprised by its “betrayal”? Just what was she playing at?

This was clearly its previous self, yet Hysteria couldn’t help but feel extremely distant and unfamiliar with her. It felt like she was a complete stranger.

“So what if I’ve turned on you? Can you do anything about it?” Hysteria replied using its divine sense as it brandished its countless tentacles.

“Everything… is within my grasp,” Extermination replied calmly. She appeared as composed as could be.

‘Is she acting?’

Hysteria was extremely puzzled. She was at the Seventh Tier, so would she be a fool? So be it if Extermination had allied with it because it had tricked her. However, this wasn’t the case. Instead, it was Extermination who had actively chosen to ally with it.

She was definitely no fool.

The problem was, it possessed the power of the entire Genesis World right now, so who could rival it?

“Hmph! Regardless of what your plans are, they’re all futile in the face of absolute power!” Hysteria declared as it swung a tentacle at Extermination.

Only a short moment had passed, yet its power had already increased three-fold. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Origin Destroying Strike!” Extermination cried as she made a tapping motion with her finger. Her movements were ethereal and beautiful.

Weng!

A ray of light shot into Hysteria’s body, yet Extermination was also sent flying by Hysteria’s strike. If she had been an ordinary Seventh Tier elite, she would have potentially been killed by this strike.

“Hahaha! Is this your trump card?” Hysteria laughed. “Before my absolute strength, your struggles are all in vain!”

Whoosh!

It swung another tentacle at Extermination.

Extermination dodged, not facing this attack head-on.

“When the Genesis World of the last era was destroyed, countless souls and wills fused together. Within this, there was even the will of the Genesis World itself,” Extermination said. It was as if she were giving Hysteria a lesson.

However, Ling Han, Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and the others were all listening carefully. It was very likely that Extermination was about to reveal a huge secret,

“The Genesis World also has a will of its own, even though this will is extremely subtle and weak. The only information contained in this will is information regarding how the Genesis World has nurtured life,” Extermination explained. “Of course, with life also comes death.

“As for me, I’m someone who managed to obtain this information,” Extermination said as she pointed at herself. A breathtakingly beautiful smile spread across her face. “However, it’s a shame that the Genesis World of the last era was destroyed, leading to most of this information being lost as well. I was only able to grasp a small portion of it.”

She looked at Hysteria, and continued, “Coincidentally, the information I received was the secret codes of death!”

Hysteria’s expression changed drastically. This expression was also reflected on its colossal body, in the sense that the color of its skin started to change rapidly and chaotically.

Someone as powerful as Extermination definitely wouldn’t bluff.

“In addition…” Extermination continued. “You truly shouldn’t have transformed yourself into a dimension.

“You learned from the mistake of your past life, and you realized that even the destructive power of the exploding Genesis World wouldn’t be able to kill you if you transformed into a dimension.

“However, the existence of the Genesis World naturally follows its own set of Regulations. There are secret codes of life, and there are also secret codes of death. What these secret codes target… are dimensions!”

Hysteria’s tentacles started to sway again, signifying its fluctuating emotions.

Extermination looked at Ling Han, and said, “I already told you before—a new age is about to arrive. Why don’t you believe me?”

Ling Han’s expression was cold. Extermination had seemingly tricked everyone with her schemes. She had used Wang Quanhe to target Ling Han, and she had also set a trap for Hysteria long ago.

“Who exactly are you?” he asked.

“Me?” Extermination said with a faint smile. “There’s no hurry. It’s not time to reveal this secret yet.”

She looked at Hysteria, and continued, “This is the final dimension of the Genesis World. Once it’s destroyed, the door to a new world will open, allowing us to walk out of this small pond!”

Chong Yan and the others were all filled with excitement. It was because of this that they had chosen to ally with Extermination. Moreover, they would also obtain huge benefits when Hysteria died, and it was even possible that they could advance to the Eighth Tier.

“Absolute! Nonsense!” Hysteria bellowed. Its divine sense boomed into the surroundings, causing tumultuous waves to crash through the minds of the Seventh Tier elites.

It brandished its tentacles and attacked Extermination, roaring, “I’ll kill you first!”

Extermination immediately dodged its attacks. Even though she was nowhere near as powerful as Ling Han, she was also a powerful Seventh Tier elite just like Hysteria. Thus, she could dodge at least 90 percent of Hysteria’s attacks. Even when she was occasionally struck, she was more than powerful enough to withstand the attacks.

“Hysteria, since you’ve transformed into a dimension, you have no option but to abide by the rules that dictate dimensions. This won’t change even though you’ve already engulfed all of the other dimensions.

“And when we look at the life cycle of dimensions, it’s only reasonable that they eventually face destruction.”

Hysteria continued to ferociously attack her, yet before long, its body quickly started to become unstable. Rays of light started to bounce around inside its body, and it was as if they all yearned to shoot out.

Perhaps Extermination’s words were true? Perhaps Hysteria was genuinely about to be destroyed?

This was truly inconceivable. After engulfing the entire Genesis World, Hysteria should have been charging toward the peak of its life. Yet, it was at this exact moment that it passed its zenith and started to plummet.

“One, two, three, four…”

Extermination continued to count, and when she reached 59, Hysteria finally lost its power to attack. Countless rays of light crashed around inside it, causing its colossal golden body to shudder violently.

“No, I’m the most powerful and mighty being in this world! I’ve engulfed the entire Genesis World, so I’m now going to leap out of this expanse of heaven and earth!” Hysteria roared. Its divine sense fluctuated through the void.

Lin Luo and the others naturally saw everything. They were filled with astonishment. Was Extermination going to turn around and prove her innocence now?

Hysteria’s aura became increasingly unstable. At the same time, its body also started to expand. It was like a balloon that had been filled with too much air, about to explode at any moment.
