Chapter 1017: Wanting to Forge the Strongest Sword

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The two broken pieces of the ship were now like two small rafts, bearing the fortunate survivors as they floated on the huge sea.

They were trying hard to return to the marine routes of the Yang Clan. Then, only three days would be needed, at most, and they would meet with another ship from the Yang Clan and be saved.

However, they had survived a great disaster, yet they did not meet their good fortune 1 . Not long after, they encountered a stormy sea that turned them all dizzy and caused them to lose any sense of direction.

When it was calm again, Yang Tiecheng took out his compass for a look, and discovered that they were extremely far away from the normal marine routes.

There was nothing else that could be done. They could only row as much as possible to return to their original marine route.

Thankfully, all of them were elites of Immortal level, and thus there was no need to worry about problems like food and water.

Soon, night fell. Everyone took their turns to rest, but none of them dared to be too relaxed, because everyone was trying to outwit everybody else, so who would really be trustworthy among them?

At dawn, a red sun leaped out of the horizon, incredibly magnificent.

“Yi, there... there seems to be a ship!”

A black dot appeared ahead of them. Everyone focused their gazes and looked in one direction, and there indeed was something floating on the surface of the sea. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Be careful, it could be pirates!” Yang Tiecheng exclaimed.

This place was completely distanced from the marine routes of the Yang Clan’s fleet. The ships belonging to the Yang Clan would definitely not appear here unless by complete accident. Hence, the possibility that it was a pirate ship was extremely high.

“That’s not right!” Ling Han activated the Eye of Truth, and shook his head. He said, “That’s not a ship. Instead, it’s an island.”

The reason why it looked like a ship was because this island was too far away from them.

“An island!”

Everyone felt invigorated. If they got on the island, they would be able to reorganize. At least, they could make a few real oars, or they could even create a sail. It would be better than now, at least.

They rowed once more to advance. After quite a long while of rowing, that island was also becoming gradually bigger in front of their eyes, and finally, they could see it clearly. That was indeed an island, and it was a very big one.

This stunned quite a few of them. How could Ling Han’s sight be so good?

Another long while passed, and they finally landed on the beach.

“We’ll move separately. One day later, we will gather back here. We will collect all materials that can be used,” Yang Tiecheng said. He stored away the two broken pieces of his ship to prevent anyone from leaving by themselves and leaving everyone else on the island.

Ability-wise, he was the strongest. He was also the “captain”, so naturally, he would be the one calling the shots. Furthermore, he was more trustworthy. Otherwise, it didn’t matter who got ahold of these two “boats”, for the others would not be at ease.

Luo Wu and Fan Yong exchanged a look. After their “shared trial”, they had formed an alliance. Now that everyone was moving separately, they naturally had their eye on Ling Han.

Unfortunately, Yang Tiecheng chose to go with Ling Han, which caused the duo’s plan to tail and kill him secretly to completely fizzle out.

Actually, Ling Han was feeling a bit sorry too. He still had the Crimson Ground Locking Net which he had not used yet, so even against a cultivator in the high extreme, he would be unafraid. Moreover, he could stun his opponent with the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique, and draw them into the Black Tower, so he was assured of victory against any cultivator in the high extreme.

This island was very big, and had a narrow, elongated shape. They were now at about one-third of the island. Hence, they separated into two groups. One group would head east, while the other group would head west.

The island was covered with dense jungle, and each tree was at least 300 meters tall, with huge leaves. Hence, if one were to walk underneath the trees, there was practically no light that could penetrate the canopy, making it appear extremely spooky.

Ling Han’s group had six people. Aside from himself and Shui Yanyu, there was also Yang Tiecheng, Yin Yuanxiang, Fu Tian, and Jin Zhihui.

Very obviously, Yang Tiecheng had separated Ling Han from his enemies.

“Brother Jin, you keep holding onto a sword, don’t you feel tired?” Ling Han asked the young man who was hugging his sword after they had set out.

Jin Zhihui shook his head, and replied, “Only when I experience the feelings of the sword at all times would I be able to forge an excellent sword!”

Was he a sword maniac?

Shui Yanyu suddenly twitched slightly, and asked, “Could it be... Brother Jin comes from the Swordforge Manor?”

If it was another man, being the focus of attention from a seductive beauty like Shui Yanyu, he would probably be completely dizzy with ecstasy. However, Jin Zhihui did not have the slightest bit of reaction. He merely hugged his sword as if it was his true love.

“Indeed, I do come from the Swordforge Manor,” he answered with a nod, appearing not to have the slightest bit of subtlety.

“As expected!” Shui Yanyu nodded. All members of the Swordforge Manor had the surname Jin.

“What Swordforge Manor?” Ling Han asked.

“The Swordforge Manor is the most acclaimed holy land of weaponsmiths on the Joint Peace Planet. However, this Manor only forges swords, and does not forge any other types of weapons. The blades they forge are not only sharp and sturdy, quite a number of them also has their own unique attributes,” Shui Yanyu explained. “Every swordsman would be proud of having a sword from the Swordforge Manor.”

So awesome?

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile and ask, “Brother Jin, if I obtain the materials in the future, can I ask you to forge my sword?”

Yang Tiecheng couldn’t help but shake his head. He had naturally heard of the Swordforge Manor, and also knew that the people from this Manor were very strange. They were obviously famous all over the world, yet did not care the slightest bit about money or power. They were too busy forging their swords.

However, though they enjoyed forging swords, it was up to their mood whom they would be willing to forge a sword for. Some had paid astronomical amounts and it was still useless, whereas some people needed not pay a single cent and would be gifted a sword of their own.

Since Ling Han had spoken so rashly like this, he was probably going to meet with a merciless refusal from Jin Zhihui.

“Okay!” Jin Zhihui said, nodding without hesitation.

Pu!

Yang Tiecheng almost choked. Wasn’t it said that everyone from the Swordforge Manor had weird temperaments? How could he have agreed so easily?

Jin Zhihui scratched his head, and said a bit shyly, “However, I have not forged a single sword yet.”

F***!

No wonder he had agreed so readily; he should only be an apprentice.

Yet Ling Han laughed loudly, and clapped a hand on his shoulder, and said, “Then, it’s decided. In the future, my sword will be up to you.”

“Are you not afraid I will waste your materials?” Jin Zhihui asked in surprise. When others heard him say this, they were likely to shake their heads directly. Even those who gave him some face would change the topic and no longer speak of the matter of forging a sword.

Ling Han said, “With what you said earlier about wanting to experience the feelings of a sword, I am certain you can forge an excellent, supreme sword!”

Jin Zhihui couldn’t help but feel excited. Even in the Swordforge Manor, he had never gotten the approval of a single person. Even his father merely advised him not to daydream. Only this man in front of him approved of it.

Most importantly, though his idea of experiencing the feelings of a sword was something he’d said himself, hearing it from Ling Han’s mouth gave him the feeling like he had encountered an intimate friend.

“All right. In the future, I will definitely forge a supreme sword for you!” He clenched his fists, his eyes shining.

Previously, he had spoken little, but now it seemed like his vocal box had been opened. He thought of Ling Han as an intimate friend, and spoke endlessly.

“Brother Ling, I want to forge the strongest sword in this world!” he exclaimed.
