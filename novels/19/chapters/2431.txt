Chapter 2432: Clash of Celestial Tools

Yu Wudi was greatly astonished.

The appearance of the Empress had already surprised him greatly. Now, however, another young woman who could rival the Empress had actually appeared? He was naturally as astonished as could be.

These prodigies… There were far too many of them, no?

He was supremely confident in himself, and he regarded himself as a peerless individual with no rivals. Fortunately, the Empress was a woman, and she was more so breathtakingly beautiful and noble. This satisfied him greatly. If he took her as his wife, wouldn’t they then become a family?

And now, another had come?

Fortunately, this was also a woman.

He unleashed a roar as he swung his fists and met their attacks. He didn’t fear them at all.

Peng, peng, peng!

The three of them became locked in an intense battle.

With just a single glance, Ling Han could already confirm that their battle prowess was all around 4800 points. Among Pseudo-Celestial Kings, this was already an outstanding result. In fact, it was only because they were monarch stars that they could reach this height. Thus, neither side could gain an advantage over the other. If Yu Wudi summoned a Celestial Tool or whatnot, perhaps he would immediately achieve victory.

However, Yu Wudi kept refraining from unleashing a trump card. He continued to exchange blows with the two women.

However, how could this rival the combined power of the Empress and Hu Niu?

Yu Wudi gradually fell to a disadvantage.

‘This…!’

Everyone was rendered speechless with shock. Just then, Yu Wudi had been extremely domineering, even managing to persuade the Splendor Celestial King to leave. Now, however, he was actually on the back foot!

Even though the two women had teamed up, if their strength weren’t up to par, there was no way they could have achieved this. If they weren’t powerful enough, even dozens or hundreds of them wouldn’t have been enough!

Heavens! Just how many supreme freaks were on the Celestial Path?

Even though Yu Wudi was on the back foot, he didn’t show any signs of panic at all. Instead, he roared with laughter, appearing wild and domineering. At this moment, he finally retrieved some Crimson Demonic Earth, ingesting it with a gulp. A devastating aura instantly shook the surroundings. He was about to ascend to a new height.

The Empress and Hu Niu didn’t dare to underestimate him. They both hurriedly retrieved and ingested Crimson Demonic Earth. In this world, only Ling Han would be capable of battling against Celestial King Tier elites without ingesting Crimson Demonic Earth.

Boom!

The auras of the three people were like a tsunami, and it was as if they were all going to ascend to the Celestial King Tier.

They continued to do battle.

Regardless of how powerful they had been just then, they had all been slightly short of reaching the Celestial King Tier. After ingesting the Crimson Demonic Earth, however, it would still be impossible for their Vitality Index to surpass 5000. In other words, the greater one’s battle prowess, the smaller the buff provided by the Crimson Demonic Earth.

The battle prowess of the three people had all been 4800 to begin with, so theoretically speaking, this number should have exceeded 5000 after ingesting the Crimson Demonic Earth. Thus, their battle prowess was all identical at this moment.

They were all at 4999.

Fighting two against one, the Empress and Hu Niu naturally possessed the upper hand. They were in full control of the battle.

“Detestable!” Yu Wudi roared. A purple streak suddenly rushed toward him.

Whoosh!

The Empress and Hu Niu were instantly pushed back.

This was a golden-purple staff that was decorated with symbols. It radiated with an aura of age, yet it more so unleashed a sense of profound pressure. It was as if a paramount Celestial King were about to step out from within the staff, crushing all opponents in his way.

Celestial Tool!

This was definitely a Celestial Tool. Moreover, it was a Celestial Tool forged by a high-level Celestial King. Perhaps it couldn’t unleash its full might in Yu Wudi’s hands, but it would still be more than powerful enough to stun Pseudo-Celestial Kings. They wouldn’t dare to cross this Celestial Tool rashly.

Hu Niu humphed, and said, “How shameless! You can’t defeat us, so you’re summoning a Celestial Tool! Niu looks down on you!”

Everyone was rendered speechless. They had already broken the rules by challenging him two-on-one, yet she was now admonishing him for using a Celestial Tool? However, the Empress and Hu Niu were far too beautiful, so beautiful that no one could bring themselves to blame them. They could only feel that this young lady was adorable and mischievous, and they all stood behind her in support.

“Indeed! As a man, you actually need to rely on a weapon? Is this anything to be proud of?”

“And it’s even a Celestial Tool!”

“I look down on you!”

“How disdainful!”

Yu Wudi was about to explode in anger.

‘Why don’t you people try to battle against two people who are just as powerful as you?!’

If he could rival them, he naturally wouldn’t have wanted to summon a Celestial Tool! F*ck! This was a bunch of armchair commentators!

Ling Han also frowned upon seeing this. The Empress and Hu Niu were just a step away from advancing to the Celestial King Tier. It was indeed time for him to equip them with Celestial Tools. Otherwise, if they came across opponents who were armed with Celestial Tools, they would definitely be at a huge disadvantage. At the very least, they would be extremely limited in how they could fight.

‘The next time I obtain Celestial Tools and Divine Metal, I won’t feed it to the Divine Demon Sword,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

“Ugly woman, move aside! Let Niu deal with him!” Hu Niu said to the Empress. If they fought one-on-one, Yu Wudi would most likely be too proud to use a weapon. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, the Empress completely ignored Hu Niu. Instead, she reached over to Ling Han.

Ling Han understood what she wanted, and with a shake of his arm, he immediately tossed the Divine Demon Sword toward her.

The Empress caught the sword. She then turned around to glance at Hu Niu, saying, “Little girl, don’t stand here and block me!”

“Wayaya!” Hu Niu stomped her feet in anger. This woman was far too despicable!

Everyone was rendered speechless by this scene. Just then, the two women had still been fighting side-by-side. Now, however, they were actually arguing with each other. Were they sure they weren’t messing around?

Hu Niu angrily left the battlefield. With their strengths identical, the situation would become far too dangerous for her if everyone else had a Celestial Tool. She was truly eager for battle, and she was truly eager to play. However, she wasn’t stupid at all.

“Ling Han, Niu also wants a Celestial Tool!” Hu Niu said as she clung to Ling Han’s arm and made eyes at him.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel goosebumps. It was fine if Hu Niu tried to come off as pure and innocent as she simply needed to be herself. However, her trying to act seductive was truly a frightening scene. He patted her small cheek, and said, “Alright, the next time I obtain a Celestial Tool or Divine Metal, I’ll definitely forge one for you.”

Only upon hearing this did Hu Niu nod in satisfaction. She continued to hug Ling Han’s arm, an expression of happiness on her face.

The surrounding people were all filled with envy. Even though Hu Niu seemed slightly unreliable, just how beautiful was she? Moreover, they had all witnessed her strength just then. She had yet to reach the Celestial King Tier, yet she already possessed strength that could rival Celestial Kings!

To be partners with such a beauty… How could they not be envious and jealous?

Ling Han simply wore a faint smile as he endearingly patted Hu Niu’s head. He then turned his attention to the sky, where the intense battle between the Empress and Yu Wudi had begun.

Clang, clang, clang!

The Celestial Tools clashed, unleashing bursts of blinding light. Moreover, the collisions were so loud that they were about to burst everyone’s eardrums.

Others couldn’t see clearly, but Ling Han didn’t have any trouble at all. This was because his Body Arts were far too powerful.

The Empress hadn’t gained an upper hand. However, she hadn’t been pushed to her back foot, either. Their battle prowess was far too close, and they more so both possessed Celestial Tools. Thus, victory would simply be decided by their performance.

It wasn’t long before they exchanged 1000 blows. At this moment, both their auras started to weaken.

The effects of the Crimson Demonic Earth were about to pass.

They both retreated 300 meters, taking a short break from battle.

“Celestial maiden, there’s no animosity between us, and we’ve already sparred our fill. Why don’t we shake hands and talk peace? How about we discuss cultivation over some tea?” Yu Wudi said as he wore what he believed to be his most dazzling smile.

The more he looked at the Empress, the more he liked her.

However, the Empress wore an ice-cold expression as she pointed at Ling Han, and said, “Kowtow and apologize to my husband. Then I can consider allowing you to die a more painless death.”

Gasp!

Everyone gasped upon hearing this. This woman was far too domineering!

However, they quickly realized that this aura of dominance was a perfect match for her disposition.

Yu Wudi wore a confused expression. Since when had he offended her husband? However, after some careful thought, he immediately came to a realization. He wore a baleful expression as he looked toward Ling Han, saying, “So, it turns out that you’re Ling Han!”
