Chapter 1577: Becoming a target again

Ling Han looked at the five of them with a smile, and replied, “That’s right. I am Ling Han. Do you all have some business with me?”

“Hoho, nothing much. We just wanted to see what right a guy who is merely in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier has to become an elder!” a young man retorted smilingly, yet there was a clear disdain in his tone.

He wore a black plated armor which had spikes protruding from it, appearing very sinister.

He was an Eternal River Tier, but his aura’s strength had far surpassed an ordinary person in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. It seemed like he only had to blow out lightly, and he would be able to kill a few hundred to more than a thousand people in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier with his mere breath.

His strength far surpassed that of Mo Li, Zhu Ba, and the others. He was definitely capable of being on equal level with Tan Mo.

Pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, and it was possible that he had formed as many as 2,000,000 stars.

Ling Han couldn’t help but nod internally. As expected of a prodigy that had walked out from a Forbidden Land; he was indeed amazing. Furthermore, Ouyang Taishan had said previously that Mo Li was not qualified enough to come here, and there was indeed some logic to his words. Merely this person was enough to overwhelm her who knew how many times over.

“Thankfully, you did not actually become one, or it would be a humongous joke!” Another person laughed raucously. His aura was not in the slightest bit inferior to that of the young man in the plated armor from before. Deep disdain for Ling Han was clearly written all over his face.

“Just scram quickly!” A third young man did not smile, but his whole expression was cold. “You are completely unworthy of standing on equal level with us. This is practically dragging down our overall level!”

The remaining two merely crossed their arms over their chests, looking completely at ease and carefree, as if they were there just to watch the excitement.

“A bunch of smelly bugs!” The Empress was furious. She pointed at the five of them, her face filled with menacing killing intent. They actually dared to insult her Ling Han!

‘Hmm?’

The five of them took one look at the Empress, and couldn’t help but look stunned. Even if they were prodigies of the current generation, so what? In front of the Empress’s charms, they were still like little boys that had just had their first contact with the affairs of the heart, completely at a loss what to do.

There was actually such an exquisitely beautiful woman in this world. Not only was she beautiful, she also had a noble bearing, as if whatever she said was right; others would willingly submit and obey her.

This clearly was not something prodigies should do, yet the five of them did not want to free themselves, and were willing to bow at the feet of the Empress. Even if they could only kiss her shoes, they would have deemed having lived their life’s worth.

However, king tiers were king tiers, after all. The five of them forcibly withdrew their uncontrollable hearts, and didn’t even dare take another look at the Empress, fearing that they would completely fall for her.

“How about this? We will not make things difficult for you. As long as you can take three moves from me, we will not chase you out. As long as you crawl between our legs, we will allow you to stay here,” the first young man in plated armor said.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily turned cold. He knew that when one entered a new place, there would definitely be the phenomenon of bullying new people. However, hearing the words of this young man, he was still slightly angered.

“You all should die!” The Empress was the first to fly into a rage, and moved to attack the five of them.

Boom, her abilities were outstanding in the first place, and added with the fact that she had merged the Regulations of two Realms at present, she had reached the peak of the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Her battle prowess was really extremely powerful, and she would even prove to be a match for the peak of the consummate level.

What was unfortunate was the five of them had also cultivated to the pinnacle level, and it was not the ordinary pinnacle level, either. They possessed more than 2,000,000 stars, and could be considered big shots even among big shots.

In a one-on-one battle, the Empress could not possibly win, what more when it was one against five now. Thankfully, the five of them were “protective of the fairer sex”, and only dodged her attacks and did not fight back. Otherwise, the Empress would very likely be suppressed with a single move.

“Wife, ignore them!” Ling Han said, smiling.

The Empress stopped, and cast a proud, disdainful eye over the five of them. Only then did she slowly return, and when she arrived by Ling Han’s side, she immediately became cute and seemingly helpless, as gentle as water.

The eyes of the armored young man and the others all became bloodshot with envy; what part of them was inferior to Ling Han? Yet why was such an exquisite beauty disdainful of even casting a second look at them?

Ling Han looked at the five of them, and said, “If you’re itching to be beaten, I can teach you guys a lesson. However, I don’t have that kind of free time now. Go on and wash yourselves clean, and three years later, I will definitely thrash your behinds!”

‘This...!’

The five of them were furious. ‘You are a little too arrogant, aren’t you?’

“Want to make a move?” Ling Han scoffed. “Don’t think that I don’t know the rules. If you guys force me into a spar just because your cultivation levels are higher, you will have to suffer serious punishment.”

Their expressions stiffened. They had rushed so quickly over because they wanted to bully Ling Han while he was still unaware of the rules here, and threaten him a bit. If they scared him too badly, Ling Han would become completely humiliated. How would he be able to take the position of elder in the future then?

But they had not thought that Ling Han would actually be so slippery, being familiar with the rules even when he had just barely arrived.

“Don’t stand in the way and be an irritant. Don’t tell me that you guys have cultivated so much that you don’t even know how to be human anymore, and want to be dogs instead[1]?” Ling Han said coldly.

The five of them exchanged a look, yet they slowly cleared the path, allowing Ling Han and the Empress to leave.

They watched the figures of Ling Han and the Empress disappear into the distance, expressions of fury on their faces.

“Are we going to let him go just like that? Then we will become a joke!”

“It’s all right. Two years later will be the ranking competition that is held every 10 years. We will each make a request of our respective seniors to arrange for us to be in that brat’s group. There will definitely be at least one among us who will come up against him.”

“Haha, at that time, I will definitely make him wail and weep in despair.”

“A mere Eternal River Tier, who is an outsider at the same time, actually wants to have a share of the treasures that have been passed down by our ancestors? What wishful thinking!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The five of them all smirked coldly.

The Green River Valley was very big, and the river flowed continuously as if there was no end to it. Even Ling Han and the Empress walked close to 10 days to finally reach a place where there was no further path ahead of them. In this place, the green river surged into empty space, and there was no way to take one step further ahead of them.

This was a small world, a Mystery Realm, and not the real world.

“Let’s go back.”

The two of them returned to their stone chamber. Soon, someone came and gave them a spatial ring. The cultivation resources that Ling Han would need for one year were contained within.

This was really generous. It was practically as if high-grade alchemical pills were completely free. It was enough to make anyone below Genesis Tier go crazy.

Yet Ling Han did not care too much. He gave all these alchemical pills to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, while he himself continued to study a new alchemical pill. He was already close to succeeding. He only had to successfully concoct an alchemical pill that could increase his Origin Power, and Empress Luan Xing’s and his cultivation level would see a booming advance.

Time passed, one day after another. A year later, Small Tower had completed the upgrade to the Reincarnation Tree, so meditating one day under the tree would now allow one to spend as much as 10 years’ time!

This was really much too important for Ling Han.

A mere three days later, he had already created a brand-new pill recipe.

He began to attempt concoction. Because he knew pharmacology like the back of his hand, and was also inside the Black Tower, he succeeded at this first attempt. However, though the alchemical pill had indeed been successfully concocted, its effects were not completely up to his expectations.

“It is really too far from my needs. What exactly am I missing here?” Ling Han went into deep thought, and pondered furiously on how he could improve the alchemical pill beneath the Reincarnation Tree.
