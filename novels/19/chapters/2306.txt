Chapter 2307 Attack

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Why not?”

Wasn’t this person always talking about fair exchange?

Wally replied, “This is related to my survival.”

In other words, he wouldn’t ask for payment if the matters were related to him. These were categorized as doing things for himself.

“Then please go ahead,” Ling Han said as he pointed at Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others.

Wally nodded before stepping forward as requested. He extended a hand, and his fingers suddenly separated, becoming thinner and transforming into thousands of threads. These threads then landed on Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others’ bodies, causing them to glow. The thin threads also glowed, and it was as if something were being drawn out from Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others’ bodies.

Ling Han looked carefully, and he could seemingly see numerous scenes coursing through the thin threads. These scenes were all related to Wally.

This was truly mysterious. Wally had removed their memories of him just like that?

After a while, Wally finished up, and said, “All done.”

He retrieved the thin threads, and his fingers returned to normal.

Ling Han was extremely curious. Just how powerful was Wally?

“Let’s go.” After pondering for a moment, he ultimately decided to leave first. Otherwise, he was truly worried that the environment would affect them if they stayed for too long.

They walked toward the soaring column of light. With a flash, they left the cavern.

“This…” Ling Han observed his surroundings. “Sure enough, we’ve been teleported away. This place is around 150 kilometers from the entrance.”

He shook his hand, waking Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others.

After waking up, they immediately adopted a defensive stance. This was the basic instinct of all cultivators.

“Where is this?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Why are we here?”

“What in the world happened?”

They all exclaimed in astonishment.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “We came across a powerful enemy, and all of you were knocked unconscious. After much difficulty and struggle, I finally managed to rescue all of you.”

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others were all slightly skeptical. In their memories, they had been exploring the Holy Mountain, and they seemingly entered an underground river. Their memories then stopped here.

They had come across an enemy?

They had no recollection at all!

Celestial Maiden Yunhe looked at Wally, and asked, “Who is he?” Right now, Wally was exuding the unique aura of a cultivator from the Foreign Realm. This aura was called Spiritual Power, and it was different from the auras of the Celestial Realm and the Dark Inverse Realm.

One heaven and earth could only contain one cultivation system.

“Oh, he’s just a passerby. He happened to pass by just now, and we coincidentally crossed paths, so I invited him over for a chat. We’re from the same race, after all,” Ling Han replied with a chuckle.

‘Whom are you kidding?’ Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others naturally didn’t believe him. Ling Han didn’t show any sense of belonging to his own race, and he would pummel and kill them on a whim. Moreover, the Demon Race encompassed so many people, so how could he suddenly feel so amicable toward a random one?

Not to mention, it was possible for people to remain cold and aloof even toward those who were from the same clan.

Ling Han paid no heed to whether they believed him. He had already made an excuse, so it was their choice whether they believed it or not.

“Ah, that’s right, the secret of the precious armor!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others exclaimed

“You guys still want to go in?” Ling Han shrugged his shoulders, and said, “I’m not going back to that godforsaken place.”

Indeed, he had already obtained the two Ancestral King corpses, and Wally had also followed him out. What was the point of going back in?

The others weren’t aware of this, yet they could all recall the uncanny suppression of that place. Their lifespan was limited, and they could also experience hunger and starvation. Because of this, they had even been scammed of many Celestial medicines by Ling Han. Just thinking about this made their hearts ache.

They all stared at Ling Han in resentment. This man was truly full of tricks.

As shameless as Ling Han was, he still couldn’t help but blush slightly in embarrassment. “Why are you all staring at me? There’s no flower on my face.”

He turned around and started to leave. He truly didn’t want to be the subject of their strong gazes.

Even though Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others didn’t want to give up on the secrets of the precious armor, they understood that their power was limited. If they entered again, they very likely wouldn’t be able to make it out alive. Thus, they were better off reporting this information to the academy, which would most likely dispatch Ancestral King elites.

In any case, reporting this piece of important information would already be a huge contribution.

With this in mind, they felt much more at ease as they set off to return. Sometimes, trying to bite off more than one could chew would only result in death.

Anyhow, they were extremely curious about how Ling Han had made it out. However, Ling Han always skirted the topic, making up excuses to avoid giving an answer. Several months passed, and they finally arrived back at the Hundred Battles Academy. As their representative, Celestial Maiden Yunhe immediately headed over to report this matter to the academy. War Soldiers had actually appeared in the Foreign Realm?

This startled the higher-ups of the academy. They called Ling Han and the others over, questioning them one by one. Everyone’s account of the situation was similar, apart from the fact that Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others were all missing the part of the memory from when they had entered the underground river to when they had exited the cavern. Meanwhile, Ling Han claimed that he had fled with Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others, and they had eventually discovered a Transfer-Formation-like mechanism at the end of the underground river. They had then used this to escape.

This was an easily believable excuse. After all, there were War Soldiers in that area, with several of them being extraordinarily powerful. As such, it wasn’t strange that Ling Han and the others were forced to flee.

The academy naturally formed a resolution about this. However, Ling Han and the others didn’t have the authority to know. In any case, if there were any huge discoveries, they would naturally be rewarded.

Anyhow, after discovering that they had lost over 100 years’ worth of memories, Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others couldn’t help but feel suspicious. Just how severely wounded had they been? They had actually remained unconscious for that long?

However, Ling Han was adamant that this was the case, and they couldn’t prove otherwise. After all, Ling Han’s powerful nature was still clear in their memories.

Wally also entered the academy. He kept a very low profile, and he only exhibited the talent of a king tier. His cultivation level was also set at the Sixth Lotus. Ling Han naturally didn’t believe this.

Right now, he was cultivating and deciding to advance to the Immortal Palace Tier after a few days. However, a significant commotion suddenly swept through the Demon Quarters.

He walked out, only to see the shock waves of battle in the distance.

‘Hmm? Regulations of Light?’

Ling Han squinted his eyes. It was common for demons to battle against each other since the Demon Race was a naturally combative race. As long as these battles didn’t result in disability or death, the academy wouldn’t stop them, either. Now, however, it was members of the Angel Race that were attacking. This was a rare sight.

With the might of the Heavenly Venerates from both sides suppressing them, there was seldom any conflict between the two races, even though they weren’t on friendly terms. Conflicts in the academy were even rarer.

Ling Han walked over, planning to observe the situation.

Three angels had entered the Demon Quarters. They were grossly outnumbered. However, they weren’t weak at all, and they were relaxed as they continued to advance. The demons were completely unable to stop them. “Brother, what’s going on?” Ling Han asked the demon beside him.

“These bastards are here to capture someone,” the demon replied.

“Capture whom?” Ling Han asked. “Someone called Ba,” the demon replied without turning around to look at him. “Even though I don’t know how Ba offended them, it’s preposterous for angels to charge into the Demon Quarters, even if they’re Wu Ya and Xun Feng!”

Ling Han was astonished. The culprit was actually himself?

‘Wu Ya and Xun Feng?’

They were both at the Eighth Lotus. Moreover, disregarding You Yuan, they were the most powerful members of the Angel Quarters.

“You Yuan didn’t come?” he asked.

“You Yuan…!” The demon shuddered upon hearing this. This was a name that instilled respect and reverence into everyone’s mind. It was because of him that the Hundred Battles Academy had managed to place 72nd out of the 1000 academies.

Even the Demon Race couldn’t help but feel respect and reverence toward this person.
