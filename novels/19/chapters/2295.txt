Chapter 2296: Tempted

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Upon appearing in heaven and earth, the Divine Demon Sword pulsed with a chilling glimmer, and radiated with an overwhelming murderous aura.

Ling Han roared as he charged forward with sword in hand.

The giant insect was unaware of the Divine Demon Sword’s might, so it was fearless as it faced Ling Han’s attack head-on. Its shell was indeed hard to crack. Without weapons, those at the same cultivation level would be unable to wound it.

Ling Han slashed down, causing a brilliant sword light to soar into the air. It was as if he were opening the sky.

Pu!

The sword light sank into the giant insect’s body, piercing it from one end and leaving from the other. Its radiance illuminated the sky.

Ling Han dashed past, and the body of the large insect was immediately separated into two. Green blood sprayed through the air as its life force was extinguished.

Everyone was speechless with shock. What was going on? Ling Han had clearly been at an absolute disadvantage, yet he had instantly turned the tables after retrieving his sword? In fact, he had achieved victory ina single strike? This was simply unfathomable!

Moreover, Ling Han was only at the Fifth Leaf of the Sixth Lotus, yet he could kill an opponent at the Fourth Leaf of the Seventh Lotus in the blink of an eye! Was the cultivation level limit still effective against him? Even the iron rule of the cultivation world had become trash!

Ling Han swung his sword several more times, dismembering the giant insect. He found a fist-sized emerald-green orb in its heart.

This was the core of the giant insect’s power, and he could extract the power from within it. As for the insect’s flesh, Ling Han and the others naturally wouldn’t consider it. They wouldn’t touch it unless they were starving to death.

“Brother Ba… how impressive!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe was rendered speechless. This person’s might had already reached an indescribable level. And that sword… It had destroyed the insect’s tough shell in a single slash. It was also unbelievably powerful.

“This sword is incredible!’ they all exclaimed in their minds.

‘When Ling Han drew the sword, they all felt a mysterious chill running down their spines. It was as if their skin were being sliced. Their hearts thumped, and their bodies shuddered.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “We can climb the mountain now.”

He was the first to set off, closely followed by the Empress and the others. They were already accustomed to Ling Han’s freakish power. As for the others, they were still feeling dazed as they blankly followed after Ling Han. They were like mindless puppets being dragged along by a string.

Even though Celestial Maiden Yunhe was following Ling Han, she was so dazed that she didn’t know where she was placing her feet as she walked.

There was only Ling Han in her eyes. Even though this demon was extremely ugly and as crude as a pig, she truly couldn’t deny his talent in cultivation.

Monarch tiers at the Fifth Leaf of the Sixth Lotus could at most only rival or defeat those at the First Leaf of the Seventh Lotus. If they came across someone at the Second Leaf of the Seventh Lotus, their only fate would be defeat. This was an iron rule. This was the advantage of one major tier.

However, not only could Ling Han easily defeat those at the Second Leaf and Third Leaf of the Seventh Lotus, he had even managed to kill an insect at the Fourth Leaf of the Seventh Lotus with a single slash.

His immense power caused her heart to flutter.

How could monarch tiers be so powerful? In fact, even monarch stars weren’t so powerful. After all, could a monarch star at the Ninth Leaf of the Seventh Lotus defeat someone at the Fourth Leaf of the Eighth Lotus? This was not to mention achieving victory in a single strike.

She was a prodigious woman, so her standards were naturally as high as could be. Only monarch stars could tempt her heart. However, if they truly courted her, she would still be reserved and consider their character first.

Now, however, her body couldn’t help but feel hot with excitement whenever she thought about Ling Han’s power. A mysterious current of warmth flowed through her body, and she could barely stop herself from leaping into his embrace. She wanted to experience his passionate kiss, his rough fondling,

and even the weight of his body on hers as he forcefully

She suddenly jolted awake. She had actually become such a pervert! ‘That’s a detestable demon! He’s as ugly as a pig! Look at that crimson-red skin, those terrible horns, those strong arms… If he embraces me, I’ll definitely be filled with a sense of safety…”

Pei! Pei! Pei!

Celestial Maiden Yunhe hurriedly clasped her head with her hands. Her thoughts had wandered off again!

She sighed in her mind. Unfortunately, she had fallen for this barbaric man from the Demon Race.

They set off for the Holy Mountain. However, their journey was destined to be troublesome, and they quickly came across a golden bear. It was only 30 centimeters tall, and it looked incredibly adorable. However, it was extremely vicious, and it immediately swung its claws upon seeing them. A projection

of its claws became tangible as it slashed toward them like a blade.

However, the cultivation of this golden bear wasn’t high, and it was eventually defeated by Bewitching Maiden Rou. However, she didn’t kill it, and she instead planned to take it as a pet.

Afterward, they came across a holy deer. This beast had the lower body of a deer and the upper body of a human. Its strength was astonishing, and even after retrieving his Divine Demon Sword, Ling Han was still unable to defeat it. In the end, they could only flee in disarray.

The gulf between their cultivation had been far too large. As a result, even Ling Han had been helpless.

After they fled for three days and three nights, the holy deer finally gave up on its pursuit. With a flap of its wings, it started flying back to where it had come from.

“Stinky deer! Niu is definitely going to eat you!” Hu Niu shouted in anger.

Ling Han wiped the cold sweat from his brow. The Divine Demon Sword wasn’t omnipotent. The holy deer had been far too powerful, giving him no chance to strike it with his sword. Thus, the Divine Demon Sword was useless regardless of how powerful it was.

Of course, this was unless the level of the Divine Demon Sword equaled or even surpassed that of the holy deer. At that time, killing it would be like killing a chicken.

Otherwise, weapons would only be inanimate objects, regardless of how sharp they were.

There was nothing more Ling Han could do. The Regulations of the Celestial Realm within the Divine Demon Sword couldn’t be channeled, so it could only stay at the same level as Ling Han.

Of course, if it weren’t for the Divine Demon Sword, perhaps they could have still escaped, but it would have been very likely that several of them would have died. In fact, they might have even consumed several life-saving treasures.

They rested for several days. During this time, they also had a huge meal to replenish their energy. They then set off for the Holy Mountain again.

However, that holy deer had seemingly set its eyes on them, and it unexpectedly started to attack them again. Ling Han and the others had no option but to flee in disarray again.

This occurred time and time again. In the end, half a year passed, yet Ling Han and the others still hadn’t managed to enter the Holy Mountain. This caused them to feel extremely frustrated. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If they couldn’t leave this place, their lifespan would only be a measly 800 to 1000 years. They could count their days on their fingers.

As mighty Sixth Lotus emperor tiers and monarch tiers, they were actually going to die of old age? How vexing!

They summarized their experiences and lessons. If they came across the holy deer again, they would flee toward the Holy Mountain no matter what. Otherwise, they would never be able to reach it.

After deciding this, they set off again.

“Stop!” Ling Han suddenly raised a hand. He had heard some slight movement.

The long grass in the distance suddenly separated, revealing a group of people.

“Baoyu Jianhu!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe exclaimed. Her pupils contracted upon seeing him. She hadn’t imagined that he would return.

This was also because they had been trapped here for half a year. Otherwise, if everything had gone smoothly, they would have already obtained the secrets of the precious armor and left long ago.

However, Ling Han’s gaze was fixed on another person: a single-horned demon. He possessed a large physique, and his tail would occasionally lash around, causing even the air to become a ball of chaos.

This person was extremely strong.

“Hahahaha! We meet again, huh?” Baoyu Jianhu roared with laughter. However, his voice was cold and dripping with malice.

As it tumed out, the Baoyu Clan hadn’t been overly interested in the “ancient tomb.” Even though it was rumored to be the tomb of an Ancestral King, these were beings who were undying and indestructible. How could there be so many Ancestral King tombs in the world?

It was because of this that their team had been led by Baoyu Jianhu. He had come to investigate the situation first. If this place had truly been worth exploring, Baoyu Jianhu naturally wouldn’t have been powerful enough to deal with the situation. As such, he would have returned to ask for assistance.

However, to be kicked out before he had even entered? This infuriated the Baoyu Clan..
