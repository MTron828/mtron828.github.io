Chapter 3438: Second Extreme!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Cui Zhenhai began to break out of the siege.

But when his palm landed on the light screen, the light screen only trembled slightly, and did not shatter.

‘What?’

Cui Zhenhai’s mouth was half-gaping, as he spoke soundlessly.

He had actually failed to blast open the light screen with a single strike. Just how sturdy was it?

It should be known that he was a Celestial Path elite, and had established the foundation of human Dao..

The formation spirit charged over. He was neither happy nor angry, not the slightest bit emotional.

Cui Zhenhai had to parry, but the formation spirit’s might was gradually showing, firmly suppressing Cui Zhenhai. So what if it was a Celestial Path elite? Very soon, he could only be thrashed.

Everyone was watching dumbfounded. They had not thought that the insufferably arrogant Celestial Path elite would be defeated without even seeing Chen Fengyan.

Yes, he had not lost yet, but it would be soon.

As expected, after only a few minutes, Cui Zhenhai had no choice but to surrender and admit defeat. Otherwise, he would be blasted to death by the formation spirit.

“The Holy Emperor’s heart is set on the world, and can accommodate the world. If you behave yourself, the Holy Emperor can accommodate you, but if you break the Majestic Empire’s laws, the Holy Emperor will also take your life,” the formation spirit said indifferently. “Do you yield?”

Cui Zhenhai was internally defiant, but his strength was inferior, so what could he do?

“I concede.” He nodded, his face flushed red.

He couldn’t figure it out. He had escaped from prison. Although he was far from being called an elite, the awakening of the heaven and earth of this world had just begun. How could a monster like Chen Fengyan appear?

“Go to the Ministry of Justice to accept your punishment first,” the formation spirit said.

Cui Zhenhai almost wanted to rebel. He was a Celestial Path elite, and belonged to the highest tier of elites on the current Celestial Sea Planet. He actually had to seek out mortals to accept his own punishment?

However, did he dare to say no?

If he dared to refuse, the formation spirit would dare to kill him.

Cui Zhenhai sighed, and nodded at his daughter. Now, he could only bow his head.

The formation spirit looked at Ling Han again, and said, “Ling Han, for stepping out and facing the enemy, raising the might of our nation, you should be rewarded!”

He pointed a finger, and instantly, a ray of light sank into Ling Han’s body.

Ling Han was astonished. He felt as if the blood in his body was boiling, and there was an unfathomable power surging within him, pushing the level of being to evolve.

Pa, a shackle had already been broken.

It was now or never.

Ling Han hurriedly sat down in a cross-legged position to stimulate this power, speeding up the evolution of the level of being.

Ka, ka, ka! His bones were cracking loudly, like a snake shedding its skin. The outer part of his old bones fell off one after another, and the newly appeared bones were light silver in colour, and their toughness had greatly increased.

Pa, pa, pa! More shackles were broken, and the level of being rapidly increased. More bone scraps fell off, causing the color of the new bones to turn even more silver.

When his bones became pure silver, that would be Second Change.

Ordinary people would be able to cross over one minor cultivation level after tearing open one shackle, at most two. However, Ling Han had already torn open nine shackles, yet his bones still hadn’t turned pure silver, which was incredibly shocking.

However, the power in his body was about to be exhausted.

It should be known that the breakthrough this time was not because he had cultivated to the peak stage of First Extreme, but had rather been forcefully instigated. Now that there was no external help, the evolutionary process would naturally stop. Furthermore, stopping halfway through the breakthrough would definitely lead to extremely terrible consequences.

The formation spirit saw this, and stretched out a finger again, shooting out another flash of light into Ling Han’s body.

Instantly, a vast and mighty power arose again.

“How can this brat’s foundations be so deep and resounding? One burst of power from me actually can’t push him up to Second Extreme?” he muttered, extremely human-like.

Meanwhile, Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief, and continued to guide the power in his body to boost the level of being in his body. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This power was still filled with life force. Even the evolution process was very quick, it did not hurt his foundations.

Everyone was watching enviously. This was a great opportunity bestowed on Ling Han by the Holy Emperor.

However, faced with the Purple Rainbow Sect’s provocation, who had stepped out?

Only Ling Han had.

Thus, he had paid an extremely great price to obtain this kind of good fortune, and had almost been killed by a Celestial Path elite.

Meanwhile, the Imperial Princes all wore ugly expressions. They had already expected this. Although Chen Fengyan was cultivating in seclusion, he had already made all the necessary preparations. However, even his sons had been deceived by him. This also made them cherish their reputation, and they were unwilling to charge ahead. In the end, however, their great opportunity had benefited an outsider for nothing.

Add to that Princess Bixiao, and the gazes that the Imperial Princes directed at Ling Han became even more unfriendly.

Thankfully, there were a considerable number of Imperial Princes that had been lost in the ancient site. Otherwise, there would definitely be even more hostile gazes directed at Ling Han.

Yet Ling Han was completely unconcerned. He used this power to continuously tear open the shackles in his body, and after about an hour, he stopped.

If someone could look inside his body, they would discover that the bones in his body had become completely silver-white.

Second Extreme!

Ling Han stood up, and discovered that a considerable number of people had already dispersed from the plaza, and the formation spirit was also nowhere to be found.

The seven Calabash Brothers surrounded him as guards, not allowing anyone to get close.

In truth, with the formation spirit’s words, who would dare harm Ling Han now?

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said.

“Yes.” The seven babies all nodded. Of course, Sixth Baby was ostentatiously ignored.

Now that Ling Han had left, there was naturally no reason for the remaining people to stay. They all dispersed.

“Shiyuan, what do you think of this Ling Han?” In a corner, there was an old man and a young man. The old man had a hunched back, appearing very aged, as he asked the young man.

The young man thought for a moment, then said, “If he uses the Heavenly Pattern Jade, I won’t be a match. Otherwise, in a battle of equal cultivation levels, I’m sure I won’t lose.”

The elder chuckled and said, “The Heavenly Pattern Jade is a Two Star treasure, so it’s normal that you can’t rival it.”

The young man said proudly, “Third Grandfather, it’s about time for our Zhao Clan to appear, right?”

“Let’s wait, let’s wait a little longer,” the elder said. “We’ve already waited for so many years. What could this little bit more of time hurt?”

“The ancient sites that have appeared now are merely those small sects of the past. At most, they only have Two Stars and Three Stars Celestial Plants. Our Zhao Clan has Celestial Plants like this. However, due to the environment of heaven and earth, it has always been in a hibernating state. However, a few days ago, it has already sprouted new buds. This has been suppressed for a few thousand years, so it would naturally usher in a period of explosive growth. In a short period of time, it would bear celestial fruits.”

“At that time, you and the Mu Sect will be the people who have the highest priority to ingest the celestial fruits.”

“Shiyuan, let these people fight to the death now. Our Zhao Clan’s target is the mother tree!”

“Those who obtain the mother tree shall rule the world!”

The young man, Zhao Shiyuan, nodded respectfully, and replied, “Yes, Third Grandfather.”

“However, that Ling Han… hoho, what right does he have to be called a heaven-suppressing freak?” The old man sneered, his eyes filled with cold killing intent, “Shiyuan, when the time is ripe, you go and kill this person. As for Hong Tianbu, let the Mu Sect deal with him.”

“I understand,” Zhao Shiyuan said with a nod. A cold smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he gazed at the spot where Ling Han had disappeared..
