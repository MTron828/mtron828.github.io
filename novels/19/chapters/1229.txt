Chapter 1230: Han Xinyan

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“However, the Treasure Forest Pavilion has dispatched a Level Eight alchemist this time. Moreover, this alchemist is regarded as a genius,” Kang Xiu Yuan immediately said.

By heading over to challenge the Treasure Forest Pavilion, they were naturally aiming for victory. However, if they ended up being thrashed... Heh, that wouldn’t be very fun.

‘Level Eight alchemist?’

Ling Han chuckled to himself. If it were half a year ago, he would have to seriously reconsider his actions. If Level Eight alchemists refined Level Seven Divine Pills, their success rate would definitely be higher, and the quality of their pills would also be on another level.

He would be confident, but he wouldn’t be able to guarantee victory.

Now, however, he had already managed to refine the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. The difficulty of refining this pill was close to that of refining Level Nine Divine Pills. So, why would he be afraid of a Level Eight alchemist?

“That’s not a problem!” Ling Han said.

Kang Xiu Yuan and Yung Yong Wang exchanged a glance. They then nodded in understanding. Ling Han was incredibly talented in alchemy, so a Level Eight alchemist might not necessarily be able to suppress him if they both refined Level Seven Divine Pills.

After a short while, the three of them arrived at the Treasure Forest Pavilion.

Compared to the Han Lin Pavilion, the time-honored Treasure Forest Pavilion seemed far more majestic. Just its size alone was 10 times bigger than the Han Lin Pavilion. It didn’t seem like an alchemy store at all. Instead, it seemed like a magnificent palace.

Due to Ling Han’s “cowardice”, this place had naturally regained its customers and reputation. The flow of customers was almost like a dragon as they streamed in and out of the entrance. It was as if there would never be a quiet moment.

Ling Han strode over, and shouted, “Ling Han, the Han Lin Pavilion’s senior elder, has come to challenge the Treasure Forest Pavilion. Does anyone dare to accept the challenge?”

The stream of customers instantly faltered upon hearing this. They all turned around to look at Ling Han.

‘The Han Lin Pavilion is accepting the challenge?’

‘It’s showtime!’

It wasn’t long before a voice traveled out from the Treasure Forest Pavilion. “Heh, Grandmaster Ling has cowered like a turtle for so long. Did you finally muster the courage to show your head?”

“Why is there a wild dog barking?” Ling Han immediately chided.

“Y-you dare to call me a dog?!” the person shouted angrily.

“Heh, I simply made a remark. Why did you assume I was talking about you?” Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Perhaps you’re feeling guilty or in the wrong? Is that why you’re making connections to yourself every time I mention the word ‘dog’?”

“Detestable!”

Peng!

The sound of something shattering traveled out from the palace. It was clear that someone was infuriated.

“Grandmaster Ling sure is impressive. Your words precede your person.” Another old voice traveled over as an old alchemist walked out from the palace. Because of the stairs leading from the path to the palace, the old man instantly had the advantage of height. He looked down at Ling Han.

‘Heh, you want to play these tricks on me?’

Ling Han’s body shook, and he instantly transformed into a giant. A powerful aura emanated from his body. This was nothing difficult to achieve. The tables had turned, and now it was he who was looking down on the old alchemist. “I’ve come to accept the challenge. Whom is the Treasure Forest Pavilion dispatching?”

The old alchemist grimaced, and thought to himself, ‘This brat really isn’t willing to suffer any loss.’

He chuckled, and said, “Please wait for a moment, Grandmaster Ling. I’ll go and invite Grandmaster Han straight away.”

He turned around and entered the palace. Meanwhile, Ling Han shrunk back to his normal size. He had simply been messing with the old man.

True challenges were won through strength.

“Let’s go!” Ling Han said. He immediately walked toward the palace.

Kang Xiu Yuan and Yung Yong Wang exchanged a glance before hurriedly catching up. A strange feeling welled up in their minds when they looked at the person in front of them. It was as if they had returned to the Lower Realm, and were following their master as he defeated alchemist after alchemist, and eventually built his reputation as the Alchemy Emperor.

The three of them quickly entered the palace. Their opponents welcomed them with a wall of people who had their arms crossed before their chests. They appeared aggressive and overbearing.

Ling Han retrieved a chair from the Black Tower and casually sat down. He made himself feel at home.

The people from the Treasure Forest Pavilion were infuriated upon seeing this. ‘How f*cking confident are you? You’re making it seem as if you’re the owner of this place!’

After a short while, the wall of people suddenly parted, revealing a woman who was followed by a flock of followers.

This was an extremely aloof beauty. Her body was shapely and slender, her eyes were bright, and her teeth were white. Her skin was especially smooth and pale. If he were to nitpick, then it would be that her chest was a bit too flat. It wasn’t full and impressive enough.

“You’re Ling Han?” A hint of scorn and even disgust appeared on her face when she swept her gaze over Ling Han. “I’m a Level Eight alchemist, so why aren’t you paying your respects to me?”

‘Tsk! How domineering!’

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “How do you know I’m not a Level Nine alchemist?”

‘Isn’t that nonsense? How can there possibly be a Level Nine alchemist as young as you? Do you really think everyone’s called Han Xinyan?’

The aloof beauty was extremely haughty. She was a true alchemy prodigy. She was merely 10,000 years old, yet she was already a Level Eight alchemist. It was only due to the limit of her cultivation level, the insufficient power of her divine sense, and the insufficient might of her flames that she hadn’t advanced to become a Level Nine alchemist yet.

Her opponent looked much younger than her, yet he actually wanted to surpass her in alchemy?

That was simply impossible!

“Humph! So be it!” Han Xinyan said haughtily. “Let’s have a match. If you lose, obediently kowtow to me 100 times and admit that you disrespected me!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Being the gentleman that I am, I won’t make you kowtow or whatnot even If you lose. You can simply bring me some tea and admit that I’m better!”

A cold glint appeared in Han Xinyan’s eyes. The arrogance of this “junior” infuriated her.

Alchemy was similar to cultivation in that a gap of one tier was like the gulf between heaven and earth. Yet, this Level Seven alchemist actually dared to act arrogantly before a Level Eight alchemist! This was incredibly disrespectful!

She forcefully suppressed her anger, and said, “Enough with the nonsense! Let’s begin our match! Seeing as you’re a junior, I’ll choose first. I’ll refine... the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill!”

A wave of commotion swept through the audience when they heard this. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Everyone knew that Ling Han had defeated Alchemist Li by successfully refining the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill. He had single-handedly turned the tables on the Treasure Forest Pavilion. However, Han Xinyan was actually choosing to refine the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill now! This was a sign of absolute confidence.

She was going to defeat her opponent at his own game. How domineering!

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “We’re not refining Level Seven Divine Pills today!”

“Hah? Don’t tell me you want to refine Level Six Divine Pills?” Han Xinyan said with a cold chuckle.

“No, we’re going to refine Level Eight Divine Pills!” Ling Han said.

The surroundings instantly fell silent.

‘You’ve got to be joking, right? You personally said that you were a Level Seven alchemist. It’s only been half a year, yet you’re claiming that you can refine a Level Eight Divine Pill now? Who can improve so quickly?’

Kang Xiu Yuan and Yung Yong Wang were also about to go crazy. ‘If your cauldron explodes the moment you start, won’t you attract the ridicule of everyone?’

Han Xinyan scoffed, and said, “Are you telling me you can refine Level Eight Divine Pills?”

“Why not?” Ling Han retrieved his cauldron, and said, “The pill I’m going to refine today is the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill!”

“What?!” Han Xinyan exclaimed in astonishment.

Berserk Blood Spirit Pill... The recipe for this pill had been lost long, long ago. At least, no one in the Long Light Galaxy could refine this pill. The recipe for this pill was tremendously valuable, and if a genuine Berserk Blood Spirit Pill appeared, it would definitely trigger furious competition between buyers.
