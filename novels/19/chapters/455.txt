Chapter 456: Heaven Grade Alchemist, Ling Han!

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Tang Zu Ming could feel his facial muscles twitch madly too. He knew that even if Ling Han failed, there was definitely no one who would dare to touch a quasi-Heaven Grade alchemist. Even if his great-grandfather was here, he would think highly of Ling Han as well.

An eighteen-year-old quasi-Heaven Grade alchemist; was he still far off from becoming a true Heaven Grade alchemist?

Why was there such a freak in this world? How was anyone else supposed to live when he set such a high standard?

Only Zhu Xuan Er’s eyes beautiful eyes shone brightly; she knew that Ling Han possessed extraordinary talent in alchemy, but had never imagined that he would really be able to become a Heaven Grade alchemist. This was a colossal pleasant shock for her.

Peng!

Ling Han simply picked up the alchemy furnace and walked out. With a sweep of his eyes, he discovered an empty public square and hurriedly raced there.

Everyone knew that he intended to have the alchemical pills withstand the calamity of thunder there, and thus gathered around it and stood firmly to watch.

Ling Han reached his destination. His right hand suddenly opened the lid of the alchemy furnace and three jade-green immediately pills shot out of the furnace and fled in different directions as if they had a life of their own.

But it was precisely at this moment that the thunder tribulation took place, without any prior warning at all.

Kuang!

Three bolts of lightning struck at the same time. They struck the three alchemical pills, and pa, pa, pa , all three alchemical pills immediately fell down from midair. Ling Han moved swiftly and caught each of them. However, one of them had been directly turned into ash, and only two fell into his hands. ( )

This ws the most ordinary Return Origin Pill, and had thus attracted the most ordinary kind of thunder tribulation. One strike and it was over. When Ling Han had concocted pseudo-Immortal Grade alchemical pills in his last life, he had actually drawn out a nine-colored divine lightning that almost spread to him even. When he recalled it even at this moment, he could still feel his heart speed up quickly and turn ashen pale in terror.

He gripped the two Return Origin Pills in his hands and raised them high.

The alchemical pills had not turned into ash.

He had succeeded!

Gods, an eighteen-year-old Heaven Grade alchemist!

Though no one knew what kind of alchemical pill Ling Han had concocted, knowing that these two pills were Heaven Grade alchemical pills was enough for them.

“Respectful greetings, Grandmaster Ling!” All the alchemists knelt. Even Gongyang Tai Sun was no exception, a fire flickering in his eyes.

Gods, finally, a Heaven Grade alchemist had emerged from the north region; moreover, it was a record-breaking eighteen-year-old youngster! Who could compare to that kind of achievement at anytime in history? Even that “Ling Han” who had been acclaimed as the Alchemy Emperor ten thousand years ago would have to admit defeat in face of such an outstanding feat.

How strange, the two geniuses of alchemy from two different generations were actually both named Ling Han; what an astonishing coincidence!

Elder Shi knelt. Zhuo Gao Feng hesitated slightly before he, too, knelt; only Tang Zu Ming was shaking in fear.

Gods, he had actually commanded someone to hunt down and kill a Heaven Grade alchemist; even if his great-grandfather was here, there was no way he could save him.

He was done for! He was finished!

He was so terrified that his knees were shaking. He wanted to flee back to the middle state, hide in the Tang Residence, and never leave, but it was as if his feet weighed ten thousand pounds. He could not take a single step at all.

Ling Han casually stored away the two Return Origin Pills; he would not be able to sell them at all in the north region. He would have to wait until he went to the other three regions or the middle stte and see. He strode towards Tang Zu Ming, scaring him so much that he shivered even more violently.

At this moment, even if Ling Han struck him dead where he was standing, it was guaranteed that no one would dare to say a word in objection.

In this whole world and era, the only people who would be able to exert some form of control over Ling Han would be the other two Heaven Grade alchemists. However, they were both in the middle state, too far to be able to help.

Pa!

Tang Zu Ming knelt down and sobbed. “Please spare me, Grandmaster Ling! I beg you to spare me, Grandmaster Ling!” After tossing and turning restlessly, he could only come up with this phrase. He was truly so terrified that he was completely out of his wits.

Ling Han rushed forth and immediately gave him a thrashing. This also meant that he had no intention to commit murder. Otherwise, why would he have gone to so much trouble? If he really wanted to kill Tang Zu Ming, he needed only wave his sword and it was done. However, this was possibly a descendant of his disciple, so he decided to educate him properly.

Everyone else was struck dumb. Who would have imagined that a noble, prestigious Heaven Grade alchemist would actually be so violent? He had actually gone ahead and thrashed Tang Zu Ming in public openly; what was the difference between his actions and those of a common thug, then?

The imposing image that Ling Han had just established collapsed instantly. Of course, his deterrent force as a Heaven Grade alchemist did not lessen in the slightest; he was still an existence that they could all only gaze up at in admiration and reverence.

When he was finally satisfied with his thrashing, Ling Han stopped and declared, “The Nine Leaf Black Ganoderma, hand it over!”

Tang Zu Ming was stunned at first. Then he realized that he was still alive. And he was no idiot; he had merely been scared stupid just now. Now that he thought about it, since Ling Han was willing to beat him up, that meant that Ling Han did not intend to kill him. He could not help but feel a great joy for getting a new lease of life.

He quickly took out the Nine Leaf Black Ganoderma from his Spatial Ring and handed it over to Ling Han. He then said, “I’m sorry, Grandmaster Ling. Because this is a necessary ingredient in one of the alchemical pills that my great-grandfather is in the midst of concocting, I had bought it over.”

“Heng, it’s not rare for you to use your great-grandfather’s name, is it?” Ling Han asked coldly.

Tang Zu Ming’s heart shook. He could hear the displeasure in Ling Han’s voice and quickly assured, “I will definitely change my habits; I won’t do it again!”

Ling Han humphed and shot out a finger which pressed down on Tang Zu Ming’s Dantian.

“Grandmaster Ling, what did you do to me?” Tang Zu Ming asked hurriedly. He did not feel anything odd happen in his body, but absolutely did not believe that Ling Han would give him a tap for no reason. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han smiled calmly and said, “I just made you unable to be a man.”

“Ah!” Tang Zu Ming screeched shrilly. He was incredibly fond of womanly charms, so if he’d lost his ability as a man, then what was left for him to live for? “No!” he cried in incredible grief. “No! No! No! I want to be a man! I want to be a man!”

“Shut up!” Ling Han gave him a slap. “It would not be difficult for you to return to being a man, but that would depend on your future performance.”

Tang Zu Ming nodded his head repeatedly like pounding a stalk of scallion repeatedly, and said, “I will definitely perform well. I will definitely perform very well.”

Ling Han nodded and said, “Then we’ll see.”

Tang Zu Ming could not help but be disappointed. He naturally hoped to immediately regain his ability as a man, but could he actually force Ling Han to release the restriction on him? He wanted to weep but had no tears. If he had known this would happen, he should have fled back to the middle state two days ago. He would not have clashed with Ling Han, either.

Who would have thought that Ling Han would actually put up such an elaborate pretense? He obviously had the genuine skill of Heaven Grade, yet humbly remained in the position of an Earth Grade low level alchemist, causing him to kick such an extremely huge iron sheet. He was now feeling so horribly wronged.

However, at this moment, he dared not to make the smallest complaint; the only thing he could do now was to stand seriously and obediently.

Since Ling Han obtained the Nine Leaf Black Ganoderma, he was naturally in a very good mood. He said, “I’m leaving.”

Then he turned, planning to walk out of the North Pill Pavilion.

“Grandmaster Ling!” Innumerable alchemists gathered around him. Gods, they had never even seen a Heaven Grade alchemist, so they naturally had to admire him for a few moments longer.

Meanwhile, Elder Shi and Zhuo Gao Feng were both kneeling in front of Ling Han, asking for pardon respectively. “Grandmaster Ling, please forgive our previous lack in manners!” Neither of them placed any importance on their pride or reputation and directly began to slap themselves severely.

There was nothing else they could do. This was a Heaven Grade alchemist; in the whole world, there were only three, and their status was on par with ultimate elites of the Shattering Void Tier. Who would dare offend such an existence?

Ling Han was irritated and said, “Don’t follow me, I still have things to do! As for you two, head to my restaurant and work for a month. If you perform well, I will forget what has happened a few days ago. If you do not, hehe!”

“We will definitely perform well!” Elder Shi and Zhuo Gao Feng declared simultaneously, their expressions filled with pleasant surprise.
