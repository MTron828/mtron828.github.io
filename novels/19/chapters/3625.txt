Chapter 3626: Legend of the Divine Temple

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The outer shell of this scorpion was made of metal, so it was especially sturdy.

Even Ling Han felt his foot go numb.

The scorpion died, leaving behind a little bit of the essence of Metal.

That was a speck of golden sand, but it was much brighter than the sand in the desert. Even if it was thrown into the sand, it would still stand out like a swan in a flock of chickens, and was very conspicuous.

Ling Han put away this essence of Metal, and continued onwards.

He returned to an extremely boring life of fighting monsters. Every day, he would be searching for Metal Element creatures, killing them, and then obtain the essence of Metal, working hard for the sake of becoming stronger in future.

In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

Ling Han’s cultivation progress was very fast. He encountered another node, and after crossing over, he opened another nine apertures. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Now, the number of apertures he had opened had reached 72.

In truth, most people broke through to Mystery Realm Tier in the second stage. Those who broke through in the first stage and the third stage belonged to the minority, and those who could open the Hidden Apertures were even rarer.

“The progress is a little slow. If that’s the case, when I concoct the Five

Elements Karmic Pill, I probably would not have cultivated Mystery Realm Tier

to the pinnacle level yet.”

In reality, it wasn’t that Ling Han’s cultivation speed was slow, but rather that he was obtaining the Five Elements Crystals too quickly. One had to realize that it would take at least several hundred years for ordinary people to gather the Five Elements Crystals with their own efforts.

And as for him?

It hadn’t even been half a year, and he already had three Five Elements Crystals in his hands. With such a comparison, his cultivation speed naturally seemed slow.

This was really a happy and annoying feeling.

Several days later, he encountered a group of people who were also gathering the essence of Metal. At first, he had been eating, but these people demanded that he hand over the essence of Metal as soon as they came up. Ling Han naturally would not be reserved. Instead, he robbed them completely, and even learned of a legend from their mouths.

“In the depths of the golden desert, there is a Divine Temple, and there is a supreme great opportunity hidden within.”

These people were professionals in collecting the essence of Metal, because there would always be forces that wanted to concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill for the sake of their descendants. In the various locations of the Five Elements, it was very easy to encounter people who collected the essence of the Five Elements.

This time, the essence of Metal that they had obtained had all been sold to the Pang Clan. Furthermore, they still had another goal, and that was to find that Divine Temple, and from then onwards, cast off their lowly status, and rise above others.

However, the Divine Temple only existed in legends. Some people swore that they had seen it, but even more people had never seen it before.

Moreover, everyone knew that signs of mirages could appear in the desert. Who knew what those people were looking at?

In this group, there was one person who claimed to have seen that Divine Temple, and it was also because of his insistence that everyone kept chasing after that Divine Temple ambitiously, though they had already spent more than thirty years here.

Ling Han only listened for the moment. His main target was naturally the Five Elements Karmic Pill. He wanted to perfect his foundations and advance to the peak of martial arts.

He spared these people, and continued to eat.

The little loli was curious, and asked, “Ling Han, do you think we’ll find the Divine Temple?”

“Rumors spread easily. The trustability for this matter can’t exceed 10%,” Ling Han said.

“Yi, Handsome Brother, you are really too lacking in optimism.” Tang Yun’er shook her head, “You should believe that with me here, your luck will definitely be heaven-defying.”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Just like how you’ve hit people a few times?” Tang Yun’er was instantly embarrassed. Then, she argued, “Do you know the law of conservation of luck? If you’re too lucky, it’s inevitable that you’ll have some bad luck. That’s how you can be so lucky again.”

“Hehe.”

Somewhere in the desert.

“Your Imperial Highness, we have already searched here for several dozen days, and have almost used up all the water and food. Should we leave for now, and go out to replenish our supplies first?” An old man in grey robes asked respectfully.

There were a total of eight of them, and they were all wearing cloaks on their heads, appearing very mysterious. However, they were presently eating, so they still showed their faces.

There was a young man and seven old men. The young man looked to be in his twenties, and had a sturdy build. He had broad eyebrows and bright eyes. Though he was only sitting there, he had a captivating aura. The seven old men all had different appearances, but they were all led by the young man, appearing to be very reverent.

Because this young man was the heir of the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire, his status was astonishing.

On the surface, the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire was a Sect Master Tier-level force, but there was still an old Venerate Tier overseeing it. Thus, the Majestic Empire was able to rule over a galaxy, and the force was astonishingly large. Furthermore, such a large force was also extremely careful in selecting heirs.

In order to ensure that their leader was definitely the most outstanding, every member of the Imperial Family, after showing enough natural talent, could become an Imperial Prince. However, once their cultivation level could not keep up, or if they had made some great mistake, their title as an Imperial Prince would be revoked, and they would never be able to become an Imperial Prince again.

Thus, there were around a hundred heirs to the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire, and their ages varied. There were old heirs that were over a thousand years old, and there were also those like this young man, who were only in their twenties.

His name was Meng Yangcheng, and he was currently ranked 97th among the Imperial Princes. This was a very low ranking, but taking into account his age, it could be said that his future was limitless.

“That’s right, Your Imperial Highness. The Divine Temple is only hearsay, so who knows if it exists or not.” Another old man advised, “Your Imperial Highness, you are too precious, so why don’t you have us search for it in your place? If we really discover the Divine Temple, it would not be too late to inform Your Imperial Highness.”

Meng Yangcheng humphed, and said, “What do you guys know? At that time, the Divine Temple retreated into the Golden Desert on its own volition. After so many years, it has only been witnessed by a limited number of people. That is because it itself is active! By the time you guys inform me, it would already be too late.”

The seven old men were all surprised. Could it be that the legend of the Divine Temple was actually true?

Meng Yangcheng opened his mouth, and did not plan to stop talking. He continued, “30,000 years ago, the Buddhist Race wanted to teach Dao here, and our Empire naturally would not allow that. The Buddhist Race specializes in bewitching people. If everyone became their believer, would this galaxy still be ruled by the surname of Meng?”

“Great Ancestor Emperor mobilized all the elites to engage in a fierce war with the Buddhist Race. Though we successfully defeated them, we could not completely destroy them. The surviving dregs steered the Divine Temple and entered into the Golden Desert.”

“The so-called Divine Temple is their means of traversing the galaxy. In itself, it is a powerful Spirit Tool. However, the Great Ancestor Emperor has confirmed that even if the surviving dregs have fled into the desert, they are all severely injured, and would soon die completely.”

“However, it was also because of that battle that the Great Ancestor Emperor was severely injured, so he could only pass on the throne and enter seclusion to heal his injuries.”

“Otherwise, with this invasion of the Shadow Moon Majestic Empire, we wouldn’t be in such a passive situation, losing a considerable number of resources!”

Meng Yangcheng said, his expression slightly dark.

The seven elders didn’t dare to reply, and they were internally stunned. As it turned out, the legend of the Divine Temple was not only true, but also involved the Great Ancestor Emperor, who was also that Venerate Tier.

And if Ling Han were here, he would be able to deduce some things.

For example, why didn’t the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire send someone to the Celestial Sea Planet to take a look at the formation seals—they were being invaded by another Majestic Empire, and were currently in a terrible state. How could they have the energy to care about a prison?
