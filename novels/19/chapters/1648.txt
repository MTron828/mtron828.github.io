Chapter 1649: Harvesting Saint King medicine

Death Mushroom, an extraordinary poison!

The Notionless Saint was a Small Saint in any case, yet he had just stretched out his Origin Power into the area where the Death Mushroom was growing, and had not even touched that Saintly medicine, and he had already sustained such a terrifying backlash.

If he had really used his hand to make direct contact, what would’ve happened?

His body would’ve probably directly rotted into a pool of mush.

This Death Mushroom was comparable to a Saint King in itself, the only difference being that it would not make any active movements. A Small Saint was naturally delusional if he wanted to harvest it.

The Notionless Saint quickly drew out some alchemical pills, ingesting them. The damage that came from severing his own arm was still quite large; though a new arm immediately reformed and regrew, it had still used some of his life force. This would naturally have damaged his foundations.

“This is impossible!” He shook his head. Merely a slight touch of the aura of the Death Mushroom, and a Small Saint could only sever his arm to save himself. If it was direct contact, it would definitely mean absolute death.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and Long Yushan also shook their heads. This was really a hopeless situation.

True, the place where the Death Mushroom grew was so obvious, so if it could be easily done, would it still be left for them? Before this, there had been many Saints who had entered, and there might even have been Saint Kings from the Forbidden Lands among them too.

Even Saint Kings could not harvest it, what more they.

However, Ling Han brainstormed. If he used Lightning Flash to harvest the Death Mushroom, his speed would be indescribably fast, so his period of contact with the poison of the Death Mushroom would be incredibly short. Then, he could still actively channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, endlessly increasing his defense.

The problem was that defense and immunity to poison were two different things.

“Small Tower, can I resist such a powerful poison?” he asked Small Tower. Though Saint King medicine was incredibly valuable, how could it compare to his own life?

Small Tower tsked. “Ignorant child, poison is also a part of the Regulations of the heaven and earth! The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll can resist all the techniques in the world, so what is mere strong poison worth— f***!” It had not finished its words when Ling Han had already charged out.

Xiu, Ling Han had turned into a streak of light, and before the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others could react in any way, he had already shot to the central part of the poisonous area. He stretched out his hand and grabbed the Death Mushroom in one go, directly throwing it into the Black Tower. Then, his figure continued to streak past, and appeared on the other side of the poisonous area.

Under the channeling of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his whole body was releasing a golden light, and multiple patterns of great dao appeared, dazzling the heaven and earth.

He slowly circled around the poisonous area and returned, completely unharmed.

“Y-y-y-y-you!” Long Yushan pointed at Ling Han, and even her voice was trembling. She really could not have imagined that Ling Han would have plucked the Death Mushroom so easily.

Ling Han broke into a grin. “Come on, let’s see if there are other such Saintly medicines elsewhere.”

There was something that he did not say. Underneath the Death Mushroom, he discovered a small piece of flesh, and that was real flesh that belonged to some living being. But it was really very small, smaller than even a fingernail.

And it was precisely this piece of flesh that had nurtured the Death Mushroom.

It should be known that even a Saint King might not be able to nurture Death Mushroom. Not only did this Saint King have to be incredibly powerful when he was alive, he also had to be killed by the hand of another, and still have his vitality. Otherwise, an aged Saint King would not have enough blood essence to nurture the Death Mushroom.

Furthermore, a Saint King corpse would only be able to nurture a single Death Mushroom, and when the Death Mushroom matured, there would only be a pile of bones left of the Saint King corpse. It could no longer nurture a second Death Mushroom.

From this, it could be seen how difficult it was to nurture the Death Mushroom.

Yet now?

...A piece of flesh the size of a fingernail actually nurtured a Death Mushroom, and Ling Han had also sensed that there was still astonishing power contained in that piece of flesh. It was definitely capable of nurturing a few more Death Mushrooms.

It was definitely impossible that this was flesh left behind by a Saint King’s corpse! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

‘The blood and flesh of a Celestial!’ Ling Han thought. Perhaps a Celestial had been wounded when the great war had happened all those years ago, and his blood and flesh had spilled. One of the pieces of his flesh had fallen here, and then nurtured the Death Mushroom.

Only the flesh and blood of a Celestial could be so powerful; a little bit was enough to nurture a Death Mushroom, and could even nurture a second and third in future as well. However, the period of growth for a Saintly medicine was counted in hundreds of millions of years. Clearly, Ling Han could not possibly stay here and wait for the second Death Mushroom to sprout.

“Are you all right?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked quickly in worry.

“I’m fine.” Ling Han shook his head with a smile.

Xiao Gu watched from the sidelines, his head slanted to one side. Was this very fun? He ignored the others, and directly strode into the poisonous area.

Though the Death Mushroom had already been removed, the poisonous nature of this place did not disappear so quickly. Suddenly, a black aura wound around him, and it was as if they had become multiple chains that continuously entwined around him.

“Xiao Gu!” Long Xiangyue and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden exclaimed. Because he looked completely identical to Ling Han, both women naturally felt affection for him.

As Xiao Gu walked, he was completely indifferent, as if this was not a poisonous zone, but rather his own backyard. No matter how much the poison surged, he did not mind at all.

This...!

Even Ling Han was extremely stunned, what more the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others. He was more knowledgeable about the amazing nature of Xiao Gu than the others, but he had never thought that this guy was actually awesome to this extent.

“En?” Ling Han suddenly paused, and looked towards the left sideways from them.

Xiu, three figures shot out. Those were three young men, and they were all tall and broad. Their clothes were very strange. Rather than calling them clothes, they should rather be called accessories. They also wore headdresses woven from bird feathers on their heads. The feathers stood three feet tall on them.

Ling Han looked at these three people, his face wearing an expression of surprise. That was because while these people’s auras were very strong, they were clearly much weaker than him, yet he was still unable to distinguish their cultivation levels!

Because the clothes that the three of them were wearing were too revealing, multiple black-veined patterns that looked a little like the demonic patterns of the Netherworld were clearly visible on their skin, but upon closer examination, they were completely different.

Previously, Ling Han had felt that the cultivators of the Netherworld had an evil aura because they were being repelled by the Regulations of the heaven and earth. In fact, after he had cultivated the Regulations of the Netherworld, he realized that there was basically no difference between the two.

...Extreme Yin gave birth to Yang, and extreme Yang gave birth to Yin. This was an unending cycle.

But the black patterns on these three gave him a completely different feeling.

“Hand over the precious medicine!” a young man spoke up, yet he was saying this to Xiao Gu who was presently strolling slowly back. Clearly, they had long since known that there was a Death Mushroom here, and now they did not see the Saintly medicine, but there was a person walking there, so who else could have harvested it except for Xiao Gu?

His words were incredibly strange. At first, they should not have been able to understand him, but he also communicated the same message through his divine sense, and this managed to breach the language barrier.

“Hand, over, the, precious, medicine!” Xiao Gu imitated his words. He was very interested in new phrases, and also very interested in people he had never seen before.

When the three young men heard this, they were all furious.

‘You actually dare to parrot my words?’

“You outsiders, do you all not know what suffering is without being taught a lesson?” The young man who had spoken earlier moved, and grabbed out at Xiao Gu. Weng, the black patterns on his body flowed, and a black-colored thread actually shot out of his hand, seemingly turning into a web.

Immediately, an expression of shock appeared on Ling Han’s face.
