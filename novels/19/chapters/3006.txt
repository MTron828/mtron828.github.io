3007 Killed

Chong Yan and the others all wore expressions of disbelief.

For a Fifth Tier to possess Seventh-Tier battle prowess was already a historical feat, but at least there was a Feng Wuding that could compare.

But now, Ling Han actually possessed the defense of a Seventh Tier, which was terrifying.

This meant that Ling Han had truly crossed into the ranks of big shots. From now onwards, he would be immortal and indestructible, and there was no need for him to take anyone seriously or take them to heart. In fact, even if the Genesis World was destroyed, and Hysteria conquered the world, he would not die, and could still live freely.

Having reached this level, what was there for him to be afraid of?

“Ah…” Feng Wuding screamed in pain.

Chong Yan and the others all looked over. At first, they had not taken Feng Wuding’s injury to heart. After all, this blow had not struck his mind, so there would be no life-threatening danger.

Thus, hearing Feng Wuding’s screams, they all felt slight disdain. ‘You have Seventh-Tier battle prowess, for better or worse, so how could you scream like this?’

However, when they could see Feng Wuding clearly, they couldn’t help but feel shocked.

Feng Wuding’s whole body was glowing, as if there was a small sun inside his body.

This wasn’t caused by him, but rather happened because the power of Ling Han’s attack hadn’t dissipated at all. Instead, it was beginning to wreak havoc inside his body.

“Ah!” Feng Wuding screamed again. His limbs were stretched straight, and his mouth was gaping widely.

Boom, pillars of light shot out of all his apertures, endless power gushing out.

Visibly, his skin was beginning to split apart, blood spurting out.

“No!” Chong Yan and the others were all shocked. They could sense that Feng Wuding’s life essence was boiling, and rushing towards an inconceivable height.

This was extremely abnormal. When one had reached their heights, everything was within a controllable range.

Now that Feng Wuding’s life essence was boiling, it was even more vigorous than that of the five of them added together. This was not because Feng Wuding’s strength had soared to an inconceivable extent, but rather because there was a great disorder in his bodily functions.

Someone with Seventh-Tier battle prowess would actually lose control of his body?

There was only one possibility for this—Feng Wuding was about to die, and that was why the phenomenon of losing control had appeared.

They had placed too much hope on Feng Wuding, and it was not as simple as merely hoping that he would destroy Hysteria. If Feng Wuding died, their hopes would naturally come to nothing.

The five of them hurriedly shot out a palm strike each, and pressed it on Feng Wuding’s body, wanting to forcefully suppress the disorder in his body.

Emptiness because all the organs in his body had been destroyed, and chaos because his body was filled with boiling power, wreaking havoc and surging.

The five of them hurriedly poured their power into Feng Wuding’s mind. Then, they all looked despondent. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That was because Feng Wuding’s mind had already been destroyed, and his spirit had also been destroyed. There were only slivers left, still struggling desperately.

However, no matter what was attempted, Feng Wuding’s death was already a closed case.

…If he did not have such a high cultivation level, and was only a Celestial King, the five great ultimate elites might still be able to defy nature and change his fate, forcefully extending his lifespan, but it could not be done now.

Heavenly Venerates were despised by the heaven and earth. It would all end with their deaths, and there was no chance for them to start over again.

“Save me! Save me!” Feng Wuding hadn’t died completely yet, and there was still a remnant soul fluttering, reaching out shakily towards the five ultimate elites, filled with the longing for life.

Chong Yan and the others were all indifferent, and ignored him completely.

A living Feng Wuding was extremely important, but if he was dead… hoho, who would take him to heart?

Did he really think that Chong Yan and the others treasured him so much because they prized his talent?

Faced with the incredibly cold expressions of Chong Yan and the others, Feng Wuding was filled with despair. In fact, he even felt a kind of resentment.

‘Why won’t you guys save me?’

Why was it like this?

He looked at Ling Han again. This person had said that he would kill him today, and it was clear that Ling Han succeeded.

Feng Wuding was filled with defiance. He was a supreme prodigy, so why did the heavens still give birth to Ling Han to compete with him? In fact, they even allowed him to die in Ling Han’s hands.

If he had another chance, would he still make an enemy of Ling Han?

In truth, was there really an irresolvable enmity between the two of them?

Feng Wuding asked himself honestly, yet discovered that the enmity between himself and Ling Han had been completely started by him alone. Furthermore, Ling Han had repeatedly spared him, and had only robbed him.

He regretted it, but this had also become his last thought.

Peng! His body exploded, while his remnant soul turned into ashes, and then disappeared.

Instantly, astonishing life essence surged towards Ling Han, turning into majestic energy.

“Brat!!” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan stared fixedly at Ling Han, his killing intent boiling.

“I’m not deaf, so I can hear you,” Ling Han said calmly. His body was passively absorbing that energy, causing his cultivation level to experience a very significant increase.

…Feng Wuding was equivalent to a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“You ruined our hopes. Even if we shatter you into pieces, it will not be able to appease the hatred in our hearts!” Shatter Mountains said, his black locks billowing in the wind. He had gone mad with fury.

Previously, his doppelganger had been destroyed by Ling Han. Though he had also been very furious back then, that could not compare to how he was now.

Ling Han chuckled. “Which one of you is Feng Wuding’s illegitimate father? But looking at the anxious expressions on your faces, it seems like all of you are his fathers!”

“You’re courting death!!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains roared furiously, and was the first to attack.

Boom, he used the power of millions and millions, and blasted it towards Ling Han.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and began exchanging blows with Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains without showing any weakness.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Space exploded continuously. The collision between peak-stage Seventh Tiers had extremely terrifying destructive power.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Another few figures swept over. Naturally, it was Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the other Seventh Tier ultimate elites.

When they saw Ling Han was presently in an intense fight with Shatter Mountains, everyone’s eyes widened slightly.

Ling Han was actually capable of matching the battle prowess of a peak-stage Seventh Tier?

This was too inconceivable. This brat clearly had not advanced to the Seventh Tier, so how could his physique be so strong as to be capable of facing a Seventh Tier head-on?

A big shot!

Another big shot had appeared among them. He was immortal and indestructible, and could exist for eternity. He could not be killed, whoever his opponent was. Even if he wanted to commit suicide, it was impossible.

Meanwhile, Golden Silk Moth’s expression was strange. His mouth was half-gaping, and his heart was filled with mixed feelings.

He had been suppressed by Ling Han. This was a humiliation that could never be erased, but now his battle prowess was only at the middle stage of the Seventh Tier, while Ling Han was at the peak of the Seventh Tier. The only thing Golden Silk Moth was proud of was his physique, but Ling Han had caught up with him in that aspect as well.

Was there still a chance for revenge?

Seventh Tier should be able to look down on heaven and earth and be omnipotent. This kind of helpless begrudging made him extremely lost for words.

Boom!

Right at this moment, an even more powerful aura appeared, far surpassing any Seventh Tier. In fact, even all the Seventh Tiers added together couldn’t compare.

Hysteria had appeared.

Without anyone to restrain it, it naturally had to take advantage of the opening to butt in.

Shua, it threw out a tentacle, which whipped towards them. This was practically like a transcendent dimension slapping towards them… no, it was not like just a single transcendent dimension, but rather several of them.
