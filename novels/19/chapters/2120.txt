Chapter 2121: Going to the Liu Clan

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled in a grown. Though it was only a glance, he had seen very clearly that there were a total of 17 horses, and there was a person riding on every single horse. They were all men, and they all had a strong air of arrogance in their expressions.

‘There’s a kid standing in the path, and not only do you people not pull on the reins to stop the horses, you don’t even slow down?’

Instantly, fury soared up in Ling Han. With a flash, he had already appeared in front of those two children, standing as proud as a mountain.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

These riders had absolutely no intention of pulling on the reins, and thus naturally crashed directly into him.

When the first horse collided with him, how could it possibly send Ling Han flying? Instantly, the front hooves of the horse stumbled, and the back hooves soared, completely overturned from the crash. The horses behind could not brake in time at all, and crashed right into the horse in front of them.

This caused a chain of horse accidents. In an instant, seven horses had completely crashed into each other. Some had even broken their necks, twitching on the ground, and frothing at the mouths.

Those seven riders had naturally also fallen on the ground. However, they were all cultivators, so they immediately got back to their feet, though their expressions were slightly stunned.

What was going on here? How had they been thrown off their horses?

“Whoa!” The remaining 10 riders all pulled on the reins of their horses, turning their mounts around, and looking towards Ling Han.

One of them demanded, “Who are you to actually dare block our path?”

Ling Han ignored him completely, and only patted the heads of the two children. “It’s fine now. Don’t cry. Go and play.”

Those two children had completely no idea how dangerous the previous scene was. They had only gotten a bad scare. Crying, they ran to the side of the path.

“Brat, Seventh Brother is talking to you!” The rider from before raised his voice. He seemed to be the leader of the band of seventeen.

The seven people that had been thrown off their horses finally regained their wits, and all of them were furious.

They had something very pressing and urgent, and could not afford to stop at all. Thus, even though they had clearly seen some children blocking their path, they had no plans to rein in their horses at all. However, they had not imagined that an elite would suddenly pop out of this tiny village, and throw their horses over.

They all drew their weapons, glaring at Ling Han with eyes filled with killing intent.

Ling Han crossed his arms behind him. These 17 people hadn’t even entered the Severing Mundane Tier, so it was naturally impossible that he would take them seriously.

“Seventh Brother, let’s just kill him!” a rider exclaimed.

That Seventh Brother hesitated for a moment, but said, “We should prioritize our main task. Let’s just give up those seven Cloud Galloping Horses. We’ll just squeeze together, and set off immediately.”

“Brat, consider yourself lucky.”

“If this had been any other time, you would have long since been chopped into several hundred pieces.”

These riders declared. The seven people that had been thrown off their horses rode together with the others, getting ready to leave.

“Wait.” Ling Han stretched out his arms. “You plan to leave just like this? Those two kids have probably gotten psychological trauma from your scare, so don’t you think you should leave some compensation?”

“F***, who do you think you are? You think you are all that impressive just because we give you some leeway?” One of the riders abused him roundly.

“Seventh Brother, this brat is practically courting death. Let us just kill him.” Some of the riders got restless, their vicious nature flaring.

“All right.” Seventh Brother thought for a moment before nodding. Since Ling Han was so determined to seek death, they could only oblige him.

Five riders immediately jumped off their horses, and then spread out, surrounding Ling Han.

Though their words were very overbearing, they did not dare to underestimate Ling Han. After all, Ling Han had just used his body to forcibly stop the Cloud Galloping Horse. This kind of strength was still quite powerful.

“Charge!” They all brandished their respective weapons, charging to attack Ling Han.

Qiang, qiang, qiang, qiang.?Ling Han did not dodge or evade, and these weapons naturally all slashed onto him. However, to say nothing of his physique, even the clothing he was wearing was woven from the fur of Dividing Soul Tier Immortal Beasts. How could it be penetrated by the power of a few Genesis Tiers?

Not only did they not manage to pierce through, they were also bounced backwards.?Pu, pu, pu.?Immediately, five of their heads had been smashed by their own weapons. There were two that were more fortunate. One of their weapons had slashed into his left shoulder, and his whole person was practically about to be sliced apart, blood gushing forth madly. The other had been split apart from his lower abdomen, and had become two halves.

At least they weren’t dead.

“What!?” The remaining 12 were all green with shock. How could they have possibly imagined that there would actually be such a terrifying elite in such a tiny village of mortals?

…Though they themselves were shockingly weak as well. In the Celestial Realm, anyone that had not advanced into Severing Mundane Tier definitely could not be considered any elite.

Ling Han spread out his hands. “This has nothing to do with me.” Indeed, he had not made any movement at all. It was only because these five people were too weak.

The 12 men all looked at Ling Han as if they were looking at a demonic monster. They could feel their butt cheeks trembling, and those that were less brave were almost about to lose control over their bladders.

“Come, tell me what urgent matter you have that you cannot even concern yourself with two kids in your path?” Ling Han’s expression darkened. He was very furious.

He knew that he could not take control of all injustices in this world, but since he had seen it, he would stretch out his hand and interfere.

Those 12 men all exchanged looks, none daring to speak.

Ling Han casually flicked a finger, and a streak of Sword Qi swept past. One of the riders was slashed in two. His lower half was still seated on his horse, but his upper body had slowly slipped down, and landed with a crash on the ground.

Still not speaking?

“I’ll speak! I’ll speak!” a rider immediately screamed out shrilly, tears and snot pouring down his face. “We are the servants of the Liu Clan of Great Clouds City.”

“Recently, we have sustained the joint attacks of the Kong Clan, and are already in mortal peril.”

“Hence, under the command of the clan leader, we are heading to Green WIllows City to use the Summoning Formation there to contact a powerful force to ask them to send some people to solve our predicament.”

One person took the lead to break the silence, and the others naturally began trying to outdo one another and blurted out their replies, fearing that they would be killed by Ling Han if they did not speak.

“Oh, what level of forces are the Liu Clan and Kong Clan? And what is that great force?” Ling Han asked carelessly. He had already lost interest, and planned to cripple the cultivation levels of these people to prevent them from causing further harm to others in the future.

“Our Liu Clan and the Kong Clan are both Severing Mundane Tier clans, and because Kong Clan has a grand elder that has broken through to the fourth severance, they have suddenly gotten the upper hand, causing our Liu Clan to suffer repeated defeats.”

“If we’re talking about that great force, hehe, you would definitely be terrified to death.”

“Imperial Void Sect!”

Ling Han faltered for a moment. Imperial Void?

“Is the sect master of the Imperial Void Sect the Imperial Void Celestial King?”

“It is that lord, precisely!” Those 12 riders’ expressions were all filled with manic excitement. In the Celestial Realm, Celestial Kings represented invincibility and absolute superiority.

Ling Han was surprised. This was really a coincidence. To actually hear news of the Imperial Void Celestial King in this place.

The ancestor of the Cheng Clan, an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, had been besieged by several Celestial Kings and left injured. Meanwhile, the Cheng Clan was massacred by the Imperial Void Celestial King. If it had not been for the formation laid down by the Celestial King of the Cheng Clan, which had sent the ancestral grounds of the Cheng Clan into the Ancient Realm, there wouldn’t have been even a roof tile left behind.

The large black dog had also said before that there was an unusual genius who had crippled his own cultivation level after he accomplished the fifth severance in the Severing Mundane Tier. Then, he had re-cultivated Severing Mundane Tier from the beginning, and when he could achieve no further severance, he finally advanced to the Dividing Soul Tier.

This unusual genius was the Imperial Void Celestial King.

Most importantly, the Imperial Void Celestial King had some link with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable!

Heavenly Venerate!

A small Severing Mundane Tier clan was actually linked with the Imperial Void Celestial King?

Ling Han became very curious, and said, “Come, let’s go to the Liu Clan.”
