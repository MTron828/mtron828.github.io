2947 Seventh Tiers Making Their Move

“I concur!” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate said.

Thank you readers!

‘Concur your mom!’ Ling Han grumbled in his mind.

However, he kept his mouth shut. Lin Luo was standing up for him right now, so he would wait to see if this Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate could resolve the problem for him.

It would naturally be best if he could resolve the situation. In case he couldn’t, however, Ling Han had no intention of standing still and waiting to be captured.

Everyone’s cultivation would be suppressed here, so unless a Seventh Tier elite came over with their true body, Ling Han wouldn’t be afraid of anyone. In fact, even if a Seventh Tier elite did come, Ling Han could still tear apart space and leave. In the void, only Hysteria was powerful enough to rival him.

!!

Thus, Ling Han was extremely calm at this moment as he contemplated something else.

It was naturally easy for him to leave. However, what about the others?

Ling Xi and Ling Jianxue were still claiming new territory in the Profound Negative Realm, so it would be impossible for Ling Han to take them with him. If he left, what would happen to his son and daughter?

However, thinking about it a bit more, even though Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the others were unable to defend him, using a bit of their power to protect his children would only be a very minor matter. After all, there was a reason to target Ling Han, but there was no reason to target Ling Xi, Ling Jianxue, and the others.

Who would dare to disregard the words of Seventh Tier elites?

The same could be said for the Rain Emperor and the others. This was even more so the case for Bai Mifan. His grandpa was a Seventh Tier elite, so who dared to target him?

With this in mind, Ling Han finally let go of his worries. If it really came to it, he would simply leave.

But where would he go?

That would naturally be the Genesis World of the last era. If he truly needed to “flee,” he would have heaps of time on his hand to explore those ancient dimensions.

Lin Luo argued strongly on good grounds, and he even offered to use his own reputation to vouch for Ling Han. If something went wrong, he would shoulder the full responsibility!

However, Chong Yan and Shatter Mountains didn’t give him an inch.

They had both come from the Genesis World of the last era, so why did they need to care about Lin Luo’s feelings?

Ling Han had to die.

Ling Han suspected that this was all because of Feng Wuding.

If Ling Han didn’t die, then Feng Wuding would forever be seen as a failure. He would always be inferior to Ling Han.

Was this conflict being perpetuated by a power struggle between the new and old Genesis World?

Ling Han had strong suspicions that Chong Yan and Shatter Mountains were fanning the flames on purpose, with their intention being to kill him, the strongest prodigy in the current Genesis World.

“There’s nothing else to say. Capture him!” Chong Yan said coldly.

“Friend, you’re taking things too far!” Lin Luo said coldly. He was a Seventh Tier elite, someone whose words were more powerful than the heavens. No one had ever defied him before, yet these people were opposing him even after he made a Dao oath to vouch for Ling Han? He was genuinely enraged at this moment.

“Heh, disposing of spies and traitors is the righteous decision. Friend Lin, are you being a little too selfish?” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate said as he reached over to grab Ling Han.

Lin Luo immediately stepped forward, yet Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan also stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Old bastard, I’ve already put up with you for too long!” Ling Han roared as he charged at the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow.

The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate shuddered slightly, while Ling Han spat blood as he flew through the air.

This was the power of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. Even though this was only a doppelganger whose cultivation had been suppressed, he was still unfathomably powerful.

However, everyone exclaimed in astonishment, all of them feeling that Ling Han was as freakish as could be.

His true cultivation level was only at the Fourth Tier.

Yet, he had only suffered some minor injuries after facing the attack of a Seventh Tier elite head-on. This was simply incredible.

“You’re this powerful now, so just how powerful will you be in the future? We definitely can’t spare you!” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate said, his expression changing slightly. However, he didn’t feel any shame that he was picking on a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, nor did he feel any disappointment that he had failed to kill him with a single strike.

He was a Seventh Tier elite, the most powerful in the world. What did he need to care about?

In his eyes, achieving his goal was the only matter of importance.

‘Die!’

He charged over again, his attacks extremely vicious as he tried to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han released a battle cry as he channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, unleashing his Fists of Fury to face the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate head-on.

He was filled with boundless rage. He was innocent, so why did he have to face such unfair treatment? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Were they all blind? Could they not see the contributions he had made to the Flaming Frost Realm all these years?

Some of them were being wilfully blind, and their intention was to kill him.

This was for no other reason than jealousy or personal grudges.

This was utterly detestable and disgraceful.

With such short-sightedness, it was no wonder the Genesis World of the last era had only been able to severely wound Hysteria, even after sacrificing its entirety. It had failed to solve the root of the problem.

As for this generation?

Perhaps Ling Han would become powerful enough to kill Hysteria in the future. However, if he were killed now, there would naturally be no more future. Taking a step back, even if they only searched his soul and found him to be innocent, what would happen if he were injured during this process?

One’s mind and divine sense were incredibly important, and these were critical factors that would affect one’s future potential. Thus, receiving injuries to these would be equivalent to destroying his future.

“Old bastard, did I trample on your grandpa’s grave or did I kill your father?” Ling Han said. He was furious at this moment, so he wouldn’t feel good unless he vented his anger. “Don’t think that you’re invincible and undying. When my battle prowess reaches the Seventh Tier, I’ll make sure to suppress you and trap you under a toilet. I’ll have you stink for all eternity!”

As a Seventh Tier elite, the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s temperament was naturally extremely calm and composed. He wouldn’t be affected by such trivial curses.

Why was this?

This was because his supreme power meant that no one dared to disrespect him. Even if someone did, he could kill them with a single strike. As such, he wouldn’t even have the opportunity to become angry.

However, this was only his doppelganger, and his cultivation had also been suppressed as well. Thus, he was unable to suppress Ling Han no matter what. This caused him to become increasingly angry, with his brows knitting into a frown.

‘How can there be such a detestable person? His mouth is far too toxic!’

Yet, there was nothing the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate could do about Ling Han’s trump cards. He was only a doppelganger, so he couldn’t channel all of the abilities of his true body, such as Heavenly Venerable Seals.

If this were in the outside world, he could rely on his superior cultivation level to suppress Ling Han. Here, however, he was only slightly more powerful than ordinary Sixth Tier elites. Thus, he was completely unable to suppress his opponent.

Seeing the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate fail to defeat Ling Han after so long, a look of astonishment involuntarily spread across Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan’s face.

This brat… was going to defy the heavens!

“Chong Yan, you can also see. Ling Han’s potential is limitless, and it’s extremely likely that he’s the only person who can defeat Hysteria in the future,” Lin Luo said.

Since Ling Han was temporarily safe, he naturally didn’t need to be too worried.

Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan humphed, and said, “We can’t even determine whether he’s an ally or an enemy. Who knows if he’s a subordinate of Hysteria? A single Hysteria is already so difficult to deal with, so what will we do if he gains another Seventh-Tier helper?

“In any case, we still have Feng Wuding, the Son of Destiny from the Genesis World of the last era!”

Hearing his name, Feng Wuding involuntarily stood up a little straighter, making himself seen.

Lin Luo simply chuckled in reply.

‘What’s with that expression? What are you trying to say?!’

Feng Wuding was instantly driven mad. Was he being looked down upon?

“You want to kill me? One of you isn’t enough! In fact, no number of you will be enough!” Ling Han roared.

He unleashed a battle cry as he channeled all of his eighth-grade seals at once, causing his power to grow thousandfold.
