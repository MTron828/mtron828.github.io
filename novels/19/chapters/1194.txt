Chapter 1195: Six King Tiers Join Hands

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Wu Zhe was also a king tier of the younger generation, there was no doubt that he was the weakest of the seven king tiers. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This was one of the reasons for the mysterious being choosing him. The weaker his target, the easier they would be to possess. Moreover, the success rate would also be higher.

Possessing others was in defiance of heaven and earth. Thus, he still had to be especially careful even though he was an extremely powerful being. As a result, he could only choose a “weakling” like Wu Zhe. This would maximize his chance of success.

Now that Wu Zhe was being attacked by six king tiers, it was very likely that he would be insta-killed.

Weng!

Their attacks arrived before Wu Zhe, yet he simply raised his hand and lightly pushed outward. An invisible barrier appeared, blocking all of their attacks. He smiled, and said, “Please have some patience. I’ll get around to killing you all when I familiarize myself with this body.”

His smile was wicked and sinister.

Ling Han and the others were stunned. How was this possible? Weren’t there restrictions that targeted power at and above the Sun Moon Tier here? This mysterious being had blocked their attacks so easily, so his power was definitely above the Mountain River Tier.

Why wasn’t he attacked by the restriction?

“Hehe, this isn’t power, but Regulations,” Wu Zhe said with a chuckle. However, black aura shrouded his face at this moment, and he naturally wasn’t the same person as before. Rather, he was the mysterious being who had possessed Wu Zhe.

He kindly explained himself, saying, “Back when I was alive, I was almost at the pinnacle of the Eternal River Tier. I was only a step away from reaching the Genesis Tier. So, how can you measly ants fathom my grasp of Regulations?”

He casually twisted his body.

Pa, pa, pa!

His bones crackled, and his body instantly underwent a dramatic transformation. It was as if he were reshaping the appearance of this body to suit himself.

“Shatter!”

Ling Han and the other king tiers all unleashed their supreme might.

Although this mysterious being had been frighteningly powerful in the past, only a wisp of his soul was still remaining at this moment. Moreover, he was relying on the body of a Mountain River Tier cultivator to unleash his might. It would be extremely abnormal if he could still wield the battle prowess of an Eternal River Tier elite.

Ling Han and the five others were king tiers of the younger generation. Even if there were other king tiers in the vast Immortal Realm, it was very likely that they would only be as powerful as them. They were all at the peak stage of the pinnacle level, so it would be extraordinarily difficult to surpass them, even by just a tiny margin.

It was just that Shen Zhu’er and the others didn’t dare to unleash their full 10-star power at this moment. Otherwise, they would be attacked by the restriction of this mystery realm. In that case, they wouldn’t be raising their battle prowess—they would be seeking death.

The six king tiers unleashed their most powerful attacks at Wu Zhe.

Wu Zhe appeared especially at ease, and he simply battled against them using a single hand. In fact, the Regulations that he used were also extremely basic—they were simply composed of a few divine patterns. However, the might that they released was tremendous, and they were easily able to block the six king tier’s attacks.

Meanwhile, he continued to restructure his body. Numerous bone spikes protruded from his back, and there was even a solitary horn growing from his forehead. The horn glowed with a faint silver luster.

If Wu Zhe still had his own consciousness, perhaps he might even be pleased with these changes. Although he had been a member of the seven king tiers before, he had undoubtedly been the weakest link in the chain. Now, however? He could withstand the combined attacks of the other six king tiers all by himself! Moreover, he could do so with absolute ease!

This was an incredible feat. If word of this got out, he would definitely become the number one prodigy in the world. He wouldn’t be one of the most powerful prodigies, but the most powerful prodigy!

Unfortunately, he was no longer Wu Zhe.

Wu Zhe twisted his neck, and said, “Amazing... This feels amazing!”

He was at least twice as tall as before, and his physique was also much thicker and bulkier. His skin also appeared very black and patchy.

Looking carefully, one would realize that these were actually patches of divine patterns! It was as if he had been born with these divine patterns on his skins—it was impossible to see any signs of artificial altering.

He stretched his body lazily, then smiled and stared at the six king tiers. “Little sh*ts, how should I kill you? Should I steam you to death, or should I braise you to death?”

“F*ck ya mom!”

Ling Han retreated by some distance, and fired his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow at Wu Zhe.

Pa!

Wu Zhe raised his right hand and caught the Origin Power arrow between two fingers. This was absolutely terrifying. How fast was the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow? Yet, he had actually caught it between two fingers!

He grinned, and said, “This arrow is fairly interesting. Had my grasp of the Regulations of heaven and earth not been far above you, I really might’ve been hit!”

“It’s effective!” Shen Zhu’er shouted in excitement. “His hand has been wounded!”

Sure enough, blood was flowing from the webs of Wu Zhe’s fingers.

“Damn it!” Wu Zhe’s expression darkened, and he said, “This body is still too weak!”

“Although his grasp of Regulations is far above us, his body isn’t stronger because of this,” Shi Anguo immediately said. “His power is also unchanged!”

“We still have a chance to defeat him!” He Tao said.

The six of them nodded in agreement. They were all king tiers, so which of them didn’t possess will of steel? Although they were in a dire situation, none of them was panicked or flustered. Rather, they analyzed the situation with calm and composure.

Wu Zhe sneered, and said, “So what? Under the suppression of my Regulations, what trouble can you people pose?”

He extended his hand toward them.

Boom!

The divine patterns on his body lit up and transformed into lengths of divine chains that whipped toward the six king tiers.

Ling Han and the others hurriedly jumped aside. Wu Zhe’s power wasn’t much weaker than theirs, and coupled with his far more powerful Regulations, his battle prowess was already at a level that they couldn’t match.

“Hahaha!” Wu Zhe laughed loudly. It appeared as if a sliver of his original awareness still remained. Otherwise, what was there for him to be so smug about? Ling Han and the others were merely Mountain River Tier “ants” that he could suppress with a flip of his hands.

Ling Han continued to fire his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, and he tried his best to maintain the distance between him and Wu Zhe.

The Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow was something that could threaten Wu Zhe.

Wu Zhe didn’t dare to be careless around these attacks. His battle prowess was indeed powerful, but his cultivation was still only at the Mountain River Tier. This was a significant weak point. It meant that he had to deal with attacks from Ling Han and the others. Otherwise, his body would be gravely wounded if he were hit by one of the arrows.

This gave the young king tiers time to move around and unleash their most powerful attacks.

“Green Bamboo Ambush!” Shen Zhu’er shouted. Her glabella split open, and a small bamboo surprisingly shot out from it. It expanded rapidly, eventually becoming an astonishingly large bamboo. However, its shape wasn’t rigid, and this allowed it to remain unaffected in this relatively limited space.

Shua!

The bamboo shook slightly, causing countless leaves to fall down. These leaves then transformed into bamboo swords that swept toward Wu Zhe.

“Purple Flames!” Shi Anguo roared. Flames burst from his body, and a fiery lion that was engulfed in purple divine flames appeared as he clapped his hands together. The lion lunged toward Wu Zhe.

“Surging Black Water!” He Tao howled. One of his eyes shut tightly, while his other eye remained wide open. A black river surged from his body.

The six king tiers all unleashed their trump cards. No one dared to hold back at this moment. Otherwise, it was truly possible that they would lose their lives here.

Boom!

Divine light illuminated the surroundings and swept toward Wu Zhe.
