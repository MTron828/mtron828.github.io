However, before starting his investigation, Ling Han was dragged along by the Empress and the others to eat a meal first.

Everyone was starving, and there were also peculiar Regulations here. While they still maintained their power, they also faced the challenges of ordinary mortals. They would feel thirst, and they would feel hunger. They would even be constricted by a limited lifespan.

Thus, they were all extremely anxious to leave this place. Otherwise, they might truly die of old age.

Moreover, after the lesson from just then, they would definitely store some food in their Spatial God Tool in the future. After all, they never knew when it might come in handy.

Ling Han generously shared his food with everyone. However, he naturally limited how much food he shared. It was just enough for everyone to relieve their hunger.

If they wanted more, no problems. They could trade for more using Celestial medicines.

This caused everyone to fume. Ling Han was blatantly scamming them in a time of dire need.

However, Ling Han was neither stealing nor robbing, even though he was clearly stronger than them. Thus, what could they say?

Several people couldn’t endure the hunger, so they set off to hunt.

Ling Han chuckled upon seeing this. He then entered the Black Tower after satisfying the appetites of Hu Niu and the others.

Before entering, he first made some gestures with his arm, cutting out a part of the space before him. He then placed two unopenable scrolls inside this space.

These scrolls couldn’t be taken inside the Black Tower, nor could they be placed in his Spatial Storage Rings. They could only remain in heaven and earth. It was as if they were the property of the heavens, things that couldn’t leave the gaze of heaven and earth for even a split second.

The void naturally belonged to the heavens as well. It was just that very few people entered.

Ling Han used the Regulations of Space to create a stable space before him. This space could remain for a long time without crumbling.

These scrolls were truly glorious beings. Each time he entered the Black Tower, he would need to create a space for them first.

He sighed as he entered the Black Tower. His body instantly became lighter, and it was as if something that had been weighing down on him had suddenly disappeared at this instant.

“small Tower, wake up,” Ling Han said. This was the Foreign Realm, so without the power of heaven and earth from the Celestial Realm, Small Tower would remain in a state of deep sleep. It wouldn’t wake for trivial reasons.

“You’re wasting my energy again,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Observe your surroundings. What power is this?”

Small Tower paused for a moment before replying, “This power is around that of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, However, it feels completely lifeless. It’s most likely that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King passed away, after which his body fused into this heaven and earth, thereby replacing the original

Regulations of this land.

“It’s also because of this that their power fell to the Eighth Heaven.”

A dead Celestial King would naturally become weaker than when they were alive. Thus, it was understandable that their power fell from the Ninth Heaven to the Eighth Heaven.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. As long as this wasn’t the power of a Heavenly Venerate, he could use the might of the Black Tower to break free. At the very least, he had a path of retreat. This filled him with confidence. When that person had sold Celestial Maiden Yunhe the map, they had lied and

said that this was the tomb of an Ancestral King. Surprisingly, however, his lie had transformed into a reality.

This was genuinely the tomb of an Ancestral King. Moreover, it was the resting place of an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King.

‘Are these strange pieces of armor also created by the power of this Celestial King?

Ling Han picked up a wrist guard. As long as this piece of armor was placed on the so-called Holy Mountain, it would automatically transform into a precious tool. He could only attribute this to the influence of the Celestial King.

He wore the wrist guard, and he immediately felt a sharp prick on his skin. However, his physique was far too powerful, so the wrist guard failed to penetrate his skin.

With a single thought, he reduced the power of his physique. He instantly felt a slight pain, and a thin needle pierced into his skin, stabbing into his vein.

Ling Han was astonished. He could feel the wrist guard fusing together with him, and it was as if it had become part of his body.

‘Interesting.’ With a thought from him, the patterns of the wrist guard immediately lit up, causing a torrent of power to surge into his body. This elevated his battle prowess by a slight amount. However, a drop of his blood was also consumed.

This was the price that the tribespeople spoke of?

Ling Han was slightly surprised. Even though a drop of his blood had been consume, this was truly nothing compared to the amount of blood he had. Moreover, his life essence was profound, so as long as his blood essence wasn’t consumed, he could endlessly create ordinary blood.

Of course, this blood was only ordinary compared to his blood essence. His physique had been tempered using the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so his ordinary blood was comparable to the blood essence of others.

“If this is the case, I can wear far more than two pieces of armor at once,” he murmured to himself. He entered the wrist guard with his divine sense again. However, even though this wrist guard belonged to him, it was still resistant to his observation. It instantly shattered into pieces.

“This piece of armor isn’t as strong as me, so it immediately shattered upon being observed by my divine sense. However, if it was stronger than me, it could most likely keep my divine sense from entering. Otherwise, this kind of armor would be completely meaningless. Enemies would be able to shatter

it with a single sweep of their divine sense.

‘Fortunately, I traded for a few more wrist guards.’

Ling Han wore another wrist guard. Not one, but two.

‘The two wrist guards lit up in unison. This placed more stress on Ling Han’s body, though it was still an insignificant amount.

‘What about three?

‘What about four?’

One after another, Ling Han continued to wear more pieces of armor. Eventually, he was armored from head to toe. However, because the tribespeople had never considered making a full suit of armor, these pieces of armor were extremely incompatible, with clear gaps between the different pieces of

armor.

“However… Ling Han was slightly astounded as he threw a punch.

Peng!

A burst of energy surged forward, transforming into a terrifying cyclone of energy.

“My original battle prowess was around the Earth Soul. Now, however, it’s reached the Heaven Soul. In fact, it’s even slightly more powerful!

‘In other words, a full suit of armor can elevate my battle prowess by a minor tier. This is equivalent to a king tier becoming an emperor tier, an emperor tier becoming a monarch tier, or a monarch tier becoming a monarch star.”

This was absolutely astounding, This was only a suit of armor—one which wasn’t very difficult to obtain, in fact. As long as one forged a billet and placed it on the Holy Mountain, it would transform into such armor after only three years.

‘If this armor can be used in the Two Realm Battlefield, won’t the Foreign Realm gain a significant advantage? Ling Han mulled over this problem. This secret technique was seemingly confined to this heaven and earth, with no one else aware of its existence.

Anyhow, his vitality was far too rich. He felt completely fine even after wearing a full suit of armor.

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, and his armored appearance instantly shocked everyone in the surroundings.

“Divine deity!” Upon witnessing Ling Han’s appearance, the tribespeople all fell to their knees. They kowtowed to Ling Han, and their expressions were as respectful as could be. They were truly treating him like a divine deity.

Meanwhile, Hu Niu and the others exchanged a glance. They felt like Ling Han’s appearance was slightly stupid.

Ling Han hadn’t imagined that his getup would elicit such a strong reaction. Thinking about it carefully, however, the people in the tribe could only wear two pieces of armor at most, so it was indeed shocking that he had been able to don a full suit of armor.

He laughed before calling Hu Niu and the others over. He planned to visit the “Holy Mountain” as soon as possible, for the corpse of the Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King most likely lay there. If he could deal with it there, he wouldn’t need to use the Black Tower to escape.

In addition, he was extremely interested in how these pieces of armor were created. If he could learn the method, he could significantly improve the Celestial Realm’s standing against the Foreign Realm.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
