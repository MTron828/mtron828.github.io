Chapter 804: Mo Family’s Genius

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I can’t be bothered to talk to you guys!” Ling Han, however, initiated the attack, forming a seal with his right hand and releasing it towards the four people. Golden light instantly radiated all around. It was the Earth Overturning Seal, a Mystical Power!

That large flea could return at any time, and he didn’t want to stay here any longer.

After all, he cultivated out Sword Heart and could resist against Shattering Void Tier’s oppressive power, but it didn’t mean that he could rival Shattering Void Tier—especially a being like the Flea King. Perhaps even the Lunar King and the likes would get a headache facing it.

“Outrageous!” Mo Yuanming and the others all snorted—a mere Deity Transformation Tier human dared to attack them?

They raised their weapons one after another, hacking, slashing, smashing, and thrusting towards Ling Han.

Ling Han couldn’t help but itch to try. Sword Heart’s miraculous use was to control the weapons of the world, so those who were called Sword King, Saber King, or Fist King all grasped the heart of martial arts. It was as if sitting on a throne, being able to command the world.

He extended his left hand and grabbed lightly, and instantly, the weapons in Mo Yuanming’s and three others’ hands all let out a gentle sound and started to tremble lightly as if they were about to escape their grasp and fly towards Ling Han.

Mo Yuanming and the three others were greatly shocked. What was happening? They retreated repeatedly and held tightly onto their weapons, fearing that they really would fly away.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. He’d just cultivated out Sword Heart, so it wasn’t strong enough yet. Otherwise, all those weapons should fly to his side with a single thought, like imperial bodyguards protecting him.

This made him anticipate things even more. How awesome would it be to to have great mastery in Sword Heart? And, Sword Heart Illumination represented the highest tier in sword path, claiming to cut all things, even extinguishing inner demons, or else how would there be “illumination” in its name?

“Sword Heart!” Mo Zhengxin said in a low voice, a cautious look flashing across his face.

“What, Sword Heart?”

“Impossible, this human’s only in the Deity Transformation Tier, how could he have comprehended Sword Heart?”

“Yeah, even Shattering Void Tier powerhouses might not have comprehended Sword Heart, how’s this human worthy of such an honor!”

Mo Yuanming and the three others couldn’t believe it. In their perception, the heart of martial arts only belonged to the Shattering Void Tier, and a very small minority of them at that—definitely not every Shattering Void Tier elite had the heart of martial arts.

Mo Zheng had a stern expression as he said, “You guys remember Xu Xiu Ran and Zhang Mo who were with us?”

“Obviously.” Mo Yuanming and the three others all nodded. Those four were guests that the sea emperor had personally received, and despite them being lowly humans, they didn’t dare to underestimate them at all.

“These two people also cultivated out Saber Heart and Sword Heart, and grasped it more deeply than this human,” Mo Zhengxin said.

“W-what!?” Mo Yuanming and the three others were shocked, covered in goosebumps.

Were humans really an extremely lowly race? Those three people didn’t even reach the Shattering Void Tier, yet they grasped the heart of martial arts that the majority of the Shattering Void Tier elites didn’t possess. With that comparison, why did it feel like the sea race was the lower level?

Mo Zhengxin, however, sighed inwardly. The sea race had the absolute advantage in the cultivation of tiers, and with the blessing of dragon’s blood, their physiques far surpassed humans’. However, with regards to martial arts comprehension, humans were a notch better.

In other words, their bloodline was the reason for their success, but also the reason for their failure.

However, he immediately retracted the emotion within, and said indifferently, “Don’t care about this now, kill this human, and seize the True Dragon’s Blood Stone.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes!” Mo Yuanming and the three others shouted, and surrounded Ling Han again.

Ling Han raised his left hand. He was now filled with interest in how Sword Heart operated, continually practicing, and with every passing moment, he discovered that he made progress in the comprehension of the Sword Heart.

“So what if he grasped Sword Heart? He’s just a human after all, and only in the Deity Transformation Tier.” Mo Yuanming and the other three attacked, launching attacks toward Ling Han for the second time.

Ling Han activated the Sword Heart and influenced the weapons of Mo Yuanming and the three others. It was as if the Spirit Tools in their hands were revolting against them, and their attacks had no accuracy at all.

Mo Yuanming and the three others were shocked. Without accuracy, how could they keep fighting?

If Ling Han were a Shattering Void Tier powerhouse, then so be it—they wouldn’t win anyway—but now the opponent was just at the Deity Transformation Tier, yet was making them so helpless.. truly an embarrassing thing.

“Aaah!” They were driven mad. Ling Han didn’t even dodge once and let them attack at will, but they couldn’t even touch the corner of Ling Han’s clothes. How could they endure this?

The heart of martial arts, was it really that powerful?

Ling Han soon lost interest. These four people were too weak, and had limited use in helping him improve his Sword Heart. He probably had to fight hand to hand with Xu Xiu Ran and the Small Sword Emperor, using their Saber or Sword Heart to improve so that his own Sword Heart could grow rapidly.

His pressed forward with his right hand. The Earth Overturning Seal shone with golden light, pa, pa, pa, pa,

sending Mo Yuanming and the three others flying.

“Wa!” Mo Yuanming and the three others hacked out blood violently, suffering heavy injuries under Ling Han’s attack.

“Good-for-nothings!” Mo Zhengxin said coldly, disdain written all across his face.

They couldn’t even take care of a human in the Deity Transformation Tier, so what were they if not good-for-nothings?

Ling Han took a glance at him with a smile, and said, “You say it like you’re not a good-for-nothing yourself.”

“I’m obviously not a good-for-nothing!” Mo Zhengxin said in all seriousness.

“Whether or not you’re a good-for-nothing isn’t decided by words alone.” Ling Han beckoned him with his finger. “Come, let me beat you till your convinced, letting you know that you yourself are a good-for-nothing as well.”

“Is that possible?” Mo Zhengxin shook his hands, turning them into dragon claws. “You cultivated out the heart of martial arts, controlling the weapons in the world, but my weapon is my transformed body, can you influence it?”

Ling Han looked at him a few more times, and said, “You seem to be quite confident in yourself?”

“Obviously, I’m from west sea’s Mo Family’s most outstanding generation, only twenty-seven years old now, yet already at the ninth layer of the Heaven Tier, and only one step away from the Shattering Void Tier,” Mo Zhengxin said proudly.

This indeed was impressive, enough to take pride in.

“This one step possibly might not even be crossed in your entire life. Relying on bloodline, and limited by bloodline, accomplishments are destined to be limited if you’re unable to walk your own path,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Talk is cheap, a mere human dares to brag without shame!” Mo Zhengxin attacked, arriving before Ling Han in a single stride, reaching out with his right clawed hand, and attacking straight at Ling Han’s face.

If this attack were to hit firmly, then with the dragon claws’ sharpness, even Ling Han’s body would be heavily injured.

Ling Han reached out with his hand and grabbed at the dragon claw.

“How dare you!”

“You seek death!”

Mo Yuanming and the three others snorted. Dragon claws were such a supreme weapon, yet you dared try to take it head on—you really didn’t know how to write the word “death”!

Pa!

Ling Han grabbed the dragon claws, a faint golden light emitting from his left hand. It was the Diamond Body.

He caught it, as steady as a great rock!

How could that be!?

Mo Yuanming and the three others eyes almost popped out. How could this happen? For a human to grab onto a dragon claw with his bare palm, was there still natural order? Was there still the law of the land?

F*****!
