Chapter 3472: Throne

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They walked up the craggy mountain path, and soon arrived at the summit.

However, there was a flight of steps at the summit, and at the top of the steps was a massive throne.

Obviously, the true summit should be that throne.

Whoever could ascend this peak would be the representative of this peak.

Ling Han had the Calabash Brothers come out, and the babies were not interested in ascending the peak, and sat at the sidelines.

At present, they did not need any great opportunities. As long as they could grow normally, they would be able to become elites of Celestial Path. Even if they were given Celestial pills, it would not be of much significance.

Ling Han began to ascend the mountain. After taking a step, weng, light and shadow instantly appeared ahead of him, turning into a human figure that was flickering with golden light. It shot out a punch at him.

Peng!

Ling Han raised a fist to parry, yet was directly sent flying by this punch.

What great power.

Ling Han stood still, and the golden figure on the steps also slowly disappeared without a trace.

He once again ascended the steps, and the golden figure appeared once more. It had still thrown a punch at him.

Ling Han didn’t plan to face this attack head-on. Instead, he charged toward the throne at the top.

As long as he sat down, perhaps everything would be settled, so what was the point of wasting time?

However, he had not rushed up a few steps, when another golden figure appeared, and shot out a heavy punch at him.

Ling Han couldn’t dodge this punch.

Peng, he immediately rolled down the steps. Thankfully, the two golden figures did not pursue him. Instead, they slowly disappeared.

Hiss, Ling Han gritted his teeth, and slowly got to his feet. This punch had really caused him a lot of pain, and even his bones had broken.

He was now an Extreme Bone Tier elite, and had undergone four bone changes. His bones should be incredibly tough, yet they were broken with a single strike, which showed how terrifying the destructive power of the golden figure was.

You dare to hit our father?” Eldest Baby was furious, “Let’s go!”

The seven toddlers charged forward, and golden figures immediately appeared. Furthermore, there just happened to be seven of them, and a battle royale immediately began.

The Calabash Brothers all showed their Mystical Power. Some had boundless strength, some were aiming straight for weak points, some were spitting fire, some were spitting water, some were impervious to weapons, some absorbed all attacks and reflected them completely.

It wasn’t long before the seven toddlers achieved victory in the first round, destroying the golden figures. However, before they could take more than a few steps, new golden figures appeared, continuing to snipe them.

The babies were very awesome, but they had only defeated three waves of golden figures, before they were blasted down from the steps.

Thankfully, they were clever enough, and did not suffer any injuries.

“Damn it, this is too unfair!” Second Baby cried out loudly. “Our battle prowess is only equivalent to the peak stage of the Enlightenment Tier, but afterwards, figures with battle prowess of Enlightenment Tier actually popped out. We’re ’ no match!”

“Heng, heng, we’ll grow up a bit more, and we’ll definitely win!” Seventh Baby said, hands on her hips.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “You guys are already awesome enough, take a rest first.”

As he recovered, he kept looking at the top of the steps. Obviously, the enemies that appeared here would become more and more powerful the higher they went. This should also be based on cultivation level, but at first, it was very powerful, and then became more and more powerful. It had even leaped up to the battle prowess of Enlightenment Tier.

Ling Han thought for a moment. The first light figure he encountered should have the power of the fourth level of Inscription Tier, and was indeed superior to him. If he didn’t use a secret technique, he would naturally be outmatched in a head-on clash, and if it was the second light figure, this power should be Five Inscriptions.

The problem was that the second human figure was only one fourth of the way up the stairs. In other words, even more powerful golden figures would appear and snipe him.

With his current cultivation level, it seemed like he would not be able to win.

He would give it a try first.

Ling Han didn’t wait for his bone injuries to recover. Injured tendons and broken bones would take a hundred days to recover, and even if he had Spiritual Herbs, it would take at least ten days to heal completely.

He could temporarily use his mystical power to stabilize his broken bones, and it would not affect his battle prowess too much.

Ling Han ascended the steps and began his challenge.

Weng, the golden figure appeared again.

Ling Han threw a punch. This time, he used the Demonic Monkey Fists, and his might soared.

Peng, peng, peng! With a series of attacks, the golden figure exploded.

How could a mere Inscription Tier cultivator be a match for Ling Han?

He continued ascending the stairs, and after taking a few steps, a second golden figure appeared.

Five Inscriptions.

Ling Han was still unafraid. Previously, he had been wounded with a single punch from the other, and it was only because he had been struck suddenly.

He also replied with a punch of his own. With the support of the Demonic Monkey Fists, his battle prowess far surpassed Five Inscriptions.

After a few punches, the second golden figure was also shattered.

He continued forward, and when he was about halfway up the stairs, a third golden figure appeared. This time, the golden figure’s battle prowess was even stronger, but it still hadn’t reached the extent of Enlightenment Tier.

Six Inscriptions?

Ling Han’s fighting spirit blazed. He circled around and fought for a while then used Frequency Attack, clashing head-on with this human figure.

This kind of direct confrontation was the easiest to decide the victor. As expected, in just a few hundred punches, Ling Han once again achieved victory. Judging from the distance, there should be two golden figures that would come to snipe him.

Ling Han walked a few more steps, and sure enough, a fourth golden figure appeared.

This golden figure did not use fists again. Instead, he brandished a golden spear, and stabbed it towards Ling Han.

Ling Han drew out the battle hammer. Zi, it was instantly activated, and greeted the incoming attack of the spear.

Peng!

Amidst a heavy blow, lightning and golden light flashed madly. Ling Han only felt a sharp pain in the web between his thumb and forefinger, and the battle hammer almost slipped out of his grip. He retreated continuously, directly retreating down the steps to the bottom.

He bared his teeth, and raised his hand. The web between his thumb and forefinger had already split open, and was presently bleeding.

This shadowy figure was definitely an Enlightenment Tier elite.

Ling Han was very strong, and very freakish, but he did not possess the strength to battle against power that was superior to him by two major tiers.

Absolute Fairness?

Fine, let’s give it a try.

Ling Han suddenly realized that if they were at the same cultivation level, he wouldn’t need as long as 10 minutes to kill two opponents.

Xiu, he charged forward again. The three light figures from before were naturally dealt with quickly, and when the fourth light figure appeared, he immediately activated Absolute Fairness.

However, the shadowy figure’s spear was still incredibly powerful as it pierced over, and its might was not reduced in the slightest.

Peng!

Ling Han was sent flying again. The wound on the web between his thumb and forefinger immediately split open, and blood gushed out.

F***, this shadowy figure still had the battle prowess of an Enlightenment

Tier elite, and was not suppressed at all.

Absolute Fairness was actually ineffective against it?

True, the formations here were obviously of a higher level than High Level, so it was too easy for Absolute Fairness to lose effect.

Though he had figured it out, the problem was, how was he supposed to deal with it?

He was only at the Fourth Extreme, and ito match an Enlightenment Tier elite, perhaps even a Sixth Extreme wouldn’t be able to.

He would either have to break through to Inscription Tier, or take one step further, break through the limits, and advance into the Seventh Extreme that might not even exist. Otherwise, there was absolutely no way he could match Enlightenment Tier elites.

Furthermore, this was only the fourth light figure. There should be a fifth light figure, whose abilities were stronger.

They had already come so far, so Ling Han naturally couldn’t give up.

Fine then, he would just cultivate here and attempt to break through to the Seventh Extreme!

He began to cultivate. Several days later, he heard footsteps. A second person had arrived here..
