2951 Challenge at Every Step

Ling Han roared with laughter, saying, “What dogsh*t brilliance? Come on, show me?”

Thank you readers!

“Die!”

The three Sixth Tier monsters charged over, with each of them unleashing their full strength. They were going to put Ling Han under so much pressure that he would have no time to tear open the Void the flee.

Unfortunately for them, Ling Han’s strength had grown by a considerable amount during the past several million years, even though his cultivation hadn’t improved by much. While he was still unable to rival those at the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, he could at the very least defend against them.

Ling Han was at a disadvantage, but there was no need for him to worry about getting killed.

!!

Not in the short term, at least.

“Capture those two!” Huangfu Dongyue said with a wave of his hand. He then charged toward the Empress and Hu Niu with the seven other people.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t allow them to succeed. He forcefully broke free before drawing the Empress and Hu Niu into the Celestial Guest Residence. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Standing tall and proud, he said, “If you want to fight, then come at me!”

“Ling Han, your treason will only lead to death!” Huangfu Dongyue said.

“How noisy!” Ling Han said with a humph. He then threw a powerful punch.

Huangfu Dongyue naturally couldn’t block this attack. However, the three Sixth Tier monsters immediately stepped forward to block Ling Han’s attack for him.

“Why struggle like this?” Huangfu Dongyue asked with a smile. “Once you return to the main body, you’ll be able to obtain unfathomable power. At that time, you’ll be able to crush those who dared to humiliate you under your feet.”

His words of persuasion naturally weren’t sincere. Instead, he was purposely trying to shake Ling Han’s will. Simply listening to him would affect Ling Han’s battle prowess by a tiny bit.

He was already at a disadvantage, so this small effect would be magnified into something much greater.

However, Ling Han remained extremely calm and composed as he continued to swing his fists. From time to time, he would also release his 200 or so dimensions, and their power was so overwhelming that even the three Sixth Tier monsters would be slightly affected.

In fact, the three Sixth Tier monsters would be less afraid of him if he directly used these dimensions as weapons. After all, shattering these dimensions would only be a matter of time.

However, Ling Han was only using these dimensions to threaten them, and this made their situation far more difficult. Ling Han’s quick release and retraction of these dimensions would cause their attacks to go awry and their reactions to become slow. This affected them greatly.

At the same time, this also allowed Ling Han to continue his resistance. Otherwise, regardless of how freakish he was, he would still be unable to rival three monsters at the peak stage of the Sixth Tier. To say nothing of three, he wouldn’t even be able to rival one.

However, no matter how he resisted, the three Sixth Tier monsters still maintained an absolute advantage. It wasn’t long before Ling Han was riddled with wounds, falling into a precarious situation.

‘Let’s not play around anymore,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

If he continued to battle, however, that wouldn’t be testing his battle prowess anymore. Instead, that would be seeking death.

Ling Han fled, and the three Sixth Tier monsters gave chase.

They were all lightning-quick, with the boundless mountains and rivers being left far behind them. Interestingly, they would occasionally come to a screeching halt, and this was because they had to stop before the devastating storms of energy.

Even Sixth Tier elites would be severely wounded if they tried to forcefully travel through these storms of energy.

These storms didn’t favor anyone, and they would stop Ling Han at some times, while they would stop the three Sixth Tier monsters at other times. Broadly speaking, these storms were still relatively fair. Thus, the distance between them neither grew nor shrunk.

“Ling Han!”

A person suddenly appeared in front of Ling Han.

Xin Qihu!

Without saying anything else, he directly launched an attack at Ling Han.

Boom!

This was a devastating attack unleashed by someone with a battle prowess at the peak stage of the Sixth Tier.

Ling Han had no option but to engage in battle with Xin Qihu. His body shuddered, and his internal organs were also in turmoil, causing him to feel extremely uncomfortable. It was also at this moment that the three Sixth Tier monsters arrived.

Boom!

Even though these three monsters were Hysteria’s subordinates, and even though they were hostile to all beings from the Genesis World, it was quite clear that they still understood what was more important. Right now, their attention and attacks were fully focused on Ling Han.

“What’s wrong? Having an internal squabble?” Xin Qihu said as he unleashed another attack at Ling Han. However, he also unleashed an attack at the three monsters.

“Are you stalking me or something? Why do I see you everywhere?” Ling Han said with a humph. He hurriedly stabilized his body, allowing his battle prowess to reach its full potential.

He was being attacked by four Sixth Tier elites now, so he was at an even greater disadvantage. Using his dimensions to buy a bit of time, he immediately turned around to flee again.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Xin Qihu and the three Sixth Tier monsters immediately gave chase, not forgetting to battle each other at the same time. This caused the situation to become incredibly chaotic.

However, it also bought Ling Han more time to escape, allowing him to pull further and further away from his enemies.

“I’m genuinely disliked by both sides now, huh? Everyone wants to kill me…” Ling Han murmured. However, his eyes were filled with fighting spirit. The more pressure he was under, and the more unfairly he was treated, the more motivated he would become. This would allow him to dig even deeper to realize his potential.

He cultivated in seclusion for a short time, digesting the comprehension that he had gained from the battle. This kind of life-and-death situation would allow him to gain the most enlightenment.

He started to deduce the Heavenly Venerable Seals.

After reaching the Third Tier, Heavenly Venerates would have the right to deduce Heavenly Venerable Seals. Regarding how many of them could succeed and what grade of seals they would be able to deduce, this was a completely different matter altogether.

Ling Han possessed far too many Heavenly Venerable Seals right now, so he wanted to use a seventh-grade seal that he already owned to deduce a neighboring seal.

If he succeeded, he would be able to obtain more combination seals. This was far more useful than deducing a random seal.

Why didn’t he try to deduce a first-grade seal?

Heh, just how difficult would that be? Perhaps he could succeed, but that would perhaps take 100,000,000 years or even one billion years. Ling Han felt like improving his cultivation was more important.

After 30,000 years, Ling Han successfully deduced a third-grade seal.

If news of this traveled out, countless people’s jaws would drop in shock. To deduce a Heavenly Venerable Seal in just 30,000 years?

“I have far too many advantages. There are countless dimensions inside me, and they’re already showing signs of growing into a Genesis World. Combined with the resonance with the other Heavenly Venerable Seals and my comprehension from that battle, I only needed 30,000 years to deduce this Heavenly Venerable Seal,” Ling Han said to himself.

Having fully digested the comprehension from his battle against the four Sixth Tier elites, Ling Han chose to exit seclusion.

He continued to look for raw stone veins, yet he discovered that this place was gradually becoming livelier and livelier, with more and more Sixth Tier elites arriving. Perhaps they were also here to look for raw stones, but if they encountered Ling Han, they definitely wouldn’t mind unleashing a few attacks.

Ling Han’s situation became dire, with an enemy around almost every corner. This was because this broken dimension was far too small.

Several years later, Ling Han found a spatial passageway that allowed him to enter a different dimension.

He was most likely the first person to enter this dimension as there was no sign of excavation in the surroundings.

“Perhaps I can advance to the peak stage of the Fourth Tier here.”

Ling Han immediately began to search for veins of ore.
