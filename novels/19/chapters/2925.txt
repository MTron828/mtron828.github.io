2926 Feng Wuding

Before their world, there had actually been another world! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Had there not been over 10,000 Celestial Kings born here, everyone would’ve assumed it had just been a dream.

“Come with me,” Zhou Heng said to Feng Wuding and the other Celestial Kings from the previous Genesis World.

“No, it’s better to come with me,” another Sixth Tier elite said. Stepping out from the crowd, he added, “If you come with me, I will nurture you all with as many resources as you desire.”

!!

“Are you saying I can’t promise them that?” another Sixth Tier elite asked.

What was the most important thing in this world?

The strongest elites, as well as fresh recruits with unlimited potential.

All of them had originated from the previous Genesis World, and being selected meant that they were all the cream of the crop. While maybe not all of them would become a Seventh Tier, getting to Fifth Tier was no problem at all.

This was especially the case for Feng Wuding, the strongest prodigy in the previous Genesis World. He had received the inheritance from the previous Genesis World, and was even likely to surpass the Seventh Tier in the future. Just how important was this?

If any force were to add these geniuses to their ranks, they would definitely be able to become the strongest faction in the entire Genesis World in the future.

As such, even Sixth Tier elites were all desperately vying for talent.

One after the other, the Sixth Tier elites showed their “sincerity” as they extended the olive branch to the potential recruits.

The Celestial Kings were tempted. The other party was all Sixth Tier elites after all. No matter if it was the previous Genesis World or the current one, they were all close to the strongest level possible. As such, the Celestial Kings quickly made their decisions.

However, the most sought-after talent, Feng Wuding, remained quiet.

It was not that no one had invited him. On the contrary, a prodigy from the previous Genesis World like him was surely more coveted than the rest. However, he remained unperturbed, and didn’t deign to make his decision too lightly.

Evidently, he was still testing the waters, and wanted to see which side would be able to give him the better offer.

However, Lin Xiaoyang, Zhou Heng, and Chu Hao didn’t participate in this competition for fresh talent. Even though each faction needed new blood to bolster their forces, the same rules didn’t apply to Seventh-Tier forces.

It was because Seventh Tiers were completely indestructible, and never had to worry about the day they would wilt and die. Lin Luo was the perfect example of standing guard for eternity. Even if the Genesis World were to be destroyed, he had a high chance of surviving it. Why the heck would he ever need any fresh recruits then?

Moreover, Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and even Lin Youlian had a high chance of reaching the Seventh Tier. Thus, they didn’t need to go through so much trouble.

Ultimately, Feng Wuding decided to join the World Alliance where Yue Borong was at.

Ling Han was shocked as Yue Borong had a blood debt with him. Would this mean that Ling Han and Feng Wuding would become enemies from now on?

Ling Han was filled with excitement at the prospect of battling such a genius and seeing how high his battle prowess was.

After the recruitment, all the Heavenly Venerates returned to the Realm Battlefield. Battling Hysteria was the main priority, after all.

Ling Han went back to his daily life of either cultivating or killing on the battlefield. He wanted to take on another decapitation mission and figure out which of the people around him was the spy.

However, he didn’t want to take the risk.

What if he were to get ambushed by Hysteria?

This time, he wasn’t sure he would be able to escape with his life so easily.

As long as the spy was not found, he could not rest.

Because they had just retreated to the Flaming Frost Realm, and had the advantage of dimensional suppression, they were able to buy themselves around 2,000,000 – 3,000,000 years of time. Everyone was making the most of that time by intensely cultivating.

The geniuses from the previous Genesis World were truly extraordinary. In just a little over 100,000 years, at least 1,000 new Heavenly Venerates had cropped up among them. However, Feng Wuding was still surprisingly a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

This strongest prodigy was also blessed by the heavens. Previously, he had managed to gain the upper hand with a show of strength. Why couldn’t he do the same now?

When he found out about this, Ling Han said, “I think this is what makes Feng Wuding so terrifying. To a genius like him, the question isn’t about becoming a Heavenly Venerate, but rather how can he become the strongest Heavenly Venerate!”

The Empress replied, “You’re saying that he didn’t advance to become a Heavenly Venerate in order to accumulate strength?”

Another several hundred thousands of years had passed, more and more geniuses from the previous Genesis World had become Heavenly Venerates. After all, the reason they were chosen was because their potential was among the highest there was, and with them accumulating strength over countless epochs, it was not surprising to see them soar so quickly.

Moreover, the various great forces spared no expense at cultivating these new recruits. Back when they had been unearthing raw stones, they had been able to obtain many Great Herbs. While some of them had been used up, a large portion had been saved up. These were ultimately used to cultivate these young talents.

In just the span of 2,000,000 years, the quickest among them had already risen up to the Third Tier, with many following behind. It was truly astonishing.

At this moment, Feng Wuding finally broke through and became a First Tier.

The second he did, he challenged a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate to a battle, and managed to end the battle with a draw.

Everyone was completely flabbergasted by the result.

To be able to battle someone two entire levels higher than him, Feng Wuding was too powerful. Even Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu couldn’t compare.

“I think Ling Han can do that too,” someone mentioned Ling Han.

“Hmph, how can Ling Han possibly compare with Feng Wuding?”

“Feng Wuding was not only the strongest prodigy from the last Genesis World, he even managed to get its inheritance. He’s already this powerful after stepping into the Heavenly Venerable Tier. He is sure to become much stronger in the future.”

“That’s right. He is the heir of the Genesis World and the Son of Destiny. In the future, he will definitely reach greater heights than the Seventh Tier.”

Everyone concluded that Ling Han was no match for Feng Wuding. This had been decided by fate.

When Ling Han caught wind of the rumors, he simply gave a light laugh. He wouldn’t try to bully someone weaker. If Feng Wuding was to catch up to him in terms of cultivation level, then he wouldn’t mind sparring a little.

On the other hand, Feng Wuding simply scoffed.

“Oh? There was someone else who can battle someone two levels higher?” He smiled. “Once I enter the Third Tier, I’ll take him as my servant.”

His words were full of contempt towards Ling Han, which was then repeated verbatim by a servant. Soon, the news spread across the Realm Battlefield.

Hu Niu was completely furious. She wanted to go find Feng Wuding and give him a good beating. However, the latter was in the midst of cultivation somewhere else, so she couldn’t seek him out at all.

Truth be told, aside from Feng Wuding, all the other geniuses from the previous Genesis World were arrogant and thought little of this generation’s prodigies. Even though both sides had not had any major conflicts yet, there were plenty of minor scuffles.

A day would come when these minor scuffles would escalate into a full-blown battle.

In the next 1,000,000 years, Feng Wuding would display his terrifying potential. Not only did he rush up to Third Tier, he was just inches away from becoming a Fourth Tier.

The day had also finally come for him to enter the Realm Battlefield.

...

The entire base erupted with excitement when they heard the news.

One was the strongest prodigy from the previous Genesis World, while the other was the unbeatable monster from the current generation. Now that the two of them were about to come face to face, which of them would be the stronger one?

Everyone was filled with anticipation towards this battle.
