Chapter 148: A Magnificent Pervert

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“I have already given face to Lady Yan before.” Feng Yan smiled softly, “That was why I did not make a move at Cherishing Flower Pavilion, and deliberately waited here instead.”

He had power, talent, and patience. He was indeed a difficult opponent.

That’s how Ling Han thought of him. In truth, he even admired Feng Yan’s character quite a bit. Unfortunately, before the two of them had even met, they had already stood on opposing sides, and were already destined to be foes.

In his last life, even if there were a few hundred million Feng Yans added together, they would not be a match for even just a look from him, but now… Ling Han’s face grew serious. The seventh layer of Gushing Spring Tier possessed even the ability to kill him instantly.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you—temporarily that is!” Feng Yan smiled, but this smile was filled with pressure and domineering.

“Feng Yan!” Yun Shuang Shuang called out loudly. That was really enough. One after another, they all did not care about the Cherishing Flower Pavilion, and did not even pay any attention to an outstanding beauty like herself. She was practically about to become extraordinarily furious.

Feng Yan did not even spare her a glance, and simply slashed his saber through the air.

“Shua,” a flash of Saber Qi danced quickly towards them, as if it was a raging dragon!

When cultivation levels were different, the power behind the Saber Qi would of course be different. Ling Han was aware that the six flashes of Sword Qi he had now could not match even one tenth of the power behind this single flash of Saber Qi. However, there was no such thing as giving up without even battling in his mind.

Ling Han gave a loud shout, drew his sword and parried. Six flashes of Sword Qi shot forwards unhindered.

“Peng!”

Without any surprise, he was flung away by this blow from the saber. The box in his left hand instantly flew out of his grasp, but his right hand still firmly held onto his sword.

As a swordsman, he would keep his hold on his sword as long as he was still alive!

“Cough!” he spat out a mouthful of blood. When he looked down, he could see there was a deep wound on his chest, from which blood was gushing out steadily. However, Indestructible Heaven Scroll was already circulating, and this wound was slowly shrinking in size.

“En?” a hint of seriousness flickered through Feng Yan’s eyes, “Six flashes of Sword Qi? You are more powerful than I expected! Additionally, your physical body seems to be much stronger than any normal martial artist of Element Gathering Tier! I had intended to wound you severely with this slash.”

Even so, his tone remained completely calm, as if everything was under his control.

Ling Han wiped off the blood at the corner of his lips, stood proudly, flicked his sword, and said, “I admit that you are currently more powerful than I am. I would need about half a year to be able to surpass you and firmly trample upon you.”

“Ha, hahahaha!” Feng Yan was stunned for a moment, before suddenly laughing loudly. He nodded, and said, “You are indeed extraordinarily talented to be able to form six flashes of Sword Qi, and are indeed much more powerful than I was in the past. However, you will not have the chance to live for another half year. Within three months, at most, even if you were in the Imperial Palace of Rain Country, I would be able to seize you and you will die by my saber.”

Yun Shuang Shuang who had been standing at one side was completely dumbstruck and could not say anything at all.

In her mind, these two people were both maniacs.

Feng Yan was so strong, yet Ling Han actually said that he would be able to catch up to him in a half year’s time and even trample on Feng Yan. And Feng Yan was even more of a maniac to say that even if Ling Yan hid in the Imperial Palace, he would be able to seize him and kill him. What treasonous words was he saying?

“Oh, then bring it on, and let me experience the power of the so-called strongest genius of Rain Country!” Ling Han’s battle intent had shot skywards. He had his own trump cards in hand. Even if it was merely the Strange Fire, if Feng Yan was caught by the Strange Fire through close contact, even Spiritual Ocean Tier elites would die, what more a mere Gushing Spring Tier martial artist like Feng Yan.

“You do not have to try to anger me. Since I have said that I will be giving you a thrashing tonight, then it would be useless even if you kneel down and beg for mercy!” Feng Yan said calmly. Another slash from his saber shot out, and a terrifyingly powerful flash of Saber Qi danced forwards.

“Peng!”

Ling Han was once again flung away, but he was much better prepared this time. His sword managed to block an uncountable number of power ripples, and actually dispersed about over half of the power behind this one slash. Though he was still flung away and spat blood, the injuries he had suffered this time were much lighter when compared to the previous time.

Feng Yan could not help but look astonished at this, and said, “I only attacked once, and you were able to capture the moves of my saber, and use a very wonderful way to defend yourself. You indeed deserve the name of genius! Now, I am beginning to waver. A genius like you that could become a threat to me, should I take the chance to eliminate you as soon as possible?”

When he said the last words, he did not hide the killing intent brimming in his heart at all.

Ling Han’s left hand moved slightly. Strange Fire could be flung out at any time—this was currently his greatest killing move.

Feng Yan leaped down from the wall, and strode towards Ling Han. Every step he took felt like it caused the ground to have a slight tremor. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yun Shuang Shuang was shocked, then realized that it was not the ground that was trembling, but it was her heart that was actually influenced by Feng Yan’s movements without her knowledge.

This guy was really powerful!

However, she still stepped out courageously and stood in front of Feng Yan, for Ling Han was the key to the concoction of Permanent Pill. This was the most important thing to Lady Yan, and even if she lost her life in the process, she wanted to make sure Ling Han was safe.

“Move away!” Ling Han shouted. He had not fallen to the level that he needed a woman to die in his stead.

“I will not wound you for the sake of Lady Yan!” Feng Yan’s left hand flashed out and a powerful force shot out. Yun Shuang Shuang was instantly pushed to one side, her face pale and she couldn’t manage to get her breath back, which caused her great suffering.

A martial artist of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier against an opponent in the seventh layer of Gushing Spring Tier; this was the only possible outcome.

Feng Yan continued to walk towards Ling Han, his expression cool. There was no way to tell what he was thinking or intending to do. Was he going to simply injure Ling Han, or… kill him?!

Ling Han waited with utter seriousness. This was an opponent that was so strong that it was enough to cause one to lose all hope.

“Yi, this little sister is really very pretty. Can you let me take a look at your breasts?” it was at this moment that a voice was suddenly heard, and a figure appeared. This newcomer was currently looking at Yun Shuang Shuang with lecherous eyes, and his fingers were wriggling like noodles, as if he was about to grab onto her at any moment.

Yun Shuang Shuang experienced a scare, and quickly shielded her breasts with her arms, rapidly taking a step backwards.

“If I can’t look at your breasts, then I would be fine with your bottom, too!” this person settled for the next best thing, as if he was a person that was very easy to deal with.

This was a young man that looked to be only in his twenties. He was not a hideous man, but could not be considered handsome either. He simply looked like the most common of men that could be found on the streets. A perverted smile was all over his face, and he was practically salivating at Yun Shuang Shuang’s *******.

Yun Shuang Shuang was so scared that she took another step back.

“Good Little Sister, don’t be scared. I’m just a pervert, not a bad person!” this person said with a very guiltless expression.

Pei, a pervert could act so confident as if he was in the right?!

Feng Yan’s eyes narrowed. With his ability, he actually did not manage to see how this person had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and now he could not even tell how powerful this person was. A strong feeling of dread uncontrollably rose up within him.

“How do I address you?” he asked.

“Don’t speak to me, you ugly man!” the person spat out, his eyes still completely focused on Yun Shuang Shuang, “Little Sister, what color are your underpants?”

Yun Shuang Shuang turned completely pale, and Feng Yan’s expression did not look too nice either. He said in a deep voice, “Are you intending to defend this brat?”

“Just blabbering on and on, don’t you know that’s very annoying?” the person turned around to sweep a look over Feng Yan, “If you keep chattering, I will thrash you to the point you become even uglier!” he turned around to look back at Yun Shuang Shuang, and said, “Little Sister, my name is Gu Feng Hua, a magnificent pervert, a one hundred percent pervert!”

He said proudly, as if being able to become a pervert was a very honorable achievement.
