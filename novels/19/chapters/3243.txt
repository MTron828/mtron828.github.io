3244 Enemies on a Narrow Road

Ling Han was astounded. Hearing Hu Can’s words, not only did he want to kill Butler Mu, he even wanted to kill Feng Ruoxian.

However, although Feng Zisheng was dead, he could still be considered a feudal official. He ruled a city and a region, and he had even died in the city. The Dark North Nation would definitely praise him as a hero and role model and publicize his heroic deeds wantonly.

If Hu Can dared to hurt Feng Ruoxian, he would naturally become the public enemy of the Dark North Nation.

Unless… he killed her to silence her.

Hiss, was there a need for that?

Butler Mu’s expression changed drastically, and he said balefully, “If you dare to have any ill intentions towards Young Miss, I’ll kill you even if I have to die.”

“Alright, alright, alright. Butler Mu, stop scaring people.” Hu Can waved his hand and said, “However, it seems that the rumors are true!”

He smiled and said unhurriedly, “It’s said that you were saved by Feng Zisheng, and then to repay kindness, you were willing to be a slave. However, I don’t believe it. There are many ways to repay kindness. An Extreme Bone Tier elite actually needs to be a slave to repay kindness?”

“There’s a rumor that Butler Mu admires Feng Zisheng’s wife and has deep feelings for her. That’s why he’s a slave. It’s just so that he can see the person he loves day and night.”

“Hehe, I really believe that now.”

After hearing his words, Butler Mu immediately revealed an indescribable expression. It was as if he was reminiscing and nostalgic, but also as if he was recalling a painful memory.

“Uncle Mu, you—” This was also the first time Feng Ruoxian had heard of such a thing, and she couldn’t help but widen her eyes.

However, there was a voice in her heart telling her that this should be true because Butler Mu treated her better than even her father. No matter what request she had, he would agree.

Especially after her mother passed away, Butler Mu would often look at her in a daze. Now that she thought about it, it was very clear that Butler Mu was reminiscing about her deceased mother.

Ling Han was also surprised. No wonder Butler Mu was so concerned about Feng Ruoxian’s matter, and the feeling he gave off was even more of a father than her own father, Feng Zisheng. It turned out that there was such a relationship.

“Looks like the rumors are true!” Hu Can shook his head and said, “Butler Mu, if you don’t want anything to happen to Missy, come, crawl underneath my cr*tch.”

This was a blatant humiliation. As long as one had some dignity, they would not accept such a great humiliation.

Butler Mu looked at Feng Ruoxian and said without hesitation, “Alright!”

Ling Han wanted to rush out. How could he possibly allow Butler Mu to suffer such a great humiliation?

There were not many people with such loyal love nowadays.

But before he could stand up, Hu Can shook his head and said, “Forget it, forget it. It’s too dangerous. If Butler Mu crawls under me and suddenly attacks me, I won’t be able to stop you.”

Butler Mu couldn’t help but change his expression. This was exactly what he had been planning.

He didn’t believe that Hu Can would let Feng Ruoxian off. Therefore, the safest way was to kill Hu Can to ensure Feng Ruoxian’s safety.

Hu Can thought for a moment and said, “This old man has thought of another idea.” He smiled and said, “When the beast tide came, everyone in the Hu Clan except this old man died. Therefore, this old man wants to marry Young Miss and prosper the Hu Clan’s bloodline.”

“Butler Mu, what do you think of this idea?”

He chuckled. “I’ve married Missy, so of course I’ll respect her and love her. Butler Mu, you don’t have to worry about me hurting her anymore, right?”

F*ck, this old bastard!

Feng Ruoxian couldn’t help but shake her head. Hu Can’s hair and beard were both white, and she didn’t know how old he was. The thought of “loving” such a person made her want to vomit.

She would rather die than marry such an old geezer.

Butler Mu’s expression turned incomparably dark as he balefully said, “Hu Can, you really want to die!”

“In any case, I’m the only single person left of the Hu Clan. What’s there for me to be afraid of?” Hu Can grinned and said, “All these years, I’ve been busy cultivating and haven’t enjoyed much. This beast tide has allowed me to see through things. Life needs to be filled with joy!”

Butler Mu didn’t say anything. He was extremely anxious.

His injuries were far more serious than Hu Can had thought. Otherwise, he would definitely risk his life. Most importantly, he could not risk his life even if he wanted to now.

‘What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?’

Cold sweat involuntarily rolled down his forehead. This was the only flesh and blood that An Yan had left in this world. He regarded her as his own daughter. Even if he were to be smashed into pieces, he wouldn’t let Feng Ruoxian suffer even the slightest bit of damage.

“Butler Mu’s silence means that he has agreed!” Hu Can laughed loudly as he slowly walked forward.

He was very careful, afraid that Butler Mu would trick him. He feared that Butler Mu was deliberately showing weakness, but in fact, he wanted to give himself a thunderous blow.

“Old geezer Hu, I really couldn’t tell. You’re already so old, yet you still want to harm the young lady!” A soft sigh came from the grass not far away.

Hu Can was shocked. He had always been very careful. Furthermore, Butler Mu had fallen here, and not anywhere else, so he was naturally vigilant. Now that he heard a fourth person’s voice, he felt as if he was facing a great enemy.

“Who is it?” he shouted. “Sneaking around, afraid to come out and face me?”

“Heh, we’re old friends. Don’t you recognize me?” Ling Han strode out.

“It’s you!” When Hu Can saw him, his eyes immediately turned red.

Originally, he wouldn’t have been the only one in the Hu Clan who could escape danger. At the very least, Hu Chaosheng and Hu Ronghai, two Blood Transformation Tier elites, would definitely have had a chance to escape.

However, Hu Chaosheng was only in First Change, and had been injured by Ling Han. Although Hu Ronghai was slightly stronger, his arms were completely crippled. How could he withstand the beast tide?

Thus, now that he saw Ling Han, Hu Can’s eyes turned red.

If not for Ling Han, he would not be the only one left. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ling Han!” Butler Mu was overjoyed. He had not expected to meet Ling Han here.

His spirit was greatly boosted as he straightened his upper body and said, “Take Young Miss away. I’ll hold this person back myself!”

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Butler Mu, this old man has committed a heinous crime. It’s better to kill him.”

Butler Mu was speechless. He naturally also wanted to kill Hu Can, but the problem was that he was already an arrow at the end of its flight, and Ling Han could at most barely contend against Hu Can. How could he possibly kill him?

Hu Can sneered. “I didn’t expect to meet a despicable brat like you here. Good! Good! Good! No one will come to save you today!”

“Come and fight!” Ling Han rushed out, his right hand brandishing the broken sword, while his left hand was hidden in his robes.

Hu Can didn’t dare to be careless, because he saw that there was a bulge in Ling Han’s robes. It was unknown what he was hiding, so he was naturally extremely careful.

He brandished his sword to meet Ling Han’s attack, while his left hand remained open, guarding against the ultimate move that Ling Han might unleash at any moment.

However, Ling Han still did not take his hand out, so he was even more cautious. What kind of ultimate move was he trying to pull out?

After a few moves, he became impatient, and his sword momentum suddenly became fierce.

Ling Han shouted lightly, and finally stretched out his left hand.

Instantly, there was a pig’s cry.
