Chapter 1703: Unlucky fool

Even Changsun Liang could not control his expression from darkening, his hands balled tightly into fists. He felt an urge to commit murder.

Ling Han pushed the table away, stood, and slowly walked out of the main hall.

At this time, everyone also flooded out in droves. They wanted to personally see how Ling Han was going to be utterly beaten and thrashed, or they would not be able to suppress this fury in their hearts; they would be burnt to the extent of suffering severe injury if that was the case[1].

The Empress walked lightly and elegantly. Her bearing was incredibly strong, and no one dared to walk into the vicinity of nine meters from her.

There was an exception.

Changsun Liang quickly walked forwards, and walked side by side with the Empress. His face held an expression of shock. Sometimes, there was no need for any actual exchange of blows between elites, and they would be able to distinguish the strength of the other upon contact with their aura.

The Empress was really very strong, so strong that he did not even have the absolute certainty that he could defeat her.

This did not make him jealous, but instead filled him with a boundless adoration for her.

How could an ordinary and common woman be qualified to be by his side?

This was the woman that he had always been waiting for, his destined partner.

Ling Han and the red-haired young man stood about 30 meters away from each other. The structures on this floating island were especially sturdy, and were completely capable of sustaining the impact caused by Genesis Tiers, so they did not need to battle in the skies.

Everyone was filled with confidence in the red-haired young man. Though he was only Changsun Liang’s attendant, being capable of becoming Changsun Liang’s attendant was enough proof of his strength.

...Even if an ordinary Saint King knelt on the ground and begged, Changsun Liang would not even give him a second look.

“Three moves!” the red-haired young man declared proudly. If he went all out, he could light up 71 holes on the holed pillar, which was not much inferior to many of the elites who had come today. Giving himself a limit of three moves was already giving himself an extremely wide space of allowance.

Yuan Xingping, Dan Yujing, Bian Zhe, and the others were all looking at Ling Han. From a certain aspect, they were of the same camp with Ling Han, so they naturally did not hope that Ling Han would lose. Yet the fact that Ling Han managed to come here was completely because of his connection with the Empress, so how could others trust in his battle prowess?

They hoped that he could withstand the full three moves. If he was defeated at the first blow, then even they would feel embarrassed.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Since you have already said three moves, then let it be three moves.”

Everyone did not know what his words meant. Only the Empress understood that Ling Han would only defeat his opponent by the third move.

“First move!” The red-haired young man moved. He tapped out a finger from a far distance. Boom

, a tiny flame surged out, and turned into a furious arrow that shot swiftly towards Ling Han at an incredibly quick speed.

The bloodline of the Dragon Tribe flowed in his veins. By nature, he was an expert in using fire. The power of this fiery arrow was very frightening.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and blew out a breath of air towards the fiery arrow. With a pop, the fiery arrow had been extinguished. He said, “Today is not my birthday, so there is no need to make me blow out any candles.”

“Yi?”

“En?”

“Ya?”

Everyone was also surprised. No one had thought that Ling Han’s strength was actually so powerful, being able to extinguish the red-haired man’s attack with a single strike, which was hard to believe or accept.

The red-haired young man was also slightly stunned, but did not think too much of it. The first strike was only a probe. He formed his hands into claws, and said, “Then come take my second strike.”

Boom, a powerful aura surged out of his body, and his spine protruded as if it had become a giant dragon.

“Heavenly Dragon Furious Claws!” He moved, his two hands pressing out. Immediately, multiple dragon scales covered them, and they had become the claws of a dragon. They were as long as 15 meters as they slashed towards Ling Han.

A True Dragon would soar above the Nine Heavens, and was praised as the strongest Divine Beast. This was not just mere words.

Multiple patterns of great dao appeared on his dragon claws, and the power of Regulation was channeled through them, so the mere sight of them would make anyone’s heart shudder.

This young man, no matter where he was, could be called a prodigy, but he was only the attendant of Changsun Liang in this place.

Ling Han smiled slightly. Darkness of the Paramount Night spread out, enshrouding the red-haired young man completely.

Under the boundless darkness, no one could see the red-haired young man any more. Even Changsun Liang was no exception, and he showed a hint of shock. He couldn’t help but ponder: if it was he that was fighting with Ling Han, and he was currently trapped by the darkness, how would he get out of this dilemma?

Peng!

In a mere instant, the red-haired young man had already charged out of the darkness, which made Changsun Liang involuntarily feel abashed, and he thought that he had made too big a fuss over a minor issue. Even Chi Long had so easily charged out, so what more when it was him.

But the smile that had just appeared on his lips was immediately withdrawn, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Because the red-haired young man had already charged over, yet the course of his attack had been diverted. At first, it was heading towards Ling Han, but now it was charging towards the side, and could not even touch even a corner of Ling Han’s robes.

The red-haired young man’s second strike was rendered unsuccessful once more.

Everyone was stunned. If Ling Han had seriously resolved the red-haired young man’s attack, then everyone could believe it no matter how strong his abilities were.

But he had simply blown out a breath of air, and created a darkness to resolve his attacks, and this was completely baffling to the others.

Unfathomable depths!

Hiss, could it be that he was also a super genius?

“Third strike!” The red-haired young man could already feel the pressure. He had struck two consecutive times, yet was not able to even sound out Ling Han’s true strength.

In this third strike, he definitely had to be cautious.

He began to build up power for a strong move, Dragon Qi ascending all over his body. Pa, pa, pa. His clothes were forcibly burst, but there was no need to worry that he would expose himself, because his body was already covered with a thick layer of dragon scales.

Ascending Dragon Strike!

This was his strongest and most powerful move; through burning his ancestral bloodline, he could deliver an earth-shattering blow. It could be said that with the explosive power of this move, he could even match an elite who could light up 80 holes.

Of course, he could only maintain such a state for three breaths’ time, at most.

“Charge!” He charged towards Ling Han, and with his furious shout, the roar of a dragon rang out through the heaven and earth.

Ling Han did not dodge or evade. When the red-haired young man pounced over, he stretched out his hand in a grab, and already grabbed the red-haired young man’s neck. With a casual shake of his hand, at least half the bones in the red-haired young man’s body was broken, and his limbs were instantly drooping like he was a dead man, no longer having the slightest bit of battle prowess left.

“Three moves,” he said with a smile, and then he threw the red-haired young man at Changsun Liang’s feet with a casual toss.

Only now did everyone know what Ling Han meant when he agreed to limit the battle to three moves.

...With his strength, he was completely capable of defeating the red-haired young man in a single move.

Yuan Xingping and Dan Yujing became cautious at the same time. Though they, too, could defeat the red-haired young man, they would definitely not have done it as easily as Ling Han had.

This was a strong foe!

Previously, they had worried that Ling Han was not strong enough, which would make them embarrassed as well, and now they felt that Ling Han was too strong, so he would become a threat to them.

A flash of anger involuntarily flickered in Changsun Liang’s eyes. Ling Han tossed the man right in front of him; what was he trying to say?

Was this a demonstration of force?

“Lord Holy Son, you have to give me justice!” Just at this moment, a person forcibly pushed his way through the crowd, his face filled with grievance.

It was Tong Lin.

Changsun Liang’s fury was irrepressible in the first place, and now, seeing the sudden appearance of Tong Lin, he couldn’t help but vent all his fury on the latter. Immediately, he shot out a palm strike.

Pa, Tong Lin was immediately rendered into a rain of blood, both his form and spirit destroyed.

This guy was really an unlucky fool.
