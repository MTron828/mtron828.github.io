Ling Han was unperturbed. He nodded, and said, “I am. What can I do for you?”

“You look like someone?” Niu Jianhua asked balefully.

“Someone as handsome and dashing as me actually has another person that looks like me?” Ling Han asked in surprise.

“Pu!” The little girl immediately burst into laughter. She had never seen such a shameless person.

Meanwhile, Niu Jianhua’s face twitched slightly. Why did he feel like he was angered the moment this person spoke?

From this aspect, he was really similar to that Can Ye.

They would rather kill the wrong person than let him go.

“Take him,” he commanded.

“Yes, Young Master!” The four old men all looked at Ling Han with contempt. Against a mere Enlightenment Tier, any one of them attacking would have a 90% certainty of victory.

Thus, they slowly approached, not worried at all. Instead, they gave Ling Han tremendous pressure.

Multiple thoughts streaked through Ling Han’s mind. Should he flee with the Imminent Skyline?

But putting aside the question of whether Imminent Skyline would be stopped by Celestial Path elites, even if it wasn’t, if he successfully escaped and then wrapped himself in Void Beast hide, then what about this little loli? Would she become a punching bag in his stead?

“You guys want to kidnap cute, beautiful, well-behaved, filial, um… as well as clever, brave Little Toffee?” the little loli asked shakily, looking like she had gotten a scare, but there was not the slightest bit of fear that Ling Han saw in her eyes. Instead, they were filled with excitement.

As an expert specializing in screwing others over, Ling Han was 100% sure that this little lolita was trying to cause trouble.

“Bad guy appears, summon the Divine Dragon, and transform!” The little loli shouted as she jumped, and even posed in a very embarrassing position.

However, inconceivably, a silvery light surged out of her body, or to be more precise, a button, and then surrounded her. When the silvery light dispersed, the little loli was already wrapped in a silver Battle Armor.

Seeing this, Niu Jianhua’s first reaction was that this was his second Battle

Armor that had been robbed from him..

However, he immediately rejected this idea. This Battle Armor was completely different. Although it was also silver in color, it was decorated with extremely exaggerated yet childish designs. He wouldn’t wear it even if he were beaten to death.

“Despicable and shameless kidnappers, I want to establish a large kingdom, and become a great Demon King. You guys can just become my servants!” The little loli was incredibly excited, and charged out.

With the help of the Battle Armor, her speed was astonishingly fast. With a peng, she sent an old man flying.

“Impressive!”

“This is the power of extreme dao!”

“Be careful, Young Master!”

The remaining three old men called out one after another, and the old man that had been sent flying also got back to his feet. There was blood at the corner of his lips. He was a Heavenly Dao Foundation, and being struck by the power of extreme dao was naturally enough to cause him a lot of trouble, and he was in great pain.

Niu Jianhua wore a solemn expression. Firstly, the little loirs current battle prowess was extremely astonishing, and secondly, the little loh clearly hadn’t stepped into Celestial Path yet, but with the help of a Battle Armor, she possessed the power of extreme dao. What did this signify?

The quality of this Battle Armor was astonishingly high, far surpassing his two sets of Battle Armor.

He felt an itch in his heart. If he could obtain it, just how far would he be able to increase his battle prowess?

Cauldron Forging Tier?

However, how powerful would the force behind someone who could casually produce this kind of Battle Armor be?

Moreover, could a young girl like her come out alone? The adults behind her were definitely nearby. If he forcefully seized it, he would be in serious trouble if this drew out her backer.

How could he have possibly imagined that this little loli was actually a problematic child that had ran away from home?

“Let’s go!” he exclaimed lightly, and took the lead to leave.

He only suspected that Ling Han was Can Ye. To offend a mysterious and powerful force for the sake of this suspicion was naturally not something that a smart person like him would do.

“Hahahaha, now you know how powerful this Demon King is!” The little loli jumped around, appearing to be incredibly excited.

Ling Han was speechless. Niu Jianhua was really unlucky to have encountered such an unreliable yet extremely powerful little loli.

Pa, silver light flickered on the little loli’s body, and the Battle Armor actually flowed like water, then turned into a shuttle.

“Yi, it’s changed into the wrong shape,” the little loli mumbled. Then, the shuttle changed again. Xiu, it suddenly disappeared.

Ling Han looked at the little loli, and did not speak. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Were you frightened by my battle prowess?” Tang Yun’er asked proudly.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Who was it that said that the shuttle’s energy was already used up?”

Previously, the Battle Armor was clearly a form of the shuttle, so how had it run out of energy?

The little loli stuck out her tongue. Oh no, she had been exposed.

A fawning smile appeared on her face, and she said, “Handsome Big Brother, what are you saying? I don’t understand!”

“Just hurry and go home.” Ling Han waved his hand dismissively. This problematic child had best return home quickly. If it was really because of her that Sect Master, or even Venerate Tier-level great elites had come, that would really be a big joke.

“No!” The little loli pouted in spite.

Ling Han spoke again, but she did not reply to him any further.

What a child.

Ling Han wiped his hands of the matter, “Since you are disobedient, I can’t be bothered to deal with you either.”

He took a step and left.

After taking a few steps, Ling Han turned around and saw that the little loh was following behind him. When she saw him look over, she hurriedly turned her head away, looking like she didn’t want to talk to him at all.

Ling Han left again, and the little loli still followed closely behind. “Why are you following me?” Ling Han stopped in his tracks and asked. Tang Yun’er wasn’t angry anymore, and she said, “Because you’re a good person, Handsome Brother!”

To be given a good Samaritan card by a six to seven year old little lolita, what kind of experience was that?

Ling Han shook his head and said, “How do you know that I’m a good person?

Let me tell you, I’m a big bad guy. I’ll do anything like murder, arson, and child trafficking!”

This time, the little loli was not the slightest bit afraid, and merely giggled, “It sounds very fun. When are we going to commit murder and arson? There would be blood when we commit murder. I’m scared of that, and arson is very fun. I often play around, but every time after I have played around, my mother would spank my behind.”

Ling Han placed a hand on his forehead. This wasn’t an ordinary problematic child, but an extremely problematic child.

What sins had he committed that he would actually bump into such a little ancestor?

“Sigh!” he sighed.

“Sigh.” The little girl also imitated his sigh.

By the looks of it, he had been tricked.

“Alright, I’ll take care of you for a few days, but you must contact your family as soon as possible, and have them pick you up!” Ling Han said. At present, he was worried about letting the little loli leave on her own, because who knew where she would fly to.

“Alright, since you insist on taking care of me, then I will reluctantly allow you to take care of me for two days.” The little loli looked very helpless.

“Don’t you try to take advantage of me when you’ve already gotten a good deal. Ling Han only felt his teeth ache as he gritted them.

“Hehe.” Tang Yun’er smiled ingratiatingly.

After walking for a while, the little loli said that her legs were sore and wanted Ling Han to carry her. After walking for a while, she was hungry again.

He had really picked up a little ancestor.

Ling Han secretly regretted his decision. Why had he been so curious just then? Why had he insisted on examining what was inside the shooting star? “Handsome Brother, look at the shooting star!” the little loli suddenly shouted..
