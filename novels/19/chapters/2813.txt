2814 Sealing the doorway

Ling Han did not pursue.

He was indeed stronger than Ping Xinghai, but this superiority was limited. Furthermore, there was a time restraint to using Heavenly Venerable Seals. If he could not suppress the other party in a short period of time, he himself would be falling into a disadvantage instead.

Ling Han shook his head. It could not be helped. Who asked him not to have mastered a higher-level Heavenly Venerate Technique?

He should improve his Fists of Fury so that it would correspond to his strength. Since he had already walked out a path of his own, he naturally should also create a corresponding technique.

In this instant, Ling Han was slightly distracted, thinking about how he was going to fuse Fists of Fury with this unique path that he had walked.

He shivered, and regained his wits.

Now was not the time to be thinking about this. Ling Han shook his head, and his feet moved. He began circling around this giant tomb, looking for an entrance.

Not too long later, he discovered that the entrance was a pair of stone doors. They were 300 meters tall and as wide as 210 meters, looking very grand.

Was this actually the tomb of a dead man… or a palace?

Ling Han was a little uncertain now. ‘You are already dead, yet you are still so particular?’

Forget it. It was not his tomb in any case.

The doors had already been pushed open, and Ling Han did not hesitate, either, striding inside. This doorway was huge, and the passage inside was also wide, matching the giant doorway. The walls glowed by themselves, but one could not see too far, as their range of vision was blocked by something.

‘Strange,’ Ling Han thought. As he walked, he stretched out his hand to touch the walls, sensing the surroundings around him.

What surprised him was that his divine sense was actually unable to penetrate this wall. It was like… hmm, the walls of the Realm Battlefield, which had the intercepting powers of the divine sense of a Heavenly Venerate. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Though this could not compare to Devouring Metal, it was still very valuable. It was the main material used to construct Heavenly-Venerable-Tier grand formations. In fact, it could even unleash the might of the Sixth Tier.

Ling Han felt an impulse to knock down this wall and stow it away. If it could be used to lay down defensive walls for his Ling City, then an ordinary Heavenly Venerate would need some amount of time to be able to invade successfully, leaving them enough time to take measures.

Forget it; he had best find that Heavenly Venerable Seal first. His own strength was what was most important.

Ling Han forcefully suppressed his impulse and strode forwards, but he had already set his eyes on this place.

The passageway was very long, and after walking for over 50 km, it suddenly became clear ahead. A massive plaza appeared, so high that the ceiling could not be seen. Because there was something invisible blocking their vision, one could only feel that it was very, very high.

Ling Han was not the only one in the plaza. Instead, there were a lot of people, who were divided into multiple smaller groups, scattered around here and there.

Looking around, he found out that every single person here was basically a Heavenly Venerate.

What were so many people waiting around here for?

Ling Han’s gaze wandered, and he very quickly located the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable and the others, so strode over to them.

“Have you made any gains?” the Empress asked. She and Hu Niu naturally knew Ling Han best, and knew that he had to have attained some kind of enlightenment when he had stayed behind and not gone with them previously.

Ling Han nodded. “Very good.” He paused, and then asked, “What is going on now?”

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable replied, “Though that ancient Heavenly Venerate has died, he has left behind his inheritance. Roughly speaking, there are a total of four areas here, and they are Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and Black Tortoise Palace, respectively.

“This is the White Tiger Palace.”

Ling Han gave an oh. No wonder they were able to find the right place just by wandering around. As it turned out, there were palaces in all four directions. Indeed, whichever direction they headed in, they would encounter a right place.

“Then why are we all standing here?” he asked.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable shook his head, and sighed. “To enter into the palace and obtain the inheritance, one would have to pass a test. But the problem now is that there are three Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates here, and they have worked together to seal off the path, not allowing anyone a chance to accept the test.”

“Oh?” Ling Han was surprised. These three people were really overbearing; could it be that they weren’t afraid that they would arouse public resentment?

Upon second thought, with how strong a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, one would be able to match 100 Third Tiers, and just how many Third Tiers were there in total here?

Hence, so what if the three of them were overbearing? At least they hadn’t chased everyone off.

“Then have they undergone the test?” Ling Han asked.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable shook his head. “How could they have not? It is just that they have not passed.”

Ling Han was surprised. Being able to become Fourth Tiers, just how powerful and domineering did they have to be, and the three of them actually hadn’t passed the test. This really was quite hard to believe. He asked smilingly, “Then what do they mean by this? They themselves were not able to obtain it, and forbade others from even trying?”

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable sighed, and replied, “Who knows what they’re thinking.”

“Perhaps they wish to summon their own disciples to try. After all, one does not allow benefits created by one’s own work to go to others,” the large black dog interrupted.

Ling Han nodded. “That may be possible.”

“Who cares what the possible reason is. Most importantly, these three bastards have blocked off the way, and we will not have any chance to make an attempt at all,” the large black dog cursed fluidly, filled with displeasure.

“Let me take a look,” Ling Han said. He walked forwards, and not too long afterwards, he saw three young people presently sitting in cross-legged positions. However, it was only their appearance that was young. Any one of them had incredibly deep, profound gazes, exuding an aura marked by vicissitudes of time.

Not far behind them, there was a completely silver palace that was built like a fierce tiger ready to pounce, as if it would erupt with a world-shaking strike at any instant.

The palace had no windows, and there was only a single entry, which was the main door.

But though the front door was open, it was a revolving light door. Clearly, entering through this door would not lead into the palace, but rather the “test” that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had spoken about.

…Because some people had already entered the light door before these three Heavenly Venerates had sealed off the doorway. However, they had all come back out after failing, and that was how others knew about the situation here.

Ling Han observed. Though these three Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates looked relaxed and laid back, and were sitting very casually, Ling Han was very clear. They had sealed off all routes that would lead to entering into the light door.

Wherever one was barging in from, they would be met with the combined attacks of the three Heavenly Venerates.

These were Fourth Tiers; what Third Tier would have this kind of courage to take their attacks head-on?

A Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate suddenly looked towards Ling Han, his eyes extremely sharp, causing pain in Ling Han’s own eyes as he was almost blinded. However, when this Heavenly Venerate saw that Ling Han was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, he withdrew his gaze after a single glance, not bothering to spare more attention on him.

Ling Han stepped back, channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. After a long while, the pain in his eyes finally subsided.

He had to admit that a Fourth Tier was indeed strong. The fact that Ling Han could kill He Liqun was completely due to the letter that Chu Hao had given to him. Otherwise, he would’ve only been able to last for 40-plus moves or so at most, and the combined forces of three great Fourth Tiers would be sufficient to kill him with a single blow.

If Ling Han took the risk and barged in forcefully, the chances of him directly collapsing would be even higher.

Thus, Ling Han returned to the Empress’s side.

“It is now a stalemate,” Ling Han said.

...

The Empress and the others nodded. Though they knew that Ling Han was very strong and extremely freakish, he was only a First Tier, after all. It was very normal that he would be unable to contend with a Fourth Tier.

“So we just give up?” the large black dog asked, unwilling to resign.

“Or should we go and take a look at the other three palaces?” Ling Jianxue suggested.

Ling Han thought for a while. “You guys go to the other three palaces first. I will wait here.”

“What are you waiting for?”

Ling Han slowly replied, “As long as another Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate arrives, even if he will also join this trio, there will definitely be a process before that. That moment is key to breaking this stalemate.”
