3084 True Identity

Was the truth finally about to be revealed?

What was Extermination’s true identity? Just who in the world was she?

Peng!

Extermination launched a palm strike, and Chong Yan’s left arm was instantly transformed into a cloud of blood.

Chong Yan howled in agony. However, more than the pain, he felt an unspeakable sense of terror.

The only thing that remained in this heaven and earth was void—nothingness. There was not an inkling of energy to be extracted. In other words, it would be impossible for him to recover from these grave wounds. At the same time, it would be impossible for him to regenerate any cultivation that he lost. How could he not feel utter despair?

Why was Extermination attacking him with such viciousness? Just how had he offended her to deserve such a wretched fate?

“The hope for a glorious future sits right here in front of you, yet I’m going to crush your dreams just like this. How does this feel?” Extermination laughed. She wasn’t targeting Chong Yan alone, and she was also targeting Big Dipper, Shatter Mountains, and the others. Their limbs and bodies had all been brutally mutilated by her.

Ling Han didn’t stop her. Chong Yan and the others had asked for this themselves. They had insisted on siding with a vicious monster.

Moreover, Ling Han also wanted to find out Extermination’s true identity. Thus, he would allow her to act smugly for the moment.

“Do you feel despair?

“Do you feel regret?”

Extermination sneered and taunted them each time she attacked them. Her words were dripping with venom, and Chong Yan and the others truly wanted to cry.

They had believed her dao oath, and they had thought that Extermination was truly going to cooperate with them. They hadn’t imagined that Extermination would turn hostile at the very last moment.

They were unwilling to accept this fate. However, what could they do now?

“At that time, you people lied to me and tricked me into blocking Extermination. You promised me that you would only unleash that attack after I retreated to a safe distance! Yet, what did you people do?” Extermination said coldly. Her voice was filled with resentment.

“Wh-what?!” Chong Yan and the others were stunned, so much so that even their heads went numb.

A name, a figure, suddenly flashed across their minds. They were filled with sheer disbelief.

“Y-y-y-y-you’re…

“Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand!”

‘What? Extermination’s true identity is actually Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand?

‘How is this possible?

‘Didn’t Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand die when the Genesis World of the last era was destroyed?’

Back then, Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand had held Extermination back, while Chong Yan and the others had detonated the Genesis World and unleashed an ultimate attack. Extermination had been blasted into pieces, and Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand’s divine sense had also been obliterated. Only an empty shell of his body had remained.

Now, however, they were being told that Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand was actually still alive? And he had actually taken over Extermination’s body?

This was astounding. This was inconceivable.

“That’s right. Do you people finally remember now?!” Extermination said as she roared with laughter. Her expression appeared especially sinister at this moment.

Pa!

She threw another palm strike, instantly crushing Chong Yan’s head.

“Oh, I’m truly sorry. I accidentally used too much force. Ah, you’re dead?” she said as she cocked her head and looked at Chong Yan’s lifeless body. Her strike had obliterated Chong Yan’s head and destroyed his mind. He was naturally as dead as could be.

Seventh Tier elites being indestructible and undying was now a fact of the past. There was no such thing as being indestructible and undying anymore.

Ling Han, Lin Luo, and the others all sighed in emotion. As it turned out, Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand hadn’t sacrificed himself willingly. Instead, he had been tricked by the others.

No wonder the current Extermination was so cruel and resentful!

Extermination turned around to look at Shatter Mountains and the others. A menacing smile appeared on her face, and she said, “However, you people would have never imagined this, huh? When the Genesis World was destroyed, all of the souls were fused together, including mine. Even though most of my soul was destroyed, a small sliver of it was fortunate enough to remain intact.

“Countless souls fused together, allowing my soul to recover. In fact, my soul became even more powerful than before.

“However, it was a shame that I was nothing more than a soul. I was like rootless duckweed[1].

“After countless years, I did indeed manage to find my own body. At that time, I could have chosen to become Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand again.”

Extermination paused for a moment and swept her gaze over Shatter Mountains and the others. Her voice dripped with bitter resentment as she continued, “However, choosing to become Yellow Sand would mean that my strength would remain the same as before. If that were the case, then how could I repay your ‘kindness’?

“So, I found Extermination’s body and used the remnant power of the Genesis World to repair it.

“Do you know how long I spent?

“3000 epochs!

“Don’t be surprised. Even though the history of this Genesis World isn’t that long, there was a gap of more than 2000 epochs between this Genesis World and the previous Genesis World.

“Why was I able to persist? It was because of my resentment toward you people. I was unwilling to accept my fate. I wanted to seek revenge!

“I repaired Extermination’s body and became its host. However, far too long had passed already. Moreover, the old Genesis World had already lost all of its life force. Without a special trigger, I was also unable to ‘revive.’

“It was at this moment that I discovered that not only had I lived, but Extermination had also lived. It had transformed into Hysteria.

“So, I activated the power of the Genesis World of the last era and unleashed waves of energy to draw those fools over. I used them to reactivate that broken world.

“If I hadn’t done this, then I would have slumbered in the void forever.

“As for what happened afterward, I’m sure that I don’t need to explain. All of you already know.

“The funniest thing is, before your minds fell into a slumber, I imprinted a mark of life on them and purposely ‘revealed’ that there was a huge secret hidden in Feng Wuding’s body. You were convinced that he could lead you to the World’s Core and help you advance to the Eighth Tier.

“Absolutely hilarious! I didn’t give this much thought at that time, because I didn’t think that I would be able to live again. I simply wanted to play a sick joke on you people. Just how disappointed would you feel after finding out that it was all a lie?

“To be tricked by someone who had died countless years ago… Even if I had been dead, I would have still laughed in my grave!

“However, I still prefer the current situation. What do you people say?”

Extermination finally stopped speaking. There was a complicated look of satisfaction on her face as she looked at Shatter Mountains and the others.

Once the truth was revealed, everything suddenly became understandable and simple.

The current Extermination was Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand, the person who had been screwed over by them in the past. Thus, “she” was filled with bitter resentment and a thirst for revenge. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Simply killing Chong Yan and the others was already unable to satiate her thirst for revenge. Thus, she had meticulously formulated and executed a plan, extending her lie that pertained to the World’s Core. She had convinced Chong Yan and the others that they could eventually advance to the Eighth Tier. It was also because of this that they had willingly joined her side.

In reality, Chong Yan and the others had indeed provided her with a lot of help. Otherwise, Hysteria wouldn’t have been able to engulf the entire Genesis World so quickly.

“You people don’t need to dream about entering the new world, nor do you need to dream about advancing to the Eighth Tier!” Extermination said calmly. “Alright, you people already know the truth now, so I assume you can die in peace?”

“Yellow Sand, you’re truly vicious, and you’re truly able to endure hardship!” Shatter Mountains spat through gritted teeth. In order to exact revenge, Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand had even been willing to enter the body of a woman. Just this alone was already astonishing enough.

Not only that, but she had never revealed an iota of resentment or hatred toward her five mortal enemies, either—she had appeared normal the entire time. Her ability to conceal her true emotions was truly terrifying.

After some further thought, however, this also made sense. She had already suffered through 3000 epochs by herself, so what else was there that she couldn’t endure?

“Die!” Extermination roared as she unleashed an attack at Shatter Mountains and the others.

Peng!

There was a tremendous shake, and a look of astonishment spread across Extermination’s breathtakingly beautiful face.

Her strike… had been blocked by Ling Han!
