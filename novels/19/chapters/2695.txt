2696 Ninth Heaven!

Peng!

The golden arrow landed on Ling Han, and suddenly the golden pattern dimmed immediately, their golden light disappearing in an instant.

The defense formed by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had already been pierced through.

The golden arrow sank into Ling Han’s body, but there was half that was still exposed, and its momentum was finally expended completely.

!!

Pa! The golden arrow trembled, instantly turning into bits of light.

This was not because its energy had been exhausted, but rather because it had hit its target, and the martial intent contained within was beginning to unleash its might.

Ling Han felt his mind shake and almost explode.

This impact was too terrifying. It was like a Heavenly Venerate had barged into his mind, and was attacking wildly within his mind. If it were not because Ling Han had experienced too many spiritual attacks in the Celestial King Graveyard previously, this strike would have probably caused him to lose consciousness.

Even so, it was still a hard time for him.

“You actually survived!” Yun Haoyang was surprised. Ling Han had taken such a powerful attack head-on from him, yet he actually survived, and only sustained heavy injury. This brat’s defense was beyond his expectations.

However, since things had reached this point, Ling Han was definitely already spent.

Complete elimination; he definitely could not leave this future trouble alive.

‘Kill!’

Yun Haoyang descended from the skies. He was going to take this chance when Ling Han was at his utmost weakest to take the life of this young prodigy.

Ling Han drummed up his remaining energy. Peng! Exerting power through his feet, he began to run madly, dashing forwards for the sake of his own life.

His motive had already been attained. He had already pushed himself to the limits, and at present, all the blood vessels inside his body were still popping continuously. Death seemed to be close at hand, causing his nerves to be stretched tightly.

He could feel it; breakthrough was already not too far away.

As long as he digested his gains from this battle, he would definitely be able to advance to the pinnacle of the Celestial Path.

Thus, what was the point in continuing the battle now?

He escaped, and began to run for his life.

“Didn’t you say you wouldn’t be running?” Yun Haoyang transmitted this message via divine sense, trying to provoke Ling Han into continuing the battle as he continued to pursue him from behind.

How could Ling Han possibly fall for it? He, too, communicated through divine sense. “Yun Haoyang, just wait. When I next appear, it will be your turn to flee!”

He said these words with surging pride, and these words were filled with absolute confidence.

If he became a Ninth Heaven, he would definitely be able to match a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“If so, that is even more reason that I cannot leave you alive!” Yun Haoyang declared coldly, a cold light flashing in his eyes. This time, no matter what corner of the world he had to chase him to, he was determined to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han did not answer. He had already said all that he had to say. Next, it would be him coming back to kill all in his way after he had advanced into the Ninth Heaven.

One fled, while the other pursued, and both of them were going all out.

10 days, one month, half a year… Time passed continuously. Yun Haoyang continued to pursue Ling Han, and a fierce battle broke out. However, Ling Han also drew the Divine Demon Sword in response, and held no fear of the other party at all. Yet this time, it was Yun Haoyang that did not dare to use a powerful attack again, because once he used a powerful attack, it would give Ling Han a chance to escape.

Thus, the two of them were embroiled in a fierce, drawn-out battle. One was determined to flee, while the other was determined to detain the former.

Ling Han was not running in a straight path, but rather running circles around the Yun Clan. However, after circling around for a year, he suddenly crashed into fog.

This was very strange. Before this, he had not seen any kind of fog gather here at all.

“Little Han, follow Grandpa Dog’s instructions.” The large black dog’s voice rang out inside Little Han’s mind.

Though the large black dog was very despicable, Ling Han had incomparable trust in him. When he heard him, he immediately walked according to the large black dog’s instructions.

Every seven steps, advance, and turn after every three steps; it was extremely complex.

Xiu! Yun Haoyang also barged in. However, he immediately lost track of Ling Han.

“Nothing but an illusory formation, you think you can stop me like this?” he sneered, and immediately waved his hands, unleashing the might of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, wanting to sweep aside all the fog in a single move.

He was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and had boundless might. With his overwhelming power, any kind of formation would be destroyed.

However, though the fog rippled like the waves of a sea with this attack, it did not disperse.

“Yi!” Yun Haoyang finally showed a hint of seriousness. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the other side, Ling Han soon walked out of the fog by following the large black dog’s instructions, and soon saw the large black dog and Wally standing in front of him.

“Let’s go. This formation would not be able to hold a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate down for long,” the large black dog called out, looking extremely anxious.

Ling Han nodded, and they left immediately.

As expected, a loud boom was heard just a while later. A frightening wave of force surged out.

Yun Haoyang already escaped, but he had also lost track of Ling Han. He couldn’t help but roar furiously, his voice rumbling out like thunder, turning into a boundless ocean of flames. This was his fury taking solid form.

“Brat, how about it? Don’t you still need Grandpa Dog to save you?” The large black dog grinned proudly.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It was Wally who set up the formation, right?”

Wally nodded. He was the most honest.

The large black dog humphed. “That was also because Grandpa Dog asked him to find a formation, and Grandpa Dog was the one who personally set it up. Otherwise, you would still be hunted by now, brat. What idle time would you have to argue with Grandpa Dog now?”

Ling Han laughed loudly. He coughed up a great many bits of his internal organs with each laugh, yet he was completely unconcerned. “Then, thank you.”

“Of course. You are under Grandpa Dog’s protection.” The large black dog claimed all the credit without any reservations. He paused, and then asked Ling Han, “Brat, you’re not going to die, right?”

“I’m not going to die, but I need a very long time to recover.” Ling Han nodded. “However, when I recover, it will be the day that the Yun Clan have to bow their heads!”

“Brat, are you certain you can break through to the Ninth Heaven?” The large black dog was also very pleased.

“Mm-hm!”

They sought out a place to heal their injuries. Yun Haoyang would definitely not give up, and would look everywhere for Ling Han to get rid of a future problem like him. Thus, they ran very far, and the farther they went, the higher the difficulty level for Yun Haoyang to find them would naturally be.

A month later, they finally stopped, and entered into the depths of an ocean.

Ling Han began to heal his injuries.

He recovered very slowly. This time, it was injuries that had been inflicted from powerful attacks of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Furthermore, he had also missed the first instance to recover, causing his injuries to worsen considerably. Moreover, if it were not for the fact that he had been exposed to Void Particle Energy a long time ago, and had developed a certain level of related understanding and resistance, he would probably have been killed with a single arrow.

Ling Han slowly removed the foreign martial intent from within his body. This was a great test, but at the same time, it was also an opportunity, allowing him to feel the power of a Heavenly Venerate from an endlessly close distance.

Time passed by quietly. 10 years, 100, 1,000… In the blink of an eye, 210,000 years had passed. Ling Han had finally removed the foreign martial intent bit by bit. With a battle cry, he surged from the seabed right into the skies, and his aura completely unfurled. Instantly, winds and clouds raged, and thunder boomed loudly.

The heavenly tribulation was coming.

A Ninth Heaven great tribulation!

Ling Han laughed. So what if it was a Ninth-Heaven tribulation? He was completely unafraid.

‘Come at me!’

Clang! The tribulation descended, and began to strike madly and explosively at him.

Unfortunately, the power of a heavenly tribulation was limited. It was only slightly stronger than the Eighth-Heaven tribulation that Ling Han had previously undergone. It was already no longer enough to threaten Ling Han.

The heavenly tribulation boomed wildly, and countless bursts of lightning exploded on Ling Han’s body, yet they were ultimately unable to penetrate the defense of his body.

A day later, the heavenly tribulation withdrew helplessly.

The dark clouds that filled the skies dispersed. Nine ribbons of iridescent light flashed around Ling Han, signifying that he had finally set foot on the pinnacle of the Celestial Path.

Ling Han did not charge back to the Yun Clan at the first opportunity. He had only just broken through to the Ninth Heaven, but there had not been much of a boost to his battle prowess. That was because the upper limits on his Body Art had just been lifted, but he had not begun to improve it yet.

He descended back to the bottom of the sea, and extracted Void Particle Energy to temper his body.
