Chapter 17: Cheng Xiang Has Arrived

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“You think you’re a martial arts genius?” Liu Yu Tong said coldly. “I am seventeen years old this year just like you, but I am already in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. What about you?”

“Pu!”

These words caused everyone to gasp in astonishment.

The ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier… what kind of concept was that?

Only the strongest of the strong in Gray Cloud Town had this kind of cultivation level!

Shen Zi Yan was indeed a genius. Those who had achieved the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier at the age of seventeen were definitely an uncommon existence in the history of Gray Cloud Town. On average, there would only be two or three of such geniuses every one hundred years, and each one of them demonstrated extraordinary talent in their lifetime, going on to become famous and leave their mark in the history of Rain Country.

But when compared with Liu Yu Tong, Shen Zi Yan couldn’t even hold a candle to the former!

A seventeen-year-old managed to achieve the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier… even in the vast territory of Rain Country, how many such geniuses would appear in one hundred years?

Liu Yu Tong no longer suppressed her power, and released the majestic aura of a warrior in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. In an instant, everyone in the surrounding area could sense the strength hidden within her body.

Shen Zi Yan bore the brunt of it as the one closest to Liu Yu Tong. Underneath this powerful aura, she abruptly lowered her head. She wasn’t even qualified to look directly at Liu Yu Tong. This was unacceptable to the arrogant Shen Zi Yan, and as she struggled to raise her head to look directly at her opponent, her eyes were filled with fear, despair and confusion.

Why was there suddenly an appearance of someone her own age, but with both beauty and brilliant talent that even she had no choice but to admit her inferiority? Furthermore, why had such a person given her a slap out of the blue?

“How dare you look down on him!” Liu Yu Tong spoke, turning to point at Ling Han, and once more turned to look at Shen Zi Yan, “You’re completely unqualified!”

What, she was here to defend Ling Han?

Whether it was Shen Zi Yan or everyone else, they were all in a state of complete disbelief.

This girl with elegant and noble bearing, unparalleled beauty and shocking talent in martial arts was actually acquainted with Trash Ling? Being acquainted with each other was inconceivable enough, and yet she had actually defended Ling Han! How could anyone accept this?

Especially the guys in the area, they all felt like they were about to die of jealousy!

Shen Zi Yan gritted her teeth, her eyes spitting fire. She had now transferred all her fury onto Ling Han.

That was because Liu Yu Tong was too strong, and she dared not have even the slightest thought of revenge.

However, Ling Han was a different story. With his cultivation level at the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, in her eyes, he could be finished off in a single blow. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Moreover, everything was because of Ling Han. He had deliberately made fun of her, so she spoke to him in mockery. As a result, she was publicly slapped by Liu Yu Tong, and had disgraced herself.

However, in truth, had she not insulted Ling Han in the first place, he would have long left. Then the subsequent course of events would never have happened.

But with her self-centered personality, how could she possibly reflect on her own behavior? So naturally she would push all the fault onto another person’s shoulders.

She pointed at Ling Han, and spoke shrilly, “In what way am I not qualified? Isn’t this guy just a piece of trash?

Trash?

Have you seen a piece of trash that could break through two layers within a single night? And what kind of trash would cause a Black Grade alchemist to beg just to be able to follow by his side?

Naturally Liu Yu Tong did not intend to inform Shen Zi Yan about any of this, so she only said, “Such a short-sighted woman like yourself naturally cannot see that underneath the dust lies gold, underneath the darkness hides a pearl. You have already missed out on your chance, so there’s no point in pointing out his brightness to you.”

As she spoke, Liu Yu Tong felt a little irritated—Ling Han had actually admired a woman like this!

Of course, she would never admit that she was jealous.

“Hahahaha!” Shen Zi Yan laughed loudly before pointing at Ling Han and said, “He’s gold, he’s a pearl? What kind of joke are you playing! He’s nothing more but a piece of trash, a complete, utter piece of trash!”

“In less than three months, he will become someone that all of you would only be able to look up to!” Liu Yu Tong said assuredly. She did not know why Ling Han had kept such a low profile in the past, but now he was obviously going to display his brilliance, dazzling to the point that the sun would look pale in comparison.

Hearing these words, everyone sneered. Although Ling Han had truly defeated Cheng Hao, but his actual cultivation level was only the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, or the fifth layer, at most. Although this kind of cultivation level was not considered trash, it was still very far off from being proclaimed as a genius… not to mention actually becoming someone that everyone would only look up to.

“En?” Liu Yu Tong’s almond eyes widened. The aura of a warrior of ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier trembled slightly, and suddenly all the taunting laughter came to a complete stop.

“Ling Han, how dare you!” At this moment, a furious roar was heard as two figures quickly rushed into the Martial Training Court.

One of the figures was none other than Cheng Hao. The other figure seemed to be slightly older than him, with a few similarities in their features.

This was Cheng Hao’s older brother, Cheng Xiang, currently nineteen years old, ninth layer of Body Refining Tier.

Both were at the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. One was seventeen, the other was nineteen, there was no comparison between their respective natural talent. Of course, a nineteen-year-old who has achieved the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier would still be able to claim the title of a genius in Gray Cloud Town, although he was not as extraordinary as Shen Zi Yan.

“Peng, peng, peng, peng,” Cheng Xiang’s steps echoed loudly, hinting at his current terrifying state of utter fury. He stopped about three meters away from Ling Han, pointed at him, and said, “What despicable means have you used?”

Ling Han smiled coldly, and said, “So I won only because I made use of despicable means?”

“Of course, otherwise, how could a piece of trash like you ever defeat my younger brother?” Cheng Xiang spoke loudly. Unlike Ling Han’s infamous reputation as a piece of trash, if today’s issue was not appropriately handled, the Cheng Clan’s reputation would definitely be seriously impacted.

Thus, whether it was true that Ling Han had made use of despicable means or not, he had to insist that he had done so.

Hearing the word “trash”, everyone’s expressions became very strange.

Shen Zi Yan had just said something similar, and the result was being repeatedly slapped by Liu Yu Tong. This elite warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier is still here, and you actually dare to publicly curse at Ling Han? Isn’t this just asking for trouble?

With Ling Han’s experience, he naturally could tell with a glance what Cheng Xiang’s intentions were. He did not reveal them though, and only slowly said, “Oh, then how do I prove that I did not make use of those despicable means you’re speaking of?”

“Heng, you used despicable means to bully my younger brother. As an older brother, how can I pretend that I did not see anything? Since you’re so brave, then I dare you to spar with me!” Cheng Xiang obviously came well-prepared.

Everyone could not help thinking, ‘How shameless!’

You are already in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, while Ling Han is only in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier. The difference of five layers, how could he compare to you?

However, as long as Ling Han was given a harsh beating, it would weaken the degree of embarrassment caused by Cheng Hao’s previous actions, and also help to avenge Cheng Hao. This was a very smart move, and could be said to be hitting two birds with one stone.

Ling Han’s smile disappeared and he shook his head, saying, “You are in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, while I’m only in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, doesn’t this seem very unjust?”

“I don’t mind if you find someone to take your place in the spar!” Cheng Hao laughed loudly. Naturally, he was very familiar with Ling Han’s label as trash. With such reputation, no one would befriend him in the whole academy, so where on earth could he find anyone to help him?

Furthermore, even if he did find someone to help him, what about it? Cheng Hao was in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, and was one of the strongest in the academy. What did he have to fear?

Everyone’s expressions once more became very strange. Ling Han really did have someone in his corner, furthermore, that someone was an extremely strong warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier that could, in one move, instantly kill a person in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier!

Wasn’t this just looking for death?
