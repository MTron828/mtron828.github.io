Chapter 2009: Sniped by Celestial Kings

A massive hand, coming out of nowhere, was suddenly spreading out its boundless might, its viciousness soaring sky-high.

“Seven Clouds King!” Lu Hairong barked furiously, her slender hand moving to greet the incoming blow from the skies.

She was a Celestial King, and supreme Mystical Power was at her command with only a casual move. Endless celestial light of great dao was entwined around her hand as she sent out a palm strike towards that enormous hand.

Boom!

The two colossal hands crashed into each other, and cracks appeared in them at the same time. The light of great dao swayed and trembled, which spread to the surface of the sea, giving rise to a tsunami wave that was at least 3,000 meters tall, radiating out in all directions.

“Despicable and shameless!” Lu Hairong rebuked again.

“Gaga, this is called complete elimination!” Amidst a loud cackle, this large hand reformed once and delivered a strike.

“Who’s scared of you!” Lu Hairong brandished a fist in response, not afraid in the slightest.

Boom!

The strength of both sides was close. After this clash, the hands that both sides had sent out shattered once more, neither able to suppress the other. But just at this moment, another massive hand appeared, delivering a strike from a slanted angle.

“Ink Poison King!” This time, an expression of shock appeared on Lu Hairong’s face.

They had actually mobilized two Celestial Kings to snipe her, or to be more precise, snipe Hu Niu!

When they left the Roc Palace, the senior elder had especially cast a secret technique to conceal them from destiny so that the whereabouts of their whole group could not be predicted, but now the enemies were lying in ambush on the seas, clearly showing that they were informed about their whereabouts.

Could it be... that a traitor had appeared in the midst of the Roc Palace?

This caused a chill to overcome her entire body.

Peng, she had not finished the thought when a palm strike had struck her from behind. Though she had parried, with a conspiracy against a party that had not expected it, what more when it was a pincer attack from two Celestial Kings, how could she possibly manage to parry the blow completely?

A loud bang rang out, and the battleship instantly crumbled. A halo of light enshrouded Ling Han and the rest. That was the protection that Lu Hairong had exerted on them.

With another wave of her hand, xiu, xiu, xiu,

Ling Han and the others instantly disappeared without a trace.

“En, teleported off?” A voice was heard from the clouds. “Old Ink, you go and pursue those people. You must kill the reincarnated body of Yiyun.”

“Got it,” another person replied, and there was no more sound to be heard.

“Don’t even think about it!” Lu Hairong hurriedly went to intercept.

“Sea Heavenly King, your opponent is me!” Boom, a massive hand struck down, blocking Lu Hairong’s path.

Lu Hairong was overcome with anxiety. Though she knew that Hu Niu possessed many ways of saving her life, the latter could not possibly escape from the hands of a Celestial King. Now, the only hope she had left was Ling Han, who was the descendant of that lord, so perhaps, maybe, it was possible?

Xiu, Ling Han and the others all dropped down from the skies, falling towards that boundless great sea beneath them.

Ling Han hurriedly stretched out his hands, and grabbed the four women.

“So fun, so fun!” Hu Niu laughed loudly, looking not the slightest bit like she had been shocked.

This girl was really quite insensitive.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled into a frown. This time, it really was a case of bystanders suffering.

While the Roc Palace was indeed powerful, its enemies were not weak, either. To make a move brazenly in the boundless seas, and even if they did have a Celestial King guarding them, so what? The other side had sent two of them!

“One Celestial King is enough to restrain Senior Lu, and if the other Celestial King catches up with us...” Ling Han said with a deep hum.

“...then we’re dead,” the Empress finished.

No matter how confident they were in themselves, against a Celestial King, there was not the slightest possibility that they could survive.

“All enter into the Black Tower.” Ling Han stretched out his hands again, drawing everyone into the Black Tower.

At this time, even a lower-level Celestial King would not be able to sense them. A mustard seed dropped down from the skies, fell into the sea waters, and drifted along the flow of the water.

Weng, celestial light surged, and a man appeared noiselessly. His build was not very tall, but he was just standing there in space, and he was like a great mountain that would never crumble, and others could only look up to him in awe.

The Ink Poison King!

“Strange, according to the ripples in space, those five people have indeed appeared here.” The Ink Poison King stretched out a hand, lightly rubbing. He was capturing the ripple in the Regulations of Space. “I also sense the auras of five people, yet they have suddenly disappeared again, like they do not belong in this dimension.

“Strange!”

He searched in the surroundings, and the more he searched, the more astonished he was because Ling Han and the others really seemed like they had disappeared into thin air.

Boom

, waves came to rise on the seas, and a massive sea dragon appeared, presently riding the winds and waves.

“I actually entered the territory of a Dark Dragon.” The Ink Poison King frowned. “There is not the slightest advantage in a fight. I had best withdraw first. If these five people are really nearby, then there will be no need for me to move at all, as they would die in the hands of this Dark Dragon.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was incredibly decisive, and immediately turned and left directly.

In the distance, the sea dragon swam over, and roared furiously at the skies. Boom, boom, boom. One after another, stars fell from the skies. The might of a Celestial King was really too frightening. Just a roar was capable of making stars fall from the skies.

After a very long while, the sea dragon sank back into the great sea, and tranquility returned.

Ling Han and the others stayed inside the Black Tower, allowing the sea waves to take them along.

“It should not be my fault this time, right?” Ling Han asked.

He had a halo of trouble following him, and always managed to unconsciously cause trouble, but this time, it was clearly unrelated to him.

“That is not definite,” Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said smilingly. “If she had not been with you, Husband, Hu Niu might not have met with an ambush, either.”

“That’s right,” Hu Niu hurriedly asserted with a nod.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and asked, “Niu, just what forces has your Roc Palace made enemies with?”

“One is called Four Seas Palace. Their Imperial Empress is a lunatic that keeps wanting to eliminate our Roc Palace, and even Niu has been dragged into the matter,” Hu Niu declared angrily.

Ling Han and the others listened to Hu Niu explain the details, and they were involuntarily moved.

The Four Seas Palace was extremely large. Their master was a woman called Shang Zhiwei who had set her heart on destroying the Roc Palace, and this woman was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Even in the entire Celestial Realm, her strength placed her as one of the very best.

If it were not for the fact that the Roc Palace still had a senior elder that was struggling on whilst at death’s door, forcibly holding on, this powerful force would have long since been razed to the ground.

Even now, the Roc Palace did not have an easy time. The majority of their members were in hiding. The moment they left the territory of the Roc Palace, they could possibly encounter a frontal assault, turning their difficult efforts of cultivation for millions and millions of years into nothing.

“When Niu becomes a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, Niu will definitely kick that lunatic’s brat, no, a*s-rape her!” Hu Niu growled angrily.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. This little girl had definitely been led astray by him.

Inside the Black Tower, they floated along with the flow of the water. At least a month had already passed, yet they still did not dare to leave the Black Tower.

There was a Celestial King standing guard outside waiting for them, so what was a mere month’s of drifting along worth?

It was not safe at all.

They did not waste their time, either. They continued to cultivate inside the Black Tower, and since the upper limits of their cultivation level had been unsealed, there was no worry that they would be wasting time.

One year, 10 years, 100 years... They had already spent 100 years inside the Black Tower. Furthermore, they had also used the time acceleration effects of the Black Tower and the comprehension of Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree. Those like Ling Han, the Empress, and Hu Niu had already pushed their cultivation level to middle-stage Yang Soul.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was slightly inferior, but she was also close to middle-stage Yang Soul.

“We should be able to go out now, right?” They discussed a while, and decided that they could not stay forever inside the Black Tower.

Ling Han’s figure flashed, and appeared outside the Black Tower.

Weng, suddenly, a frigntening aura swept over, and a colossal hand was grabbing over at a speed faster than lightning.

F***, that Celestial King was still standing guard!
