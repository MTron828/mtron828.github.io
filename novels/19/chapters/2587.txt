Chapter 2588: Unexpected Return

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Zhan Feiyu fled, while Yang Que gave pursuit. Behind them, there was also a trail of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings from Ghost King City, all of them traveling at immense speed.

However, the initiative was in Zhan Feiyu’s hands since he had fled first. Thus, as long as he wasn’t obstructed, he wouldn’t need to worry about getting caught.

This was already the outskirts of the city to begin with, so with the speed of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, they could genuinely exit the city in just two or three steps. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A relaxed expression appeared on Zhan Feiyu’s face. At the same time, however, there was also a hint of fury. He had actually been forced to scurry like a rat! He was truly unwilling to accept this.

“Heh, since you’ve already entered Ghost King City, don’t you want to stay for a little longer?” a voice suddenly said with a cold chuckle. An eerie azure hand that was colossal in size suddenly reached over from the center of the city, slamming over at an incredible speed.

!!

This was a skeletal hand, completely azure in color and as uncanny as could be.

Zhan Feiyu instantly shuddered in fear. This was the hand of the Azure Ghost Celestial King.

He didn’t dare to face this attack at all. Otherwise, if he were obstructed by this hand and surrounded by Yang Que and the others, he definitely wouldn’t be able to flee.

However, the speed of the skeletal hand was incredible, and this was most likely a strike that the Azure Ghost Celestial King had been preparing for a long time.

Peng!

The hand slammed into Zhan Feiyu’s back, causing him to violently vomit blood.

However, Zhan Feiyu didn’t stop at all. Instead, he continued to flee with all his might, crashing through layers of space and shooting forward hundreds of kilometers in an instant.

He successfully exited the city.

When a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was intent on fleeing, it was truly difficult to stop them.

Tang Mingbo bellowed in rage, continuing his pursuit as he roared, “Old bastard, stop right there!” The culprit who had killed his son was hiding inside Zhan Yufei’s Spatial God Tool, so how could he let him flee?

Even though Zhan Feiyu had already fled far into the distance, Tang Mingbo’s bellow had also contained some divine sense fluctuation. Thus, he was able to hear him clearly. This caused him to feel extremely vexed. He hadn’t done anything! Yet, he was being chased and beaten as if he were a rat! Moreover, even a weakling such as Tang Mingbo dared to act so arrogantly toward him? F*ck!

Which bastard had screwed him over?

No, he couldn’t scurry away just like this! He had to make head or tail of the situation. Otherwise, he would become an absolute joke! Without knowing where he had gone wrong, his scheme of countless years had been ruined just like that!

Following the escape of Zhan Feiyu, Yang Que and the others also dispersed, going back where they had come from. After all, was there any point in remaining?

However, this encounter also gave them a timely warning about just how poor the defenses of Ghost King City were. The second-in-command of an opposing force had already infiltrated their place, yet they hadn’t known about it at all. Thus, they naturally had to strengthen their defenses. Otherwise, if Prosperous Opening City had launched an invasion, they would have only learned about it when the enemy forces would have been already in the city.

Ling Han wore a strange expression. He truly hadn’t imagined that things would’ve taken such a wild turn.

Mm-hm, by the looks of things, Lu Gaoquan and the others most likely believed that he had already fled Ghost King City. If he made an unexpected return now… Hehe…

Ling Han casually strolled around, randomly finding a place to rest. He decided to return to Lu Li’s residence tonight.

Not a single person would be prepared for his unexpected return.

After half a day, he secretly snuck into Lu Li’s residence. His aura was completely hidden. After all, he was here to hunt, so he naturally didn’t want to become the hunted instead.

With his improved Heaven Deceiving Technique, even First Tier Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t be able to see through him. Thus, even if there were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings present, Ling Han still wouldn’t need to worry about being caught.

Even so, he still remained cautious as he scoured the courtyard.

Because he was afraid that there might be Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings present, Ling Han naturally didn’t dare to release his divine sense. Otherwise, if he were caught, he would have nowhere to flee.

After snooping around for a while, he arrived in a building where he could faintly hear some conversation. He immediately recognized one of the people as Lu Li.

‘Found you.’

He became increasingly careful, silently sneaking over and peeking through the crack in the door.

Thanks to the Heaven Deceiving Technique, even Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings would fail to notice his existence when walking past him. After all, this was a technique that could deceive even the heavens, to say nothing of people.

There were only two people in the room. One was Lu Li, and the other was also a young man. However, even though he looked young, and even though there were no ribbons of iridescent light around him, Ling Han had a feeling that this person was definitely more powerful than him.

Moreover, this person’s appearance bore slight resemblance to that of Lu Li. However, he definitely wasn’t Lu Gaoquan—Ling Han had seen Lu Gaoquan before.

“…Are you alright?” the young man asked Lu Li.

“Thank you for your concern, Uncle. Your nephew is feeling fine,” Lu Li replied respectfully.

‘Uncle?

‘This person is Lu Gaoquan’s brother? Huh? I don’t think I’ve heard of this person before.

‘Hang on, was it because of the sudden appearance of this uncle that Lu Li suddenly enjoyed an explosive rise in power? And thus Tang Yuan was forced to surrender and even wear a floral dress? Otherwise, things can’t be explained.

‘However, even if he’s a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, what right does he have to force Tang Mingbo to lower his head?

‘Perhaps he’s even more powerful than the Azure Ghost Celestial King?’

Ling Han became increasingly careful, channeling the Heaven Deceiving Technique to perfection. If he were discovered by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at such close range, he would definitely be caught.

Lu Gaoquan’s brother was called Lu Gaojian, and his eyes were filled with doting as he said, “I heard that you were almost killed by an evil person, and this made me extremely uneasy. If I hadn’t been discussing an important matter with Azure Ghost at the time, I definitely wouldn’t have allowed the culprit to escape.”

Lu Li was extremely moved upon hearing this. He felt like this uncle who he had only just reunited with loved him even more than his father. He hurriedly replied, “If Uncle had been there, that Li Long would have definitely been killed on the spot.”

If he had the opportunity, he would curry as much favor as he could. This would allow his status to rise at a meteoric rate. Indeed, he could even bed Yang Xiaoling by force. This was all thanks to his relationship with Lu Gaojian.

“Uncle, your discussions with Lord Azure Ghost are far more important. Your nephew wasn’t in any great danger,” Lu Li said obediently. He understood how to please his uncle.

However, Lu Gaojian shook his head, saying, “No one in this world is more important than you. When I catch the culprit, I’ll definitely dice him into 10,000 pieces!” As he said this, a terrifying killing intent erupted from his eyes, ice-cold and menacing as could be.

Lu Li was extremely moved. This uncle treated him far too well.

As an outsider, however, Ling Han considered many more things. This uncle treated his nephew far too well!

‘Gasp! Lu Li isn’t his biological child, is he?’

As an outsider, Ling Han was able to see things far more clearly. The way that Lu Gaojian looked at Lu Li was the way that only a father would look at his son.

‘F*ck! This is far too messed up!’

Lu Gaojian lightly tapped his armrest as he said, “Prosperous Opening City is scheming to obtain Ghost King City, and this is something that I’m already aware of. However, why did they send someone to assassinate you? What benefit does this bring them? Unless… Wang Yun is already aware of my matters?”

Wang Yun was the lord of Prosperous Opening City.

Lu Gaojian frowned, and continued, “But that’s impossible! I’ve already kept an extremely low profile, so they definitely can’t be targeting you because of your relationship with me… Strange… Where did things go wrong?”

No matter how he wracked his brains, he couldn’t come up with a logical explanation for the recent events. He had come to Ghost King City with a mission, and apart from the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, only Lu Li knew of his existence. Thus, how could this intel have been leaked to Prosperous Opening City? How could they have cooked up a plan to target them?

It was only natural that he couldn’t make head nor tail of the situation. This was because it had all been one big coincidence.

Ling Han giggled in his mind. To say nothing of Lu Gaojian, even Heavenly Venerates would get a headache if they were present. After all, everything had been a coincidence and a misunderstanding. Thus, how could there be any logical explanation?

Lu Gaojian paused for a moment before retrieving a jade seal. He handed it to Lu Li, and said, “Take it. There’s a cultivation technique inside, and I want you to switch to practicing this from tomorrow onward.”
