Chapter 1332 Painting

Xie Donglai was a prodigy, after all, so he immediately changed his tactic after discovering the freakish toughness of Ling Han’s physique.

He would defend with his full power!

As time passed, he would continue to become stronger. After a while, he would eventually advance to become a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Coupled with his cultivation talent, he would possess battle prowess that was at least on par with the late stage of the low extreme. This would definitely be enough to suppress any Sun Moon Tier cultivator—including those at the pinnacle level.

Moreover, he could reach this level in just half a day.

He stopped attacking and focused all of his power on defense.

However, after just a few exchanges, he discovered that Ling Han was just as hard to deal with as his heavenly tribulation.

‘How is he so powerful?

‘He clearly hasn’t reached the peak stage of the pinnacle level yet, so he shouldn’t possess battle prowess on par with the Heavenly Body Tier. So, why does he seem like a Heavenly Body Tier elite?’

Ling Han’s overwhelming power was beyond his imagination.

Xie Donglai naturally wouldn’t know that Ling Han had already been blessed by Celestial Qi twice. This had perfected his comprehension of the Regulations and allowed him to raise his battle prowess by at least one star. Even though he hadn’t reached the Heavenly Body Tier yet, his battle prowess was already on the verge of the Heavenly Body Tier.

“F*cking peasant!” Xie Donglai spat through clenched teeth. Not only had Ling Han stolen the woman he liked, but this lowly peasant had even surpassed him in terms of cultivation and battle prowess.

He was unable to accept this!

He gritted his teeth and waved his hand, retrieving a scroll. The scroll swayed in the wind as he unfurled it, and there was a painting of 12 golden warriors on its three-meter-long body. Each of the warriors was suited in golden armor and holding a spear. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was clearly a painting, yet it exuded an overwhelming murderous aura. It was as if this wasn’t a painting of 12 warriors, but instead of 12 demons who had massacred millions of people to forge the bloody spears in their hands.

“Blood Servants, are you not going to show yourself?!” Xie Donglai cried sharply.

Weng, weng, weng!

The painting lit up, and the 12 golden warriors surprisingly walked out of the painting. They stood in the air and pointed their spears toward the sky. At the same time, the murderous aura exuded from them instantly soared tenfold or perhaps even 100-fold.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han frowned slightly. These 12 golden warriors were all at the Heavenly Body Tier. Although they were only at the early stage of the low extreme, they had a big advantage in numbers. Together, they were powerful enough to oppose a being at the middle stage of the low extreme. More importantly, their killing intent was far too terrifying. If one possessed slightly weaker willpower, perhaps their knees would already be buckling at this moment.

“Damn it! You actually forced me to unleash this technique!” Xie Donglai gritted his teeth in anger, and continued, “However, since I’ve unleashed the Blood Servants, I’ll be able to overcome my heavenly tribulation even if they can’t kill you. When I succeed, it’ll be time to deal with you!”

He had received this treasure from his senior after suffering greatly and returning to the Xie Clan. This painting could only be activated once, yet it would summon 12 Blood Servants whose battle prowess was at the Heavenly Body Tier!

If this couldn’t hold Ling Han at bay for half a day... He refused to believe that it couldn’t!

In his eyes, this was a test from his senior. If he was forced to use this painting, he would have naturally failed the test. However, he was about to reach the Heavenly Body Tier anyway, so it wouldn’t matter even if he didn’t receive praise from this senior. His status in the Xie Clan would still soar to a great height regardless.

“This painting was refined by a senior of my clan. He’s at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, and he extracted and sealed the divine sense of 12 elites from the Blue Cloud Imperial Empire in order to make this painting. Each of the Blood Servants had committed boundless crimes, and they were then refined by the bloody aura of battlegrounds, increasing their murderous aura!” Xie Donglai wore a haughty expression, and he asked, “My Blood Servants... How will you block them?”

Kuang!

A bolt of lightning crashed into his head. Although he managed to dissipate much of its might, it still left him especially disheveled. His hair was a mess, and he appeared to be in a very sorry state. His air of haughtiness instantly vanished into nothingness.

‘Extracting and refining their divine sense? How ruthless!’

Although Ling Han had killed many people as well, death would mark the end of their hostility. However, the Xie Clan actually refined the divine sense of their enemies into a treasure? In Ling Han’s eyes, this was taking things too far!

Anyhow, these golden warriors were beings formed from divine senses?

Ling Han laughed loudly as he unleashed heaven’s might.

Weng!

Not only was Xie Donglai’s cultivation instantly weakened by two stars, but expressions of fear also appeared on the faces of the 12 murderous Blood Servants.

They weren’t afraid of Ling Han, but of the heaven’s might that he had unleashed. Divine senses that had no host body shouldn’t have existed in the world. They would be targeted by heavenly tribulation and attacked until they dissolved. Thus, the 12 Blood Servants were petrified once they sensed the heaven’s might unleashed by Ling Han, even though this wasn’t genuine heaven’s might.

‘F*ck!’ Xie Donglai mouthed silently. He was so astonished that he almost spat his tongue out.

Heavenly Body Tier Blood Servants were actually trembling in fright before Ling Han! It was as if they had come across their nemesis! However, he was only a measly cultivator at the Sun Moon Tier! Even though he had reached the pinnacle level, he should have still been trash before Heavenly Body Tier elites!

At this moment, Xie Donglai’s mind was a jumbled mess. It was as if his mind were about to become sludge.

“Aaah!” He wailed in wretched agony. With his cultivation decreased by two stars, how could he withstand heavenly tribulation any longer? A bolt of lightning arced down, ripping a wound that stretched from his left shoulder all the way down to his right rib. It almost tore him into two pieces.

“Why is it like this?!” Xie Donglai roared to the sky. “You’re merely a lowly peasant, so what right do you have to suppress me? Even a finger of mine is 100 times more valuable than you! Any random elite from the Xie Clan would be able to suppress you billions of times over!”

“Are you done speaking?” Ling Han asked coldly. Ever since Xie Donglai had set his eyes on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, Ling Han had already sentenced him to death.

“You lowly peasant, do you truly dare to kill me?” Xie Donglai screamed in exasperation and anger. He had already been stretched while facing Ling Han’s attacks alongside his heavenly tribulation. Now that his battle prowess had been weakened by two stars, how could he withstand their attacks any longer?

“What do you think? Do you think I’m merely playing around with you?” Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle.

“You won’t dare to kill me!” Initially, Xie Donglai hadn’t wanted to stoop as low as using this technique. However, he was genuinely out of options at this moment. “Each member of the Xie Clan has a marking planted into their body. If we die, these markings will immediately notify the elites of our clan and show them the appearance and aura of the culprit! So, if you kill me, know that the Xie Clan’s grand elder is nearby! He’ll definitely rush over to slay you, a lowly peasant who dares to provoke the Xie Clan!”

Was this true? Or was it false?

Ling Han didn’t care!

‘Die!’

He showed no mercy as he unleashed the Divine Demon Sword. The Divine Demon Sword automatically launched an attack, its sword projections brilliant as it unleashed an astonishing battle prowess. Meanwhile, Ling Han activated the lightning divine pattern on his right hand, attacking Xie Donglai with divine lightning. These attacks were devastating.

Xie Donglai was astounded. He had already warned Ling Han of the consequences, yet he still dared to attack him?

If Ling Han killed him here, Xie Qian would notice immediately. With his ability as an Eternal River Tier elite, he would be able to arrive here in a single stride. Then, he would kill Ling Han with a simple smack.

In order to kill him, Ling Han was willing to sacrifice himself as well?

‘He’s f*cking crazy!’

He wasn’t belittling himself, but he was indeed far worse than Ling Han when it came to talent and coming across opportunities. If it were him, he would definitely value his own life above anything else. How could he sacrifice himself to kill someone else?

At this moment, he was not only scared, but also weighed down by indescribable grief.

How had he come across such a madman!?
