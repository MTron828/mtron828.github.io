Chapter 2107: Who’s Above You?

“Why are you blocking me?” Xiao Cheng asked loudly. His eyes were blazing with killing intent.

Whoever stopped him from saving Yang Xiao was his enemy.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Come, let’s have a chat.”

‘Have a chat?’

“There’s nothing to chat about with you!” Xiao Cheng said. His voice was vicious as he continued, “If you don’t move aside, I’ll kill you!”

“How long have you been practicing this cultivation method?” Ling Han asked. His expression was calm and amiable, and it was as if he were chatting with a friend.

“Piss off!” Xiao Cheng roared. He immediately launched an attack at Ling Han.

Ling Han casually replied with a strike of his own.

Pa!

Xiao Cheng’s attack was immediately blocked.

However, Xiao Cheng naturally wouldn’t give up so easily.

Peng, peng, peng!

He continued to attack, yet he was unable to breach Ling Han’s defenses at all. He was simply attacking in vain.

Hu Niu became impatient, and she suddenly jumped out of her seat. She grabbed Xiao Cheng’s neck before smashing him into the ground again and again.

Peng, peng, peng!

Xiao Cheng lost consciousness after just a few slams.

Yang Xiao saw all of this, and his mind instantly became numb with fear.

As it turned out, these people were all so powerful! Yet, he had actually dared to target the three women! He had been seeking death! Fortunately, because of this reason and that, he hadn’t turned on Ling Han. Otherwise, he would have definitely been killed.

Now, however, he still had a sliver of hope.

Ling Han glanced at Yang Xiao before reaching over with a hand. He then activated the Source Power of Wood, and suppressed the poison in Yang Xiao’s body.

His cultivation level was far above that of Brother Jun, and he more so possessed the Source Power of Wood. Thus, suppressing or even erasing this poison was as easy as could be.

“Who in the world are you?” Yang Xiao asked after regaining the ability to speak. He immediately voiced his biggest question.

How could these people possibly be Ling Jianxue’s relatives? Joining Ling Jianxue’s forces? This was far too preposterous! Only someone as simple-minded as Chen Shuangshuang would believe this.

Ling Han slapped Yang Xiao’s face, and smilingly said, “I’m the one asking questions, not the other way around, understood?”

He didn’t threaten Yang Xiao, yet he was filled with a dignified and formidable aura that instantly sent chills down Yang Xiao’s spine.

“Understood!” Yang Xiao hurriedly said with a nod.

“Alright, tell me about your experiences from these past few days,” Ling Han commanded in a calm voice.

Yang Xiao hesitated for a brief moment. However, a cold chill instantly gripped his heart. Ling Han’s gaze was far too terrifying, and it made him feel the danger of death. He hurriedly recounted his experiences from the past few days.

“Bastard!” Chen Shuangshuang roared in wild rage. Not only did this bastard want to trick her, but he even wanted to feed her aphrodisiac?!

He truly deserved death!

Ling Han told the Empress to calm Chen Shuangshuang down. What he cared more about was what had occurred after he left that day.

“There’s a giant statue under the village, and as long as one sincerely prays before this statue, they’ll obtain its blessing and power?” Ling Han murmured. This was identical to Ascent Route Island.

They would lure people in with an easily obtainable power first, and when these people became addicted, they would convince them to abandon their current cultivation system, and adopt a new one.

Xiong Si definitely harbored sinister intentions. He wanted to use Yang Xiao to infiltrate the Heavenly Saint Palace. If this occurred for generation after generation, it was truly possible that this Eighth-Heaven force would eventually be overtaken.

The hands of this dark force had already moved toward a powerful sect like the Heavenly Saint Palace. The situation was much direr than Ling Han had imagined.

Ling Han casually waved his hand. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

Relentless flames swept by, instantly incinerating Yang Xiao into ashes.

“Why did you kill him?” Chen Shuangshuang asked in a daze.

“If I didn’t kill him, what would I leave him around for?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “Let’s go, let’s have a chat with the leader of the Vicious Bear Gang. Hopefully he’s a big fish. Oh, that’s right, why has Xiao Gu suddenly disappeared at this kind of time?”

They set off for the small village.

Ling Han had already visited this village once, so returning was naturally very easy. It only took them half a day to arrive.

Peng!

With a wave of his hand, Ling Han tossed Xiao Cheng forward. Xiao Cheng slid across the street of the village, carving out a deep ditch.

Everyone in the village instantly stopped what they were doing to stare at Ling Han. They were all brimming with violent auras.

“Call your leader over,” Ling Han said calmly.

“Haha! Where is this audacious person from? You actually dared to barge into our Vicious Bear Village with several beauties? Are you seeking death?” someone in the village immediately said with a loud laugh.

Ling Han snapped his fingers.

Whoosh!

A burst of sword light swept through the air, sending a column of blood into the sky. The person’s head slid off from his neck.

His knees buckled, and they thudded into the ground. His headless body then leaned forward and slammed into the ground, sending a plume of dust into the air.

He was dead.

Deathly silence fell over the village. Thunderous shouts then erupted, and the villagers were all wild with rage.

An outsider had actually dared to barge over and kill someone? This was blatant provocation!

“Kill him!”

“Rape his women!”

Boom! They all charged at Ling Han, brandishing their swords and sabers as they did so.

Ling Han raised a hand.

Weng!

A burst of sword light burst forth, transforming into several hundred bursts of sword light as it did so. Sword light flooded the entire sky.

When these bursts of sword light vanished, not a single person on the street was left alive.

Ling Han strode forward. He knew where Xiong Si lived. However, whether or not the latter was present was another question.

It wasn’t long before they arrived at their destination and stopped. This was because Xiong Si was already waiting for them at his door.

“I’m Xiong Si. Greetings, everyone!” Xiong Si was like an elegant and respectful gentleman as he greeted them. He didn’t seem like a brute at all. “May I know how I offended you to the stage of being so ruthless?”

Ling Han wore a faint smile as he replied, “I didn’t like the look of them. How’s this reason?”

“Didn’t like the look of them? Good one!” Xiong Si said as he roared with laughter. As he laughed, seven men instantly appeared, three to Ling Han’s left and four to his right.

Xiong Si’s expression instantly transformed into one of viciousness, and he said, “I also don’t like the look of you people, so I’m going to kill you all!”

As he said this, the seven people lashed out in unison, attacking Ling Han and the others.

These seven people were the pillars of the Vicious Bear Gang, and they were all Yang Soul elites. Thus, by teaming up, they were confident that they could achieve victory.

Ling Han casually raised his hand.

Weng!

The power of Regulations transformed into a sword that slashed down at the seven people. They instantly collapsed to the ground, and the world around them instantly became peaceful and tranquil again.

Xiong Si’s vicious expression instantly vanished, and he said, “Brother, let’s resolve things peacefully!” He was like an obedient dog, and he continued to bow at Ling Han as he spoke. “Brother, how should I refer to you?”

However, when he straightened his body…

Whoosh!

A burst of black light shot out from his chest, stabbing at Ling Han.

This light didn’t contain the power of Regulations, yet it seemed like a world of its own. It contained a unique Regulation, and it was as if it could sever all matter in this world.

Ling Han reached forward.

Weng!

The column of black light ground to a halt before him, unable to advance any further.

“The power of darkness,” he said in a faint voice. He looked at Xiong Si, placing him under a mountain of pressure.

Xiong Si groaned as the color drained from his face.

How was this person so powerful?

Xiong Si was at Yin Soul, and his opponent was also at Yin Soul. Moreover, the former had activated a secret technique, and he had more so received a blessing from the Deity. Add to that an element of surprise, and he should have definitely caught Ling Han off guard.

“Spit it out, who’s above you?” Ling Han asked.

“Brother, I only like women. I don’t like men. How can there be someone above me?” Xiong Si said. He continued to act stupid and speak nonsense.

Ling Han raised his hand again.

Swoosh!

A burst of sword light swept forward, instantly severing one of Xiong Si’s arms.

“Aaah!” Xiong Si screamed in agony.
