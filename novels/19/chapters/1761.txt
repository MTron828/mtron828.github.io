Chapter 1762: Advancing to second severance

Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Han Qi gaped, completely incapable of believing his own eyes.

This place was the treasury of the Han Clan, and also the most heavily guarded location. Putting aside the fact that outsiders wouldn’t be able to come in here at all, even for the Han Clan itself, there were not many members that were allowed to come here, either.

He was the youngest son of the patriarch of the Han Clan, and thus was given special privileges. After advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, he could experience a Celestial bath here. Not only would it stabilize his cultivation level, it could further increase his strength.

When he used this opportunity to reach the middle stage or even the late stage of the first severance, he would go and seek Ling Han out to personally take revenge for their previous grudge.

...His cultivation level could soar just by taking a bath; amazing, right? Hehe, this was the power of a three-star force!

But Han Qi could never have imagined that when he pushed these doors open, he would actually see three outsiders here, and what made him feel even more stifled was that one of them was actually Ling Han.

This, h-how was this possible!?

These words kept going over and over in his head.

How could this be... how could this be... how could this be...

After at least a few breaths, he suddenly came back to himself. These three guys actually absorbed all the essence in the Celestial Bath Pools!

Looking at the color of the pool waters, he knew that it had completely turned into ordinary clear water.

His expression immediately became extremely miserable. That was his Celestial medicine bath, yet it had now been absorbed completely by his enemy. This almost caused his heart to shatter.

“Y-y-you...” He pointed at Ling Han, his whole body trembling and face extraordinarily pale. He could not even muster up a single breath.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and asked the large black dog, “You already knew that this was the Han Clan’s place?”

“That’s right, do you think that your Grandpa Dog is so idle and free?” the large black dog scoffed.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “This is the first time that I think that you have done a good deed.”

“Pei, Grandpa Dog has always done only good deeds! What people call as the epitome of morality is Grandpa Dog,” the large black dog declared, completely shameless.

This large black dog was really quite interesting. It was aware of the various incidents of the Han Clan coercing Ling Han, and thus brought him here to rob the Han Clan blind. En, this deserved a full cup of wine!

“Y-y-you...” Han Qi’s breath still had not been mustered up, but his expression was already turned from white to green, and he could possibly faint at any time.

Those were 10 Celestial Bath Pools, and who knew how many billion years was needed to prepare all of them. If he was not the direct son of the ancestor of the Han Clan, how could he possibly be allowed to come here for a bath the moment he advanced to the first severance?

But even so, he could only enter into a single Celestial Bath Pool. Otherwise, he would definitely be heavily punished by the clan, and it was not impossible for him to be even executed.

And now? All 10 Celestial Bath Pools had been completely sucked dry!

“All of you, die!” Han Qi finally exploded. He summoned a flag, and the moment it unfurled, a sudden air of extreme coldness spread out. Ka, ka, ka. Thick layers of ice appeared on the pillars and floor tiles of the palace.

Ling Han took a step forward, and the Nine Heavens Flame surged. Boom, the severe coldness was instantly stopped.

He crossed his arms behind his back, and stepped towards Han Qi. The Nine Heavens Flame blazed, splitting the ice in half, allowing him to calmly and leisurely approach Han Qi.

Han Qi gritted his teeth, and waved the flag with all his might, attempting to stop Ling Han’s approach.

It was useless. He had only just entered the first severance, so how was he supposed to match Ling Han? Even if the flag in his grasp was a Pseudo Celestial Tool, it was useless. At most it could only display the might of the peak stage of the first severance in his hands, and in front of Ling Han, this was less than nothing.

Seeing Ling Han had already come very close, Han Qi could only grit his teeth, turn around, and run.

This was the territory of the Han Clan, and who knew how many elites were standing guard here. How could Ling Han be allowed to do as he liked here?

But his body had just turned around when Ling Han clutched his neck with a single move.

Han Qi couldn’t help but be greatly shocked. Could it be that he would have to destroy his physical body again?

Yet Ling Han did not make a move. He knew that there was definitely a protective technique that an elite had placed in Han Qi’s body, and couldn’t bother himself to spare the effort, either. He directly sealed off Han Qi’s cultivation level, and then tossed him over to the large black dog. “Is there any way to make him suffer as much as possible under the condition that his life is not harmed?”

The large black dog’s eyes turned, and he immediately showed a hint of excitement. “Leave it to me!” But then, his expression immediately changed. “Oh no, this brat has touched the restrictions, and there are presently elites of the Han Clan rushing over, let’s retreat quickly!”

Ling Han nodded. Though they had only robbed two treasure palaces here, and there were a considerable number of other places they had not emptied out yet, how would they be able to match Immortal Palace Tier elites?

Retreat, retreat, retreat.

They went back the same way they had come. After they had exited the final protective formation, the large black dog still spared some effort to repair the formation, restoring it to a flawless condition. In this way, the Han Clan would have completely no idea where they had come in from.

And thus, they could also leave a back door for themselves. In future, they could continue to enter from this spot.

Then, they traveled back to where the bushes were, yet saw that there would be occasional elites streaking past in the skies as well as powerful divine sense doing multiple sweeps. Clearly, the entire Han Clan had already been alerted completely, and they were intending to find their uninvited guests.

The large black dog set up a temporary Transfer Formation, which only sent them out of the surrounding diameter of 10,000 miles. However, this was already outside the territory of the Han Clan. Then, they circled back, and activated the formation again. With a flash of light, they had already returned to Dark Moon City.

After their taking the formation apart, no one would know what they had done or where they had gone.

The large black dog carried Han Qi off with it with a snicker, and came back only after half a day had passed. However, Han Qi had disappeared. The large black dog explained, “Grandpa Dog stuffed that brat under a latrine pit. I guarantee that there is no way that the Han Clan could find him even if they turned the whole Celestial Realm upside down!”

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily became strange. Indeed, what Celestial level elite would want to look under a latrine pit? Furthermore, Celestials were immortal, so with the fact that Han Qi was buried underneath a latrine pit, he could not possibly die for billions of years, yet he would never see the light of day again, either.

The large black dog was indeed two-faced to the extreme. The consequences of offending him were very serious.

Ling Han and the Empress entered into seclusion. They had absorbed all 10 Celestial Bath Pools, and this was something accumulated by the Han Clan over who knew how many billions of years—even a three-star force needed innumerable billions of years to be able to accumulate such resources, so how valuable was it?

A month later, they emerged from the Black Tower. Suddenly, tribulation clouds gathered.

They were both about to break through to the second severance!

The two of them greeted the heavenly tribulation head-on, and with how freakish they were, they naturally survived it easily.

Second severance!

They were both very excited, and did not think that they would have advanced into the second severance so quickly. However, this was only possible by relying on the accumulated resources of a three-star force. Of course, the other reason was also because they had the Reincarnation Tree, which allowed them to digest these benefits in the nick of time.

Not long after, the large black dog also scrambled over. He had actually advanced to the second severance as well.

Ling Han was already able to remain calm in the face of this freak dog’s strangeness.

“Han Hongfei has already left Dark Moon City, and just nice, we can return and play around again at the Ding Clan,” Ling Han said coldly. Previously, he only knew that there was not a single good person in the Ding Clan, but he had never imagined that they would actually be so deranged to actually create an evil object like the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts.

If that kind of evil Tool was successfully refined, it meant that millions and millions of lives had been erased. Otherwise, it was definitely impossible that this evil Tool could possess such frightening might.
