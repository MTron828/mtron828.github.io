Chapter 1490 Frightening Collisions

Peng! Peng! Peng!

After several hundred collisions, Second in the World started to struggle, even though he possessed the physique of an Iron Bone Barbaric Bear. He stumbled around the arena, and it was as if he were drunk.

He bared his teeth, and his expression was as pained as could be. It was as if there were stars before his eyes, and his entire body was sore and hurting. Even raising his arm or lifting his foot would send bursts of pain through his entire body.

‘Is this brat human?

‘Even the descendants of True Dragons aren’t this ferocious!’

Second in the World was certain that the physique of Iron Bone Barbaric Bears was comparable to that of True Dragons, even though True Dragons were ranked above Iron Bone Barbaric Bears in the Divine Beast Rankings.

However, Ling Han looked as if he were completely unfazed. This astonished him greatly, and he felt an urge to vomit blood.

“Again?” Ling Han asked politely. With his current physique—which was nearing the toughness of Level 15 Godly metal—even the full-power attack of an elite at the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier might not be able to wound him. Thus, his collisions with Second in the World were nothing to worry about.

Second in the World wanted to quit, but he was called Second in the World, and he only acknowledged the power of his ancestor, “First”. As such, how could he accept the fact that his physique was weaker than Ling Han’s?

“Come!” he said with vigor.

“Then let’s charge at each other again,” Ling Han said indifferently. He prepared to charge forward.

Second in the World couldn’t help but shudder. Not only was he hurting from the collisions now, but he was even feeling apprehensive of them. Moreover, the pain from the collisions could be forcefully suppressed, but the mental pressure that he felt before the collisions was immense. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

‘How f*cking painful is the collision going to be?!’

Upon thinking of this, his fighting spirit immediately started to wane.

Ling Han detected this, and he couldn’t help but chuckle. “We can compete in other areas as well.”

“No, we’ll stick to this!” Second in the World said. However, after pondering for a moment, he added, “Unless you’re afraid!”

‘You’ve brought this upon yourself!’ Ling Han said in his mind.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Let’s continue!”

‘Holy f*ck!’

Second in the World genuinely wanted to slap himself. Ling Han had clearly given an out, yet he had insisted on maintaining his face. He had brought this pain upon himself!

Sigh!

Peng, peng, peng!

Ling Han started to charge at Second in the World.

Second in the World shuddered upon seeing this. However, he still shut his eyes and charged at Ling Han.

Peng!

There was a loud boom, and they were both sent flying back.

Ling Han retreated quickly, yet he charged forward even more quickly. He immediately hurtled toward Second in the World again. At this moment, he was like a raging bull.

Second in the World wanted to cry. Ordinarily, it would be him using this kind of tactic to bully his opponents into submission. Not only would his opponents lose the battle, but they would even suffer a mental breakdown. Now, however, he discovered that it was he who was facing a mental breakdown.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

They collided a dozen or so times again. Ling Han was just about to collide with Second in the World again, yet he was astonished to discover that Second in the World suddenly leaned to the left the instant that they were about to collide. The two of them scraped past each other. This was their first miss where they didn’t collide with each other.

“You’re not playing anymore?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Second in the World was extremely stubborn, and he replied, “I simply slipped.”

“Fine!” Ling Han nodded before falling silent again. He continued to charge forward.

He could easily overcome these small tricks.

Second in the World also accelerated toward Ling Han. However, just as they were about to collide, he suddenly leaned to the side again.

Ling Han turned around, and asked, “You’ve slipped again?”

“The sunlight was too blinding, so I shifted over to avoid it,” Second in the World said. He made up another excuse.

Again!

“My shoelaces came undone.

“I suddenly felt thirsty, and I wanted to drink some water.

“The moonlight looks brilliant, and I want to appreciate it for a moment.

“...”

Afterward, Second in the World started to make up all kinds of excuses, not daring to collide with Ling Han. However, he was extremely stubborn, and he was still unwilling to admit defeat.

The spectators were already roaring with laughter. Who would have imagined that a supreme king tier would also be so shameless?

Ling Han was also rendered speechless. Although Second in the World looked like a wild bear, his ability to make up excuses and mess around was also top-notch. He continued to give excuse after excuse, and he was more so frank and confident as he uttered these nonsensical excuses. He didn’t seem embarrassed in the least.

Before becoming an elite, did one have to train to become shameless first?

Ling Han started to become more ferocious. It was Second in the World who had chosen to battle like this, and Ling Han had already given him a chance to compete in other areas. However, he was extremely stubborn and had insisted on continuing with this kind of battle. Thus, he had to suffer the consequences even with tears in his eyes!

Ling Han started to deduce his opponent’s movements as he activated the Star Plucking Step and charged forward again.

Second in the World used the same tactic again, leaning to the side the instant before they were about to collide. However, Ling Han’s body also leaned over at this moment, and the two of them instantly collided together.

Peng!

They were both pushed dozens of meters back by the overwhelming force of the collision.

Second in the World’s entire body was trembling. Only he knew that several of his bones had already been broken. At the same time, his flesh had also been crushed and ripped open. The collisions were already starting to leave marks on his body. He had evaded Ling Han numerous times before, and he had finally managed to recover some of his Origin Power. However, after the collision just then, he received even more wounds on top of his old wounds. His situation became even direr.

“Y-you... Why did you collide with me?” he shouted.

The spectators couldn’t help but laugh upon hearing his aggrieved cry. Weren’t they competing by colliding with each other? Why was he suddenly dissatisfied now?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I accidentally slipped.”

He replied with one of his opponent’s excuses.

Again!

Peng!

“Why did you stray off course again?”

“The sunlight is too blinding.”

Peng!

“What about this time?”

“My shoelaces came undone.”

Peng!

“...”

After colliding a dozen or so more times, Ling Han had already finished returning all of Second in the World’s excuses back to him. Second in the World was vexed yet helpless.

“I admit defeat!” He finally decided to end this battle.

Ling Han smiled upon hearing this. Second in the World was truly blind to compete against his physique head-on.

“Brother Second, let’s battle again in the future,” he said.

Second in the World was slowly limping off the arena. However, it was as if his rear had been struck by an arrow upon hearing this, and he immediately dashed down and ran away. His speed was astonishing.

He had definitely been scarred by this battle.

Ling Han shook his head and also left the arena. He then looked toward the other battles.

Those who could make it to the final 16 were elites among elites and king tiers among king tiers. Among them, only Ling Han and Second in the World had chosen to battle against each other head-on. Meanwhile, the remaining king tiers had all left a large distance between them and their opponents. They were all unleashing powerful techniques at each other.

Thus, his battle against Second in the World was the first to end. The other king tiers were still engaged in intense battles.

He looked toward Empress Luan Xing. Her opponent wasn’t a rank three king tier, but rather a rank two king tier. However, they had a Pseudo-Saint Tool in their hands, and they were more so at the Eternal River Tier. Their strength was quite impressive.

After reaching this level, the gap between rank three king tiers and rank two king tiers already wasn’t that evident. In fact, possession of a high-level God Tool could even allow one to mitigate it or surpass it.

However, the empress also had a brick in her hands. Although this was a strange weapon, the empress’ enchanting figure meant that she still appeared stunningly beautiful even with the brick in her hands. Gazing at her figure was extremely refreshing.

The spectators were overwhelmingly on her side, and they relentlessly cheered her on. In fact, some of them were even threatening her opponent and calling for them to surrender. If they didn’t surrender, they would suffer a beating each time they were seen in the future.

Ling Han smiled upon seeing this. In fact, the empress was in full control of the tempo of this battle. Moreover, the Absolute Beginning Stone was particularly powerful, and thus she was destined to win this battle.

He then looked toward the Rain Emperor’s battle. Coincidentally, his Second Brother’s opponent was Zi Chenfeng. There was no doubt that he would suffer defeat. However, drawing upon his willpower of bravery and invincibility, the Rain Emperor could still withstand his opponent’s attacks for a while.

The Notionless Saint was even more unfortunate than him, and his opponent was none other than Gu Daoyi.

In fact, he didn’t need to feel too bad about this. Although he had been a Saint before, he had only been a Small Saint. Meanwhile, Gu Daoyi had been a first severance grand elder. Right now, he more so possessed a Divine Fetus. As such, he could easily suppress the Notionless Saint’s Five Element Body. That being the case, it was only natural that the Notionless Saint was no match for him.
