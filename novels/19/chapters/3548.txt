Chapter 3549: Rapid improvement of cultivation level

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The long sword stabbed into the pig’s body, and instantly, it could not advance the slightest bit further. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The perverted pig was definitely the best shield. It could dissipate all attacks that it suffered, and would not suffer the slightest bit of effect.

But he was f****** in pain.

The perverted pig screamed in agony. If it could, it would definitely bite Ling Han to death. Just how much pain had Uncle Pig suffered?

Ling Han withdrew the perverted pig and continued to run.

“Don’t run!” That person hurriedly set off in pursuit. However, this place was filled with gigantic flowers and grasses, and every single one of them was covered with poison. Though it was not fatal, it would be extraordinarily itchy and hard to bear. No one would be willing to touch it.

Thus, both Ling Han and that person’s speed was very slow, and they did not display the speed that they should have at all.

However, in such an environment, the better one’s control over movement techniques, the faster their speed would naturally be. Ling Han gradually increased the distance between himself and the person behind him.

“Tell me your name, and in a few days, I will come and slaughter you!” Ling Han turned around and said.

“Humph, I am Sikong Huan, come and kill me!” That person said balefully. Naturally, there was no way he would be afraid. Ling Han was still a very long way off from Mystery Realm Tier.

Ling Han nodded. In any case, he had already memorized this person’s appearance. Even if Sikong Huan was not his real name, he could still find him and kill him.

He sped up, and soon disappeared among the flowers.

He found a place to bury the gourd, and only the mouth of the gourd was revealed. It was very covert. Then, Ling Han also entered. He was going to begin breaking through to Five Inscriptions.

This kind of conventional breakthrough was naturally no big deal for Ling Han. He was only going through the motions. Thus, after less than half a day, he had also inscribed an inscribed pattern on his kidney, but the number of veined patterns was still only 1.7 million, and it was difficult to improve further.

In truth, a million was already his limit. Now, he was breaking through his limits. In life, one should not be too greedy.

With a single thought, the inscribed patterns on his internal organs all lit up, boosting his battle prowess. At the same time, it also had the effect of protecting his organs.

In the human body, aside from the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, there was also the stomach, large intestines, small intestines, bladders, gallbladder, and so on. If one could inscribe on all of them, then one’s defenses would undoubtedly be greatly improved.

In this place, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll wasn’t so powerful anymore. Cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to the pinnacle of each cultivation level was the way to go.

But even the so-called genius prodigies could only cultivate to Six Inscriptions, and Seven Inscriptions had never been heard of, but to inscribe all the organs such as the stomach, intestines and guts, just how many inscriptions was that? Ten Inscriptions? Fifteen Inscriptions?

Could he reach this kind of height?

“From One Inscription to Five Inscriptions, this is a leap in level of being, and in every cultivation level, there is a limit to the leap in level of being. The limit of ordinary people is five, and six for prodigies. Only freaks like me can reach seven.”

“Hence, it is impossible to accomplish a leap in level of being eight times. However, there should still be hope if I want only to inscribe inscriptions on my organs and increase my defenses.”

Ling Han thought. His current rate of advancement was really too fast. In two to three days, he would be qualified to break through to Six Inscriptions, and in another two to three days, he would be able to break through to Seven Inscriptions. Thus, he now had to consider the matter of eight, nine or even more inscriptions.

He did not waste any more time to cross the flower fields, but rather began to meditate in the gourd. Sometimes, he would also discuss with the seven toddlers, and talk about his ideas.

“Seven Inscriptions?” The seven babies all exclaimed in shock, then shook their heads in unison.

“Father, five is the limit, and six is breaking the limit. Seven can’t possibly exist in this world,” Second Baby said seriously.

Ling Han was surprised. Even these babies that seemed to know everything didn’t think that there was Seventh Change, Seventh Extreme, and Seven Inscriptions. So, in history, was there really no one that had reached the limit after the limit?

He looked towards the lecherous pig. The lecherous pig humphed, still angry, completely ignoring him.

“However, Father, what you are suggesting is only inscribing inscriptions, but doesn’t involve the improvement of the level of being, so there’s still hope.” Eldest Baby nodded, “As far as I remember, there were ancestors who realized it, but the prerequisite was to reach Six Inscriptions. Moreover, they had to inscribe on the other organs at the same time when they were breaking through to Six Inscriptions.”

“However, doing so will decrease the power of the sixth inscription. After all, people have limited energy. Moreover, the further down the path of cultivation, the more final paths there will be. In this way, to inscribe inscriptions on more organs, although it will increase one’s defense, it will also decrease one’s attack power.”

“So, there will be times when the moon will be dim, clear and full, and it can’t possibly be perfect,” Sixth Baby added adorably.

Ling Han nodded slowly. He didn’t care that there were a few less patterns during his breakthrough into Six Inscriptions, because he had long since pushed the number of patterns to the limit. Even if Six Inscriptions only had tens of thousands of patterns, it actually wouldn’t have much effect on his battle prowess. The only difference was the vitality and defense of his organs. The more veined patterns there were, the more energetic his organs would be. This could be seen from the heart, liver, and other organs that he had inscribed.

Thus, Ling Han still wanted to perfect all of his organs as much as possible.

Multitasking?

Ling Han thought. This was the only way. When breaking through to Seven Inscriptions, he would simultaneously inscribe on the remaining organs, and the lowest requirement would be to reach a million veined patterns.

Occasionally, he would come out of the gourd and check if this natural great formation was channelled to a “zero” state, allowing people to pass through.

However, the cycle of this great formation was considerably long. At least, it was still far from reaching the point when its might was the weakest.

Ling Han continued to wait. He continuously simulated the progress of Seven Inscriptions, because at that time, he would have to inscribe all the remaining inscribed patterns on all the remaining organs.

He had never thought of the problem of being unable to attain Seven Inscriptions. If that was really the case, then he would be no different from a normal Six Inscriptions.

“I definitely can!”

At the beginning of the day, he began to cultivate. With the help of the Ice Origin Stone, his cultivation progressed at an extraordinarily fast pace. One day was half a year or even one year faster than others.

However, the Ice Origin Stone also had a huge disadvantage, and that was its range of influence was very wide. Probably everyone within a radius of 5,000km would be able to benefit, so it was also very easy for Ling Han to attract enemies.

He was endlessly hunted down, and the most infuriating thing was that he had not even finished cultivating, when his opponents had already charged over, so he had no choice but to stop cultivating.

Precisely because of this, he had initially estimated that he would be able to cultivate to the end of Five Inscriptions in two days, at most three days, yet now, it had forcefully dragged on until the fifth day.

The problem was that the Ice Origin Stone was continuously being consumed, causing Ling Han’s heart to ache terribly.

“These b@stards, when I advance into Seven Inscriptions, I’ll kill all of them!” He was angered, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

But after enduring for five days, he had still cultivated to the finishing line of Five Inscriptions, and could break through to Six Inscriptions.

There were enough Treasured Fruits of Life, so Ling Han began to charge forward without hesitation.

For others, Six Inscriptions was already breaking limits, and was incredibly difficult. Ordinary prodigies would only dare to think about it. At the very least, one would have to be a one-star genius to even have that little bit of hope of breaking through.

However, for Ling Han, Six Inscriptions was equivalent to an ordinary person breaking through to Five Inscriptions. It was slightly difficult, but that was about it..
