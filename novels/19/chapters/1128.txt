Chapter 1129: Returning to the Joint Peace Planet

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ever since being “groped” by Ling Han, the empress had naturally viewed him as a perverted, vulgar, and shameless scoundrel. However, after spending close to two years together, she realized that Ling Han’s conduct was nothing short of “noble”.

The restraint that he had shown at the end even more so required overwhelming willpower and resolution. Moreover, he had even exposed his precious treasure in order to protect her purity. It could be said that his conduct was blindingly noble!

Could she still kill Ling Han?

Of course not! That would be repaying kindness with hatred!

In fact, Empress Luan Xing rejoiced slightly in the fact that she had been trapped with Ling Han, and not some other man. If it were another man, she would have definitely lost her purity and chastity already. Just thinking about such a possibility made her shudder and feel a strong sense of lingering fear.

Moreover, in order to ensure that he received a disciple, Notionless Saint would have definitely made her copulate several times. This was even more terrifying.

In a sense, Ling Han was a big benefactor of hers. In fact, she owed him so much that she wouldn’t be able to repay him this entire lifetime!

The problem was, the memories of her kissing, hugging, and intertwining with him were all seared into her mind as well. How could she relax upon recalling these events? There was a heavy burden on her, and it was her goal to become the strongest cultivator in the world.

There was a blemish in her dao heart now, and this would potentially affect her future cultivation. What could she do about this?

How could she not be worried?

In the end, she could only reply with a soft “Mm-hm”. This was her way of saying “I know”.

Ling Han could understand her difficulties to a certain degree. However, he wasn’t female, after all, and he was more so not Empress Luan Xing. Perhaps he could only understand less than one percent of what she was feeling at the moment.

“Your Majesty, let’s pretend the events of these past few days never occurred. What do you say?”

Empress Luan Xing was riled up upon hearing this.

Only she could say that!

‘You touched me, kissed me, and embraced me, yet you want to pretend none of that happened with a mere few words?’

If Ling Han knew of her thoughts, he would definitely shout that he was being wronged... because it was in fact this empress that had touched him, kissed him, and embraced him, okay?! If it hadn’t been for his strong willpower, there was even a strong possibility that she would have f*cked him!

‘Unfaithful man!’ Empress Luan Xing scolded in her mind.

However, she instantly chided her own thoughts. Was this man worthy of being her husband? No way! She humphed, and said, “Or else? Perhaps you wanted to remember them and have more fantasies about me?”

‘Ahhhh! She’s truly not cute at all. She’s far too haughty!’

Ling Han sighed in his mind. Being beautiful indeed gave one the right to be whimsical. Although she had thrown a barb at him, he couldn’t dislike her no matter what. He nodded in his mind. He definitely had to keep his distance from this stunning beauty. Otherwise, he would genuinely lose himself to her.

Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing both remained silent and lost in their own thoughts. Meanwhile, under the manipulation of Notionless Saint, a starship surprisingly appeared within the large tomb!

Although Notionless Saint had been severely wounded, and even had his Saintly Origin stolen, he had still been a Saint, after all. He had made many preparations before his death, this hidden starship being one of them—he had prepared this for his future disciple.

However, it was possible for him to live a second life now, so of course he took this starship out to use now.

This was a small starship, and it was only fitted with a small number of defensive formations. These formations were used to deal with meteoroids or black holes that suddenly appeared in the galaxy. They didn’t possess any offensive ability.

The starship was too small, after all, so it was impossible to carve too many formations onto it.

Nothing could have been done about this. Notionless Saint had only prepared this in the moments before his death, so what time did he have to make things perfect?

He returned to the Black Tower after summoning the starship. Only his divine sense was left right now, and he had even refined his own Saintly might. Thus, it was impossible for him to stay alone in the outside world for too long. Instead, it was necessary for him to attach himself to external objects such as the Reincarnation Tree. Not only would this allow him to live on, but it would even allow him to live on better. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This was a Godly tree that required 12 trillion years to grow—could its effects not be spectacular?

Relying on the preparations that he had left, it was still possible for him to suppress the Heavenly Body Tier elites in this large tomb. In fact, it was even possible for him to suppress weaker Eternal River Tier elites. Once he left this large tomb, however, he would merely be a damaged soul—a damaged soul that had refined his own Saintly might, no less. In other words, he would pose absolutely no threat.

Apart from giving Ling Han some suggestions, he could do absolutely sh*t-all!

Meanwhile, Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing were both sitting inside the starship. There were no resting rooms or anything of the sort, and there was only a single cabin. However, this cabin was definitely bigger than Ling Han’s Cloud Piercing Shuttle. It was able to fit around 10 people.

The atmosphere was quite delicate, with neither of them speaking to each other. However, they were stuck in a small space, after all, so Ling Han could still smell the mesmerizing bodily fragrance of the empress. This filled his body with desire.

He had seen the empress’ true appearance before, and he had even experienced intimate contact with her as well. This allowed his imagination to run wild.

“Don’t let your imagination run wild!” Empress Luan Xing suddenly said in reprimand.

Ling Han rolled his eyes. ‘So, you even know what’s going on in my mind?’

He smiled faintly, and said, “Okay, I won’t think about that anymore.”

“You’re still thinking about that!” Empress Luan Xing said in accusation.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Oh, really?”

After seeing the seductive and charming side of this empress, it was extremely hard for him to fear her anymore.

His only complaint was that this empress was mighty, seductive, pure, and stunningly beautiful, yet for some reason, didn’t possess the adorable charm of a girl. If she were to flirt with him in a sweet and adorable voice, it was extremely likely that he wouldn’t be able to control himself, even with his strong willpower.

Empress Luan Xing seethed with anger. This man actually showed her no respect at all! He had revolted! Revolted!

She was fuming, and she felt an urge to suppress Ling Han. However, she was instantly surprised by her own thoughts. Her emotions had actually been affected by a dirty man?

Crap, it was all over... After experiencing intimate contact with that man, she couldn’t wipe him from her mind anymore!

This result was partly because she had remained too pure before. Otherwise, why would Ling Han be etched so deeply in her mind? They hadn’t done anything truly sexual, after all.

The starship continued through the galaxy. They didn’t experience any accidents or disasters that were common in the galaxy, and thus they arrived back at the Joint Peace Planet in just a few days’ time.

Fortunately, neither the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire nor the Jade Drop Majestic Empire had attacked the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire during the two years that Empress Luan Xing had been absent.

This was understandable, though. After all, how were they to know that Empress Luan Xing had only just returned?

However, Ling Han was feeling quite pissed off. This was because the Majestic Heaven Sect had already finished selecting disciples a year ago. In other words, he had already lost his opportunity to go.

His three brothers, as well as Helian Tianyun and his disciple, Ding Ping, had all successfully entered the Majestic Heaven Sect and gone to the Flying Cloud Planet. He had also heard that the Rain Emperor and Ding Ping had been granted the status of a so-called seed 1 . As such, they would enjoy special treatment and priority nurturing from the sect.

In addition to them, Shui Yanyu had also successfully entered the sect. Although she wasn’t especially outstanding, her age combined with her cultivation level was sufficient for her to qualify into the sect. It was just that she couldn’t become a seed.

The new disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect were divided into three categories—seeds, outstanding disciples, and ordinary disciples. Thus, excluding the two seeds—the Rain Emperor and Ding Ping—Helian Tianyun and Feng Po Yun were both granted the status of outstanding disciple. Meanwhile, Murong Qing and Shui Yanyu were both ordinary disciples.

As for Ling Han... where should he go next?
