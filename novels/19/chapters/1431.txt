Chapter 1432 The Victim Has Arrived

“Gasp! Who would’ve thought? He was actually a king tier!”“I wonder which galaxy he came from.”

“He was able to become a king tier, so he’s definitely from a large galaxy.”

“However, this king tier appears a bit devilish. He purposefully dug a hole for Wen Dong and screwed him over.”

“Heh, who told them to seal this area off and even prohibit others from ascending the mountain? I feel like he taught them a good lesson. The Purple Wind Mountain isn’t owned by their clans!”

“Exactly!”

The cultivators at the foot of the mountain launched into a spirited discussion, some of them feeling that Ling Han was slightly devilish, and many more of them supporting his actions.

“Let’s climb the mountain,” the Rain Emperor said. His fists were already starting to itch.

Seeing that Ling Han and the others were preparing to climb the mountain, a cold sneer involuntarily stretched across Wen Dong’s face.

‘Where do you think this is? Why do you think the prodigies chose this place to taste tea and discuss dao? It’s because no one else can reach the top of this mountain!’

King tiers could naturally reach the top of this mountain with ease. However, even four-star geniuses like them would feel under immense pressure if they tried to climb to the peak of this mountain. At least, they definitely wouldn’t have any remaining energy to engage in battles.

According to rumors, the Purple Wind Mountain had only become like this because of the actions of a Saint. It was him who had transformed this mountain, imbuing it with its strange powers. When it came to ordinary cultivators, they would struggle to ascend this mountain even if they had reached the Heavenly Body Tier. Only by reaching the pinnacle level in at least one major tier and then reaching the Heavenly Body Tier would one obtain the ability to climb this mountain easily.

Moreover, the more pinnacle levels that one had reached, the easier it would be to climb this mountain.

‘Are these people all king tiers?

‘What a joke! How can that be possible?!’

Wen Dong was eager to see them fail.

He had been embarrassed before everyone, and thus he naturally yearned to see them being embarrassed before everyone as well. This way, he would at least have some consolation.

Not only was Wen Dong thinking this, but many other people were also thinking the same thing. How rare were king tiers? It was extremely difficult for a planet to produce even one king tier. As such, it was likely that there would only be 10 such king tiers in an entire galaxy. Moreover, this was for a large galaxy. If it were a small galaxy, perhaps it would only be able to produce one or two king tiers. In fact, it was entirely possible that it would produce none.

Just as Ling Han and the others were about to embark on their climb, they suddenly saw three figures shooting over from the distance. One of them was in a wretched state, with his entire left-arm non-existent. All that was left was a patch of mangled flesh.

“Young Master Yuan? Young Master Yuan!” a follower in green suddenly exclaimed. There was a stunned expression on his face. Just then, he hadn’t recognized the wounded person, because he had refused to believe that anyone on Wood Figure Planet, especially in this Purple Wind Mountain region, would dare to target a member of the Liu Clan.

Indeed, the wounded person was none other than Liu Shiyuan, the haughty youth who had been shot by Ling Han.

“Brother Qing!” Liu Shiyuan exclaimed. Tears involuntarily started to stream down his face as soon as he saw the follower in green.

Family, he had finally seen family!

He was incredibly moved, and he used his only arm to grab onto the follower in green, saying, “Brother Qing, you’ve got to help me exact revenge... You’ve got to help me exact revenge!”

“Who wounded you?” the person who Liu Shiyuan referred to as Brother Qing asked, his face cold and full of killing intent.

He was called Zhang Qing, and he wasn’t actually a member of the Liu Clan. Rather, he was the follower of the young king tier, Liu Juntian. He was naturally very powerful, and he was also a prodigy and a four-star genius. He could be referred to as a supreme prodigy no matter where he went.

Anyhow, he had only decided to follow Liu Juntian because he felt that Liu Juntian had a profoundly dazzling future. In fact, he believed that Liu Juntian could become a Saint in the future!

Meanwhile, he understood that he would have zero chance of becoming a Saint himself. As such, if he rode on Liu Juntian’s coattails, perhaps he could even become an Eternal River Tier elite in the future.

That was the Eternal River Tier! Was it not impressive enough?

Thus, he treated the Liu Clan as his own family. In fact, he treated it as more than his family. It was hundreds of times more important!

That being the case, how could he not feel enraged and worried upon seeing Liu Shiyuan’s severe wounds?

“It was a group of despicable men and women. Their leader... Aaah!” Liu Shiyuan’s gaze had been focused on Zhang Qing, yet he suddenly felt a terrifying chill creep up from behind him. He involuntarily turned around to look, only to see the man who was the root of his nightmares behind him. He couldn’t help but scream.

His speed was slower than Ling Han’s, but he hadn’t taken any detours along the way. He had directly hurried over here to ask his elder brother to exact revenge for him. Thus, he had only arrived here slightly later than Ling Han and the others.

However, just as he was speaking of his nemesis, his nemesis had appeared behind him!

Liu Shiyuan immediately scuttled behind Zhang Qing in fright, using his only hand to point at Liu Shiyuan, shouting, “Brother Qing, it was him! It was him! Hurry up and attack him! Kill him for me! No, severely wound him so I can kill him with my own hand! And those two women. Although their faces are covered, their bodies are quite shapely...” As he spoke, his mind started to wander.

His mind was wandering with lust even under such conditions. From this, it was clear that Liu Shiyuan lived up to the name of a true profligate.

However, Zhang Qing was instantly terrified.

Although he was also a prodigy, could he compete against a true king tier?

No! Unless his cultivation level was far superior!

Right now, however, he was only at the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier! He was already no match for him in terms of cultivation level. Moreover, how large was the gulf between prodigies and king tiers? How could he exact revenge for Liu Shiyuan? If he attacked, he would merely be seeking death.

“Huh? Brother Qing, why are you hesitating? Hurry up and attack him!” Liu Shiyuan urged. A look of displeasure spread across his face.

He was only referring to Zhang Qing as “Brother Qing” because his elder brother had asked him to do so. This was because Zhang Qing was a relatively good lackey he could use. Thus, he needed to take more care of his feelings. However, Zhang Qing was actually pretending to be deaf and mute when his nemesis was right before him? How could Liu Shiyuan not be displeased?

‘What’s the meaning of this?

‘You’re eating from my Liu Clan’s bowl, yet you’re not going to act as my Liu Clan’s dog?’

However, how would Zhang Qing dare to attack? There was a bitter look on his face, and he said, “Young Master Yuan, that person is a king tier!”

‘What?!’

Liu Shiyuan was instantly startled. His elder brother was also a king tier, so he naturally understood what these two words represented—invincible among the same cultivation level! Of course, this was an oxymoron because invincible implied that only one person could become a king tier for any one cultivation level. Even so, a king tier would be invincible at least on their own planet. Even when casting one’s gaze over entire galaxies, king tiers would only have fewer than 10 or so opponents.

King tier—these two words were like a huge mountain in and of themselves. They were capable of crushing someone until they were barely able to breathe.

However, a look of haughtiness immediately returned to Liu Shiyuan’s face, and he said, “There are ranks even among king tiers. My older brother is a rank two king tier!”

Indeed, just as he said, there were also ranks among king tiers. Even though they were all at the Heavenly Body Tier, would two people be of equivalent power if one had reached one pinnacle level while the other had reached two pinnacle levels? Even though the benefits of reaching these pinnacle levels would decrease as one advanced in cultivation, the gap between the king tiers would still exist, just that it wouldn’t be overly significant.

However, to king tiers, any slight gap could prove fatal when they were battling against a fellow king tier of the same cultivation. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

If a king tier had reached one pinnacle level, they would be referred to as a rank one king tier. If they had reached two pinnacle levels, they would be referred to as a rank two king tier. If they had reached three, they would be referred to as a rank three king tier, and so on and so forth. However, the maximum was only rank five. After all, there were only so many pinnacle levels for one to reach.

It was already common knowledge that king tiers were rare, with one galaxy only producing at most 10 king tiers. Among these, perhaps there would only be one or two rank two king tiers. In fact, it was even possible that there would be none.

However, Liu Juntian was none other than a rank two king tier!

“Where’s my brother? Call my brother over! Have him suppress this person!” Liu Shiyuan finally realized that Zhang Qing wouldn’t be able to defeat Ling Han.

Zhang Qing immediately made a decision, saying, “I’ll inform Master straight away!” He knew that Liu Juntian only had this one younger brother, and he was more so extremely doting toward him.

“Humph, this person actually dared to wound me. He’s truly become tired of li—” Liu Shiyuan said arrogantly. There were so many people here, and thus he wasn’t afraid of Ling Han attacking him. He wouldn’t dare!

Peng!

However, before he had even finished speaking, he suddenly transformed into a cloud of flesh and blood.
