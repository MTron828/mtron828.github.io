Chapter 1835: Big Trouble

Now that he had killed Bei Xuanming, would the Lunar Sect be willing to let things slide?

To say nothing of his friendly relationship with two three-star alchemists, the Lunar Sect would decide to kill him even if he were a grandson of one of the alchemists!

One could indeed act with arrogance and haughtiness if they had the support of a three-star alchemist. However, they couldn’t act as they pleased.

After all, alchemists only enjoyed such a lofty status because they were supported by cultivators. In other words, cultivators could choose to give them face, yet they could also choose not to give them face.

In this world, power was the ultimate deciding factor.

“L-Ling Han!” Fu Gaoyun and the others exclaimed in a shaky voice. Their faces were green with dread.

Ling Han glanced at them, and asked, “Hmm? What’s the matter?”

Upon seeing their extremely anxious expressions, he finally came to a sudden realization. “Oh, don’t worry, everything’s fine. This isn’t the first Holy Son of the Lunar Sect that I’ve killed. There was also another one... Hmm, what was his name again?”

Ling Han frowned in thought. If Nangong Ting could still see after his death, he definitely wouldn’t be able to close his eyes in peace. He was the Holy Son of a three-star force, yet Ling Han had even forgotten his name?

Pu!

Fu Gaoyun and the others choked and spluttered upon hearing this. Not only were they not reassured, but they even started to feel more tense and anxious.

‘You killed another Holy Son of the Lunar Sect?!’

Gasp!

Currently, the Lunar Sect only had two Holy Sons who were at the Severing Mundane Tier. One was Bei Xuanming, and the other was Nangong Ting.

“Brother Ling, was that person called Nangong Ting?” Fu Gaoyun asked with a sliver of hope that the answer would be negative.

Ling Han clapped his hands with a smile, and said, “Yes, it was him!”

‘F*ck!’

Fu Gaoyun and the others cursed in their minds. They then stared at Ling Han with a dazed expression. They didn’t know how to describe this person.

Could he be any more ferocious?

“Oh, by the way, I genuinely killed Zihe Bingyun. I wasn’t joking,” Ling Han said with a smile. His actions had been witnessed by Lin Fang and the others, so it was already impossible for him to keep it a secret anyway. Thus, he chose to confidently admit it.

He had indeed killed Zihe Bingyun. Moreover, he had done so with a clear conscience.

If they had only been shocked just then, Fu Gaoyun and the others were completely terrified now.

Who was Zihe Bingyun?

She was the successor of the Zihe Clan, a prodigy among prodigies, and a king tier among king tiers. She was a supreme elite who had severed heaven and earth!

Only Celestial King Tier forces could raise such an emperor tier prodigy. Moreover, only very few of these prodigies existed. Yet, she had actually been killed by Ling Han? C-could he cause any more trouble?

Ling Han grinned, and continued, “Oh, that’s right. I also killed Luo Changfeng as well.”

Fu Gaoyun and the others instantly collapsed to the ground.

‘Holy f*ck!’

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I’ve caused quite a lot of trouble, so there’s no need for you guys to follow me too closely. Otherwise, some people might consider you as my accomplice. Alright, till fate brings us together again.”

Fu Gaoyun gazed at Ling Han for a long time before saying, “Brother Ling, I genuinely can’t tell how far you’ll walk in the future.”

He felt like his goal of becoming the clan leader of a three-star force was already a lofty one.

After all, this was a three-star force! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, compared to Ling Han?

He had already killed the successors of two Celestial King Tier forces, and it was inevitable that he would be relentlessly hunted by the Zihe Clan and the Thundercloud Palace. Just Ling Han’s troublemaking ability alone was already enough to render him speechless and stunned.

“Gaoyun, let’s go,” Cheng Zhong said in an urgent voice. Although he was stunned by Ling Han’s actions, he didn’t want anything to do with him at all. After all, the Celestial King Tier forces wouldn’t care about how many people they targeted when they unleashed their vengeance.

He didn’t want to be caught up in their revenge.

Fu Gaoyun sighed with emotion before nodding at Ling Han and leaving the canyon.

The others also left with him. When passing Ling Han, Fu Xiaoyun couldn’t help but steal a few glances at him. Her heart fluttered slightly. Just as Bei Xuanming had said, if Ling Han had remained at the Fu Clan, it would’ve been completely possible that they might have become a couple.

However, it was a shame that this was completely impossible now. Even if she were willing, the Fu Clan definitely wouldn’t be willing. If they became involved in a Celestial King Tier force’s act of revenge, their only fate would be death and destruction.

“Abandon your unrealistic thoughts!” the Empress said coldly. Such an indecisive woman wanted to become her sister? She wasn’t worthy!

Fu Xiaoyun was feeling extremely unwilling as she glanced at the Empress, yet she was immediately rendered speechless by her stunning beauty.

The others also noticed the Empress at this moment, and they were also mesmerized by her breathtaking beauty.

The Empress waved her hand, and said, “Piss off!”

Peng, peng, peng!

They were instantly sent flying by the Empress. They didn’t even dare to support Ling Han, so how could they be worthy of becoming his friends?

Only Situ Xiaozhen was spared from this. Her reaction was much more composed, and even though she also stole a few extra glances at the Empress, she quickly came to her senses. She looked toward Ling Han, and asked, “Is your a*s truly okay?”

‘F*ck! What’s up with your thought process? You’re still hung up on this?’

“It’s as good as can be! There’s no need for you to worry!” Ling Han was completely helpless against this filth queen.

“Oh...” Situ Xiaozhen nodded in reply. However, there was disappointment on her face, and it was clear that she had hoped to hear a bloody and brutal story.

After Fu Gaoyun and the others left, Ling Han swept his cold gaze across He Shaolin and his companions. However, he decided not to kill them. Instead, he simply crippled their cultivation. This would cause them to lose all of their cultivation in a few years, at which time they would become ordinary people.

With this done, he held hands with the Empress and walked into the canyon.

In no time, news of him killing Bei Xuanming had already spread far and wide. In fact, there were even rumors of him killing Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng. However, because they hadn’t witnessed it, most people naturally chose not to believe this. In any case, was it that easy to kill the successors of Celestial King Tier forces?

The veracity of the former piece of news was confirmed, yet the veracity of the latter pieces wasn’t. However, these rumors spread through the mystery realm at an incredible rate.

Even so, no one dared to provoke Ling Han and the Empress anymore.

To say nothing else, just his act of killing Bei Xuanming was already reason enough for others not to provoke him.

Although Bei Xuanming wasn’t powerful, there had been a powerful cultivator beside him. Yet, he had still been killed by Ling Han. As such, Ling Han was not only courageous, but he was also astonishingly powerful.

Who would dare to provoke such a person?

Moreover, what if Ling Han had genuinely killed Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng? If that were true, would he be afraid to kill a few more people?

Wherever Ling Han passed, people would avoid him as if he were the plague. Even the Empress’ stunning beauty couldn’t tempt them into taking risks.

Given a choice between a stunning beauty and their life, most people would choose to keep the latter. After all, they hadn’t cultivated for hundreds of millions of years for the sake of women.

However, there were always those who believed that they were an exception. They believed that as long as they had an advantage in numbers, and as long as they launched a sneak attack, they would have a chance to defeat and kill Ling Han. At that time, they would be able to use his corpse to seek rewards from the Lunar Sect. If Ling Han had genuinely killed Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng, they would naturally have been able to obtain even richer rewards and greater fame.

Moreover, they would also be able to obtain the breathtakingly beautiful Empress as loot. This was naturally an enticing thought.

There was strength in numbers, and enough ants could bite an elephant to death. Moreover, they were all powerful cultivators who were far more powerful than ants. At the very least, they could be regarded as wolves.

A pack of wolves could kill a tiger. What did it matter that the tiger was the king of beasts?

These cultivators contacted each other, and encouraged more people to join their ranks. Surprisingly, a portion of people were indeed persuaded by their proposal.

There was a surge of undercurrents, and a great number of invisible sword projections were already entangled and clashing.
