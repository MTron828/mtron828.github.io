3245 Pig Saliva

Hu Can was dumbfounded.

However, what Ling Han took out was actually a pig, and it was even a little pink piglet at that. This?

Hu Can was instantly shocked. If not for the fact that he was still fighting, he would definitely have laughed out loud.

‘Can you be any more amusing?’

Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian were also dumbstruck. What was going on?

Could a pig be used as a weapon?

“Ha, you’re courting death!” Hu Can’s wariness was completely gone. As his sword slashed horizontally, the left hand that he had been hiding and not using all this time also struck out, launching an attack towards Ling Han.

Ling Han placed the little pink pig in front of him as a shield.

Pu, pu, pu, pu! Sword Qi slashed over, but they were all taken on by the little pink pig.

“Gu—” The little piglet immediately let out a miserable cry, as if it was being slaughtered. However, its body was unharmed.

Yi?

Hu Can couldn’t help but open his mouth wide, his eyeballs almost popping out.

If the first time he couldn’t speak was to laugh at Ling Han’s stupidity, then this time, he was truly shocked.

What kind of pig was this? How could it face his Sword Qi?

This was a top-notch Spirit Tool of Blood Transformation Tier. It was guaranteed that even a Fifth Change in Blood Transformation Tier would not dare to take it head-on. However, a little suckling pig had faced it head-on as if nothing had happened. Who could believe this?

Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian had the same expression. They looked like they had seen a ghost.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Old geezer Hu, I’ve really underestimated you. You’re already so old, yet you still want to harm a little girl. Today, this captain is going to castrate you!”

If Lian Xuerong was present, she might have emphasized, “You’re the vice-captain, the vice-captain.”

The little pink pig, on the other hand, kept crying out. Its four limbs flailed about, wanting to struggle and escape. It didn’t want to be Ling Han’s shield.

“Little piggy, for Young Master’s sake, you must hold on!” Huan Xue cheered on the little pink pig.

‘Damn it, can’t you see how cute I am?’

Previously, there had only been Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian, so he had naturally spoken without any qualms, like a cat playing with a mouse. But now that two unrelated people had suddenly appeared, he was naturally flushing because of his previous words.

He was already so old, yet he still said such shameless words. How embarrassing.

“Damn it!” He could only curse, and then launch a powerful attack, wanting to kill Ling Han as soon as possible.

“You flew into a rage out of humiliation?” Ling Han chuckled, and pulled the little pink pig to the left and right as his shield, blocking all of Hu Can’s attacks.

—-hm, this lecherous pig is really a qualified shield.

The little pink piggy was furious as it glared at Hu Can.

‘Are you f*cking blind? Every attack is aimed at me. Do you think I’m easy to bully?’

Hu Can couldn’t help but be stunned. This lecherous pig’s expression was too on point. It was like a person with a pig’s face, allowing others to see through what it wanted to say at a glance.

One had to know that this pig could even withstand attacks at the level of Fifth Change Blood Transformation Tier. It was impossible for it to be ordinary. Therefore, how terrifying would it be if it flew into a rage?

Hu Can did not dare to be careless, and felt like he was facing a formidable enemy.

As expected, the little pink piggy flew into a rage and began to spit wildly.

Hu Can wasn’t careless at all with the little pink pig. He thought that it was very likely to be a formidable opponent. If the little pink pig unleashed a strong power, he wouldn’t be surprised even if it was a terrifying Sword Qi.

However, he did not expect the pig’s attack to be spitting.

What was more abominable?

Ling Han seized the opportunity to attack, restricting his movements. Either he would be slashed by Ling Han’s sword, or his face would be covered in saliva.

Without hesitation, Hu Can chose the latter.

Instantly, his face was covered in sticky saliva.

“Hu hu!” The little pink pig was instantly overjoyed. Who told you to look down on me? Do you know how powerful I am now?

Hu Can was stupefied. Then, his head of white hair surged into the sky in fury.

He was furious. He was really furious.

What was the most important thing for a cultivator?

Of course, it was his life. And aside from life?

That would be pride.

He wanted to kill the pig, and he wanted to kill people!

“Old geezer Hu, calm down. It’s just a little pig. Don’t lower yourself to its level,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Lower himself to the same level?

‘Try getting a pig’s saliva on your face!’

Hu Can roared furiously, and pounced towards Ling Han, the longsword in his hand slashing out swiftly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Sword Qi slashed over with incomparable sharpness.

Ling Han merely used the little suckling pig as a shield, absorbing all the attacks that came his way. Furthermore, there wasn’t the slightest bit of impact, allowing him to quickly counterattack. As the broken sword swung down, his attacks were similarly incomparably fierce.

The little pink pig continued to spit. Although it was only so small, it could take anything head-on. Its saliva was also endless, as if the floodgates of a dam had been opened, flowing towards Hu Can.

Hu Can complained incessantly. With Ling Han and the broken sword, he was already not much weaker than him. Thus, it became incomparably difficult for him to dodge the pig’s “attack.”

One had to know that this pig wasn’t spitting. Instead, it was spraying. His entire vision was filled with it. It was as if ten thousand arrows had pierced through the air. If one wanted to dodge, the only way was to retreat. However, could he still continue the fight?

Moreover, this was really just saliva and didn’t have any side effects. Therefore, as a cultivator, he naturally had an instinctive disregard for harmless things and focused his attention on truly threatening attacks.

This was the outstanding quality of a cultivator. Otherwise, if his heart was distracted by something unrelated, how could he fight?

However, in this place, this kind of focused attention caused Hu Can to go crazy. This was because he had been sprayed with saliva in order to dodge Ling Han’s attack. In just a few moments, not only was his face completely wet, his hair was stuck together, and his body was also wet, as if he had just been fished out of the river.

“Ah!” Hu Can roared angrily. He was going crazy. He wanted to kill someone, but he just couldn’t do it. It made him feel extremely terrible.

Ling Han laughed loudly. He had almost suffered a loss when he himself had faced the little pink pig, so he knew what kind of feeling this was.

‘Old b@stard, old b@stard, go ahead and feel aggrieved.’

However, because he had to hold the lecherous pig with one hand, Ling Han had no way to use the Demonic Monkey Fists, so he could only use the sword. However, he had not learned any sword techniques, so he could only rely on his intuition to activate the power of the broken sword.

The Sword Qi was very impressive, but Hu Can was not simple either. It would be difficult to defeat him just like that.

The battle was in a stalemate, it looked like there was no clear winner, but Hu Can was getting more and more pressured, being continuously spat on by a pig. What kind of experience was this?

He couldn’t help but want to complain. How could such a small pig have so much saliva?

“Old b@stard, I’ll send you on your way!” Ling Han let out a long cry, and the momentum of his sword became even more urgent.
