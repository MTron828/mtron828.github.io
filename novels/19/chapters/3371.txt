Chapter 3372: Beaten to a daze

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Young Master Cat was stunned. The door opened.

‘But… where is he?’

“Which bad guy knocked on the door so loudly? Are you trying to kill us with the noise?” A childish voice came from below.

Young Master Cat looked down and saw that the person who opened the door was actually a child. She was at most two or three years old. She was wearing colorful clothes and looked like a little princess.

Even though he was from the Demon Race, he had no anger at all when faced with such a pink and chubby little cutie. He said amiably, “Little girl, go and call Ling Han out.”

“Father is cultivating and doesn’t have time to deal with you.” This was Second Baby. Among the six children, she was the smartest. Yes, the only flaw was that she could not count, to the point of being considered an idiot in counting.

■Doesn’t have time?’

Hehe, Young Master Cat sneered. Did she really think he was stupid?

You didn’t dare to come out and fight with him, but you pushed out a little girl. Do you think you can send him away with a little cutie?

Too naive.

He did not waste his breath on a little girl. Instead, he forced his way through

the door.

Second Baby sighed. This kid insisted on getting beaten up. What could she do?

She closed the door.

“Why are you closing the door?”

“Let us in too!”

“Little girl, open the door.”

The students outside called out one after another. They all wanted to see the battle between Ling Han and Young Master Cat, but the academy had its own rules. The Demon Race could break them, but they didn’t dare, and could only call out from outside the door.

Indoors, Young Master Cat was surprised to find another child standing in front of him.

Eldest Baby crossed her arms in front of her chest and said, “Are you the fool who wants to spar with Father?”

Young Master Cat couldn’t help but twitch his lips. For a moment, he didn’t know whether to nod or shake his head.

He had indeed come early to fight with Ling Han, but he was definitely not a fool.

“Ling Han, you’re a grown man, yet you don’t dare to come out. Letting a few little kids deal with me, you’re really shameless!” he shouted in a low voice.

“What? You actually dare to say that Father is shameless?” Eldest Baby was furious and instantly turned violent.

“Boss, beat him to death!”

“That’s right, beat this b*stard to death!”

Fourth Baby and Fifth Baby appeared together. Ling Han was currently in seclusion, so they couldn’t cling to him, and could only come out to join in the fun.

“Alright!” Eldest Baby rubbed her palms together and suddenly exerted strength in her legs. Peng, her figure surged as she rushed towards Young Master Cat.

So fast!

Young Master Cat felt his vision blur. Eldest Baby had already arrived in front of him. After leaping up high, she threw a punch at his face.

He did not have time to be shocked and hurriedly reached out to block.

Peng, a punch landed. A huge force attacked, causing him to take a few steps back.

Fortunately, although he was in the Extreme Bone Tier, he could maximize his battle prowess to the level of Inscription Tier, so he naturally couldn’t be injured by this punch.

Young Master Cat lowered his arms and looked at Eldest Baby, who had just landed. His fighting spirit soared.

Previously, he had only thought that Eldest Baby was just a cute baby, so it was naturally impossible for him to have any fighting spirit. However, after one strike, he realized that Eldest Baby had the battle prowess of the Extreme Bone Tier, and could completely contend with him.

When he became serious, he only had eyes for his opponent, even if she was just a cute child.

Young Master Cat took the initiative to attack. Boom! He rushed out at an astonishing speed.

His true form was a cat demon. Speed was his forte, and he instantly reached three times the speed of sound.

This was a domain that only Inscription Tier cultivators could step into, yet he had easily reached it.

Eldest Baby was caught off guard. Peng, she was instantly punched, and her small body flew out, crashing heavily into the flowers behind her.

However, in the next moment, Eldest Baby had already rushed out, her face filled with anger. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hong, black energy rolled over and wrapped around her body.

“Oh no, Boss has entered a berserk state!”

“She’s going crazy!”

Fourth Baby and Fifth Baby shouted in unison.

Young Master Cat couldn’t help but be shocked. Such a terrifying high-level energy?

‘You’re just a little kid. How can you trigger such a terrifying high-level energy?’

This was simply unreasonable!

Young Master Cat cursed in his heart, but he had to be prepared. The current Eldest Baby made him feel cold.

Peng, Eldest Baby rushed out. Her entire body was wrapped in black energy, making her body larger. She threw a punch that was as big as a sand bowl. Young Master Cat naturally could not be afraid of a little kid. He hurriedly threw a punch forward.

However, as soon as the fist came into contact with her, his expression changed, and then he was sent flying.

If Ling Han was present, he would definitely shake his head endlessly.

Don’t you know that Eldest Baby is known as a violent maniac and her specialty is strength?

How stupid are you to compete with a super strong baby?

Peng, Young Master Cat fell heavily to the ground, stunned.

What was going on? He was sent flying by a little kid?

He must be dreaming, right?

“You can’t even withstand a single blow.” Eldest Baby clapped her hands. It was settled easily. There was no challenge at all. “You still want to challenge my father with your pathetic self? Have you been kicked in the head by a donkey?” Young Master Cat’s outlook on life must have collapsed. He couldn’t accept that a cute child could be so powerful.

‘There must be some mistake.’

Perhaps he was dreaming?

He scrambled to his feet, shaking his head vehemently.

“Silly cat, you’re not dreaming.” Second Baby walked over, looking eager to try. “It’s my turn.”

Your turn for what?’

Xiu, Second Baby immediately threw a punch.

Fuck!

Young Master Cat hurriedly dodged, but Second Baby seemed to have known that he would do this. A beam of light shot out from her eyes, hitting Young Master Cat.

This just happened to be Young Master Cat’s weak point.

Young Master Cat couldn’t help but turn pale with fright. Even he didn’t realize this flaw. How did this little girl discover it?

He tried to dodge, but it was too late.

Peng, he was shot by the light beams. His entire body flew up again, and then he heavily landed on the ground.

His face was filled with confusion. He was so shocked that he was doubting his life..

He had actually lost consecutively to two children!

“Ugly cat, it’s my turn next!” Another excited voice sounded.

Young Master Cat was shocked. He hurriedly got up and looked around, but there was no one. Even when he spread out his divine sense, he still didn’t find anyone.

Who was sending him a voice transmission with their divine sense?

BANG!

Before he could finish his thought, he felt a sharp pain coming from the back of his head. He couldn’t help but fall forward and fall to the ground.

In just a minute, he had suffered three defeats.

This time, he finally fainted. There was no need to doubt life anymore.

“He really can’t take a beating,” Sixth Baby said. She was completely untouchable in her invisible state. It could be said that almost no one could defend against a sneak attack.

“Childish.” Third Baby, who had been sitting on the roof, commented disdainfully.

Eldest Baby grabbed one of Young Master Cat’s arms and dragged him away. She didn’t care at all as his clothes were torn. When she reached the wall of the courtyard, she flung him forcefully. Pa, Young Master Cat was thrown out by her.

The little girl clapped her hands and grinned.. Done!
