Chapter 2031: Fu Clan

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A weak and helpless woman was being pursued by 10 powerful brutes. Wasn’t this a typical case of kidnapping?

Although the woman didn’t appear too weak, with a fourth severance cultivation, the brutes chasing after her were all at the third severance or fourth severance as well. As such, how could she hope to defeat them?

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion in his mind. ‘As expected of the Western Celestial Realm. Even Severing Mundane Tier cultivators are so commonplace.’

Anyhow, that woman was indeed beautiful, with her skin pale like jade and her hair raven black. Her figure was also extremely shapely and alluring. As such, it wouldn’t have been surprising if she had caught the attention of some evil young master, who had then commanded his underlings to kidnap her.

The woman continued to scream as she ran, yet the louder she screamed, the quicker the people in the surroundings tried to avoid her. They appeared extremely afraid to be caught up in her trouble.

.

After everyone retreated to the sides of the streets, Ling Han and his companions stuck out like a sore thumb.

A hint of panic spread across the woman’s face. She didn’t know the intention of Ling Han and the others. Were they going to help her, or were they going to assist her kidnappers?

She was running extremely quickly, and she sped past Ling Han and the others in a flash. Her expression immediately relaxed, and she continued to speed away into the distance.

When the dozen or so brutes approached, a faint smile spread across Ling Han’s face. He activated his Regulation of Slaughter.

Weng!

A terrifying aura exploded outward, causing the color to drain from the brutes’ faces. They collapsed to the ground with several loud thuds. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Was it possible for Severing Mundane Tier cultivators to fall over for no reason?

Naturally not. Moreover, it was a dozen or so of them falling over in unison!

It was extremely evident that this was the doing of Ling Han and the others. Otherwise, why would they be standing in the middle of the road?

“Heavens! They actually dare to interfere with Young Master Fu’s affairs! They’re definitely going to suffer great misfortune.”

“Seriously… Don’t they know that the Fu Clan is a powerful clan of United Link City?”

“By the looks of it, they’re all newcomers.”

“Mm-hm, that’s definitely the case.”

The passers-by murmured among themselves, and they were all discussing this in a hushed tone. It was as if they were afraid of being overheard.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. No wonder these dogs were all at the Severing Mundane Tier. If it weren’t a powerful clan, how could they deploy so many powerful cultivators?

However, he naturally wouldn’t worry about this. To say nothing of the impressive battle prowess of himself and the others, wasn’t there Xiao Gu to protect them even if they truly provoked a powerful elite?

“Let’s go, let’s go, Niu wants to eat meat!” Hu Niu said in displeasure. She patted her stomach as she spoke.

“Let’s go, let’s go, Niu wants to eat meat!” Xiao Gu repeated. He also started to pat his stomach.

Ling Han could feel the beginning of a headache. Just Hu Niu alone was already enough trouble. Now, there was going to be another troublemaker?

In any case, he naturally couldn’t turn down Hu Niu’s request. Thus, they started to look for a place to eat. They chitchatted as they walked, and it was almost as if they had already forgotten about the small commotion just then.

The passers-by exchanged surprised glances with each other.

“These people are far too confident!”

“Indeed! They interfered with the Fu Clan’s matters, yet they still dare to act so calm and composed?”

“Perhaps they came prepared?”

“Tsk, haven’t you heard of the saying? Even a powerful dragon can’t defeat a snake in its?nest1.”

“Don’t they know that the grand elder of the Fu Clan is the chief alchemist of the Moon Plucking Celestial King?”

“Heh… In any case, they’re definitely seeking death.”

Ling Han and the others didn’t hear these remarks. This was because they had already found a restaurant, and started to chomp down on food.

“Mmmm, delicious, delicious!” Hu Niu had a drumstick in one hand and braised pork in another. Her mouth was also stuffed with food, yet she could still somehow manage to speak clearly. This was truly impressive.

Xiao Gu tried to emulate her, yet his words came out completely scrambled. He couldn’t speak clearly at all.

It was clear that gluttons also needed talent.

Ling Han, the Empress, and the others ordered some wine to drink. There were many aspects where the Western Celestial Realm was different from the Eastern Celestial Realm, and this also included the food culture. Thus, they all wanted to try some wine.

“You people seem to be in quite a good mood,” someone said with a leisurely laugh. Ling Han and the others looked over, only to see someone at the door. However, because the light was coming from behind him, a long shadow was cast onto the floor. This also made him appear slightly more dignified.

This was a smart-looking young man. He was wearing an azure robe, and his eyebrows were slightly raised, making him appear quite flamboyant.

“Young Master Fu!” The customers in the restaurant immediately stood up and greeted him. Their voices were all filled with respect.

The Fu Clan was a formidable force in United Link City. This person was called Fu Yue, and he was the only third-generation member of the Fu Clan. Thus, one could imagine just how lofty his status was.

This was inevitable. The past three generations of the Fu Clan all consisted of only a single person.

Fu Yue wore a faint smile as he strode into the restaurant. He arrived beside Ling Han’s table, and there was a skinny old man following behind him. This old man appeared tired and listless, and his eyes were shut the entire time.

However, whenever he opened them, one could see the countless intertwining symbols on his eyeballs. His domineering aura would flash into the surroundings for a split second.

‘Immortal Palace Tier?’ Ling Han speculated in his mind.

This old man’s power was profound and hard to fathom. He was so powerful that even Ling Han couldn’t determine his power. Thus, he was at least at the Immortal Palace Tier.

However, could he be an Ascending Origin Tier elite? Ling Han truly didn’t believe this.

Would such an elite become the subordinate of a young man?

After all, the Fu Clan wasn’t a Celestial King Tier force.

“You don’t mind me sitting over here, do you?” Fu Yue asked with a smile. However, he had already taken a seat before Ling Han and the others could even reply.

‘Why the f*ck did you ask?’

“You don’t mind me sitting over here, do you?” Xiao Gu repeated. He was filled with excitement upon seeing this new “toy”.

A look of displeasure instantly spread across Fu Yue’s face. What was the meaning of this? Was this person mocking him? He humphed, and said, “Friend, don’t think I don’t know that it was you who attacked my useless subordinates.”

“Friend, don’t think I don’t know…” Xiao Gu repeated without missing a word. Moreover, his skills had clearly improved, and he could even emulate one’s tone and expression now.

Fu Yue truly became angry at this moment. These people were taking things too far!

Meanwhile, Ling Han was slightly astonished. Wasn’t the Fu Clan a formidable force? How did this Young Master Fu have so much spare time? He had failed to kidnap a woman, so he was personally coming over now?

Was he truly that given to lust?

However, this didn’t seem right. Whether or not one was given to lust, this could be easily determined through their actions. Right now, Hu Niu, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou were all sitting at the table. They were three breathtaking beauties. However, Fu Yue could still remain undistracted. Indeed, he might steal a few glances here and there, but this was a completely normal reaction.

Bam!

Fu Yue slammed his hand on the table. His patience certainly wasn’t great. However, this was understandable. As a respected youth, who wouldn’t be afraid of him and yield to him?

Moreover, he didn’t know about Xiao Gu’s habit of parroting others, so he thought that Xiao Gu was purposefully mocking him. As such, he naturally couldn’t control his temper.

“Heh, don’t mind him. He simply likes to copy others,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Heh, don’t mind him…” Xiao Gu repeated. He still liked to copy Ling Han the most. After all, this was the first person that he had met. Indeed, even his appearance was copying Ling Han’s.

Upon seeing this, Fu Yue’s anger finally subsided a little. This person seemed to have some mental issues.

‘Strange. One of the brothers is handsome and confident, yet the other one is stupid and slow. Was he beaten stupid in his mother’s stomach?’

“I’ll also cut to the chase. Where’s that woman?” Fu Yue asked.
