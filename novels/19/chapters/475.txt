Chapter 476: Blood-Sucking Bugs

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

After a few minutes, Yue Kai Yue and Guang Yuan also arrived by his side. Their speed wasn’t fast, as there were already four teams that had entered the divine temple from three different entrances.

Ling Han started walking towards the passageway.

Yue Kai Yu and the others hurriedly followed. They unconsciously took Ling Han as their core, listening to his plans.

They entered the divine temple. It was pitch-dark inside, but with the eyesight of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, they could still see in a radius of more than three meters. Ling Han could see up to ten times that because he cultivated the Eye of Truth, having eyesight that surpassed martial artists of the same tier. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Inside the divine temple was emptiness, without a single pillar. It could be imagined how vast the space was. This layer was a meter in height, and the top was grayish black walls, giving people the feeling of inhibition.

It was very quiet here. The echo of the sound of footsteps kept resonating within this vast space.

It was too empty, there was nothing at all.

They continued onwards. Even if there wasn’t anything in this layer, there was still the second and the third layer. And calculating based on the height of the divine temple, there should be at least several hundred layers!

Because it was too empty in here, they had no delays on their way, very soon arriving at the core area of this layer, where they found a staircase that led to the second layer. They obviously weren’t the first to arrive—the four groups that entered earlier had all arrived, but didn’t tread on.

There reason being the six corpses that lay at near the stairway.

It was the same people who had been engulfed by the lake water!

All dead, and their Hippocratic face was extremely terrifying as if moisture in their bodies had been drained dry, turning them into dried corpses. Ling Han and the others could recognize that these were the people who entered earlier because the of the clothes they wore, as for the faces... a dried-up corpse’s face was quite hard to recognize.

With the emptiness here, if a fierce battle broke out, the sound should have reached the doors, but the six people died without a sound, without even a single cry in fear; what did this explain?

The six people were almost simultaneously killed, so none of them let out a scream, nor was there any trace of a battle.

The killer’s strength should be quite strong!

Precisely based on this awareness, the people here came to a halt. Although everyone knew that risks accompanied opportunities, no one wanted to lose their life for no reason; they had to be cautious, cautious, and even more cautious.

Ling Han observed; it was too empty here, nothing could be hidden, and he could see clearly that there really was nothing. The stairway was immaculate, without any foreign matter anywhere.

Where could the killer be hiding?

Almost at the same time, everyone’s gaze turned towards the end of the stairway, the second layer of the divine temple.

If the killer hid at the entrance of the second layer, taking advantage of when the six people climbed the steps to suddenly kill them, and then threw the six corpses down... was there such a possibility?

“What, there’s one person missing!” someone suddenly said. “Although I don’t remember the total amount of people swept in, but I recognized one of them, and his corpse is definitely not amongst them!”

In other words, that person escaped?

The first layer couldn’t hide people at all, so if that person escaped, that person could only have entered the second layer.

So they thought, but no one acted blindly without thinking; what if the killer still lay in ambush at the entrance of the second layer, preparing to carry out a lightning-fast attack? When one was in the open, and the enemy was in the dark... this was too dangerous.

Ling Han, however, wasted no time, taking large strides forward. He had absolute confidence.

“As expected of Master Ling, such great courage!” everyone complimented. Obviously not many were sincere, only wanting Ling Han to take the lead.

Ling Han obviously wouldn’t care. He was too curious as to what exactly was hidden within this temple that seemed to be from the god realm. Why was It buried beneath the lakebed?

He walked to the side of the stairs—everything was normal. He took a step onto the stairway, and everything was still normal.

The danger came from the entrance to the second layer.

At this moment, almost everyone formed the same consensus, while Li Si Chan, Guang Yuan, and Yue Kai Yu were especially nervous, clenching their fists tightly and staring with wide eyes.

With another step, Ling Han’s head was about to cross into the second layer.

Ling Han temporarily halted, raising his head to look at the top. The end of the stairway was a blurry spinning ring of light, and seen from here, nothing could be seen clearly.

It seemed that the situation in the second layer couldn’t be seen unless one entered.

“Master Han!” Li Si Chan and Guang Yuan yelled out nervously.

Ling Han nodded and took fierce step down, instantly shooting like an arrow and worming extremely quickly into the spinning light ring.

Xiu , his figure flashed, and he already appeared in another space.

The environment here was oddly dusky, but compared ot the first layer’s dark space, it was much brighter, at least the eyesight of normal Spiritual Pedestal Tier warriors could reach around 300 m. A barren field underneath his feet, and the nearby one-thousand-meter radius of land was completely dark-red, as if molded by the coagulation of fresh blood.

Hiss, to dye such a large field of land black, how much blood was needed?

Besides, this place was really massive!

Ling Han looked far; the skies here exceeded 300 m in height, already exceeding the divine temple’s height.

This was another small world, its space compressed by a powerful being using mystical arts, forming a world of its own.

Before his thought finished, he heard weng, weng, weng sounds as infinite black dots rose from the ground, suddenly swarming towards him. With his impressive eyesight, he saw clearly with a glance that these were small flying bugs; they were shaped like mosquitos, and their mouthparts were sharp and long. As they fluttered their wings, weng, weng sounds were emitted.

As it turned out it wasn’t that the ground was dyed black with blood but squeezed full of these bugs! Once they flew, the ground became an earthy yellow, no different from the land outside.

Ling Han instantly realized that the six people earlier had their blood sucked dry by these bugs.

The killers were found.

The unknown was the most frightening. Since he knew the killer’s true identity, Ling Han felt calmer instead. Hong , he activated Strange Fire, and instantly, a field of flames swept out. Zi, zi, zi, these bugs let out sharp cries, burning to ashes in their hundreds and thousands and falling down.

However, more bugs still swarmed over, completely unafraid of death, even using their companions as cover. They pierced through the flames and swarmed right before Ling Han.

“Let’s see how good your teeth are.” Ling Han smiled lightly. As long as it weren’t teeth such as Hu NIu’s, he still had the confidence that within the same tier nothing could harm his Iron Sheet Body.

As expected, these bugs stung his skin to suck blood, but snapped their mouthparts instead, unable to drill through at all.

However, Ling Han also felt a slight sense of pain. Apparently, the stinging of these mouthparts somewhat affected him.

This was quite surprising as his physique was completely no weaker than rare metals of the same tier but he still felt a slight sense of pain, meaning that the destructive power of these bugs was still quite surprising.

No wonder the six people earlier died at the entrance. The moment they entered the second layer, they probably immediately suffered the attacks of the blood-sucking bugs, and without the defensive power such as Ling Han’s to bear their attacks head-on, they thought of escaping to the first layer; however they were too late, and by the time they rushed out, they’d already been sucked dry of their blood.
