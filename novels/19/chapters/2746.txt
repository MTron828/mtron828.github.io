2747 You’re a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!

In the outside world, An Tayun and Yang Zhihe were both astounded.

Ling Feifan was actually this powerful?

“Using Body Arts to suppress one’s opponent is the battle technique of Heavenly Venerates.”

“Don’t tell me that this brat has already interacted with the unique power of heaven and earth and used it to temper his body?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The two Heavenly Venerates exchanged a confused look.

A First Heaven Celestial King being able to interact with the unique power of the realm? This was simply unfathomable, regardless of how prodigious one was. However, apart from this, was there any other explanation?

An Tayun couldn’t help but waver. Yang Xuanlong only possessed the ability to potentially become a Heavenly Venerate, yet if Ling Feifan had truly interacted with the unique power of heaven and earth, he was destined to eventually become a Heavenly Venerate.

In fact, he didn’t really care which dimension Ling Feifan was from. After all, a mighty Heavenly Venerate naturally possessed an equally broad mind. What he cared about more were potential and natural disposition.

Even An Xiu’er was surprised. In the eyes of a girl in love, their lover would naturally be all-capable. However, she was also a Celestial King, and she was more so the daughter of a Heavenly Venerate. Thus, her observation skills were naturally extraordinary.

In the past, Ling Feifan definitely hadn’t been so powerful.

‘What’s going on?’

Meanwhile, Ling Han was slightly unsatisfied. In fact, Ling Feifan’s abilities included far more than just this. However, his physique was inferior, so it prevented him from unleashing any more power. Otherwise, his own body would collapse first.

‘How should I teach the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to my grandson?’

Ling Han mulled over this problem. He could borrow the Black Tower, and use it to forcefully teach his grandson, just like how he had learned it. Otherwise, he could modify the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and structure it like the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. That way, it could be learned one scroll at a time before ultimately being combined together.

However, borrowing the Black Tower at this moment would be impossible. Thus, Ling Han felt like the latter option was the more reliable one.

He immediately started to ponder this problem, thinking about how he could deconstruct the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Meanwhile, inside the Heavenly Venerate Tool, Yang Xuanlong started to launch his counterattack.

He charged at Ling Feifan, unleashing the radiant flames from his palm as he did so, with the flames transforming into two white snakes that lunged at Ling Feifan.

Ling Feifan roared with laughter, unafraid as he faced this attack head-on.

‘You’re seeking death!’ Yang Xuanlong said in his mind. After channeling this Heavenly Venerate Technique, his battle prowess could rival that of Third Heaven Celestial Kings—this certainly wasn’t something that newbie Celestial Kings could rival.

‘Die! Hurry up and die!’

Weng!

When the flaming white snakes crashed into Ling Feifan, a golden bell immediately materialized around him, with numerous golden symbols pulsating on its surface. The golden bell successfully stopped the white snakes in their tracks, preventing them from advancing another inch.

Yang Xuanlong’s jaw involuntarily fell to the ground. How was this possible?

He had never believed that Ling Feifan could also possess a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and the reason for this was simple. It would be useless even if Ling Feifan had the aid of a Heavenly Venerate, as the bare minimum requirement for channeling a Heavenly Venerate Technique was reaching the Ninth Heaven.

For example, even he could only channel a Heavenly Venerate Technique for 15 minutes at most. Even so, he would still end up wounded and completely exhausted.

Now, however, Ling Feifan had actually blocked his Heavenly Venerate Technique? There was only one explanation: he had also mastered a Heavenly Venerate Technique!

How… was this possible?!

His eyes bulged in disbelief. He had initially thought that he could crush his opponent with ease, yet it seemed like he was the one who was about to be slain in the end.

“Hahaha! Little loach, what else do you have to say?” Ling Feifan chuckled as he hurriedly seized this opportunity to attack. This defensive ability didn’t belong to him, so he had no way of retracting it after it had been activated. Moreover, it would only last for 15 minutes.

If Yang Xuanlong avoided him now, and unleashed his vicious Heavenly Venerate Technique after waiting for his extreme defensive ability to vanish, he would definitely be screwed.

Thus, he had to dispose of his opponent as quickly as possible.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

He unleashed his fists of fury, relentless and overwhelming as he attempted to submit his opponent.

Yang Xuanlong was shocked time and time again, and his morale had already fallen into a ditch. Thus, what more power and confidence did he have to defend? After blocking a few strikes, his face was quickly pummeled black and blue.

Fortunately, Ling Feifan didn’t attempt to unleash any fatal strikes. He simply rendered Yang Xuanlong severely wounded and unable to battle.

An Tayun shook them out in a timely manner, and said, “Enough, we’ll end it here.”

“Feifan!” An Xiu’er called as she ran over, delight and joy on her face. She hadn’t imagined that the issue would be resolved so smoothly.

“Heh, I already told you, didn’t I? I’ll shatter all obstacles and make you my wife,” Ling Feifan said, starting to blow his own trumpet again.

“Hmph! You people are cheating!” Yang Zhihe said coldly. The golden bell was still pulsating around Ling Feifan, making it as clear as could be.

He resolutely lashed out, grabbing at Ling Feifan, and announcing, “Cheaters deserve death!”

He was going to kill Ling Feifan. That way, his son wouldn’t have any other opponent.

“Brother Yang, please show some mercy!” An Tayun said, hurriedly stepping forward to obstruct him. He had also noticed that Ling Feifan’s defensive ability was abnormal, with the golden bell capable of being summoned but not unsummoned. Rather than one’s own ability, this appeared more like the ability of some treasure.

However, he didn’t mind this, as Ling Feifan had already displayed his freakish abilities. As a First Heaven Celestial King, his body had already been tempered by the unique power of the dimension—in other words, he was destined to become a Heavenly Venerate in the future.

If he passed on such a son-in-law, where would he find another one?

Thus, he decided to protect Ling Feifan.

Peng!

The two Heavenly Venerate exchanged a blow, unleashing a shock wave that instantly reduced the An Clan residence to ruins.

“Brother An, I didn’t do that on purpose,” Yang Zhihe said upon seeing this, hurriedly retracting his hand. Destroying someone else’s residence could be regarded as a small matter or big matter, depending on the owner.

An Tayun’s expression was extremely dark. His clan residence had been destroyed two times in three days. Just who in the world had he offended?

Ling Han stepped forward, and said, “You want to kill my grandson?”

“To cheat in a fair battle, and to harbor such impure intentions, what does it matter even if I do kill him?” Yang Zhihe replied proudly. He naturally didn’t need to show Ling Han any respect. After all, Ling Han was an opponent, and he more so didn’t think that Ling Han was very powerful.

“No one can touch my family. Since you want to kill my grandson, I’ll send you on your way first!” Ling Han replied coldly, a baleful look in his eyes.

“A battle in the sky!” Yang Zhihe said. With a single stride, he directly flew into the sky.

He didn’t dare to battle on the ground. Otherwise, if he turned the surroundings into a vast sea, An Tayun would very likely truly become wild with rage.

Ling Han naturally wasn’t afraid of him. With a slight bend of his knees followed by an explosive release, he also shot into the sky, his speed even exceeding Yang Zhihe’s. Thus, he caught up to Yang Zhihe before the former could even reach the desired height.

Boom!

He immediately unleashed a furious punch.

Yang Zhihe was both enraged and astonished. This person didn’t respect any f*cking customs! Was he truly so giddy to attack? However, Ling Han’s strike was both quick and vicious, so he had no option but to respond.

Peng!

He exchanged a blow with Ling Han, the deafening explosions of their clash causing the space around them to shatter into pieces. At the same time, they were both sent flying back.

Boom!

Heaven and earth responded, with arcs of lightning striking down at Yang Zhihe. However, they completely ignored Ling Han.

Yang Zhihe didn’t understand this. His opponent had clearly wielded the power of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so why wasn’t he being targeted by heaven and earth? Of course, this was even though these strikes were inconsequential to Heavenly Venerates.

He carefully mulled over this, and his expression quickly transformed into one of deep shock. “You didn’t unleash Heavenly Venerable Tier power!”

What powers were Heavenly Venerates most renowned for?

This was naturally the six fundamental powers of the Genesis World or the unique power of the dimensions. However, he hadn’t detected any of these powers in Ling Han’s punch just then.

“You’re a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” he exclaimed again. However, his frown grew even deeper.
