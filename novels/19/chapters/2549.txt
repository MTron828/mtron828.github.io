Chapter 2550: Drastic Change

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Ninth Region was a chaotic space. With a single stride, one might easily travel dozens of kilometers into the distance. With another stride, they might easily return to their original position again.

If they were powerful enough, they could directly shatter this formation. Indeed, when one’s strength reached a certain level, one could completely ignore rules and regulations. Elites could act as they pleased.

Now, however, they were weaker than Celestial King He Feng had been. Thus, they could only abide by the rules that Celestial King He Feng had set at that time.

They continued to experiment. With the help of Wally’s analytical abilities, they finally managed to reach the end of the Ninth Region after spending more than a month.

The stone tablet was already within reach.

“Let’s begin!” He Runhai exclaimed, excitement in his voice.

If they managed to activate this formation eye, they would be able to open the gates to the treasure chamber, in which lay everything that he desired.

However, everyone wore a solemn expression. After reaching this place, if there was someone among them who harbored sinister intentions, it would almost be time for them to reveal themselves.

Even so, they had already come so far, so they naturally wouldn’t retreat. They all cut open their fingers and smeared their blood onto the formation eye.

Boom!

A ninth column of light soared into the sky.

The nine columns of light then fused together, transforming into an even thicker column of light that pierced through the heavens.

Gazing up, one could see the rotating column of light in the clouds. The sky was overcast, and it was as if some terrifying monster were about to soar down.

Clank, clank, clank…

There was the sound of clanging chains, and it was as if some mechanism had been triggered.

“Huh?!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They looked to the left, only to see a length of metal chain dancing in the sky, intertwining to form a gigantic tree.

Whoosh!

A length of chain swept toward them, as agile as a snake.

As if anticipating this, He Runhai immediately flicked his hand, tossing forth one of the Celestial Kings. The metal chain pierced through the body of this Celestial King before tightly wrapping around him.

“Aaah…!!!” The agonizing pain instantly forced the Celestial King awake. He howled in pain, and blood continued to spurt from his mouth. However, his body shriveled rapidly, and it was as if he had instantly lost all of his blood.

Ling Han and the others were deeply astounded. However, they also felt as if this were expected.

They had always had a nagging feeling that He Runhai was scheming something else. As a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, how could he possibly be so amiable?

At this moment, he finally revealed his true face.

Clang!

The metal chain soared upward with the Celestial King. At the same time, another eight lengths of metal chain rose from different locations, each carrying a corpse. Liu Hao, Luo Yangqiu, Xu Huan, and Ji Zhihang were among these corpses.

These were the people who had stayed behind to guard the stone tablets in each of the previous eight regions!

“He Runhai, what’s the meaning of this?!” the Imperial Void Celestial King asked in a baleful voice. Even though he had reached some sort of agreement with Xiao Yingxiong and the others, he wouldn’t go as far as to be concerned about their life or death, but this threatened his personal interests, so he naturally stepped forward to protest.

However, He Runhai stood with his hands clasped behind his back, replying in an indifferent voice, “Without sacrifice, how can one reap any rewards? Do none of you understand such a simple concept?”

“You dare to target members of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy? How audacious!” Gu Heyi roared in anger. This was in stark contrast to his usually amiable temperament.

He Runhai smiled faintly, and replied, “Without their sacrifice, the United Origin Manifestation Fruit can’t reach maturity. Tell me, which is more important? Have you made up your minds?”

He paused for a moment before continuing, “If you don’t want this paramount fruit, you’re free to leave right now. I definitely won’t stop you. However, by the time you report this to the higher-ups of the martial academy, I would’ve already changed my identity and vanished into the sea of people.

“Or perhaps, you want to harvest this fruit with me?”

The large black dog roared with laughter. “To scheme with tigers, the only possible fate is death! He Runhai, I advise you to obediently surrender.”

“Not so fast!” the Imperial Void Celestial King said, raising a hand to block the large black dog.

“Imperial Void, what are you playing at? Don’t tell me you’re actually going to cooperate with him?” the large black dog said as he focused his gaze on the Imperial Void Celestial King. His body was tense as he said this.

If the two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings joined hands, they would have no option but to flee.

“Heh, sure enough, Brother Imperial Void is also a resolute person!” He Runhai said with a chuckle. “As cultivators, our only goal is to shatter the pinnacle of cultivation. In order to achieve this goal, we’re even willing to sacrifice our own sons! Let alone other people!”

Upon hearing this, a cold chill ran down everyone’s spine. His son was truly unfortunate.

This was a ruthless and ambitious person. In order to achieve his goals, he was willing to do anything.

Even though the Imperial Void Celestial King didn’t necessarily hold the same beliefs, he had absolutely zero care for Liu Hao and the others. Thus, he couldn’t be bothered arguing against this point.

He simply wanted the United Origin Manifestation Fruit.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yingxiong and the others all wore solemn expressions. The decision of the Imperial Void Celestial King put them in an extremely difficult spot.

If they refused to join, it was very likely that they would be silenced and killed by the Imperial Void Celestial King. However, even if they joined, they would have crossed the bottom line of the martial academy. Could the Imperial Void Celestial King let them off lightly?

Whoosh!

Liu Yufei suddenly dashed forward, entering the central region of the large formation.

This place had initially been solid ground. However, following the appearance of the large tree of chains, the central region also underwent a huge transformation. It was now possible to dash over without any obstructions.

“United Origin Manifestation Fruit!” everyone exclaimed. Liu Yufei was definitely aiming for this celestial fruit.

They definitely couldn’t allow her to succeed.

They hurriedly gave pursuit. Even though Liu Yufei had said before that there was more than one United Origin Manifestation Fruit, could they truly believe anything from the mouths of this pair of master and disciple? The fate of Liu Hao and the others was a stark warning.

Even the Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t suppress his urge. He immediately gave chase as well.

He Runhai looked at Ling Han and the others, and asked, “Why aren’t you giving chase?”

Ling Han, the Empress, Wally, and the large black dog all remained put.

The large black dog cracked a grin, revealing his sharp canine teeth. “You’re not giving chase, either, so why should we feel any sense of urgency?”

He Runhai roared with laughter. “You think you’re being very smart, huh?”

“He Runhai, what are you playing at?” Ling Han asked loudly.

“As a measly Third Heaven Celestial King, you actually dare to act so haughtily before me?” In sharp contrast to his previously modest temperament, He Runhai suddenly became arrogant and prideful. “The others have already rushed toward their deaths. Even though you people are slightly smarter, this can only delay your inevitable death by a little while.”

Sure enough, he started to reveal his sinister intentions. He couldn’t contain himself any longer.

“Old geezer, before Grandpa Dog, can you truly flip the heavens?” The large black dog charged forward, aiming to capture He Runhai.

He Runhai didn’t dodge or evade. Instead, he simply watched the attack sweep over. However, when the large black dog’s paw swung over, his body shuddered slightly, gradually becoming transparent. In the end, it vanished completely, only leaving behind loud and wanton laughter.

The expressions of Ling Han, the Empress, and the large black dog changed drastically. He Runhai had already slipped away at some unknown time. What had stood before them was merely a fragment of his divine sense.

It was no wonder that he was completely unafraid of the large black dog. This was because his true body was nowhere near them to begin with.

“When did he slip away?” Ling Han asked with a frown.

“Wally, did you notice this?” the large black dog asked.

Wally shook his head. He also appeared extremely astonished. “Firstly, I didn’t keep my eye on him the entire time. Secondly, I didn’t observe any unusual energy fluctuations.”

“Then… should we advance or retreat?”
