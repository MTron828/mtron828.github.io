Chapter 2555: Resolution

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han could barely believe his ears. There was actually someone who was willing to become a Hysteria-like existence?

What was so attractive about this?

What would it matter even if he conquered a dimension for himself? With only himself left, what would it matter even if he was the strongest in history? There would be no one before him, and no one behind him.

Who could endure such loneliness?

Yet, He Feng was actively trying to achieve this? If this wasn’t madness, then what was?

As if reading Ling Han’s thoughts, He Feng smiled faintly, and said, “I certainly haven’t gone mad. This is merely because you don’t understand Hysteria’s true power. It’s impossible to destroy Hysteria. Only by becoming a dimension can one hope to rival Hysteria.”

“Then should I praise you, Senior? Should I praise your grand sacrifice to rival Hysteria?” Ling Han asked. He knew that this might enrage He Feng, but he still said it anyway. Otherwise, he would feel far too p*ssed off.

When facing a Heavenly Venerate, even Ling Han’s trump card had lost its use. The Dimension Scroll could summon heavenly tribulation, yet this naturally couldn’t frighten a Heavenly Venerate.

He Feng smiled indifferently. “I’m not so noble. However, when I become powerful enough, I’ll definitely rise from the low-level dimensions, eventually coming across Hysteria.

“I’m a human after all, so I simply dream of becoming the strongest. However, I have no intentions of engulfing the entire Genesis World.

“Thus, I’m your greatest hope.”

His words rang with reason. This was because the Genesis World was ordered from the weakest to the most powerful. If a dimension became more powerful than the one in front of it, it would naturally rise up. Thus, when He Feng became powerful enough, he would eventually surpass the Flaming Frost Realm and encounter Hysteria.

However, Ling Han wasn’t so optimistic.

Why had Hysteria caused such a huge commotion?

This was because it was unfathomably powerful to begin with. Through engulfing all matter, it had already reached the Sixth Tier or perhaps even the Seventh Tier. It had then engulfed its own dimension, replacing it with itself.

However, He Feng wasn’t so powerful. In fact, even he himself had admitted that he couldn’t possibly become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. Thus, even if he went to the lowest-level dimension in the Celestial Realm, would he have the right to engulf it?

Utterly impossible!

Regardless of how weak a dimension was, it would still possess fundamental power. It was simply a matter of how much fundamental power it possessed. Thus, no matter what, a dimension could at least be considered as a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, no?

That being the case, could a First Tier Heavenly Venerate engulf an entire dimension? Ling Han was skeptical.

Otherwise, the three Heavenly Venerates in the Celestial Realm would have acted long ago. After obliterating the Celestial Realm, they could then interact with the fundamental power in the core of the dimension. Using this, could they not achieve their dream of advancing to the Second Tier?

However, the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate and the others had failed. Thus, why would He Feng be any exception?

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t reveal this. After all, He Feng had already fixed his mind on this. If he suddenly realized that he had wasted several epochs on a futile plan, who knew what he would do in a fit of frustration and anger?

“Old ancestor, please forgive me this one time!” He Runhai suddenly fell to his knees and begged.

This was firstly to save his skin, and secondly for the United Origin Manifestation Fruit. At this moment, he finally believed He Feng’s words. His ancestor had indeed been looking out for his descendants.

He Feng wore a baleful expression as he looked at He Runhai. Killing intent flashed across his eyes. Why had he purposefully concealed the truth? Was it not to examine his descendants? Now, it was clear that He Runhai was a paranoid and distrustful person.

This kind of person would definitely seek revenge for any perceived offense.

“Unworthy descendant, what’s the point of letting you live?” He Feng said with a harrumph. He resolutely lashed out, swinging his palm at He Runhai.

He Runhai didn’t dare to face this palm at all. He hurriedly turned around to flee.

However, how could a measly Celestial King escape from the attack of a Heavenly Venerate?

Pa!

He Runhai was comprehensively obliterated by the strike. Like a mere fly, he appeared oh so insignificant and weak.

Blood rain instantly fell from the sky, signifying the grief of heaven and earth.

Crack!

An arc of lightning descended, crashing toward He Feng.

The Flaming Frost Realm was an extremely high-level dimension, so even Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t be targeted by heaven and earth. However, this was about it. He Feng had launched an attack just then, and he had more so killed a Celestial King.

Celestial Kings represented the Regulations, so in some sense, they were also the messengers of heaven and earth. Thus, this naturally triggered the fury of heaven and earth, causing it to attack him.

He Feng casually made a grabbing motion with his hand.

Pa!

The arc of lightning was instantly shattered. As long as its power was limited to the level of Regulations, it would be completely unable to threaten Heavenly Venerates.

He Runhai had acted with smugness and haughtiness for half a day, yet he had now died just like that.

However, no one dared to relax. He Feng was merciless enough to kill his own descendant, and he had also revealed his biggest secret to them. Thus, would he allow them to leave?

“No need to be so tense. If I had wanted to kill you all, I would have acted long ago,” He Feng said with a smile. He swept his gaze across their faces, continuing, “I initially planned to collect your blood essence to nurture the United Origin Manifestation Fruit so that I could help my descendant. However, who told my descendant to be so unworthy?”

He felt slightly disheartened. However, he immediately smiled, and said, “I’m not one to ignore the bigger picture. Even though this United Origin Manifestation Fruit hasn’t reached its pinnacle state yet, it’s still surpassed all other Celestial King Tier Great Herbs. Moreover, there’s no requirement for one to be at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven to ingest it.

“Here, a gift for you all.”

He raised a hand and placed it on the metal tree, causing it to produce flowers and fruit at an astonishing speed.

This was extremely strange. This was a tree formed from metal chains, yet it was actually blooming real flowers and producing a real fruit. This fruit was only as large as a human head. It was purple-black in appearance, and there was also a clear unevenness about its surface.

He Feng waved his hand, and the fruit automatically split apart, flying toward Ling Han, the Empress, Xiao Yingxiong, and the others. Each person received a piece. However, the large black dog and the Imperial Void Celestial King didn’t receive anything.

“You’re both at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven, and you both possess the talent to ascend to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Thus, this incomplete United Origin Manifestation Fruit is completely useless to you,” he explained.

The large black dog smacked his lips in displeasure. It didn’t matter that this fruit was ineffective. He wouldn’t mind tasting one just for the sake of it.

Meanwhile, everyone else was astonished. He Feng was actually so generous? In fact, he was so generous that they didn’t dare to believe it.

He Feng waved a hand before leaping up. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Whoosh!

He directly tore open the void, instantly vanishing without a trace.

Weng!

The surrounding space shuddered, and a black figure suddenly materialized.

Everyone was astonished again. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were unable to directly tear open space to leave this place, yet two people had now done it, one after another.

This was another Heavenly Venerate.

F*ck! Was there an abundance of Heavenly Venerates now?

Pu!

However, upon seeing the dark figure clearly, they almost burst into laughter. This was because a donkey stood before them, with its hair pitch black and smooth.

This was a… Heavenly Venerable Tier donkey?

“Brats, you’re not going to return?” the black donkey said. Its voice was filled with a paramount might.

“S-Senior!” Ling Han and the others said. However, they all felt extremely strange saying this. As they looked at the black donkey, they couldn’t help but glance at the large black dog. They had a nagging misconception that the two of them were similar in disposition.

“Dare I ask, Senior, did He Feng only act as such because he noticed your existence?” Ling Han asked. Otherwise, he refused to believe that He Feng was such a generous and forgiving person.

The black donkey chuckled, and replied, “Of course! Otherwise, why else do you think he left the fruit to you brats? He did this on purpose to express goodwill to me. Otherwise, if I occupied him and waited for other Heavenly Venerates to arrive, could he have escaped?”

Everyone came to a realization upon hearing this. Sure enough, He Feng wasn’t a genuinely generous and magnanimous person. Instead, he had only been thinking about himself.
