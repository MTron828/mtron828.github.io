Chapter 2008: Heading to the Western Celestial Realm

“Ling Han, you are so awesome!” Hu Niu was the first to leap over, and climb onto Ling Han’s back, waving her tiny hands continuously.

The Empress also leaned into his embrace, her expression rippling.

From the moment Ji Wuming appeared, he was like a great mountain that could not be surpassed. Even super monarch tiers like them could only look up at him, but now Ling Han actually managed to stop Ji Wuming single-handedly.

How could this not make them incredibly excited?

“I want!” The Empress leaned close to Ling Han’s ear, and lightly said these words. Her fragrant breath assailed Ling Han’s nape, warm and hot.

Ling Han instantly shivered. The Empress was like a pool of water in front of him, indescribably seductive.

“Niu wants too!” Hu Niu was not willing to admit defeat, either, her tiny hands groping around on Ling Han’s chest.

“Willful!” With a hurried wave of his hand, Ling Han had taken all three women into the Black Tower.

He had tossed Hu Niu and Bewitching Maiden Rou to one side, and left quickly with the Empress in his arms.

“Stupid Ling Han! Stupid Ling Han!” Hu Niu yowled in anger. Why was this damn guy always unwilling to have babies with her?

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s eyes were also soft and wet. She had long since been conquered by Ling Han, and the moment she thought about how Ling Han and the Empress would be physically entangled with each other, her face involuntarily flushed, and she felt her body become boiling hot, as if something was about to surge from her body.

“Damn enemy!” She crossed her legs, her gaze so resentful that even a man of stone would feel his heartbeat quicken at the sight.

A day later, Ling Han finally brought the three women out of the Black Tower, and continued their journey.

The Empress looked radiant from the love she had enjoyed, which increased her beauty even further, and Ling Han was also energetic and invigorated. In the last few hundred years, they had all been searching for Yang Soul Stones, and had not thought about that matter at all.

“Bad Ling Han! Niu hates you!” Hu Niu was peeved.

Ling Han comforted her for a while, and took out some grilled meat. Amidst the fragrant aroma, Hu Niu immediately drooled madly, and had forgotten completely about the matter of her jealousy.

Another month later, they had finally returned to the entrance, and headed upwards through the passage.

Hua, water splashed in all directions. The four of them emerged from the water. The sunlight that they had missed descended on them, sunny and clear skies above them.

The Yang Soul Ocean was currently undergoing a powerful change. The seven-colored rainbow had long since turned white, and these white bands of light were also shaking continuously, as if they would be shattering at any moment.

Once the rainbow shattered, it meant that the Yang Soul Ocean had closed, and the next time it opened, it would be 100,000,000 years later.

Thus, those that had not come out by then would be left behind eternally in the Yang Soul Ocean.

After waiting for 17 days, the white rainbow also vanished.

Ling Han made a calculation. There were a total 752 people that had come, and on their return there were only 421 people. Among them, 74 had broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier, while the remaining people had failed, and could only wait for the next time.

Among those that had come to Yang Soul Ocean this time, aside from those limited few that had been tortured by the Immortal’s Tribulation, and had to break through, or their lifespans would be severed with nothing left, all the others had enough confidence, and that was why they would come and take risks here.

But among more than 700 people, only less than 100 had successfully broken through, which showed just how hard the Dividing Soul Tier was to attain.

The battleship activated, returning to Alchemy City.

Hu Niu came to inform Ling Han that in these 700 years, Celestial Kings had moved to apprehend Ling Han—that was due to the trouble that Ling Han had caused when he had killed six monarch tiers in the Three Blooms Valley. How could the forces behind them possibly give up the matter easily?

Monarch tiers, even for Celestial King Tier forces, were very hard to nurture. At least, they would have to be Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces and above.

And now they were slaughtered, so naturally Celestial Kings would have to interfere.

However, all of them had been chased off by Lu Hairong. She had not appeared, yet had always been guarding Hu Niu from the vicinity, and had helped Ling Han deal with some “small problems” while she was at it.

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder there were no Celestial King Tier forces that came to cause trouble for him all this while, so it was Lu Hairong that had interceded.

“We’ll go back to Alchemy City first, and then... we will go to the Western Celestial Realm!”

After spending more than a year’s time traveling, they finally returned to Alchemy City. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Upon dealing with some miscellaneous tasks, Ling Han bade farewell to Grandmaster Zi Cheng, brought the four women together with Shi Lei and Shi Yu, and headed to the seas of the Eastern Celestial Realm.

Standing at the ship’s prow, Ling Han was slightly rueful. Initially, he should have gone to the Western Celestial Realm close to 1,000 years ago, yet because two Ascending Origin Tiers had battled fiercely, he was innocently dragged in, and in the end, he had gone to Alchemy City instead, where various events had occurred.

And now, he was finally going to set out again to the Western Celestial Realm. Furthermore, this time, there was a Fourth heaven Celestial King standing guard, so it should probably be assured, right?

Xiu

, Lu Hairong’s figure flashed, and finally appeared on the battleship.

“After entering into the boundless seas, all of you behave yourselves,” she said solemnly.

“Senior, you are a Fourth Heaven Celestial King!” Ling Han was surprised. Even a Fourth Heaven Celestial King could not move unhindered in the boundless seas?

Lu Hairong scoffed, and said, “If you want to die, you can give it a try.”

“Ugly, don’t speak like that to Niu’s Ling Han!” Hu Niu jumped out first.

Lu Hairong couldn’t help but feel speechless. Hu Niu was so besotted with this man, and she was completely helpless about it.

“There are a considerable number of primitive creatures in the boundless seas,” Hu Niu explained to Ling Han. “When the world first began, the first batch of creatures became Celestial Kings, but not all creatures’ intelligence developed.

“In the boundless seas, there are a great many powerful creatures. They are like the lowest grade of wild beasts, and the only meaning of their lives is survival.

“If we accidentally barge into their territory, that would be very terrible!

“But Niu likes it!”

The little girl giggled, looking like she delighted in seeing the world in chaos.

Ling Han nodded. The development of the Eastern and Western Celestial Realms was faster, and the majority of creatures had gained their own intelligence, but the creatures in the seas were slower, and were still muddleheaded.

Close to four months later, the battleship arrived at the end of the Eastern Celestial Realm, and further ahead of them was the boundless sea. After they crossed it, it would be the Western Celestial Realm: another world with a higher overall level of cultivation and alchemy.

In that world, there were Ling Han’s parents, his lovers, and his son.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by emotion. As long as he was not thinking about it, it was fine, but once he thought of them, he became incredibly excited.

If his son walked the normal path, there should be many generations of descendants by now, wouldn’t there?

The moment he thought that he was going to become a grandfather, or even great-grandfather, or great great grandfather, Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. He truly had not prepared himself enough for that.

“Let’s go!”

With a turn of Lu Hairong’s slender hand, the battleship sped up towards the ocean. The strength of a Celestial King could not be described with words.

Ling Han and the women all looked from the bow of the ship, admiring the scenery they passed.

There was no shift of night and day in the Celestial Realm. If there was any sun or moon, that ordinarily would be a sun or moon that had been refined by an Ascending Origin Tier or even stronger great elite using supreme techniques. And in the boundless seas, there was naturally no great elite that had that much idle time and created a sun and moon here.

Thus, everything here was very primitive.

However, there were still stars in the Celestial Realm. Countless stars were scattered across the skies. This boundless sea naturally could not be dark, but it could not be considered bright in any sense of the word.

The scenery of the heaven and earth seemed like they were eternally unchanging. Stars were spread out above their heads, while the endless seas stretched out beneath them.

Boom, all of a sudden, a giant hand appeared out of nowhere, striking out at the battleship.
