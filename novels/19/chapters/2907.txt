2908 Ling Xi returns

How serious was it?

Originally, there were eight levels here, but now only three were left.

The first to sixth spatial levels were all compressed together, while the seventh and eighth spatial levels still existed independently.

This kind of spatial compression was irrecoverable, and even the Heavenly Venerates were helpless because this involved the Genesis World itself. Even if it was someone as strong as a Seventh Tier, how could he resist the huge Genesis World?

In other words, Heavenly Venerates with cultivation level below Fifth Tier would have to stay and fight on the first spatial level.

Zhou Heng and the other Sixth Tier elites immediately discussed this and divided the team in half. One team was naturally all Sixth Tier elites, and the other team was led by Fifth Tier elites. They would go to the first spatial level to set up defenses.

Under the roll call of a Sixth Tier elite, the other team would be commanded by these three people respectively.

Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang had all advanced to the Fifth Tier!

After so many years, they had finally taken another step forward.

No one was unwilling, and even the veteran Fifth Tier elites did not voice any objections. This was because these three Fifth Tiers were too powerful, and their battle prowess was enough to soar to the Sixth Tier. With them holding down the fort, it would be even safer than a few Sixth Tiers taking on the task.

The reason was that right now, in this first spatial level, one’s cultivation level would either be suppressed to the Fifth Tier, or one would similarly have to be a Fifth Tier. In that case, who would be more powerful? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, it was the three greatest prodigies of all eternity.

However, this was not good news for Ling Han, because he saw Xin Qihu casting him a cold, menacing gaze, as if he was already a dead man.

F*ck, this guy would definitely use his position to avenge his personal grudge and make a move against him.

He was the commander-in-chief, so he could completely arrange for Ling Han to be under his command. When Hysteria attacked, he would arrange for Ling Han to be in the most dangerous place. Once Ling Han died, he could pluck his soul and obtain all the secrets that Ling Han had.

In fact, he could do it himself and throw the blame onto Hysteria.

And what if Ling Han objected and fled?

Didn’t he know that the punishment for deserters in the Realm Battlefield was incomparably cruel? As long as Ling Han dared to escape, then Xin Qihu would be able to attack in a justifiable and open manner.

Thinking about it, this seemed to be a dead end.

“Ling Han, come,” Lin Youlian suddenly said. “From now on, you are my deputy general.”

Ling Han was surprised. Lin Youlian was publicly protecting him.

Xin Qihu immediately revealed a dissatisfied expression. However, he did not say anything, and only smirked coldly.

Obviously, he wouldn’t let this matter rest.

“Thank you, Miss Lin.” Ling Han communicated this to Lin Youlian through divine sense.

Lin Youlian merely nodded and looked ahead, a hint of worry in her beautiful eyes.

Now that Hysteria had made a comeback, it could be said that they had been accumulating strength, and what awaited them was definitely an army that could topple mountains and overturn seas. However, after so many years of internal strife, not only had they lost too many elites, but their hearts were also no longer united.

Would they completely collapse after a single wave of attacks?

She sighed inwardly. However, no matter what, they had to hold on. Otherwise, Hysteria would be able to push the front line forward. After losing a large amount of territory, the power of the Flaming Frost Realm would be greatly weakened, and they would be in an extremely disadvantageous position in the dimensional clash.

The team advanced step by step, and the construction of city defenses commenced. This was their only way out.

At most, they only had a billion years. They had to hurry.

Time continued to pass, and the entire team advanced very mechanically. The construction of the city walls was naturally done by Celestial Kings, and sometimes even Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates would go and help. At this time, who would still dare to talk about status?

The atmosphere was extremely oppressive. From time to time, internal strife and battles would break out, and the reason for this was actually insignificant.

This was because the pressure was too great, causing everyone to become tense, impulsive, and irritable.

Although Lin Youlian and the other two were the greatest prodigies of all eternity, and their martial prowess surpassed that of everyone here, they were helpless when they were faced with how the hearts of the people had changed.

100,000,000 years, 200,000,000 years… As time passed, they constructed city defenses one after another.

After more than 910,000,000 years, they did not advance any further. Instead, they began to reinforce the latest line of defense. This was their first line of defense against Hysteria’s army.

Everyone was making their final preparations to deal with the impending battle.

However, people’s hearts had really changed. Even though there were extremely strict rules that prohibited the causing of trouble and killing among themselves, such things still happened from time to time.

After all, Lin Youlian and the others were only three people.

Later on, forces were established within the fortress, and they formed cliques just like before. In this way, the private killings actually stopped.

On this day, Ji Wuming, the large black dog, Yi, and the others came looking for Ling Han.

“Boss, let’s also establish a force,” Yi said.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Aren’t we already on the same side?”

“This is different. Other people have opened their doors and established their respective forces. Their clothes have clear signs on them, making it obvious at a glance,” Yi said. “Let’s get a uniform set of clothes too. Let others see that we’re from the Ling Alliance, and they won’t dare to provoke us.”

“Woof, woof, woof. Grandpa Dog was almost slaughtered a few days ago and made into braised dog meat. Look, Grandpa Dog’s tail is bald.” The large black dog turned around, and his tail was seen poking out of his iron underwear. It was completely bald.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Haven’t you always been very slippery? How did you end up in such a miserable state?”

“Brat, Grandpa Dog was about to be killed by someone, and you’re still laughing?” The large black dog stomped his paws, fuming.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Alright, we’ll also form an alliance here, and officially establish a force.”

They acted resolutely, and immediately began to make preparations. They announced the establishment of the Ling Alliance, with Ling Han as the alliance leader. The Heavenly Venerates in the alliance included the Empress, Hu Niu, the Rain Emperor, Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, the large black dog, Ling Jianxue, Ling Feifan, Ji Wuming, Huo Furong, Shi Chanzi, Yi, and so on.

There weren’t many Heavenly Venerates, but with Ling Han holding down the fort, this was a powerful banner.

After hundreds of thousands of years, Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing returned.

Contrary to Ling Han’s expectations, Fu Tianxing had not only advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, but had also in fact advanced to the Third Tier in one go. In terms of cultivation level, he was already not inferior to his master, and Ling Xi was not far behind, either, and had similarly advanced to the Third Tier.

This made Ling Han sigh ruefully. The new generation surpassed the old. His daughter’s strength was within his expectations, but he did not expect that this disciple who had been abducted by his daughter would also be so freakish. It was as if he had the intention of catching up to him.

Of course, Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing had only caught up in terms of cultivation level. When it came to strength in a battle between equals, no one could compare to Ling Han.

...

Like Ling Xi, Fu Tianxing also contained a small world formed from the collision of two dimensions. As long as he continued to grow stronger, his future would be limitless. It was very likely that he would become another Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang.

The return of these two people greatly increased the strength of the Ling Alliance. Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing were also in love with each other, and were preparing to get married.

When Ling Han found out, he almost couldn’t resist killing Fu Tianxing.
