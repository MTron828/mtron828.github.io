Chapter 1130: Setting off for the Majestic Heaven Sect

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Majestic Heaven Sect was extremely powerful. Although it didn’t wish to dominate the surrounding planets, there was a great elite at the Eternal River Tier watching over the sect. As such, it wasn’t afraid to retaliate against those who provoked it.

It could be said that the Majestic Heaven Sect could casually reject to accept a disciple, even if it were Empress Luan Xing who personally requested the Majestic Heaven Sect to accept them. In any case, the relationship between Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing wasn’t that great anyway.

Because Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er had refined some Mountain River Stones before, the combination of their age and their cultivation level qualified them as prodigies. Thus, they were also accepted into the Majestic Heaven Sect as ordinary disciples.

Almost all of Ling Han’s friends had left the Imperial Capital and headed off to the Majestic Heaven Sect.

Ling Han started to mull over his next move.

“Where is Ling Han?” A majestic and dignified voice sounded outside his residence.

This was... Qu Qiuxue, the Great Commander of the Imperial Guards.

Ling Han was slightly surprised. This Great Commander only answered to Empress Luan Xing. The fact that she had come here signified that... Empress Luan Xing had issued an imperial decree?

‘Tsk, how pompous. You embraced me and tried to sate your lust with my body, yet you’re sending an “underling” to deliver a message now?’

He opened his door and walked out, only to see that Qu Qiuxue was dressed in a full suit of armor. There was a hint of might to her beauty, and she was like a radiant flower that blossomed among the army.

It was a shame that this radiant flower only listened to the commands of Empress Luan Xing. Ling Han had never heard any rumors about her liking a man, and it was extremely likely that she was mesmerized by the empress, so much so that she had forgotten her own identity as a female.

Ling Han clasped his hands in salute, and said, “My respects to the Great Commander!”

As a fellow official of the Majestic Empire, he didn’t have to kneel—as long as Qu Qiuxue didn’t insist on it.

There was a strange look in Qu Qiuxue’s eyes as she gazed at Ling Han. He was such an ordinary man, so how was he worthy of being the recipient of the empress’ imperial decree twice? So be it if he had been the recipient of the first imperial decree. The empress had needed to borrow his achievements to put the officials and nobility back in their place.

However, the imperial decree this time was completely for a private matter.

‘When did he become acquainted with Her Majesty?’

No matter how Qu Qiuxue guessed, she would never fathom that the empress had actually lived with Ling Han for the entire two years that she had been missing. Moreover, there had been some extremely intimate moments between them. She would definitely go crazy if she were to learn of this.

“Her Majesty asked me to deliver this to you.” She handed a letter to him, and said, “This is a letter penned by Her Majesty for the Ninth King. Her Majesty wants you to deliver this to the Ninth King, and as long as the Ninth King is willing, Her Majesty said that you can become her follower. That way, you can also cultivate in the Majestic Heaven Sect.”

Ling Han was astonished by her words, so much so that he forgot to accept the letter. Only when Qu Qiuxue coughed loudly did he come back to his senses and accept the letter.

“I’ll take my leave now.” Qu Qiuxue looked at Ling Han deeply before turning around to leave.

She couldn’t understand why Her Majesty wanted Ling Han to deliver the letter. Not only that, but Her Majesty had even sent her over to deliver the message!

Ling Han was astonished because he knew that the Ninth King had already been accepted as a disciple by the Majestic Heaven Sect, and had already gone to the Flying Cloud Planet. Moreover, that unreliable Ninth King had actually been chosen as a seed.

Although Empress Luan Xing said that she wanted him to deliver a letter, she was, in effect, also opening a back door for him to enter the Majestic Heaven Sect—albeit as a follower of the Ninth King.

In the Majestic Heaven Sect, only seeds were allowed to have followers who could cultivate in the sect. Although these followers couldn’t receive the resources of the sect, they could follow their “masters” and listen to the lectures on the great dao given by great elites.

Moreover, Venerable Trinity himself would occasionally give tips to the seeds. Thus, although followers were mere servants, an astounding number of prodigies still fought tooth and nail to win a spot of a follower.

Empress Luan Xing wasn’t influential enough to have the Majestic Heaven Sect break their rules and accept Ling Han as a disciple. However, she used another method to open a door for Ling Han.

Ling Han sounded especially narcissistic as he mumbled to himself, “Tsk, it looks like I’m quite charismatic, huh? Even the empress has been mesmerized by me.”

‘Should I accept this offer?’

Ling Han pondered over this for a moment. In the end, he decided to accept Empress Luan Xing’s act of goodwill.

His three brothers, his disciple, and his lover were all at the Majestic Heaven Sect. In addition, his enemies in Zhao Lun and Sha Yuan had also gone to the Majestic Heaven Sect. If he stayed in the Imperial Capital, what could he do apart from teasing the empress?

However, was it easy to tease the empress?

Ling Han made some preparations. He sold all of the alchemical pills he owned, and then used the True Origin Stones that he received to purchase a large number of materials. He couldn’t give up on alchemy—the Demonic Power Source was close to being used up, so it was impossible for him to maintain his rapid speed of cultivation. Thus, it was necessary for him to return to his old path of using alchemy to support cultivation.

Half a month passed, and Ling Han decided to visit Old Man Xu first. After that, he left the Joint Peace Planet and head to the Flying Cloud Planet on Notionless Saint’s starship.

Why couldn’t he use his Cloud Piercing Shuttle?

The lack of defensive formations was only part of the problem. The more important problem was that his Cloud Piercing Shuttle lacked galactic coordinates.

There was no sense of up, down, left, or right in the vast galaxy, so how could one determine where they were headed?

Galactical coordinates were the key to navigation. However, these coordinates would only be useful when paired with star charts. In addition, these star charts could only be displayed with the help of extremely large formations. Thus, it was basically impossible for small shuttles such as the Cloud Piercing Shuttle to navigate through the galaxy.

If Ling Han were to attempt his journey with the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, there would only be one possible outcome—he would become lost in the vast galaxy. If he were lucky, perhaps he would make it to an unfamiliar planet after hundreds or even thousands of years. Of course, the condition was that he had enough True Origin Stones to fuel the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. Otherwise, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle would become no different from other ordinary shuttles.

Ling Han steered the starship. This didn’t require much technique or skill—there was only a formation, and the starship would fly by itself after the galactic coordinates were entered and the True Origin Stones were inserted. Only when the starship came across unexpected events—such as asteroids or planetary explosions—would one need to physically steer it away from the predetermined route.

Ling Han entered the boundless galaxy. Most of the time, he would simply comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree. He would only leave the Black Tower occasionally in order to check on the situation and see whether there was any risk of accidents.

It would take a long three months to get to the Flying Cloud Planet.

Ling Han was currently sitting under the Reincarnation Tree, and Notionless Saint was imparting his cultivation knowledge to Can Ye, Yuan Cheng He, and the others. He genuinely had nothing else to do right now, being a damaged soul and all. He obviously couldn’t cultivate, so this was his way of passing time.

Ling Han listened from the side. This was the knowledge of a Saint, after all. Could the Majestic Heaven Sect compare to this?

If he broke the news that there was a Saint imparting his knowledge in the Black Tower, even Eternal River Tier great elites such as Venerable Trinity would beg to enter, to say nothing of Heavenly Body Tier elites.

It was impossible to describe the great dao with mere words. However, Notionless Saint had been a supreme elite once, so he naturally knew how to guide his students.

This was analogous to how a black hole couldn’t be seen, but one could succeed in proving its existence through observing the light rays and celestial bodies that it absorbed.

The guidance provided by Notionless Saint was similar to this. Through his profound yet simple explanations, Can Ye and the others were able to attain all kinds of comprehensions.

One had to remember that they were comprehending dao under the Reincarnation Tree. Perhaps they couldn’t grasp a concept in just one day, but what if they were given a year? Or even 10 years?

“Brat, even if I obtain a physical body in the future, I’m still going to cultivate in this place of yours,” Notionless Saint said. “It’s an unparalleled treasure land!”

Under the Reincarnation Tree, one day’s worth of cultivation was equivalent to one year’s worth. Thus, even Saints couldn’t resist the appeal of cultivating here. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“No problem!” Ling Han said with a nod.

If Notionless Saint could recover fully, Ling Han would have gained another powerful helper, even if Notionless Saint were only a Small Saint.

The Asura Demon Emperor couldn’t help but admire and venerate his master even more. He had obtained the services of a Saint just like that! If they were in the Netherworld, this would be equivalent to obtaining the help of a Demon Master!

He involuntarily tried to wag his tail. However, he was in human form right now, so there was no tail for him to wag. This displeased him greatly. He actually wasn’t a dog anymore! How infuriating!
