Li Changdan was knowledgeable. He recognized that this was a Talisman Weapon. He had seen it before at He Guan’s place.

One could imagine that this Talisman Weapon was definitely a gift from Sun Jianfang, so its power was absolutely astonishing.

Therefore, he stopped in time, and didn’t want to face it head-on.

Meanwhile, Ling Han unleashed a burst of power, and flew into the mine.

“Li Changdan!” Rui Yuanliang couldn’t help but roar furiously. This guy was clearly a Nine Meridians cultivator. As long as he used his full strength, how could Ling Han possibly have the chance to escape?

It was this guy who had suggested chasing after Ling Han, but it was also this guy who had been so timid. He really did not know what he was afraid of.

Afraid of being charged with killing the Dao Child?

But even if Ling Han died in his or Yang Fei’s hands, how could Li Changdan stay out of it?

They were all in the same boat here.

How stupid. How could such a person actually aspire to become the Dao Child?

In the mine, the lighting was dark, and the terrain was complicated. Thus, Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang immediately stopped in their tracks. They couldn’t give chase recklessly. If they weren’t careful, they might lose their lives.

Li Changdan said coldly, “Chase after him!”

Rui Yuanliang looked at Li Changdan, and said angrily, “If you had used your full strength, that kid would have died long ago!”

Yang Fei, on the other hand, was also furious, but did not dare to say anything. He was only from the Seven Meridians, and did not have any background.

“What’s the point of saying this now?” Li Changdan’s gaze was cold. “Right now, we need to work together and kill Ling Han. Otherwise, there won’t be anything good for us in the sect in the future.

“Are you still going to be so timid when you meet that kid again?” Rui Yuanliang asked.

“Of course not,” Li Changdan said.

“Good!”

The three of them advanced together and entered the mine.

At first, there were no forks in the path inside the mine. They only needed to walk forward.

“There’s a bone-chilling cold.”

However, after walking for a while, a fork appeared in front of them.

“Which side?” Yang Fei asked.

There were no footprints left in this mine, so they didn’t know which path to take.

“Don’t be anxious.” Li Changdan took out a box and opened it. Inside was a jade-colored toad. He placed the toad on the ground. Strangely, this toad actually croaked twice at the passage on the left.

Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang clicked their tongues in wonder. This was really a good thing for tracking.

Soon, they encountered another fork in the road. Li Changdan still took out the toad to guide them in the right direction.

…

After Ling Han passed through several consecutive forks in the road, he stopped. This was enough to shake off the pursuers behind him.

Now, all he had to do was wait. Once they entered the other fork in the path, he would turn back and leave this place.

With all the miners and supervisors together, how many people were there? Now, they had disappeared without a trace. It was unknown if they had been eaten or kidnapped. There was something strange about this.

Under such circumstances, how could Ling Han dare to venture deep into the mine?

However, a moment later, he heard the sound of footsteps. In this space, it was exceptionally clear.

Hmm, the three of them had caught up with him?

Ling Han was astounded. He could clearly hear that there were a total of three sets of footsteps. Naturally, Li Changdan and the other two were the most likely source.

Strange, they had already passed seven forks. How could they chase after him so accurately?

Could it be that one of these three people had a dog’s nose? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Han immediately moved again. After walking for a while, a fork appeared in front of him. Ling Han chose the left path and entered. Then, after walking for a while, another fork appeared in front of him, and he chose the right path again.

The mine wasn’t completely pitch-black. Instead, there were lamps hanging at regular intervals. These lamps were powered by electricity, and they could be used for about a month at a time. Thus, even though half a month had passed, these lamps hadn’t been extinguished.

After running like this for nearly two hours, Ling Han stopped to rest. He felt that his body was burning hot. If he continued to run, his blood vessels would probably explode.

But 10 minutes later, he heard footsteps behind him again.

F*ck!

Ling Han decided not to run. Who was afraid of who?

He took out the Talisman Weapon and waited quietly. As long as these three people appeared, he would use it.

He hid in a dark corner. At this point, he seemed to have exceeded the current limits that the mine had extended to, so there were no lights hanging on the cave walls.

A gust of cold wind blew over, and Ling Han felt his entire body go cold, as if his blood was about to freeze.

One had to know that he had opened his Six Meridians, and his power was close to 10,000 kilograms. His physique was extremely powerful, but now he actually felt that his blood was about to freeze?

Something was not right!

How could there be a cold wind blowing?

If this place had just been dug out, then the end would be behind the darkness, but now there was a wind blowing over. What did this mean?

The miners kept digging, and they might have dug through an underground cave.

Who knew what was in that cave? Perhaps the disappearance of the miners and supervisors was related to this.

Wait, there was also a strong stench!

A strong sense of danger suddenly rose in Ling Han’s heart, and he exerted strength in his legs. Xiu, he darted out.

Pa! A hole was punched into the wall he was leaning against, and a blood-red spear-like object was stabbed into the wall.

Ling Han could not help but grind his teeth slightly. If he had reacted a little slower just now, the back of his head would have definitely been pierced through.

Xiu, the blood-red object retracted, and a colossal creature slowly crawled out from the darkness.

Was this a lizard?

Its length, including its tail, was about six meters. Its entire body was dark red, and its body was covered in scales. There was also a bright red rooster crown on its head, and the thing that had almost killed Ling Han just now was its tongue.

Good lord, not only was its tongue like a spear, but it could even pierce through hard rocks. This was too terrifying.

Ling Han’s heart trembled. Had all the villagers that had disappeared been eaten by this guy?

At this moment, the footsteps behind him were getting closer and closer.

Without any hesitation, Ling Han immediately turned around and fled.

Li Changdan, Rui Yuanliang, and Yang Fei immediately appeared. When they saw Ling Han, they all revealed looks of surprise and joy.

They finally found him

However, they would never have imagined that not only did Ling Han take the initiative to welcome them, he even had a smile on his face, as if the three of them were not here to kill him, but were his closest friends.

This was too strange.

Li Changdan’s selfish side was immediately exposed. He was extremely wary of the Talisman Weapon in Ling Han’s hand, and thought that Ling Han was deliberately approaching him with the intention of using the Talisman Weapon to kill them.

Xiu, he immediately paused and forcefully stopped himself.
