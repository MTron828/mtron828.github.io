Chapter 1811: Trap

One day, two days, a year, two years, 100 years, 200 years.

Ling Han had lost all sense of time, and only felt that he had waited as long as a few thousand or tens of thousands of years in this state, but his Dao Heart had not wavered in the slightest.

That was because he had discovered something meaningful: increasing his appreciation of the Regulations of Dao.

He hadn’t advanced to the second severance peak stage, right? Then, he would go ahead and continue appreciation of Dao.

Before, he had also experienced having lost all his five senses, but the two experiences were different. At that time, he couldn’t enter into the Black Tower, but he could still use all the techniques in his body. This time, however, his divine sense seemed to have been cut off, or was blocked in a specific area inside his mind.

But under such conditions, he could put everything else out of mind, and focus on comprehending Dao.

However, inevitably, feelings like emptiness and loneliness began to spread, corroding him and testing his Dao Heart, and wanting to shake him and drag him into the abyss of darkness.

In the cultivation world, this was called karmic hindrance[1].

Everyone would encounter this. The only difference was whether it was stronger or weaker. Under normal conditions, most people could bear it, but in such an extreme situation, it was really, really too difficult.

Ling Han guarded his heart and spirit firmly, focusing on comprehending Dao. ‘Who cares what you are or what you do? My heart is inclined towards Dao, and my obsession will not change.’

It wasn’t clear how much time had passed. He only felt as if he had encountered a bottleneck, the ceiling of the maximum limit of Regulations.

An enlightenment rose up in him. He had reached the second severance peak stage.

...He had long since reached his limits in the area of Origin Power, and now his comprehension had also reached that level. Then, next was breaking through. If he did not break through, he would not advance an inch further.

“Young man, you have passed the text.” A voice rang out by Ling Han’s ear. Suddenly, the space around him returned to normal, and he had come back to that stone chamber from before. That shadowy light figure stood with his hands clasped behind his back, bearing no expression.

Ling Han showed an expression of astonished delight.

Originally, he would probably need 100 years to reach the second severance peak stage—unless he continued to consume Celestial medicines endlessly, increasing his appreciation of Regulations. Furthermore, this was still taking into consideration that he had the Reincarnation Tree, and had two Source Powers of the heaven and earth inside his body.

But now, he had actually reached this level with a single step.

Still, just how much time had passed?

This question had just risen in his heart, and he saw one of the walls of the stone chamber suddenly crack open. A figure rapidly shot out. Shua, Sword Qi swept out, slashing madly at Ling Han.

“You mad criminal, die!” This was an astonishingly beautiful woman. However, at this moment, her face was covered with grim ice. Who else could it be but Zihe Bingyun?

This strike was extremely frightening. As Sword Qi danced, even great dao was trembling.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled into a frown. This woman had come here as well; what a great coincidence!

His killing intent blazed. He really did not have the slightest bit of fondness for Zihe Bingyun. Just to take out her anger, she was willing to commit murder; she had really been horribly spoilt!

Did she really think that he didn’t dare to kill her?

Ling Han’s figure leaped out, his hands balling into fists. The two great Source Powers of heaven and earth circulated at the same time. One fist was blazing hot, while the other was icy cold, forming two extremities as they blasted towards Zihe Bingyun.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them clashed in an exchange of blows. It was clear that Zihe Bingyun had also gained a great benefit in this place, having advanced from the third severance early stage to the third severance peak stage. In terms of battle prowess, she still overwhelmed Ling Han completely. However, due to Ling Han’s tough physique, it was still a great problem for her to cause any harm to him.

“Vile criminal, I want nothing more than to devour your flesh and drink your blood!” Zihe Bingyun harshly rebuked even while she was delivering attacks against him. Her beautiful eyes were wide as if she had suffered some great atrocity, and was filled with a boundless fury.

Ling Han couldn’t help but become speechless. Just who had been the first to trifle with the other?

He wanted to toss a harsh rebuke back, but his heart suddenly clenched.

How could it be so coincidental? It wasn’t anyone else that had come, but had to be Zihe Bingyun?

The test given by the shadowy light figure was a test of his Dao Heart. He could not make a sound, but what if the so-called ‘pass’ previously was only just another part of the test?

With such thoughts, Ling Han immediately discovered what was off. Though the Xuanyin Source Water and Nine Heavens Flame were very strong, they did not have that kind of supreme noble air of a Source Power of heaven and earth! Furthermore, he was still unable to sense the Black Tower.

Originally, this should have been the first thing he realized, but he was filled with astonished delight previously, and heard that he had “passed”, which was followed by Zihe Bingyun charging out. Everything had happened all at once, and he was not given the slightest time to think at all.

This was still a part of the test. If anyone was careless and overlooked it, he would definitely fall for the trap!

With a discovery like this, it was naturally impossible for Ling Han to speak. He only circulated his full power, and launched a powerful offensive against Zihe Bingyun.

At this time, he also discovered that though his physique was very strong, it had not reached the extent that it had after having been tempered by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Clearly, there was some mysterious technique that was imitating his condition, but the problem was that whether it was the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, Xuanyin Source Water, or Nine Heavens Flame, they were all too high-grade.

Two were great Source Powers of heaven and earth, and the other had been created through fusing a considerable number of Celestial King Tier techniques, so how could they be emulated!

It was greatly possible that this had been an ancient Celestial King Tier sect, but even if this technique had been laid down by a Celestial King, how could a mere technique that had been left behind perfectly emulate three great Celestial King Tier objects with its creator now gone?

That would really be a joke.

Thus, if he investigated carefully, there were actually many gaps in the matter.

‘Since that was the case, then could I be even stronger?’ Ling Han thought. ‘I am not Severing Mundane Tier, I am Dividing Soul Tier!’

Boom, he instantly unleashed an incomparably powerful attack. One strike was crushing, and Zihe Bingyun was blasted into smithereens, and turned into spots of light that gradually disappeared.

“Not bad, not bad!” It was still the voice of that shadowy figure from before which rang out by Ling Han’s ear.

The scene in front of his eyes seemed to have changed slightly, but the change had been too fast. If it was not for the fact that Ling Han’s senses were incredibly sharp, he could not possibly have been able to detect the change. He connected to the Black Tower at the first instant, and when he discovered that he could, he immediately relaxed.

This time, he had really passed the test.

He sensed the condition of his physical body. The passage of time could be deduced from the minuscule changes in the physical body. It only took an instant, and he immediately showed an expression of surprise. That was because only a few breaths’ time had passed.

It was only the time for a few breaths, and he had advanced from the second severance middle stage to the second severance peak stage; this... was practically a miracle!

So this was the power of a Celestial King?

He had a dawning realization. Rather than calling this a test, it would be more appropriate to call it good luck!

When this Celestial King Tier sect had still existed, this place was definitely not somewhere anyone could come just as they liked. Instead, only core disciples that had gone through careful, meticulous selection would be qualified. This was like taking a sip of Reincarnation Tea, which was similar to waking up from a slumber 100 lifetimes later.

Ascending Dragon Palace, Ascending Dragon Palace, no wonder. This was indeed a place that would help a hidden dragon ascend into the heavens.

“You have understood.” The shadowy light figure nodded. “This is indeed a test, but also an opportunity. Whether you are able to grasp it depends on whether your Dao Heart is firm or otherwise. However, every person only has an opportunity like this once in a lifetime. Furthermore, it is only limited to the Severing Mundane Tier. Otherwise, the spirit would sustain a fatal injury. It will only be detrimental, and not beneficial at all. Even Celestial Kings can do nothing.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ling Han was curious, and asked, “I have survived the solitude, and guarded my Dao Heart, so I have gained this good fortune, but if I was not able to pass through the next test?”

That false Zihe Bingyun was actually the real test, and could also be called a trap.

The shadowy light figure did not show emotion, and coldly replied, “Then you will not be able to enter into a place, and search for another greater opportunity.”

“What opportunity?” Ling Han asked.
