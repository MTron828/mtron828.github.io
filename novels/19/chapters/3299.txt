Chapter 3300 - 3300 Strange Young Girl

A formation that he could wear on his body!

How could this be done?

Ling Han’s thoughts immediately wandered. Since that was the case, he naturally could inscribe patterns on armor, creating an indestructible army.

The upper limit of the Precipice Formation’s defenses was as high as Enlightenment Tier. However, because the formation was damaged, its defenses naturally dropped drastically, and it could only unleash the might of Inscription Tier. This was also extremely shocking, because there was only one Enlightenment Tier elite in the whole of the present generation.

However, looking at the drawing conditions of the formation patterns, Ling Han couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. This was because it required the blood of an Inscription Tier elite as ink.

It could be a Demonic Beast, or it could be a cultivator.

Sigh, could it be that Ling Han would have to run over to General Hengtian or General Vajra to ask them for some blood?

Whether it was formation techniques or alchemy techniques, after reaching High Level, the greatest difficulty was how to get the ingredients.

Ling Han put away the formation patterns and put this formation aside for the moment. He’d wait until he obtained the blood of an Inscription Tier elite.

On the second day, Ling Han was just about to return to the academy when Zhong Feiyang came over and chatted with him for a while. He was filled with admiration for Ling Han’s formation skills, and wanted to discuss formations with him.

Ling Han truly didn’t have time, so he politely declined, disappointing Zhong Feiyang.

Ling Han couldn’t care less. There were really too many things he had to do now.

After returning to the academy, Ling Han continued to cultivate diligently.

On the way to harvest Vermillion Fruits, Ling Han had already used the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll Technique to deduce a Blood Transformation Tier cultivation technique. Limited by his cultivation level, this may not be the strongest Body Art in the world, but with how the world was only at the beginning of martial arts, there should not be any match for the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

He nibbled on honey every day, improving the toughness of his physique, and his physical power also increased madly.

The mystical power of an ordinary Fifth Change should be around 1 million kilograms, but Ling Han estimated that his limit should be able to rush up to 2.5 million kilograms, and added with physical power, it should be no problem to reach 5 million kilograms.

This power was too terrifying. By then, Ling Han could even lift a medium-sized warship single-handedly.

He already had a large amount of money in his possession, so Ling Han began to purchase medicinal ingredients. He wanted to get rid of the poison of the Soul Departing Pill as soon as possible. If he couldn’t get rid of this poison, he kept feeling as if someone had placed a saber by his neck.

Students had come to visit, hoping that Ling Han could give a holler and establish a new force. With his present reputation, it was sure that there would be a great many people willing to join under his banner.

Yet Ling Han was completely uninterested. After experiencing such a long time in the Genesis World, would he still cling to power?

After becoming some Gang Leader or whatnot, he would definitely be greatly distracted. How could he be as free as he was now?

The little handmaiden was still cultivating in seclusion to break through to the Blood Transformation Tier, and didn’t even have the time to serve him. Not only was Ling Han slightly unaccustomed to this, but so was that perverted pig, who was glaring at Ling Han. This perverted pig humphed at Ling Han, meaning that Lord Pig is hungry, so quickly go and give me something to eat.

Ling Han chuckled, “Do you want to eat roasted suckling pig?”

The perverted pig was immediately enraged, and with a sweep of his four legs, he was just about to charge over to fight Ling Han to the death. However, he had only taken a few steps when he slowed down, panting heavily. Then, he collapsed onto the ground, completely exhausted.

Ling Han shook his head, and said with a smile, “Who told you to eat until you are so fat? Just look, your four legs are as short as can be.”

The perverted pig rolled its eyes at him. It was just that lazy and gluttonous, so what could it do, b@stard?

However, Ling Han was indeed a little hungry, so he took out a goat from the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

This was a Demonic Sheep that he had killed in the mountains. It had the cultivation level of Blood Transformation Tier. Not only did it taste extremely delicious, it was also very beneficial to cultivators.

Previously, he had already eaten half, and now, there was still half left.

After starting a fire, Ling Han began to roast the leg of lamb. Roasted food was the most aromatic.

Smelling the aroma, the perverted pig immediately began to drool. “Look at how promising you are.” Ling Han shook his head sheepishly.

The perverted pig pointed a hoof at Ling Han, and snorted, meaning, ‘Look at yourself, you’re not much better than Lord Pig’

“Gu-“The sound of a stomach growl was heard, yet it was neither Ling Han nor the perverted pig.

The man and the pig turned their heads at the same time, and saw that there was a person sprawled out over the wall of the courtyard. His eyes were fixed on the roasted mutton on the fire, and he was completely focused.

Gu, that person swallowed, and it was very loud.

Ling Han was surprised. This guy whose stomach was growling in hunger and couldn’t help but swallow was actually a young girl who looked to be no more than 14 or 15 years old.

However, the problem was that Ling Han didn’t realize when she had appeared on the wall at all. If it weren’t for that stomach growl, he would have still been unaware.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A fourteen to fifteen year old young girl had come so close to him, how had she managed to deceive his divine sense?

“Focus on grilling, don’t burn it!” The young girl suddenly spoke up, her voice crisp and clear.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. ‘Should you be considering this matter? Aren’t you going to explain why you’re leaning on my wall first?’

He had countless complaints, but at this moment, he didn’t know where to start.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded, and focused on roasting the leg of lamb.

Another few minutes later, the aroma of barbequed meat wafted out, becoming even more alluring.

The young girl couldn’t help but stretch out her neck, her whole upper body in midair. Then, with a ‘pa’, she fell off the wall. She dusted off her behind and got back to her feet, completely unscathed.

She was not afraid of strangers. She strode over, sat down, and stretched out her hand to grab the mutton.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and asked, “Where’s your parents?”

“Dead,” the young girl said expressionlessly, already holding the leg of lamb horizontally and directly chewing on it.

The little perverted pig was instantly enraged. It stretched out its hoof and pointed at the young girl, looking like it was about to fight her to the death.

To dare to snatch Lord Pig’s meat, she must be tired of living! More importantly, her breasts were still so small. This was what Lord Pig hated the most, b@st@rd.

Ling Han looked at the young girl, and frowned slightly. This young girl gave him an unfathomable feeling. He could not tell the height of her cultivation level at all.

If it was said that she was only an ordinary person, how could she possibly approach quietly without being discovered by him?

But to say that her cultivation level was above Ling Han’s, that was even more inconceivable. An Extreme Bone Tier elite who was only fourteen or fifteen years old? Then wouldn’t she be even more freakish than Hong Tianbu? If there really was such a monster, wouldn’t her name have spread throughout the world long ago?

He looked at the young girl who was wolfing down the food, and asked, “Little girl, what is your name?”

“Little girl?” The young girl put down the leg of lamb, and cocked her head to look at Ling Han for a while, “This old lady is more than old enough to be your mother!”

What an unlikable little girl. It was said that the mouth that eats the food of others is softened, and she, on the other hand, was actually taking advantage of him.

Pa, the perverted pig tried to leap up and take a bite of the mutton, but unfortunately, its jumping ability was too bad. It fell from the air when it was only three inches off the ground, and was still very far from touching the meat.

The young girl seemed to be interested, and lowered the meat slightly. When the perverted pig was about to bite it, she raised her hand again, and the perverted pig missed its bite, making her laugh loudly.

And she said she wasn’t a child!

Ling Han didn’t ask any more questions, and simply watched quietly. She wouldn’t have just come for a meal of mutton, right?

After a while, the young girl seemed to have gotten tired of teasing pigs, and casually threw the lamb leg that she had eaten to the point that only a bone was left onto the ground, and said, “Brat, I was the one who planted that Weapon Nurturing Tree!”
