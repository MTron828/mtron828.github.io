Chapter 1039: Essence of the Demon Master

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

On the other side of the battle was a man who looked to be only in his forties. His upper body was bare, and all his muscles were bulging. However, what was unusual was the fact that there were actually multiple divine patterns on his skin. They did not seem to be engraved on his skin, but rather cast from some kind of metal.

Not only was that the case, there were over a dozen sharp spikes growing on his back. They had all sprouted from his spine, and each spike was over half a meter long, making for a frightening sight.

A black Qi entwined around his entire body, which gave Ling Han a feeling of familiarity.

Demonic Qi!

Right, that was precisely Demonic Qi. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

... This man was a great elite of the Netherworld, and the golden-skinned old man was obviously one of the Immortal Realm. This was a battle between the two most powerful elites from the two Realms.

In their great battle, they could change the shape of their bodies according to their will. There were times when they were the size of ordinary humans, but there were other times when they were zillions of meters tall. With a stretch of their arm, they could easily grab a star nearby and smash it into the other.

In the fierce battle between these two titans, the surrounding stars had been completely ravaged, multiple blinding spots of light lighting up the dark universe.

Ling Han could feel his hair stand on ends just from watching. A whole star was smashed into bits, and there was a massive conflict involving the Regulations of heaven and earth. That kind of destructive power was capable of utterly ruining everything. Even elites of the Heavenly Body Tier would only be insta-killed in this kind of battle.

However, this kind of conflict did not have the slightest negative effect on these two people. They merely continued such an utterly destructive battle, and created even greater destruction.

Yet finally, the man from the Netherworld was no match for his opponent. He was hit with a great attack, his body sent flying, and directly shattering a star. Meanwhile, he was stuck to a shattered piece of the star, and streaked towards the depths of the universe.

This powerful move directly shattered his physical body, and erased his divine sense as well. In theory, he was definitely and completely dead, with no hope of survival.

He streaked through the universe alongside this shattered piece of star for who knew how long, and finally crashed into a planet, turning a plain into a massive sea.

Star Sea!

Ling Han finally understood. In the past, two ultimate elites had been battling, with one being defeated, or even killed. His body alongside a broken piece of a celestial body crashed down right into Joint Peace Planet. This was the origin of the Star Sea.

But what no one knew was that one of the fighters was actually a great elite from the Netherworld.

Was he in the Genesis Tier?

Ling Han had not yet completed this thought when he saw a stream of chaos attack him, causing him to be filled with killing intent.

Kill, kill, kill, he wanted to kill all the people of this Realm!

This was the remaining will of that great elite from the Netherworld.

He had to have died long ago, but even if this kind of existence left behind merely a shattered piece of his will, that would be sufficient to affect any who came after. Now, the Demonic Qi was influencing Ling Han’s heart, wanting to erase his original self and turn him completely into a demon.

Ling Han humphed. If this was outside, he might be affected, but this was inside the Black Tower!

The Genesis Tier was indeed the greatest power of the current era, but this elite from the Netherworld had died who knew how many years ago, so how much power could he still have left?

Ling Han drew upon the power of the Black Tower to resist the Demonic Qi.

This was not his first time.

Long ago, in the Devil Sky Mystery Realm, he had already resisted the Demonic Qi of the Asura Demon Emperor. Of course, compared to this stream of Demonic Qi, the Asura Demon Emperor was practically trash. However, Ling Han’s abilities had also changed massively since that time. Furthermore, the power of the Black Tower had also been restored quite a bit since then.

Was that still not enough to suppress you?

Ling Han whittled away endlessly at the Demonic Qi. The berserk, chaotic, and bloodthirsty factors had all been worn down, leaving behind only the purest essence, which sunk into Ling Han’s Dantian. At first, there was only a speck, which turned into a ball, but it was about the size of an egg then.

What was shocking was the fact that the essence was filled with power, and could be absorbed by his Mountain River. Ling Han immediately discovered that his second great Mountain was growing at an astonishing pace. Going by that trend, he would be able to reach the middle stage of the medium extreme in about a month’s time—close to the late stage—and form his second great River from there.

This was really too astonishing!

It had to be known that breaching every minor level in Mountain River Tier would take long millennia. Only Zhao Lun, Sha Yuan, and other such descendants that managed to obtain terrifyingly bountiful resources would be able to complete such accumulation in a short few centuries.

But Ling Han?

Going by this kind of rate, he might be able to reach the peak stage of consummate level in only a few years.

“There is no need to be shocked. This is the lifetime essence of a Demon Master,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

“Demon Master!” Though Ling Han had expected this, he was still shocked.

Demon Master, an equivalent to the Saints of the Immortal Realm, was an existence in the Genesis Tier.

“The will and physical body of the Demon Master has long been worn away, but Genesis Tier is really too powerful. Even a portion of his body could last for a few hundred million years, influencing this sea,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han nodded. Precisely because of the effect of the corpse of the Demon Master, this sea was affected, creating such incredibly shocking gravity...

In truth, that was a kind of power of Regulation. An elite of the Genesis Tier would affect the Regulations of the heaven and earth, and who would not be influenced?

No wonder Demonic Qi would seep out of that pit on the Earth’s Core Island; it had to be connected with this area of sea.

Ling Han looked inward at his Dantian. The last bit of essence from the Dantian had turned into a black ball. It was so black that it would cause one to shudder inwardly. Furthermore, the endless power was also spreading out through this ball-like form, nurturing his physical body and raising his cultivation level.

This was something that was taking place at all times, and going by that trend, it was enough to help him reach the Sun Moon Tier!

That was natural. It was the lifetime essence of a Demon Master; what would be strange about it raising Ling Han to the Sun Moon Tier? On the contrary, if it were not for the fact that time had passed too quickly, and that it had lost a great portion of its essence, it might’ve even been capable of raising Ling Han to the Heavenly Body Tier or even the Eternal River Tier!

‘Thankfully, the power of this essence is spreading out bit by bit. I would definitely explode from its force otherwise.’

A lingering fear rose up in Ling Han. Being capable of raising his cultivation level to the Sun Moon Tier in a short time... How terrifying was this power? Also, this ball of power was staying in his body. It was like a time bomb; it would really keep one on edge and scared.

‘However, the most important thing is not the quick boost to cultivation level, but rather the Demon Master’s comprehension of the Regulations of heaven and earth contained in this—the Regulations of heaven and earth of the Netherworld. I only need to reach a corresponding level, and I would be able to comprehend the Regulations from both the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld, which is the very most frightening part.

‘But I heard that the two realms were opposed to each other, remaining in an inharmonious relationship. If I’m not careful, I may not be able to merge the Regulations of the two realms. Instead, I myself would be driven mad. The Regulations of the two realms would conflict, and I’d die.

‘Forget it. This is something that I should consider only after I have stepped into the Genesis Tier, so I’ll just think about it later.

‘According to that theory, the reason why this Star Sea would have such a powerful gravity field is because of the existence of the Demon Master. Now that I have absorbed the essence of the Demon Master, wouldn’t this great sea be no different from any ordinary sea?

‘Haha, I can leave this place!

‘Tsk, I am indeed very lucky. When I opened the sky, I was instilled with good fortune from the heaven and earth—that is definitely no mere empty words.

‘Furthermore...’

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head. The Demonic Power Source in his Dantian—this was the name that he came up with for that lump of essence from the Demon Master; after all, if he called it essence, he felt that it was somewhat filthy—immediately spread out threads of Demonic Qi. His air immediately changed, and there was a black gas circling around his whole body as if he had transformed into a demon himself.

‘Haha, I can pass myself off as a person from the Netherworld!I’ll let the Asura Demon Emperor come take a look to see if there are any discrepancies.’

Ling Han cracked a grin.
