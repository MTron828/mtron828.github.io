Chapter 1008: Who is the Killer?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Me?” Ling Han smiled slightly. Previously, when they entered into the zone of fog, he had entered into the Black Tower with Shui Yanyu. What business of his was it that there had been a battle raging outside?

However, he could not use it as evidence. He merely shook his head, and said, “Killing him is not worth my time.”

When he said this, he, too, felt curious. The people here should be aiming for him, so why was Jiang Anyun the one who had been stabbed and killed? Looking at this wound, it was both thin and deep. Obviously, the attacker had struck ruthlessly. His attack was meant to be fatal.

It was definitely a planned assassination, and not a spontaneous action.

“Aside from you, who else could it be?!” the old man exclaimed, his beard shaking in anger. Jiang Anyun was the sole son of Jiang Ji, and though his character was unbearable, he bore the “heavy responsibility” of continuing the ancestral line for the Jiang Clan. And now, before he had even sown the seeds, he was dead. Jiang Ji would definitely fly into a thunderous rage.

... He was now busy cultivating in seclusion, so where would he find the time to ******* and have another son?

“That’s right. He was your foe, and it was already known to all from the first day we boarded. If it was not you, who else would do such a thing?” Luo Wu interrupted, a clear handprint on his face. Who knew who was the one who’d slapped him.

Instantly, Yang Tiecheng’s eyes swept over, killing intent brimming in their depth. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In truth, Ling Han did not fear this man. If it was a battle, it was true that he was no match for him at present. However, with his incredible physique, he was absolutely confident he could survive. Even if worse came to worst, he still had the Black Tower, didn’t he?

If there was no absolute necessity, what need was there for him to fight someone completely unrelated to death and fall for the dastardly trap of another?

He now understood what was going on. Though the murderer had killed Jiang Anyun, the former’s motive was still him: it was to slander him, and make use of Yang Tiecheng and the Black Five Gang to get rid of him.

Ling Han looked completely calm, and said, “I will repeat it one more time. It was not I who killed him. If I really wanted to kill him, it would definitely not end with stabbing him to death with a single strike. Instead, I’d beat his head to a pulp!”

“Ha, so you admit that you have a motive now!” Zuo Xiao suddenly jumped up.

“Are you an idiot?” Ling Han looked at him in disdain.

“Brother Yang, this person has an old grudge with Jiang Anyun. Furthermore, he has also admitted just now that he had the idea of killing the latter,” Luo Yu said to Yang Tiecheng.

Fan Yong, meanwhile, asked sarcastically, “Ling Han, you said you are not the killer, but what proof do you have?”

“That’s right. If it wasn’t you, show some proof!” Luo Wu called out as well. On the issue of dealing with Ling Han, they were on the same side.

Ling Han scoffed out coldly, and said, “You really are a bunch of idiots. Since you all accuse me of murder, then it should be you who should be producing the evidence, and not I! Otherwise, I can also say that you ate sh*t when you were little. If not, show some proof! You spied on him bathing yesterday, so please show some evidence to prove your innocence!”

He pointed at them one by one, and accused each person of a nonsensical crime.

Everyone knew that he was speaking nonsense, but Ling Han had clearly conveyed his meaning, and it was whoever made the accusation should produce evidence to support his claim. Otherwise, wouldn’t others have to run about everywhere to prove their innocence just because you were opening your mouth and making an accusation?

If they wanted to accuse Ling Han of being the killer, they would have to show proof. Otherwise, it was best that they spoke less crap.

In that moment, everyone’s expression was cold.

Previously, the situation was completely chaotic, and their divine sense and sight was both jammed. In truth, no one knew who the killer was, but since someone had jumped out to accuse Ling Han of the crime, they naturally were happy to go with the flow. After all, killing Ling Han was their main purpose.

Yang Tiecheng’s thick brows wrinkled into a frown. The relations of the people on board were complicated, and he, too, could not confirm who the killer was. Hence, he said, “I will naturally get to the bottom of this matter. I ask everyone to cooperate with me!”

“As you like!” everyone replied.

They all stayed on the deck to cooperate with Yang Tiecheng’s investigation.

In truth, this murder was very hard to investigate. After all, everyone had a Spatial Spirit Tool, and if they hid the murder weapon inside, who would be able to find it? To say the least, they could have directly thrown it into the sea... What, would you still steer the ship back into the fog to search for it?

The investigation naturally came to a dead end. On the other hand, the names of the other few people were made known.

The young man hugging a sword was Jin Zhihui, the old man in gray was called Zhou Gaoyang and the youth in coarse robes was called Fu Tian. Finally, the beauty in white was named Yin Yuanxiang.

Forget about the remaining seven people from the Black Five Gang. They were all trash, so who cared what their names were...

Yang Tiecheng could feel a headache coming on. Now that someone had died on board, he would definitely have to bear responsibility. More importantly, there was not the slightest bit of clue who the killer was. It seemed like the person who had done the dead was an assassin. This sword strike was really too decisive and clean.

“An assassin!” The others were also considering this issue. After all, it was naturally a good thing to be able to push the blame on Ling Han, but if there really was an assassin on board, all of them would be in danger.

Who knew if the next person to fall would be them so they could be used to frame Ling Han? Of course, it was still possible that Ling Han was the one who had done it.

It was precisely because the truth was shrouded in fog that everyone felt a sense of danger. They felt as if not one person could be trusted, like everybody next to them could possibly become a killer.

“Why don’t we enter into the Black Fog once more?” Ling Han suddenly suggested.

Everyone was stunned. ‘Have you gone f******* mad?’

In the fog, sight and divine sense would both be greatly affected, and battle prowess would drop drastically. No one was willing to stay in that kind of environment.

“Perhaps the killer would still make use of the opportunity again, and we would be able to find him then,” Ling Han continued.

In any case, his target was the pirates, so he did not care about the change in the ship’s course, nor did he care if there would be time wasted.

“I think that this is not a bad suggestion,” Luo Yu spoke up first, his eyes focused on Ling Han, revealing a sinister killing intent.

Previously, he was slightly surprised that he had not managed to find Ling Han, but this time, it would definitely not happen again!

“Yes!” Liu Ying and the other three women also expressed their agreement.

Fan Yong and Zuo Xiao exchanged a look, and then nodded slowly.

Meanwhile, Jin Zhihui, Zhou Gaoyang, Fu Tian, and Yin Yuanxiang did not have an opinion. They neither agreed nor objected, looking completely like “you can all go crazy on your own, and I will just take care of myself”.

Seeing that none of the guests objected to steering back into the Black Fog, Yang Tiecheng humphed, and said, “Fine, then we’ll go back into the Black Fog.” He was also feeling frustrated. Someone had actually dared to commit murder right in front of his eyes!! He would definitely find this person at all cost.

The ship slowly turned around, and steered towards the fog.

No one spoke any further, just as if they were all preparing to make their move. Very soon, the fog enveloped them. The sun’s light gradually disappeared, and it finally became complete darkness.

It was in that one instant that banging sounds rang out. Battle had erupted.

“En!”

“Ah!”

“Yi!”

Endless grunts were heard. Someone bounced out and crashed into the ship’s hold, and someone suffered a few punches and palm strikes, releasing pained grunts. Someone had even been slashed with a sword, his blood streaming, and the warm liquid covering the faces of others.

So what if elites like them could not see? They had long since had a clear grasp of the environment on the ship’s deck, and like a blind man that had lived in a house for a considerable number of years, they were very familiar with their surroundings.

They all thought that they had clearly targeted Ling Han, and fought with wild abandon.
