3248 Gu Xiangming
Feng Ruoxian hurriedly said that she didn’t dare to not consider him her uncle. She bowed to Yu Yi and said, “Ruoxian pays respects to Uncle Yu.”

“Sigh, I heard about your father.” Yu Yi sighed. “For the sake of the people in the city, Brother Zisheng has generously sacrificed his life. He should be a role model for us.”

Feng Ruoxian thanked him, but in her heart, she naturally hoped that her father was still alive. How could being recognized as a martyr and regarded as a pillar of the country be more useful than a living person?

“Come, this is Captain Gu from the Imperial Capital.” Yu Yi changed the topic and pointed to a young man beside him. “Captain Gu is here to escort Ruoxian back to the Imperial Capital.”

“Your humble servant, Gu Xiangming, pays his respects to Miss Ruoxian!” The young man cupped his hands and bowed slightly to Feng Ruoxian.

He was wearing a set of silver armor and looked quite handsome.

“Captain Yu.” Feng Ruoxian also returned the greeting gracefully. With Feng Zisheng’s passing, she had also turned from the Young Mistress of a feudal official’s family into an orphan. Naturally, she couldn’t put on airs.

Gu Xiangming didn’t dare to be negligent. He heard that several princes were interested in this beauty. It was just that Feng Zisheng had been wavering, wanting to marry Feng Ruoxian to the one most likely to inherit the throne. Otherwise, this woman would have long become a princess consort.

Moreover, Feng Zisheng had sacrificed his life for the country. When His Majesty came out of seclusion in the future, he would definitely praise him greatly. If he dared to be rude to Feng Ruoxian, he would have to suffer.

Yu Yi stayed behind and said a bunch of polite words, along the lines of if Feng Ruoxian had any difficulties, there was no need to be polite with him, and to just let him know.

After a while, he said that he still had official city matters to deal with and bade farewell.

“Miss Ruoxian, let’s return to the capital as soon as possible,” Gu Xiangming suggested. “With such a huge incident happening in Huju City, General Hengtian has already personally led an army to quell the beast riot. Furthermore, Lord Chairman has instructed me to escort Ruoxian back to the capital safely as soon as possible.”

Feng Ruoxian nodded and said, “Sorry to trouble you, Captain Gu.”

“It’s my duty.” Gu Xiang was obviously very humble. Actually, he was a captain in the Imperial Guards. Although his rank was not high, he was a close official of the emperor, which placed him at a rank higher than other officials of the same rank.

Moreover, he was still a Third Change Blood Transformation Tier, but he was only 23 years old this year. It could be said that he had achieved success at a young age, and was even more arrogant due to the fact.

Firstly, he saw that Feng Ruoxian was a beauty. Secondly, the other party’s identity was special. That was why he was so polite.

“Please wait for Ruoxian to get ready,” Feng Ruoxian said again.

Gu Xiangming nodded and sat down at the side.

Feng Ruoxian entered the house. She would definitely bring Butler Mu with her to the Imperial Capital. Not to mention anything else, an Extreme Bone Tier elite would at least allow her to barely gain a foothold in the Imperial Capital. She wouldn’t have to worry about being wronged and having nowhere to voice her complaints.

Ling Han was unperturbed. He had been thinking about how to break through to the Blood Transformation Tier, but he seemed to suddenly be stuck. It had already been a month, and he still hadn’t made any progress.

However, right now, he was actually communicating with the empress and the others in the dimension within his body, though he could only give them a soft brush as a gesture to indicate disagreement and brush twice to indicate agreement.

Meanwhile, Huan Xue was holding the little pink pig and stood behind Ling Han, dutifully doing what a little maid should do.

As for Sun Jianfang, he had gone out shopping, saying that he wanted to take a look around.

Gu Xiangming swept his gaze over, and saw Ling Han sitting steadily like a mountain. Ling Han showed absolutely no intention of greeting him at all, and a hint of displeasure appeared on his face.

He was the captain of the Imperial Guards, and a young elite of the Third Change Blood Transformation Tier. You actually dare to put on airs in front of me?

“You really don’t know the rules!” he said coldly. “You don’t even know that you should serve tea when you have a guest?”

His face was filled with arrogance, as if there was nothing more he wanted than to raise his head so high that his nose was pointing at the sky.

This was his true colours.

Huan Xue was a little worried. She had heard the previous conversation. This young man seemed to be from the capital and had a powerful background.

She immediately wanted to put down the lecherous pig and go make tea for Gu Xiangming, but before she could move, she saw Ling Han suddenly open his eyes.

“And who are you?” Ling Han asked, staring coldly at him.

Gu Xiangming immediately stood up. This small fry actually dared to speak rudely to him?

“How dare you humiliate me?” he said balefully.

“Heh, you want to order my maid around right from the start, where did you get that courage from?” Ling Han retorted.

Gu Xiangming snorted and said, “Oh, she can’t be ordered around?”

Ling Han ignored him, treating him as if he didn’t exist.


Gu Xiangming was infuriated by such indifference. Who would dare to show him any disrespect?

There were some, but it was definitely not a nameless person from a small border town!

“I don’t believe it!” Gu Xiangming looked at Ling Han, and said, “I want you to personally serve me tea!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “You’re quite good at dreaming!”

“You’re not going to?” Gu Xiangming sneered. “I’ll make you do it ‘willingly’!”

He stared at Ling Han, and his blood and Qi surged out, transforming into a white tiger. His murderous aura was revealed, and he let out a silent roar at Ling Han.

A major characteristic of the Blood Transformation Tier was that the blood and Qi was too powerful and too terrifying, and could form an oppressive pressure. It was a bit like a spiritual attack, but still different.

Ling Han was unafraid. He had Middle Level Spiritual power, so a barrage of murderous aura like this was completely no big deal for him.

However, he was not the kind of person who was willing to suffer losses. He immediately activated his Spiritual Power and counterattacked.

There was no such thing as distance in terms of Spiritual power. This attack arrived as soon as it was said and ruthlessly collided with the white tiger.

Boom, the white tiger immediately dissipated. The murderous aura of a Third Change could not match Middle Level Spiritual power. After all, this could only be said to be the embryonic form of a spiritual attack and could not be considered true Spiritual Power.

“Oh!” Gu Xiangming couldn’t help but cover his head. The impact of Spiritual Power gave him a splitting headache.

In terms of power, even if Middle Level Spiritual Power could only lift a few books at most, but how fragile was a human’s brain?Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The skull could be incomparably hard, but could the brain be?

After being hit by the Spiritual Power, his head felt like it was about to explode.

“Humph, so you’re a cultivator of Spiritual power. No wonder you’re so arrogant!” Gu Xiangming’s right hand shook, and a white light flashed around his wrist. This blocked Ling Han’s spiritual attack.

Hmm, this should be a Spirit Tool.

Gu Xiangming snorted again and said, “Cultivators of Spiritual Power indeed have the right to be arrogant. They can become alchemists or Formation Masters, but! You have only attained Elementary Level Spiritual Power at most. In front of me, you’re still trash.”

Ling Han was astounded. ‘You’re a guy who doesn’t understand Spiritual Power at all, and you don’t even know what level his Spiritual Power is, yet you actually dare to talk nonsense?’

Where did this courage come from? Where did this sense of superiority come from?

Gu Xiangming strode towards Ling Han. He had already used a Spirit Tool to block Ling Han’s spiritual attack. As far as he knew, cultivators of Spiritual Power all had extremely low martial prowess, and he could suppress them just by stretching out his hand.

But at this moment, the bedroom door opened and Feng Ruoxian and Butler Mu walked out.

Gu Xiangming frowned slightly but stopped in his tracks.
