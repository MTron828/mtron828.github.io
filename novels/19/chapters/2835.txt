2836 Outmatched

Why were there so many Heavenly Venerates in Ling City?

Very coincidentally, the Rain Emperor, Ji Wuming, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and other elites had just ended their adventures, and happened to return just the day before.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! One after another, figures shot out from within the city, standing proudly in midair.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, Ji Wuming, the Rain Emperor, Huo Furong, the large black dog… as well as the Empress, all of them either First Tier or Second Tier Heavenly Venerates. The one with the highest cultivation level among them was the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, who was already a Third Tier. After all, he was nurtured from the heaven and earth, and he had already surpassed everyone by nature.

“Bunch of pushovers.” Rong Yang was completely unconcerned. He was a Fourth Tier, and if he went all out, then even if these people joined forces, they would still be no match for him.

“Did you hear me? Scram!” the Empress shouted lightly.

Rong Yang glanced at her, and his eyes involuntarily lit up. The Empress’s grace and beauty was too captivating, and even he couldn’t help but feel his heart move. However, he was a Fourth Tier, after all, so how could he so easily become enraptured by beauty?

“Lord Rong, this is the murderer who killed Rong Xinkuan,” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate said in a timely manner.

Rong Yang nodded, and showed a hint of surprise. Though he had long since guessed it, he had not imagined that the Empress would actually be so beautiful and graceful. His expression became menacing. “You are quite bold to dare to kill even a member of our Rong Clan!”

“So what if I killed him? Why are you spouting so much nonsense? If you continue to be chatty, I will slaughter you as well!” the Empress declared impatiently. She could not be bothered to say that it was Rong Xinkuan who had taken the initiative to kill a member of the Ling Clan first.

What did it matter? If she wanted to kill him, then she would.

“How brazen!” Rong Yang shook his head. It was this woman who had committed the crime, and now she was actually still so arrogant even after seeing him. Did she think that she was a supreme elite of the Seventh Tier?

He stood in the skies, looking down on all of them. “You, bind yourself, then head to our Rong Clan for discipline. Then, ask Ling Han to come out, and surrender the Heavenly Venerable Seal, and this matter… I can also let this go.”

This was the territory of the Lin Clan, after all, and he was not a self-centered guy like Rong Xinkuan, either. Hence, he left a bit of allowance, and did not want to do something like massacring the entire city.

“Scram!” The Empress sent out a palm strike, the force turning into a jade-like giant palm that covered the heaven and earth.

“How dare you!!” Rong Yang was really outraged. A mere Second Tier; so what if she possessed Third-Tier battle prowess? In front of a Fourth Tier, she should still be utterly respectful.

He moved as well, moving to suppress the Empress.

When a Fourth Tier moved, how could Third-Tier battle prowess match it?

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, Ji Wuming, and the others all moved, joining forces with the Empress against Rong Yang.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

All the Heavenly Venerates were battling fiercely in the skies, blasting the heaven and earth till it turned pale, stretches of space collapsing one after another.

However, even if the Empress and the others had an advantage in numbers, faced with absolute power, they were still outmatched and suppressed by Rong Yang single-handedly. Every single one of them was in dire straits.

They had already gone all out, using Heavenly Venerable Seals, precious tools, and secret techniques one after another, but faced with Rong Yang’s invincible power, they could only continuously sustain heavy injuries.

Including the Empress, all of them were covered with injuries. They were only still standing with mere force of will, and that was the only reason why they had not collapsed.

However, no matter how strong the willpower, it could not last. There would eventually come a time when willpower was no longer enough.

“You all have angered me!!” Rong Yang declared menacingly. Faced with a Fourth Tier elite, these people actually did not have the slightest bit of respect, which caused killing intent to grow within him.

“Die!” He sent out a palm strike. Pa! Yi was instantly sent flying, a mist of blood spraying out from all over his body as he directly dropped out of the skies.

This was because the Empress and the others had joined forces to block a portion of the power. Otherwise, how could a First Tier survive the attack of a Fourth Tier?

“Next!” Rong Yang set his eyes on Ji Wuming. He did not care that his attack had not killed Yi. What he wanted was to crush all of them.

Peng! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

No one could stop it, and Ji Wuming was also sent flying, one of his arms directly ripped off with the powerful force.

It was like Rong Yang was a demonic god. He was so powerful that every move possessed invincible might, beating the Empress, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the others to the point of severe damage and injury.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel hopeless. The gap in strength was too wide. This was not something that mere numbers could make up for.

…If they wanted to use numbers to compensate for this gap, their numbers would have to be multiplied by another tenfold, at least. The higher the cultivation level, the wider the gap in strength would be among Heavenly Venerates. Having mastered one additional or one less fundamental power of the Genesis World would really indicate much too great a gap.

Where was the Lin Clan? Could it be that they were just sitting by and watching Rong Yang wreak havoc?

In the distance.

“Father, are you really not planning to interfere?” Lin Piaoxue asked.

Lin Xiaoyang smiled. “There is no need for me to interfere.”

“But—”

“Don’t worry. I can already sense it; that brat is about to come out of seclusion,” Lin Xiaoyang interrupted what his daughter had been about to say. “Furthermore, it will also be beneficial for these people to experience a life-threatening danger.”

Lin Piaoxue nodded. She naturally trusted her father’s judgment. If he said that Ling Han was about to come out of seclusion, it was definite that Ling Han would soon be coming out of seclusion.

***

After going through as long as 20 billion years of harsh cultivation, Ling Han had finally pushed his cultivation level to peak-stage First Tier. He was now qualified to attempt breaking through to the Second Tier.

“This is still First Tier. From Second Tier onwards, not only do I have to cultivate the six fundamental powers, I also have to continue improving my Powers of Dimension. There is no doubt that my speed will be even more slowed down.”

Ling Han sighed, but he set this matter aside soon afterwards.

Even if he was slow, how could it be that he would choose not to break through?

To other Heavenly Venerates, the difficulty of advancing from the First Tier to Second Tier was actually more or less the same level of difficulty as a Ninth Heaven advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. It was all beginning from zero, and was extremely difficult, but for Ling Han, this was indeed a small matter.

It was because he had long since been able to sense Void Particles, and used Void Particle Energy to temper his physique, which allowed him to become incredibly freakish even just as a Celestial King.

Now, all he had to do was extract Void Particle Energy again, and convert it for his own use. He could also directly draw upon it for his use.

Weng! His consciousness spread out in the heaven and earth, and instantly got hold of countless Void Particles.

The higher his cultivation level was, the stronger his divine sense would naturally be, and also the wider the heaven and earth he could come into contact with. It was just like his divine sense was a net. The wider the net was stretched, the more fish would be naturally captured—Void Particles were these fishes.

Come on, come on.

Weng! Ling Han’s figure trembled. His consciousness had actually split, and a portion had entered into an unknown space.

He immediately realized that this was the Void!

...

Boom!

The Void was extremely violent; this was because there was no substance here, and the only thing here was… the six great fundamental powers!

The six fundamental powers of Void Particles, Constant Particles, Mesotron Particles, Receive Particles, Rainbow Particles, and Quark Particles were all within, but Ling Han could only sense one of these at the moment.

What was going on here? He had clearly not sent his consciousness into the Void, so how did he suddenly end up in the Void?

Aside from being stunned, Ling Han also felt an inconceivable terror. This meant that he was unable to perfectly control himself, and great trouble would ensue.

All of a sudden, a sense of indescribable fear rose up inside his heart.

In the Void, a black chain suddenly lashed out at him, no, it was probably more accurate to call it a tentacle.

Hysteria!

Ling Han immediately came to his senses. But why was it so coincidental? His consciousness had just entered the Void, and Hysteria had already traced him?

There was absolutely no way he could match Hysteria, and he hurriedly withdrew his consciousness frantically.

Xiu! His consciousness retreated from the Void. Just a little bit more, and Hysteria’s tentacle would have touched him.
