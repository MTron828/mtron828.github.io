2799 Great turn of events

By now, the Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates on the sixth level were no longer enough to stop Hysteria’s army, and because of this, many Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates rushed as reinforcements to the sixth level. The war situation had already reached a boiling point.

On the side of the Flaming Frost Realm, more than 10 Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates had already died, and even one of the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates had perished. This was a massive loss.

This was very bad. Though they could still hold the fort now, if Hysteria’s army suddenly changed the direction of their assault one day, for example, to the seventh spatial level, then wouldn’t the defense lines there be conquered in an instant with so many Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates dispatched to the sixth level as reinforcements?

Even if they could eradicate all of Hysteria’s army, the defense line was still gone. There had never been any cases of reclaiming lost territory.

!!

How far would Hysteria push forwards then?

It was not that there had never been such incidents in history. Every time, this would be a headache for the side of the Flaming Frost Realm. Due to a moment of the slightest carelessness, they would have to pay the price of losing a massive stretch of territory.

This time… no one knew what the result would be.

Ling Han could not be of any help, either, so he could only focus on accompanying his wife, and wait patiently for the birth of his child.

Very quickly, 60,000,000 years had passed, and it was finally time for the Empress to give birth. Ling Han was circling around in anxiety, continuously pacing at the doorway.

This pregnancy had taken close to 100,000,000 years, so this child naturally would not be born in a single day. After taking a whole seven days, this little infant was finally willing to be birthed.

It was a girl. Though she had just been born, she already had exquisite features, resembling the Empress fully.

Ling Han cuddled his first daughter, and a smile involuntarily bloomed on his face.

Beautiful, this was his daughter.

The Rain Emperor and the others had all come upon hearing the news, and when they saw Ling Han holding the newly born child in his arms, they all expressed their congratulations.

“What a pretty little girl. Why don’t I play matchmaker and betroth her to Zhou Heng’s grandson,” the black donkey said, stretching his head to take a look.

Ling Han almost sent out his foot in a kick. His daughter had just been born, and you were already having ideas about her?

She was not marrying. No way; no matter how outstanding the guy was, she was not going to marry.

Everyone delivered their first-meeting gifts. There were countless Celestial-King-Tier Great Herbs and Divine Metal, and Ling Han accepted it all without reservations.

“Brother Ling, this daughter of yours seems extremely extraordinary!” Ji Wuming said. His aura was becoming steadier and steadier; he was not far from breaking through to the Second Tier.

Ling Han chuckled, holding his daughter like a treasure, unwilling to let others even touch her. He was very clear. This precious daughter was already a First Heaven Celestial King upon birth, so how could she not be extraordinary?

It could not be helped. Both her parents were Heavenly Venerates, and they had both consolidated countless Powers of Dimensions. From the very moment of her birth, this kind of child would be gifted naturally, far surpassing the descendants of ordinary Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han had extracted the small world inside his body, and had fused the core of the dimension into his daughter’s body. As long as his daughter was within this small world, she would have the strength of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

How impressive!

Ling Han’s limelight was too strong. Even if it was not appropriate to hold any kind of celebratory events in the Realm Battlefield, there were still many, many people who paid him a visit upon hearing the news. Every single person brought valuable gifts.

There were gifts which Ling Han accepted, and some he did not. He naturally would not be accepting favors for nothing; that would depend on who the other party was.

And just at this time, a great event happened.

It really was a great event; no one had even expected it to happen.

Boom! The sky collapsed and the earth cracked as Power of Dimension surged out furiously, capable of destroying everything.

“Not good!” Ling Han’s expression immediately changed drastically. He had initially planned to check out the situation, yet now he did not have the slightest hesitation as he drew all the women into the Celestial Guest Residence, and then broke out in a run.

In the distance, a terrifying energy storm could be seen rumbling towards them, just like how when that small world between the Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm had exploded.

This was an energy storm that was created after the collision of two transcendent dimensions. It was assailing unstoppably. To say nothing of First Tier Heavenly Venerates, even Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates would not dare take it head-on, and could only retreat.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! One after another, figures appeared all around Ling Han, joining the ranks of the mad race.

Thankfully, though the energy storm was terrifying, it was still unable to keep up with the speed of Heavenly Venerates.

In a single stroke, they had run for millions of kilometers, and only then did everyone finally stop.

They presently had already retreated completely from the Realm Battlefield.

What in the world was going on?

Before they could go and find out what was going on, they saw even more people break through space and appear, yet they were not the Heavenly Venerates of the second level, but rather consisted of elites from every level.

The Second Tier, Third Tier, Fourth Tier, Fifth Tier, and Sixth Tier, all the elites had retreated from the Realm Battlefield—except for Seventh Tiers.

Everyone was even more curious. What on earth had happened?

Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and Lin Xiaoyang were all present. Aside from them, there were a number of Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates as well. Everyone was looking towards them for guidance as they became the center of the crowds, exuding a domineering aura capable of suppressing everything else. There was no one who was allowed to be disrespectful.

Ling Han counted, and there were more than 200 Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, close to 300 of them. On average, that would mean that every high-level dimension would have around two to three each.

The Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates were all frowning slightly. Very soon, they looked like they were listening in on something, and they showed a hint of surprise not long afterwards.

Lin Xiaoyang said, “I have just received a message through divine sense from the lords at the eighth spatial level. They said that an intense battle has caused turbulence and a collision of the two dimensions. Now, this has formed an energy storm. Aside from Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, no one can stand here.”

Everyone nodded; so that was what had happened.

Hold on?

Realization suddenly dawned on everyone. As the energy storm wreaked havoc, only Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were actually capable of standing guard. Then wouldn’t that mean…

“Correct.” Chu Hao nodded. “The energy storm this time is extremely violent. It is possible… that it will never disappear. This means that we do not have any mission for the moment, nor do we need to continue fighting here. We are completely capable of going wherever we wish.”

‘This…!’

Though everyone had already thought of this, when this information was really confirmed, they still could not grow accustomed to this.

In these countless years, they had been fighting and growing here. They had long since considered this place as their home, and now, all of a sudden, someone came and told them their home was gone, and there was no need for them to stand guard here any longer. They felt a blankness that came from not knowing what to do.

But it was only for an instant. A great many people had already thought of what they were going to do.

…Return to their respective realms, and become the sole overlord.

Zhou Heng spoke, “Everyone, you can go wherever you wish. If there are any signs that the energy storm is going to disappear, we will inform you individually, and you shall return to battle.”

Everyone nodded.

...

However, after fighting for so long, how could they simply disperse at a mere word? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

No one left at the first instant, but rather planned to wait and see.

Meanwhile, Ling Han found a chance to seek an audience with Zhou Heng. Coincidentally, Lin Xiaoyang and Chu Hao were also present, so they met with Ling Han together.

“Brat, you are quite good,” Chu Hao said smilingly. Originally, he had been sure that Ling Han could only give up on his initial plans, and take the route of an ordinary Heavenly Venerate. He had not thought that Ling Han would have given him such a pleasant surprise.

“Thank you, Senior,” Ling Han bowed slightly. “Dare I ask, Seniors, what are your opinions on this event?”

“Are you suspecting that this is Hysteria’s conspiracy?” Zhou Heng voiced out Ling Han’s suspicions. He pondered for a while. “It is not like this kind of thing has never happened before in our extensive history, but the energy storm has never been as intense as this.”

“I can confirm that this is definitely not false… The Seventh Tier lords have also confirmed this fact.”
