Chapter 3614: Killing move

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, though these two rocks would automatically pursue their target, the impact was not all that strong. Ling Han’s whole body shook, and he felt as if he was about to spit out a mouthful of blood, but that was the extent of it.

The cultivation of his physique was really too tough. It could be claimed that he was invincible in Mystery Realm Tier, and the battle prowess here was limited to Mystery Realm Tier, so it only made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

Who was attacking him?

Ling Han was furious. He didn’t mind sparring with others as long as there was enough essence of water, but now someone actually sneak attacked him?

Damn it!

He wanted to push aside the rocks and search for the culprit, but these two rocks… were actually magnets that were stuck tightly together.

This was definitely no ordinary magnet. The magnetism was astonishingly strong, and he actually couldn’t push the rocks aside.

Peng, the rocks fell, and smashed into the ice.

Theoretically speaking, this block of ice should have been extremely sturdy and couldn’t have been shattered. However, the magnets interacted with each other, creating a powerful heat energy that rapidly melted the ice.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Multiple figures flew over.

“Hahaha, Ling Han, you didn’t expect this, did you?” There were a total of seven people, and they all smirked coldly.

“You killed a prized son of our Lei Clan, and think you can go unpunished?”

“Even if you hide here, we can still apprehend you!”

Ling Han’s heart clenched. As it turned out, it was again members of the Lei Clan and the Pang Clan. He smirked coldly, “As a dignified force of Core Formation Tier, you actually only know how to use such underhanded tricks?”

“Don’t waste your breath on him. Hurry up and capture him. Otherwise, he’ll sink,” someone urged.

“All right!” Someone walked over, wanting to grab the magnets.

Ling Han definitely couldn’t allow him to succeed. Otherwise, once he left Cold Water Lake, he would definitely die.

Weng, he activated the barrage of murderous aura and spat out a golden sword that slashed towards that person.

That person was completely unprepared. Ling Han was already trapped between two magnets, so how could he still have the spare energy to attack him?

Under the barrage of the murderous aura, his expression faltered. Then, he was sliced by the golden sword, and his vitality was directly destroyed.

A dignified Foundation Building elite was killed just like that.

The others were all taken aback. They had not thought that Ling Han would still be able to insta-kill an elite of Foundation Building Tier in such a situation. This was practically as easy as slicing weeds.

Peng, the magnets melted the ice, and instantly fell into the water, bringing Ling Han down rapidly.

No one dared to approach. With a precedent, who would dare to court death?

Thus, the six of them could only watch helplessly as Ling Han sank into the water.

After a long while, they finally came to their senses, and their faces were slightly flushed.

They actually didn’t dare to make a move against a minor character in Mystery Realm Tier?

This was too humiliating!

“However, since this brat has sunk to the bottom of the lake, he’s definitely going to die,” someone said sheepishly.

“En.” The others all nodded in agreement.

“That is a Green Red Magnet that has been dyed with the blood of elites. It is not something that that brat can break free from at all.”

“Thus, he would either freeze to death, suffocate to death, or be crushed to death when he is finally exhausted. There is definitely no fourth possibility.”

“Just to be safe, we had best go down and take a look.”

“All right.”

The six of them went into the water one after another, wrapping themselves in flame energy to resist the coldness. They sped up, and soon caught up to the two magnets that were almost joined together. They could very clearly see that they were presently sinking rapidly with Ling Han in tow.

But after only a while, they did not follow any further. That was because they had already dived very deep into the water, and the water pressure was becoming more and more terrifying. If they continued to dive in, their bodies would be crushed by the pressure.

It couldn’t be helped. In this place, they could only unleash the full strength of Mystery Realm Tier.

Thus, they all stopped, and watched as Ling Han and the two magnets sank deeper and deeper, right until they disappeared into the darkness.

They began to float up, leaping out of the water one after another, and stood on the floating ice.

“He’s dead for sure.” The six of them nodded. This time, there was no longer any possibility for Ling Han to survive.

Inside the lake. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ling Han was thinking of countermeasures. The suction force of these two magnets was really too terrifying. He couldn’t struggle free at all, and he was also unable to enter into the Essence Nurturing Gourd. He really couldn’t advance or retreat.

Not only that, but he also needed to resist the crushing power of the magnets, and communicate with the energy of flames. Otherwise, he would freeze to death before he could even be crushed to death.

More importantly, this was also the bottom of the lake. If he didn’t have any air, one hour would be his limit.

Could it be that he could only choose between being crushed to death, freezing to death, or suffocating to death?

The magnets continued to sink. Thoughts streaked through Ling Han’s mind. He had to escape as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would have to face an even more serious problem — the water pressure.

Destructive Energy!

This was the only solution that Ling Han could think of.

He definitely had to succeed.

Because his Spiritual Power was limited, he dispersed the flame energy, then channeled Destruction Energy. Instantly, his hands and feet were entwined with black-colored energy. Under the powerful destructive power, his shoes instantly turned into nothing.

Ling Han pressed his hands into the magnets, but to his disappointment, there was actually no change to the magnets at all.

It was ineffective?

No, it was possible that the material of the magnet itself was more shocking, so it was not something that could be destroyed in a few moves.

He could not give up.

Ling Han channeled the Destructive Energy continuously. Now, he could only take a gamble. If he didn’t shatter the magnets, he wouldn’t be able to escape death.

The magnets sank rapidly. This thing was abnormally heavy, and sank very, very quickly.

The water pressure approached madly, and Ling Han felt as if every part of his body was being crushed. His skin instantly shattered, and blood seeped out, leaving behind a long line of blood that streaked straight towards the bottom of the lake.

Thankfully, Ling Han had cultivated to the true pinnacle of each cultivation level. His physique was incredibly tough, and he could withstand the pressure when it reached his bones.

He was still sinking, blood seeping from his eyes, nose, and ears.

Right at this moment, he discovered that there was a slight movement of his arms and legs.

Part of the magnet… had been destroyed.

Ling Han’s spirit was greatly energized, and he hurriedly continued to work hard.

Water pressure, compression, and extreme coldness. Ling Han had to face three major problems at the same time. If it was another person, any one of these problems would be fatal, but he managed to withstand them.

Seventh Change allowed his Qi and blood to be extremely vigorous, and there was definitely no problem for him to resist the ice for a short period of time.

Sinking, sinking, sinking. Shattering, shattering, shattering.

Ling Han was competing with time. If he really went too deep into the water, it was possible that he wouldn’t even have the strength to swim upwards.

His range of movement became larger and larger, and the water pressure also became more and more terrifying. All of a sudden, Ling Han felt his body tremble, and then he collapsed at an angle.

He had reached the bottom of the lake.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. It was too dark here, and he wouldn’t be able to see anything without activating his eye technique. However, after stepping into the mud, he naturally came to his senses.

The water pressure here was too terrifying. Ling Han felt as if even his bones were trembling, and even after Seventh Change, his blood and Qi was close to being unable to maintain his vitality. His vitality was rapidly declining.

Ling Han still didn’t give up. For someone like him, even if he was about to take his last breath, he would definitely be resisting.

Destructive Energy rolled out, and Ling Han released a soundless roar as he made his final attempt.

Crack! A crisp sound was heard from the magnet..
