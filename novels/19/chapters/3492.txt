Chapter 3493: One Inscription

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Some people were extremely fortunate, and different from the norm, when forming the inscriptions, far surpassed normal people.

This kind of inscribed pattern was called a special inscrription.

Ordinarily, when 10,000 Extreme Bone Tiers broke through, only one of them would receive a special inscrription, at most. Moreover, only one special inscrription would form, and the rest would be slightly changed on the basis of the first inscribed pattern.

Thus, the first inscription was extremely important.

However, there was no way to choose the inscribed patterns, and they were naturally formed. Some deduced that this was related to the natural talent of cultivators. The higher one’s natural talent, the more likely it was to form a special inscrription.

However, there were also exceptions. Some people had clearly broken through from Fifth Extreme, yet had formed a special inscrription.

Ling Han was very expectant. Would the inscribed patterns that he had formed be special?

Though this would only have a slight effect on his battle prowess, and could not possibly change his battle prowess in essence, he still wanted to obtain a special inscrription. Even if it could only increase his battle prowess by a tiny bit, that was good enough.

This stage required inscribing an inscribed pattern on the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. Generally speaking, one would choose to place the first inscription on the heart.

One’s spirit was contained in the heart, and it was the ruling organ. It was the basis of one’s life, and its effects were the greatest.

If his heart exploded, he would definitely be done for.

Thus, 99% of people would place the first inscription on their hearts.

Ling Han was no exception either. His heart was beating strongly, and with every beat, large amounts of blood would spurt out, transmitting the energy to various parts of his body, and as one after another, inscriptions formed, the beating of his heart became even more majestic.

What depressed Ling Han was the fact that though multiple golden veined patterns covered his heart densely, in truth, they all overlapped. No matter how many veined patterns were added, the inscribed patterns themselves did not change much.

It was just a simple “one”.

F***, if it looked like this, to say nothing of special inscrription, it couldn’t even be considered a normal inscribed pattern.

Heavens, why didn’t you add an extra stroke, and become a “two”?

No matter how he looked at it, this was the pinnacle of perfection.

However, no matter how Ling Han thought about it, this inscribed pattern didn’t change at all. Multiple streaks of light were embedded into it, only making the word even deeper.

Hong long long, his level of being was also undergoing a drastic change. One after another, the shackles were shattered, just like thunder claps, and Ling Han was also continuously nibbling on the Treasured Fruit of Life. After all, it was the breach of a major tier, so the amount of life energy needed was astonishing.

Just as he had expected, even breaking through to the next major tier was still inferior to the expenditure of breaking through to the Seventh Extreme. Ling Han only ate seven Treasured Fruits of Life, and they were all Enlightenment Tier-level at that, and his breakthrough this time was eased.

Once this eased up, it meant that it was not far from the end.

Sure enough, after another half an hour, peace returned to Ling Han’s body.

Ling Han looked inside himself, and his expression involuntarily became extremely strange.

His inscription was still an incredibly simple “one”.

Other people’s inscribed patterns were extremely complex, and couldn’t be seen clearly at all. There were at least tens of thousands of veined patterns, but Ling Han’s?

Firstly, it was as simple as could be.

Sigh.

Ling Han sighed. Actually, the veined patterns he had inscribed were at least a million strokes, but they had all overlapped together. What could be done?

He stood up. In any case, he was an Inscription Tier elite, and now, he could truly sweep aside all Enlightenment Tier elites.

Setting down this inscribed pattern that made him depressed, Ling Han decided to test out his current battle prowess. Though he knew that it would definitely be very strong, he had to know where his limits were, and when he attacked, he would also have to be careful.

“Father!” The toddlers all pounced over. Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and spread open his arms so that the toddlers could hang onto him.

“Yi, Father, your inscribed patterns are so strange!” Second Baby stared at Ling Han for a while before saying.

The little girl could see his inscribed patterns.

Ling Han sighed, and asked, “How strange?”

“Father, do you know how normal and special inscribed patterns are divided?” Second Baby asked.

Ling Han shook his head. He didn’t have a teacher, so what was the point of giving him guidance? He only knew what he had to do.

Eldest Baby interrupted, and said, “Actually, this is very simple. It depends on the structure of the inscribed patterns. The more strokes there are, the greater the power.”

“Father’s inscription is a horizontal line,” Second Baby said.

“Ah!” All the children were startled. This, this, this, this, these inscriptions were a little too weak, weren’t they?

This was practically too weak.

“This is returning to one’s true self!” Third Baby said with absolute certainty.

She had always had the most confidence in Ling Han.

Ling Han was startled. The might of the inscribed patterns was based on the number of veined patterns they formed? Then this “one” of his had overlapped a million patterns, but they were all piled together, so it looked as if there was only a single pattern.

Then, was his inscribed pattern stronger or weaker?

Peng!

There was a loud bang, and Ling Han didn’t even need to look to know that the door must have been broken open again.

This was a door that was plagued with calamity. Who had it trifled with? Just how many times had it been broken?

Ling Han put down the children and walked towards the main doors, while the other children followed behind him.

After arriving at the courtyard, he could see a dozen over young men and women standing outside. Ling Han had seen most of them before-he had robbed them once, so he was naturally familiar with them.

Ling Han, do you think that just because there is a formation here that can weaken the cultivation level of elites, you can rest easy?” Bai Hongcai spoke up, his expression filled with disdain. As long as there was no suppression of cultivation level, it would be child’s play for him to suppress an Extreme Bone Tier.

Ling Han smiled and said, “You’ve forgotten the pain after healing your scars?” “You-” Bai Hongcai’s face instantly flushed red. Being defeated with a single punch from Ling Han was really a great humiliation to him. Even if this was because his cultivation level had been suppressed, outsiders would only say that he, an Enlightenment Tier, was inferior to even an Extreme Bone Tier.

“You want revenge?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“That’s right!” Bai Hongcai declared proudly, and strode into the main doors.

’You’re that confident?’

Ling Han activated the formation, but a silver light blossomed from Bai Hongcai’s body. It was like a protective shield, expelling the might of the formation.

“Haha, this is a Spirit Talisman personally forged by Lord Fei, so how could it be suppressed by the formation you laid out?” Bai Hongcai sneered, “Ling Han, how dare you! Today, I will let you know what’s good for you!”

He strode over. Boom, the aura of an Enlightenment Tier elite surged out, incredibly overbearing.

This time, not only were there Wang Yu and his group outside, but there were also a great many people from the Imperial Capital. It seemed like they had received the news beforehand.

Clearly, this time, it was not just the actions of Wang Yu and the others. It was very possible that he had gained the support of Fei Yongsi. What was his motive? This was a move against Chen Fengyan, to see how the latter would respond.

Everyone in the Imperial Capital knew that Ling Han was greatly favoured by the present Holy Emperor. In fact, Ling Han had even surpassed his sons. If Ling Han was humiliated, and Chen Fengyan still did not react, that would prove that he was ill at ease, and did not dare to oppose a Cauldron Forging Tier.

However, the appearance of juniors like Wang Yu left a path of retreat for Fei Yongsi. Previously, the formation spirit had spoken on behalf of Chen Fengyan, telling Celestial Path elites to abide by the rules. Thus, even if Chen Fengyan’s strength was inconceivably strong, they still had reason to deflect the blame.

Seeing that Bai Hongcai was unafraid of the formation’s suppression, the people outside all looked worried..
