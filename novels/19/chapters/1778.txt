Chapter 1779: Fu Tonghai

Ling Han looked at Fu Tonghai again.

If he was being honest, this man indeed had a very strong personal charisma—only then would he be able to easily gather the hearts of others. If Ling Han was not a man that was determined to become the strongest in this world, there really might be a possibility that he would be moved, and follow this man and answer his every beck and call, serving him faithfully.

However, his aspirations were higher than the heavens, so how could he possibly become someone else’s follower?

Even in the case of Fu Gaoyun, his relation with Ling Han was only that of friends, and not the relation between a superior and subordinate.

But who would believe that?

Someone in a superior position had no need for friends. Even if they treated someone very well for the sake of winning their loyalty, at the essence, that was still treating the latter as a subordinate, and not as someone who was their equal.

Fu Tonghai could not see through this. Thus, he wished to recruit Ling Han at all costs, yet did not know that this could not possibly succeed, and would only cause dislike to sprout in Ling Han’s heart.

Ling Han smiled calmly. “I am a man with no great ambitions, and only wish to spend my life peacefully. I am afraid I can only disappoint Brother Hai’s expectations.”

‘Utter crap!

‘What were your words to Liu Huaiyu? Weren’t you planning to become a Celestial King? And now you’ve become a man with no great ambitions? Whom are you trying to deceive!’

Fu Tonghai’s expression involuntarily darkened. Faced with such a stubborn guy like Ling Han, he also felt weary. But Ling Han was too crucial, and directly influenced the inclinations of two great alchemists!

If he could not manage to get Ling Han over to his side, then it might really be impossible to stop Fu Gaoyun from ascending to the position of the patriarch.

It definitely couldn’t happen!

He tried persuading him again, promised rich rewards, and even used Liu Huaiyu as his bargaining chip. As long as Ling Han nodded, he could consider gifting such an enchanting, seductive beauty to Ling Han as his concubine.

Ling Han’s heart involuntarily became filled with disdain. Being able to treat a woman, especially a subordinate that had admired him so long, as a good to be gifted to others meant this person’s nature was truly cold.

In Fu Tonghai’s eyes, there was nothing that was as important as the position of the patriarch. For the sake of rising to this position, there was nothing he could not sacrifice or give up. That was because he could get anything that he had given up 1,000 or 10,000 times back in future.

Now, Fu Tonghai could give Liu Huaiyu to him, and in future, he could aso take her back. In fact, if he had other daughters, wives, or the sort, he could take them as well because he could already get rid of him when he was no longer useful.

Originally, Ling Han had no intention to have any kind of relations with him, and now his heart was filled with dislike for him. He calmly stated, “I am a little tired, please return.”

Fu Tonghai’s expression became incredibly dark in a flash. He had never been dismissed like this straight to his face.

Usually, he would be the one who would be ending a conversation, waving a hand to dismiss others, but now it was he that was being dismissed by another in this manner?

It should be known that no matter how impressive you were, you were still just a dog of the Fu Clan!

This point was applicable to all the subordinate clans and subjects of the Fu Clan. Even great alchemists like Situ Tang and Xiang Yan were no exception. Though Fu Clan presently treated these two with incomparable respect, and even the lord patriarch had to carefully accompany them, the moment the essential profits of the Fu Clan were involved, they would definitely give them up without the slightest hesitation.

‘I’ve just given you a few compliments, and you really think that you are someone important?’

Fu Tonghai smirked coldly inside his heart. This guy had to have been horribly spoilt by Fu Gaoyun. He really had no idea just how much Fu Gaoyun had sacrificed to be able to recruit this guy under his banner.

He immediately made his decision. He would definitely investigate Fu Gaoyun’s accounts. If he had sacrificed the benefits of the clan just for the sake of having Ling Han by his side, then he would report him. If it was serious, Fu Gaoyun’s status as heir would immediately be removed!

Additionally... he looked at Ling Han with a smile, and asked, “Brother Han, you are going to the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm as well, right?”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Correct.”

“I have been there before, so why don’t I tell you about it first, Brother Han? There are many dangers in this Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, and the slightest carelessness could lead to one losing his life. Thus, be careful, very careful!” He clapped a hand on Ling Han’s shoulder, seeming as if he was giving advice to Ling Han, when in truth, his words were filled with threat.

The Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm was too dangerous. Every time it opened, the number of people who died inside were uncountable. ‘You are but a mere second severance, so it would be a very normal thing for you to die inside.’

Ling Han chuckled. Since this guy was already planning to turn hostile, he did not want to bother to keep up appearances, either. He waved him off. “I have always been a fortunate man, so there is no need for you to worry about me.”

“Then, pray that you have good luck.” Fu Tonghai turned around to leave, his expression becoming incredibly cold and sinister in an instant. He had already decided that he would have his subordinates put all effort into hunting down Ling Han and killing him after they had entered into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

In any case, it was a Mystery Realm. As long as there were no eyewitnesses, who cared if there were a few deaths?

Furthermore, Bei Xuanming was on poor terms with this person as well. Previously, he had even wanted to make use of him to teach Ling Han a lesson. If they had entered into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, how could he keep himself from making a move on Ling Han with such a good chance in front of him?

There were too many elites in the Lunar Sect!

Though some of them had not become Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, their talent was extremely high, and they had cultivated for who knew how many hundreds of millions of years in the Severing Mundane Tier, hoping to be well-prepared. Anyways, there was no longer any limit to their lifespan after advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, and with how long the path of cultivation was, there was absolutely no need to compete to see who was faster or slower.

This kind of person was extremely frightening. It was possible that their battle prowess was a considerable number of times stronger than even that of the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters in the same cultivation level!

Fu Tonghai was sure that Bei Xuanming definitely had no lack of such elites that would follow alongside him into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm with his identity. Then, as long as he encountered Ling Han, the latter would definitely die without a doubt.

‘That’s right, there is also the Xiao Clan, and the Han Clan as well!’

Fu Tonghai suddenly recalled that Ling Han was really a troublemaker. He was only in the Severing Mundane Tier, but he had actually offended a great many two-star and three-star forces. The fact that he’d managed to continue living until today was practically a miracle.

‘However, the miracle will be ending now because this time I, Fu Tonghai, will be organizing everything!’ His killing intent soared. The fate of anyone who was not useful to him naturally was death. Who asked Ling Han to be too useful such that he directly affected the balance of power between the four great heirs?

‘Even if I don’t make a move, the other two probably wouldn’t be able to remain calm, either!’ A sliver of a cold smirk appeared at the corners of Fu Tonghai’s lips.

He was referring to Fu Xiuping and Fu Bingbing. How could these two people not be anxious as well?

They had to be anxious!

It was just that they should be aware that they could not compete with Fu Gaoyun, and thus simply chose not to recruit Ling Han at all. Wouldn’t it be even better to directly kill this guy in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm with a trap?

And that would end the matter once and for all!

‘Ling Han, Ling Han, if you still manage to escape this time around, I will take your surname!’ He turned his head and glanced at the manor behind him. Then, taking a step forwards with a flutter of his sleeve, he disappeared without a trace.

In the main hall, Ling Han was rubbing his chin, feeling slightly wronged.

Initially, he had not planned to do anything special when he had come to the Fu Clan. His main motive was merely to investigate the whereabouts of the Roc Palace. Why had so many things happened for no reason like this?

So strange.

“Don’t think about it. You are just a magnet for trouble. If nothing happened when you went somewhere, that would be truly strange indeed.” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden walked to his side, leaning against him.

Ling Han wrapped his wife in his arms, smelling the perfume in her hair, and asked, “How can anyone say that about her husband?”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden giggled. Being married to such a man, there was really no need to worry about the lack of color in one’s life. Life was always so exciting.

“I want it!” she said softly by Ling Han’s ear, her voice incredibly seductive.
