Chapter 1006: Pill Refinement

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Hahahaha! Brat, you finally couldn’t resist setting out to sea!” Jiang Anyun started to roar with laughter. In his eyes, that delicious and charming, seductive beauty would be his once Ling Han decided to set out to sea.

Ling Han completely ignored him. After all, Jiang Anyun was merely a clown.

“Seize him!” Jiang Anyun’s displeasure turned to anger when he saw Ling Han’s reaction. He was the young gang leader of the Black Five Gang!

“Impudence!” a burly man shouted. He was truly burly, and his height reached an astonishing three meters. His body bulged with jet-black muscles, and it looked as if he were forged from cold iron. The cold glint reflected by his skin was especially clear.

“Who are you? How dare you speak like that in front of me!!” Jiang Anyun was extremely annoyed. Was his status as the young gang leader of the Black Five Gang all for show? Why was everyone going against his wishes?

“Young Gang Leader...!” An elder hurriedly tugged at him, and whispered, “This is the Yang Clan’s Yang Tiecheng, an elite at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. It’s rumored that he practices a peculiar cultivation technique, causing his physique to become as strong as Godly metal. He’s extremely favored by the Yang Clan.”

Jiang Anyun’s temper instantly died down. He was indeed the young gang leader of the Black Five Gang, but how could the Black Five Gang compare to the Yang Clan?

“Don’t even think about causing troubles on my ship!” Yang Tiecheng swept his gaze over every single person on the ship. With his rich experience, how could he not notice that many of the passengers had set their eyes on the young man and woman?

“Once you disembark my ship, you can naturally settle all the differences between you. However, don’t blame me for being rough if you try to cause troubles on my ship!” Yang Tiecheng unleashed his powerful aura without reservation as he spoke.

“Brother Yang, is it? My hands are a little itchy, so why don’t we have a short spar?” Luo Yu stepped forward with a smile on his face.

“No problem!” Yang Tiecheng answered without hesitation.

If he didn’t display his prowess, who knew what troubles these passengers would cause?

Luo Yu took a few steps forward before pressing his hand toward Yang Tiecheng.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Yang Tiecheng also moved, and both of them used speed to fight speed. They exchanged over 10 blows in a fraction of a second.

Luo Yu suddenly gave a muffled groan as he retreated several steps. His face had already become frighteningly pale.

“Good fight,” Yang Tiecheng said calmly as he cupped his fists.

Luo Yu finally came to his senses after a short while, and hoarsely said, “Brother Yang is indeed strong. I’m not your opponent.”

It was especially evident how powerful Yang Tiecheng was after he exchanged a few strikes with Luo Yu. The people on the ship were all astonished, and no one dared to underestimate his power anymore.

Initially, the members of the Luo Clan had all felt superior as they had come from the Imperial Capital. They despised the local residents of this poor and rural area. However, Yang Tiecheng’s strength gave them a huge slap across the face.

“This person is most likely a two-star genius.”

“His cultivation level is at the peak stage of the consummate level, and he’s also a two-star genius. He’s probably the most powerful person on this ship.”

“It looks like we won’t be able to kill Ling Han on this ship.”

“We’ll wait!”

Their expressions didn’t change as they spoke, and they all wore radiant smiles as they reached a decision.

“I’ll repeat myself again,” Yang Tiecheng said in a threatening voice. “No matter who you are, don’t even think about targeting other passengers on my ship. If you dare to kill someone, I’ll also dare to kill you!”

“Humph!” Everyone remained silent, and only Jiang Anyun wore his displeasure on his face. From this, it could be seen just how foolish this young gang leader was. He had already reached the Mountain River Tier, yet he still didn’t have any astuteness at all.

He was already accustomed to acting as he pleased, so he was naturally extremely unhappy now that someone was suppressing him.

Yang Tiecheng entered his cabin to rest after delivering his warning.

This was going to be a very, very long trip.

Their ship would sail on a set route. It would anchor in a few renowned regions during this journey—they would stop for one to three days at each place, and then set off for the next region.

So, what exactly were those renowned regions?

These were areas where treasures could potentially be found.

When that star had crashed down, it had broken into several pieces. There were seven extremely large pieces, and they had each landed in a different region in the sea. Thus, people would normally venture to these seven regions when searching for treasures.

Ling Han gazed at the scenery for a while. An astonishing gravity field enveloped the entire Star Sea, and if cultivators tried to swim here, they would exhaust themselves and drown in no time. Of course, they could still recover their Origin Power when they reached the bottom, so they still had a chance to swim back up.

However, a plethora of terrifying Demonic Beasts that were already accustomed to the crushing gravity field lurked under the sea. Moreover, this was the sea, after all, so it would be extremely dangerous if one were to come across a Demonic Beast that was at the same cultivation level as them. If the Demonic Beast’s cultivation level was higher, then one was pretty much as good as dead.

When battling under the sea’s surface, the battle prowess of humans would decrease dramatically.

Ling Han hadn’t come to search for treasures, so he naturally wasn’t worried about such dangers. After gazing at the scenery for a while, he returned to his cabin, and continued to refine pills. Wasting time was a disgraceful habit.

The ship continued along its route, but apart from a measly few people, no one else was interested in diving into the sea. They only had one target—Ling Han.

After seven days, Ling Han finally managed to refine his first batch of Heavenly Qi Pills.

The Heavenly Qi Pill was mainly aimed at cultivators at the low extreme of the Mountain River Tier. Cultivators at the medium extreme could still ingest this pill, yet its effects would be much less evident. Ling Han gifted these pills to Shui Yanyu, and the seductive beauty was extremely astonished.

‘Ling Han can actually refine pills as well? Moreover, he genuinely managed to refine Divine Pills!’ Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She had indeed seen Ling Han refining pills before. However, he had failed time and time again, so she had thought that he had only just set foot on his pill refinement journey. Who would’ve imagined that he was refining Heavenly Qi Pills!

In the Imperial Capital, such pills could be sold for 100 True Origin Stones each!

Ling Han was only able to refine three pills the first time. However, he was able to refine five the second time, seven the third time, and a perfect 10 the tenth time.

In his eyes, this was extremely normal. As the Alchemy Emperor, he had only taken so long to refine this pill because he had been lacking in resources and cultivation level. Now that he had resolved these issues, it was naturally easy for him to succeed in his pill refinement.

However, Shui Yanyu was given quite a large fright. Was this man a monster? Not only did his cultivation level advance rapidly, but he was even tremendously talented in alchemy!

In any case, she was still extremely happy about this as the Heavenly Qi Pill was exactly what she needed right now. This pill could help her rapidly raise her cultivation level.

After using all of the ingredients, Ling Han started to study the second pill recipe.

Heavenly Pearl Pill.

It was a Level Two Divine Pill that could elevate both the Origin Power and physical power of a cultivator. It could even strengthen one’s physique to a small degree.

Many people practiced Body Arts in the Immortal Realm, yet very few could master such arts. One of the major problems was strengthening one’s physique. Only a tiny number of people could elevate their physique to the Immortal level as this required far, far too many resources.

As a result, the Heavenly Pearl Pill was extremely expensive, with each pill having a cost of 300 True Origin Stones. Moreover, this pill was often out of stock.

At Ling Han’s current level, this pill was the most useful to him.

He was extremely motivated, and so immediately started to drain his ingredients after familiarizing himself with the pill recipe.
