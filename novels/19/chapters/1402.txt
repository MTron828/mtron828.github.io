1403 Another Heavenly Body Tier

“Ling Han, you killed my son, and today is the day I will make you compensate with your life!” Sha Jing stated coldly. He could not tell Ling Han’s cultivation level, but was still unafraid as he thought their cultivation levels were equal.

However, just how many years had Ling Han cultivated? Could he be a match for him?

They were both in the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, and he was confident that he could easily suppress Ling Han.

He had to avenge the murder of his son, and as a Great General, he naturally had special privileges, and as he had declared that it was to avenge the murder of his son, it could be considered absolutely justified, so he dared to commit murder fully in public in the Imperial Capital.

“Your son, Sha Yuan, attempted to kill me repeatedly. I killed him, but I have a clear conscience,” Ling Han stated calmly. “If you are dissatisfied about it, then I accept your challenge.”

“Then die!” As Sha Jing’s Origin Power boiled, his aura as a Heavenly Body Tier rolled out in an incredibly frightening manner.

This was a suppression on the level of being, causing everyone in the proximity to collapse onto the ground. Only a few were exceptions, such as Zhao Lun. He naturally had the protection of the Great General Zhao, just like Li Weiwei had the protection of the Left Minister.

On Ling Han’s side, there was naturally no issue with his and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s protection.

“Hold on.” Ling Han waved a hand, his eyes sweeping over the Left Minister, Sha Jing, and Zhao Jianbai. Then, he said, “When I was at the Majestic Heaven Sect, I had once been hunted down by someone, and my starship was destroyed. The culprit should be one of you, right?”

At the time, there were only those few Heavenly Body Tiers that he had met, and Empress Luan Xing and Qu Qiuxue did not have the motive to do this. Yet the remaining three were suspects, especially Sha Jing and Zhao Jianbai.

“Humph, were you worthy of me making a move on you at the time?” Sha Jing immediately retorted in disdain.

Zhao Jianbai and the Left Minister also disdained from answering. They conducted themselves with dignity, so it was naturally impossible that they would answer whatever questions was asked of them.

Ling Han looked confused. At the time, he had remembered the aura of the person who had ambushed him, but it was different from these three. This was also why he had asked directly. Perhaps, at that time, the person who ambushed him had deliberately changed his aura. With the abilities of the Heavenly Body Tier, it was completely possible to have fooled the Ling Han of that time.

But the problem was, the person who ambushed him at that time should have been completely capable of killing him directly, so why had he done something so unnecessary?

“Humph, even if you try to delay, no one will be able to save you!” Sha Jing uttered coldly. He wanted to avenge the death of his son.

“Wait!” The Left Minister stretched out an arm to block him. “Brother Sha, Ling Han is a member of our Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, and he has already advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier at present, which is a great fortune of our empire. How could we fight amongst our own people?”

“He killed my son, and you still want me to have a peaceful relationship with him?” Sha Jing smirked coldly. This was really the greatest joke in the world.

The Left Minister had decided he wanted to mend the relations between himself and Ling Han. He had broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier at such a young age, so his future prospects would definitely be boundless.

He had already made a mistake, and had no intention of making another.

“Brother Sha, I am the Left Minister of our empire. Before Her Majesty went into isolation, she has delegated the important matters of state to myself and Brother Du.” The Left Minister brought Empress Luan Xing into the matter. This was a powerful weapon that could suppress everything else.

True enough, Sha Jing looked slightly wary. The reign of Empress Luan Xing was extremely strict. Previously, she had already killed one of the Great Generals personally. If he deliberately disobeyed her, and was called for an accounting later on, then even if he was a great elite of Heavenly Body Tier, a Great General of the empire, so what?

“Brother Li, is Brother Sha’s son not a citizen of our empire?” Zhao Jianbai interrupted. “This man is only a subject of the empire, yet dared to kill the son of a Great General of our empire. If this is not severely punished, how could that be reasonable?”

“That’s right!” Sha Jing immediately regained his resolution, not only due to Zhao Jianbai’s argument, but also because the latter had made his position clear—he was siding with him.

“Brother Li, you should cooperate with us to suppress this violent criminal together,” Zhao Jianbai persuaded. Even if Ling Han had just broken through into the Heavenly Body Tier, they were all in the low extreme. If Ling Han put his life on the line to fight them, it would not be easily dealt with, either.

If three Heavenly Body Tiers joined forces, their chances of safety was naturally greatly increased.

The Left Minister couldn’t help but be stuck in a dilemma. He wanted to protect Ling Han, but if it would lead him to become hostile with two Great Generals, he’d hesitate.

Was it worth it?

At present, though he had great authority, he still shared the rule with the Right Minister, and also because the Seven Generals had not expressed their stand, the two Ministers were equal in power. But if Zhao Jianbai and Sha Jing sided with the Right Minister, he would definitely be suppressed by the Right Minister.

To offend two Heavenly Body Tiers for the sake of one... it was not a worthy bargain.

He thought for a moment. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, he said, “Since you have a personal grudge with him, you settle the grudge yourselves. I will not interfere!”

“Father!” Li Weiwei immediately jumped up. He said he would not interfere, but in truth, wouldn’t that mean that he would allow them to do as they liked?

Yet the Left Minister’ expression was solemn, and he gave his daughter an imposing look. This daughter really gave him too many worries. It was time for him to seek a husband for her. She should become more reserved after she had become someone’s wife.

Though Zhao Jianbai and Sha Jing were not too satisfied, the Left Minister had clearly stated he would not interfere. That was not too bad, either. At least they had one less very powerful barrier they would have to overcome.

The both of them were experienced great elites of the Heavenly Body Tier, and Ling Han had just barely broken through. How could it be that they couldn’t deal with him easily with the two of them working together?

“Ling Han, you’d better kneel down and accept your punishment! As a subject, you deliberately disobeyed the law. Do you plan to have the Great Ling Empire die for your sake?” Zhao Jianbai exerted pressure on Ling Han using the name of righteousness.

“I’ll go!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stood up. She had just advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier, and just happened to want a chance to test out her abilities.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded. With him supporting her from the background, it should be fine.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden sent out a palm strike, and the whole wall was sent flying. She took a step out, her figure standing in midair.

‘What?!’

Seeing this scene, everyone had gone numb with shock.

Without any external tool, being capable of standing in midair, this was... Heavenly Body Tier!

Weng, there was actually another great elite of Heavenly Body Tier by Ling Han’s side! Now, it was two against two, so it was really not easy to judge which side was stronger.

Xiang Chengyun was both jealous and terrified.

Why?

Why was it that a boor from a small world could exceed himself in cultivation level? Why could he obtain the hearts of so many supreme beauties? And now, it was even more exaggerated; he actually had a female companion in the Heavenly Body Tier!

Yet he actually said that he wanted this female elite to stay behind and join him for some wine; wasn’t that courting death?

Sha Jing and Zhao Jianbai all looked serious. Even though the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s aura was very unsteady, and they could tell with a single glance that she had just broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier, anyone who had advanced into this cultivation level definitely could not be underestimated. After all, they themselves were also only in the peak stage of the low extreme.

“Miss, this matter is unrelated to you, so what need is there for you to interfere?” Sha Jing decided to first attempt to drive a wedge between them.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stood up highly, a pair of phoenix’s wings opening behind her back. Each wing was as long as 1000 miles. They fluttered lightly, and there were red clouds dancing around them. She opened her mouth and stated, “Ling Han is my husband!”

When these words were said, it had directly put a block on whatever Sha Jing had wanted to say afterwards.

He wanted to avenge his son, so how could it be that he would not allow her to step out for her husband? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Even he was envious at that. That was because even though he was also a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, it was obviously impossibly that he could marry a woman in the Heavenly Body Tier as his wife as well, so how could he not be envious?

“Since that is the case, we can only meet on the battlefield.” He drew out a saber. That was a treasured Tool that had accompanied him for innumerable years on the battlefield, and he had long since refined it that they were mentally connected.
