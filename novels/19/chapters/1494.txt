Chapter 1495 Come Battle!

Ling Han had shown up!A commotion began among the masses. They naturally could see that Ling Han was still bleeding, and there were bloodstains all over his clothes too. It was clear that he had just gone through a battle.

Could it be that this guy had gone out yesterday night as well? And offended some force somewhere, and had thus fled all the way back with the pursuers hot on his tail? If this had happened in the academy, it was definite that no one would believe it.

Who would dare make a move in the residence of a Great Saint?

The teacher humphed, “Why did you come so late?”

Ling Han pointed at the hourglass in the fighting ring. “Can’t I have overslept? In any case, I did not exceed the time limit.” Just as he spoke, the last grain of sand in the hourglass also fell down quietly, representing that an hour had passed.

The teacher was so furious that with a flutter of his sleeve, he directly ascended onto the fighting ring, without bothering to say another word.

Just go on and fight.

“Ling Han, I had thought that you did not dare come!” Gu Daoyi declared coldly.

Ling Han chuckled. “Just dealing with a random person is merely the matter of a simple action; what need is there for me to shrink back?”

“Heal your injuries now; I will give you two hours’ time to recover,” Gu Daoyi declared proudly. He wanted to defeat a Ling Han that was in prime condition, and obtain a straightforward and upright victory, and would not allow the slightest bit of excuse for Ling Han to claim for his loss.

When these words were out, everyone couldn’t help but nod their heads. As expected of the greatest prodigy of all eternity, Gu Daoyi. Merely this generous trait was enough to gain the admiration of others.

Normally, even if Gu Daoyi had immediately made his move, no one could say anything in disagreement as it was Ling Han who had been late. Furthermore, he had only made it here in the last instant.

This was also a show of confidence. Even if I allowed you to recover two hours, so what?

Ling Han gave a dismissive wave, and said, “No need, let’s just get the fight started. When we’re done, I can go and get my prize.”

This... you were a bit too arrogant, weren’t you? You hadn’t even started fighting, and you were already sure that you would definitely win?

Gu Daoyi’s current temperament was incomparable to how he had been years ago. Immediately, he was angered. He glared darkly at Ling Han, his index finger endlessly flicking, and his killing intent blazing. “Since you are so determined to seek your death—”

Shua, a flash of Sword Qi shot towards him, stopping whatever else he had been about to say.

“Just get the fight started. Where do you come up with so much blabber?” Ling Han withdrew his finger.

‘Again?!’

Gu Daoyi almost exploded in fury. It had been exactly like this previously in the Sunken Abyss Valley; Ling Han used an attack to stifle whatever he had been about to say. This brat, how was he so detestable?

“I’ll beat you to mush!” he roared, and charged towards Ling Han.

Boom!

The two men immediately began fighting. Because they previously had already fought, they did not feel out each other any further. Immediately, they used their powerful moves, battling fiercely with one another.

Gu Daoyi was the first to change his move. He used all the Mystical Power of Ten Lives of his 10 lives, and the Divine Fetus had become even more frightening after he had advanced into Eternal River Tier. Celestial light flowed from his fingers. This destructive ability was incredibly astonishing. If one was directly landed with a slash, it was guaranteed that even a Saint would frown.

After all, this already contained a portion of the Regulations from the Celestial Realm; how could it possibly be called a Divine Fetus otherwise? Just like while the Divine Demon Sword was only Level 11, if one was directly dealt a blow, then even the spirit of a Saint would disperse if he did not cut his losses in the nick of time.

This was power of Regulation that had surpassed the Immortal Realm!

Though the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was also a technique from the Celestial Realm, Ling Han did not dare to rashly check if the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll would be capable of casting out the murderous aura from within his body if he was actually hit. It would be wise to be cautious.

As the Mystical Powers of Ten Lives were delivered one after another, Gu Daoyi gradually entered into prime condition. When the bodies of his nine lives appeared, it turned into a battle of 10 against one!

This time, he himself had advanced into the Eternal River Tier, so the bodies of his nine lives were also naturally capable of showing the might of the Eternal River Tier, which had reached even the high extreme, and which was more powerful than he himself.

The bodies of his nine lives were too frightening! Or rather, the Nine Deaths Heaven Art was too powerful. This was the reason he could form the bodies of his nine lives, which showed that the Nine Deaths Heaven Art was possibly also an extremely powerful celestial technique in the Celestial Realm itself.

‘I definitely have to snatch it for my wife!’ Ling Han thought. He used heaven’s might, which weakened the bodies of nine lives by two stars of strength. Yet even so, because the bodies of nine lives were too strong this time, power that had been weakened by two stars was still overwhelming for him.

“Hahahaha!” Gu Daoyi laughed loudly. Previously, he had been limited to the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, causing the might of the bodies of nine lives to also be severely limited. However, it was different this time round. Now that he had opened up the upper limit of the Eternal River Tier, the bodies of nine lives also exploded with outstanding battle prowess.

“Merely an ant from the Immortal Realm, how could you be worthy of fighting me?” Gu Daoyi said in an incredibly disdainful tone, communicating this message via divine sense.

He thought that Ling Han was from an ancient divine tribe, and definitely would not leak the secret of the Celestial Realm. This was a secret that belonged specifically to the both of them.

The Mystical Powers of Ten Lives were all used, and their might was practically nature-defying.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han was repeatedly hit. This was a fight of 10 against one, and furthermore, each doppelganger was even stronger than the original. Even Ling Han was not capable of matching that.

Gu Daoyi had cultivated a celestial technique, but had Ling Han not done the same?

Not only had he cultivated one, and it was definitely not one that was inferior in any way to the Nine Deaths Heaven Art, though the strength of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll lay in defence.

Ling Han had indeed been sent back by the attacks, but he had only suffered superficial injuries. As golden divine light circulated, his injuries immediately healed.

“You just have this little bit of strength?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

‘F*ck!

Gu Daoyi’s expression darkened involuntarily. This guy’s tongue was still as poisonous as it had been. However, he was a little shocked by the strength of Ling Han’s physique. He had clearly seen no circulation of Origin Power into defenses. Ling Han was completely taking on the attacks head-on, and it was like he was made of genuine steel.

Could it be that this guy was a descendant of one of those few supreme Immortal Beasts of the Celestial Realm? Otherwise, how could he possibly possess such astonishing physique?

On the other side, Hong Ma had also received a shock. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At first, he had been slightly regretful he had made the agreement of three moves with Ling Han, and thought that he had lost in an unjust way, but now, he accepted his loss wholeheartedly.

If they fought all out, it was another matter whether Ling Han would be able to overwhelm him in terms of attack power, but he was definitely invincible in the area of defense. He could not possibly break through Ling Han’s defense—even if he could, it would be a mere scratch with the latter’s terrifying recovery ability.

“Humph, so what if you have strong defenses? Would you be able to defeat me with just the ability to take a beating?” Gu Daoyi asked arrogantly.

Ling Han broke into a grin. “Who said that I am only strong in defense?”

The Godly bones in his body glowed; the first killing formation was activated.

One at a time, there was no need to rush.

Ling Han attacked, using the Lightning Sword Technique, and embedded the killing formation as well as the Tide of the Ages within his attack.

“Using yourself as a formation?” Gu Daoyi’s insight was indeed sharp. He had immediately seen through to Ling Han’s attack. “Quite intriguing. The strength of your physique actually allowed you to inscribe Level 14 formations! Too bad, in front of me, what is a Level 14 formation worth?”

His bodies of 10 lives showed their might at the same time, and easily dispersed this attack.

“Ling Han, there is no way you will be a match for me,” Gu Daoyi said proudly. “Prostrate in front of me. You should know; I can bring you glory.”

He was the Severing Mundane Ancestor from the Celestial Realm!

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Don’t be patient, the best is yet to come!” He activated two killing formations, and attacked again.

It was still easily dispersed.

Three!

The smile on Gu Daoyi’s face gradually withdrew, and he revealed an expression of seriousness.

Why had the might of the killing formation become stronger and stronger?

It was obviously still Level 14, but its might had far exceeded that; this was illogical!

“You, you did not inscribe just a single killing formation!” Realization suddenly dawned on Gu Daoyi, his face filled with shock and astonishment.

This time, he was really stunned.
