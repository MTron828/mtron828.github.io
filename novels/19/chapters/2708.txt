2709 All killed

In only an instant, all of Ling Han’s injuries were healed.

Indestructible Divine Metal Physique was not only as tough as Divine Metal, it also had the indestructible trait of Divine Metal, having extremely strong recovery ability.

“Y-you…” Desolate Moon looked at Ling Han in shock. He was about to lose his mind. How could anyone have this kind of recovery ability? This was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Then, he gritted his teeth. “Even if you have recovered, so what? With so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates here, just how many times will you be able to recover?”

“Once is enough,” Ling Han stated calmly. He waved the Divine Demon Sword, and began his counterattack.

Peng, peng, peng! The Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates’ battle prowess was still great, blasting him in all directions, but he did not bleed this time. Instead, grooves appeared on his body one after another.

…A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would definitely only produce a groove should he blast Divine Metal; the depth of the groove would depend on the amount of force. But if they really wanted to damage Divine Metal, they could only use the fundamental power of the Genesis World.

In other words, it would at least have to be the attack of a First Tier Heavenly Venerate to be capable of damaging Divine Metal. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han only shook his body, and those grooves on his body immediately became even again.

He broke into a grin. So what if there were around 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates?

…Unless the number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had reached a maximum limit that could turn him into a meat patty with a single strike, surpassing the tough level of Divine Metal. In that case, he definitely would die.

But 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates?

It wasn’t enough!

It was time for him to counterattack.

With a battle cry, Ling Han swept out with the Divine Demon Sword. There was nothing it could not destroy; at least, it was not something that could be matched by the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Pu! A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate died immediately.

And Ling Han also paid a price for it. Having over 100 Pseudo=Heavenly Venerates attack him caused a great many grooves to appear on his body, but with the recovery of his physique, they rapidly healed.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and charged out again.

Pu, pu, pu! One strike after another, and he killed Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates like he was slicing grass.

Strictly speaking, these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were only puppets, so how high could their battle prowess be?

Desolate Moon commanded them from the sidelines, but he could only adjust their military formation on a wider scale, establishing their tactics. How could he possibly micromanage every single attack?

Moreover, battle would change in an instant. These were Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates fighting, but he himself was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so how could he possibly catch up with them?

One after another, the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates collapsed, and the number very soon surpassed 50.

Desolate Moon was panicking. From the look of things, it would not be too long before Ling Han eliminated all these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Just what kind of freak was this?

A’mu and the others were also dumbfounded as well, their eyes staring blankly. They could not believe this at all.

…A Ninth Heaven Celestial King being capable of having Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier battle prowess was already inconceivable enough, breaking the iron rules of cultivation. But Ling Han was even more domineering now. In his hands, Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were just like weeds that could be cut at any time.

Was this really a person who was at the same cultivation level as them?

How could Ling Han be so strong?

It should be known that they, too, were super freaks that had Evolution Index reaching 12, so why was the gap between them so wide?

This actually was not because they were not freakish enough, but rather that they were not as lucky as Ling Han. If they, too, could be tempered by Void Particle Energy now, and also had a Heavenly Venerate Tool, they probably would not be too inferior to Ling Han.

And from this, it was evident that once Ling Han truly advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, or became a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, his advantage would disappear completely.

…All of them would have been tempered by the fundamental power of the Genesis World, or would have grasped one of the six fundamental powers of the Genesis World, aside from that unique power of the Flaming Frost Realm. Then, there would be absolutely no difference among them.

Ultimately, the most important deciding factor would be their individual ability.

This thought floated through Ling Han’s mind, but he exercised no mercy at all when he attacked. Very quickly, another dozen Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates collapsed.

And the more Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that collapsed, the fewer the attacks he had to sustain. Naturally, fewer injuries would then be inflicted on him, and these injuries would be lighter.

Desolate Moon gritted his teeth, and turned to flee.

If he still stayed, it would be his turn to be eliminated when Ling Han took out all the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates on the scene.

Desolate Moon was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King; how could he oppose a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

…Yet he had forgotten that Ling Han was actually a Ninth Heaven Celestial King as well. The problem here was: was there anyone who would still consider Ling Han a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Ling Han laughed loudly. With a burst of force, peng, he streaked out. Though there were a great many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates trying to stop him, Ling Han ignored them completely. Underneath the mad barrage of several dozen attacks, he had already charged out, heading directly for Desolate Moon.

Desolate Moon turned to take a look, and his face involuntarily became livid.

There were still 40-plus Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates now, and they actually couldn’t even stop Ling Han?

This was natural. With a precious tool cutting a path for him, how could they block him?

Ling Han stretched out a hand to grab Desolate Moon. “You can’t die so easily. I will capture and drag you back to the martial academy, in honor of Xiao Yingxiong!”

“Don’t underestimate me!” Desolate Moon humphed, and sent a spiritual attack towards Ling Han.

Yet Ling Han was completely unaffected. The hand that he had stretched out was steady, without the slightest sliver of a tremor.

Previously, he only had to hide himself in the Celestial Guest Residence, and would not be affected by the black Qi. In other words, Divine Metal could effectively cut off these spiritual attacks. Then, now that he had successfully cultivated the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique, how could it be that he would not have this kind of immunity?

His palm descended. There was absolutely no way Desolate Moon could dodge this. How could a Ninth Heaven Celestial King possibly be any match for Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess?

Ling Han captured Desolate Moon, and sealed off the latter’s cultivation level before he threw him into a Spatial God Tool.

Ling Han feared that Desolate Moon would be able to exude black Qi, and contaminate the women, so he naturally could not send him into the Celestial Guest Residence.

Once Desolate Moon vanished, the remaining Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates immediately became puzzled. Their master was gone, and they were like kites which had their lines cut, left with only the most primitive instincts of slaughter and violence.

Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword once more. Shua, shua, shua! Sword light blazed hotly, and the remaining Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates very quickly all collapsed as well.

Only then did he withdraw his sword, and strode towards the canyon.

A’mu and the others were all gaping in shock, their eyes wide. They could only stare at Ling Han in astonishment. They had completely no idea what to say.

Was he really a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, just like them?

“What is it?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“I am more stunned, and am still trying my best to digest my shock,” A’mu answered.

These were honest words, but it could also be seen how open-minded he was. Otherwise, there was absolutely no way he could say these words now.

Everyone nodded. There should be no preceding Ninth Heaven Celestial King like this.

“Brother Ling, you asked for the Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone just now; was it to cultivate the final stage of your secret technique?” Liu Ziyan asked, her beautiful eyes sparkling.

She herself was a freak whose Evolution Index had reached 12, and it was destined that she would become a Heavenly Venerate one day. There was already no one that was worthy of her admiration, yet now she suddenly felt just how insignificant she was.

Ling Han was a true freak; he alone was 100 times more amazing than all of them added together.

She felt her heart beat fiercely, her cheeks dyed red. Some string in her heart seemed to have been strummed.

Ling Han nodded. They had already seen this, so there was no meaning in denying it any further. Moreover, when one had reached the heights that he had, there was no need to hide a matter like having cultivated a Heavenly Venerate Technique.

As long as a Heavenly Venerate did not appear, he feared no one.

“Should we wait here now or return immediately?” A’mu asked.

They would definitely not be able to catch up to Du Shiyi, so why wouldn’t they just wait here for the Heavenly Venerate from the martial academy to arrive? By then, it would be fine for them to just travel with him back to the martial academy, and before that, they could also continue their cultivation here.
