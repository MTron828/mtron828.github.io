Chapter 1176: Mind If I Sleep With You?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After convincing Hu Feiyun to leave, Ling Han wrapped his arms around Shui Yanyu and prepared to get some rest.

There were outsiders nearby, after all, so it would be a bad idea to enter the Black Tower and risk exposing the secret of his Spatial God Tool.

With a swoosh, Meng Wei entered their tent as she pulled the entrance aside. She was wearing a bright red cloak, and it was evident that she had only just washed her hair. There were still beads of water dripping down her silky red hair, radiating a peculiar type of allure.

“Leader Meng, it’s already so late. For what reason do you come?” Ling Han asked. There was slight irritation in his voice. Meng Wei had come without invitation, and she hadn’t even asked before entering. She was acting far too familiar.

‘You can’t do as you please, even if you’re a woman, and even if you’re a beauty.’

“Guys, mind if I sleep with you?” Meng Wei asked them a shocking question.

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered aloud. Thankfully, he and Shui Yanyu had been together this entire time; otherwise, she would have definitely interrogated him on his relationship with Meng Wei.

Shui Yanyu was also astonished, and she asked, “Sister Meng, are you drunk?”

There was a puzzled look on Meng Wei’s face, and she said, “Why are you two so surprised? Have you two not made love before?”

Was this woman trying to shock them to death?

Shui Yanyu was extremely embarrassed, and she buried her head into Ling Han’s back, not daring to look at anyone else.

Ling Han was naturally thick-skinned enough, and he said, “Leader Meng, what are you trying to say?”

“I battled for an entire day, and several of my good comrades died. I’m feeling extremely down right now, so I want to let myself loose!” There was an alluring look in Meng Wei’s eyes as she gazed at Ling Han, and she continued, “Don’t think that I’m casual about my partners. Although I won’t guard my chastity as if it’s pure jade, I’ll only make love with men that I truly think are worthy.”

‘Is this not casual?’

Shui Yanyu was already completely dumbfounded. This woman was... far too bold.

“Your expressions are so strange! Do you think that women get the short end of the stick when they f*ck men?” Meng Wei chuckled in scorn, and said, “It’s fine as long as I feel good! It’s not like I’ll get pregnant or anything, and we can both go our own ways after rooting. Neither of us will owe each other anything.”

This made some sense. However, in this world—where beautiful women were often treated as a commodity—people still held onto the traditional belief that men would definitely be better off when making love with women. Women would definitely get the short end of the stick.

Ling Han wouldn’t interfere with other’s habits as long as they didn’t affect him. “Leader Meng, I think it’ll be better if you seek your own comrades... to let yourself loose.”

“Tsk, rabbits don’t eat the grass by their burrows.” Meng Wei waved her hand, and said, “When I screw a man, we’ll only be together for a maximum of 10 days to half a month. We’ll never see each other again after that. So, how can I screw my own comrades? How will I leave them by my side after I screw them?”

Ling Han grimaced upon hearing this. This was the first time he had come across such a woman, and he was truly at a loss for words.

“Oi, want to see my wares?” Meng Wei asked. She undid her cloak and slipped out of it, revealing her beautiful and seductive naked body.

Large breasts, flat stomach, shapely bottom, and long and slender legs—this was truly a flawless and alluring body. However, there were many scars on her body, and it was clear that some had been left numerous years ago. They hadn’t disappeared over time.

These scars had formed due to the foreign martial intents that had remained in her wounds while they healed. Because of their existence, her wounds hadn’t been able to heal completely.

Ling Han was astonished that there were so many scars on the body of a stunning beauty such as Meng Wei. It was quite a startling scene.

Meng Wei proudly puffed her chest, and confidently said, “How is it? My figure is quite nice, isn’t it?”

Ling Han waved his hands, and said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have a habit of getting together with my cooperation partners.”

He wasn’t faking seriousness. In fact, he was genuinely uninterested in having one-night stands.

Ling Han had never seen himself as someone who was loyal to only one partner, but he wouldn’t make love with someone just for the sake of short-term pleasure.

“Then I can only concede and take the next best option!” Meng Wei turned her gaze to Shui Yanyu, and said, “Girl, I’ll teach you how to make love with women! Believe me, my techniques are definitely no worse than your man’s. I guarantee that you’ll experience an incredible pleasure!”

‘F*ck! You’re even trying to steal my woman?!’

Ling Han was extremely ticked off, and he immediately walked over and grabbed Meng Wei by the neck.

“Oi, oi, oi, I only accept normal love-making. You’re being too rough, and I don’t like that... Ow!” Meng Wei shouted loudly as she was thrown out of the tent by Ling Han. She plopped to the ground on her rear.

“Hahaha! Leader, you were rejected, huh?”

“I said so, didn’t I? He has two breathtakingly beautiful wives, so how could he possibly have been seduced by our leader?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“However, he rejected a threesome that was delivered to his door. It looks like Young Master Han’s standards are pretty high, huh?”

Meng Wei’s subordinates all roared with laughter. It was evident that they were all well aware of their leader’s bad habits.

“What do you guys mean? Are you trying to say that I’m not classy enough?” Meng Wei slipped back into her cloak and continued to speak without restraint.

Her subordinates all giggled in secret. They had gone through thick and thin with Meng Wei, so it could be said that they were like true brothers and sisters. Thus, they naturally didn’t fear her too much, nor did they overly respect her. However, they were all willing to die for her.

At least half of the scars on her body had been left during the times that she had saved them.

She continued to curse and vent her emotions. Her desire hadn’t been satisfied, so she was naturally very unhappy. After cursing for a while, she shouted, “I’ll deal with it myself!”

She then immediately returned to her own tent.

Shui Yanyu’s face flushed red, and she buried it in Ling Han’s lap, murmuring, “How can there be such people?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Would you still say this if Meng Wei were a man?”

Shui Yanyu pondered for a moment before replying, “Although that would still seem a little too casual, I guess it wouldn’t be overly astonishing.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Indeed. Why is such behavior regarded as normal for men, yet women are criticized for doing the same thing?”

Shui Yanyu’s views naturally couldn’t be changed so quickly. She simply shook her head, and said, “Anyhow, I can’t accept such behavior!”

“Of course. You already have a flawless husband in me, so how can you seek out other men?” Ling Han smiled as he pulled her into his embrace and enjoyed her beauty and warmth.

“Pei!” This man really couldn’t say anything nice.

Morning arrived, and they continued toward the alchemist’s abode.

Although they had experienced that awkward situation last night, it didn’t seem like Meng Wei had taken it to heart. Sure enough, she was extremely thick-skinned. If this hadn’t been the case, she wouldn’t have run before an unfamiliar male, stripped naked, and asked to make love anyway.

Meng Wei wasn’t embarrassed, yet Shui Yanyu’s face flushed red every time she saw her. She was teased incessantly by that open and casual woman.

They ventured further and further from the Yellow Spring. After walking for several more days, a small manor appeared before them.

“Be careful!” Meng Wei warned. “We came across a pack of Demonic Beasts the last time we came here, and we were forced to abandon our armor and retreat. In the end, we only managed to explore a very small area.”

Ling Han was slightly puzzled, and asked, “How do you know there are pills in here if you weren’t able to explore its depths last time?”
