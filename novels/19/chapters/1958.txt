Chapter 1959: Top-grade monarch tiers arrive

Another day later, an important figure from the Wide Prosperity Heaven finally arrived.

Tang Minglong.

Just hearing the name of this person would make it very easy to imagine a broad-shouldered man with tall build, but in truth, he was a dwarf. His figure was covered with wrinkles, and he had a head of gray hair. No matter what, no one would probably be able to connect him with their image of a top-grade monarch tier.

But it was rumored that this was the reincarnation of a Celestial King!

No one knew why a Celestial King had to choose such an “unbearable” body, nor did they understand why the Celestial King had not mended this body with his own ways. To all Severing Mundane Tiers, this would only be a piece of cake, so it could not possibly be difficult for a Celestial King to accomplish.

If the rumors were true, and Tang Minglong was really the reincarnation of a Celestial King, further thought would bring the realization of just how incredibly terrifying the new generation of the Wide Prosperity Heaven was.

...If even the reincarnation of a Celestial King could only be ranked third, then just how powerful could Yi and Shu Yarong be?

“Lord Tang!” A considerable number took the initiative to stand and greet him, and only the monarch tiers were relatively more reserved.

So what if you were a Celestial King? You had already dropped down to rock bottom, and all of us would be able to become Celestial Kings in the future, so who would have to fear anyone else?

What everyone respected would always be true strength.

Tang Minglong was standoffish, appearing to be slightly antisocial.

Someone who had loose lips immediately pointed at Ling Han, and called, “Lord Tang, this person has insulted our whole Wide Prosperity Heaven!”

Tang Minglong looked over. However, there was only a hint of confusion in his eyes. He did not speak up to ask further.

That person hurriedly related the matters that had happened previously, and then looked at Tang Minglong impatiently, hoping that he would stand up angrily, and seek recompense for the Wide Prosperity Heaven, as well as stamp down completely on the Calm Peace Heaven.

Trash was still trash after all.

When Tang Minglong heard all this, his eyes turned on Ling Han and Hu Niu. His gaze flickered slightly. Then, he closed his eyes, and sat down in a cross-legged position on a huge rock, looking like he did not want to be disturbed by such trivial matters.

Everyone from the Wide Prosperity Heaven was disappointed by this, yet they could not compel Tang Minglong to make a move. They could only hope that Ling Han and Tang Minglong would meet each other after the Three Blooms Valley opened.

“We don’t need to wait that long. When Lord Yi is here, he will definitely step out to suppress Ling Han,” someone said with full confidence.

“En!” This won the agreement of many, and even the monarch tiers looked reverent.

They were all monarch tiers, but Yi was too strong, reaching the point that even they could only look up at him.

In the blink of an eye, another two days had passed.

All of a sudden, fragrance diffused in the wind, and multiple beautiful blooms floated down from the skies. However, when one stretched out his hand to touch it, he would realize that these weren’t real flowers, but mere images. However, the fragrance was real.

“Fragrance wafts 10,000 miles, Fairy Shu is here!”

Immediately, everyone from the Wide Prosperity Heaven became excited.

Shu Yarong. Not only was she the number one beauty of the Wide Prosperity Heaven, she was also the second strongest elite of the Severing Mundane Tier. Under these two halos, it was natural that she would seem like a goddess from the Nine Heavens, noble and graceful.

Very soon, a white figure was rapidly coming from the distance. She was an extremely beautiful woman. She was dressed in snow white robes, with multiple colourful butterflies on her skirts. Occasionally, they would flap their wings and fly, but they would immediately soon turn into bits of light and disappear.

These were not real butterflies, but something formed by Regulations.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel his heart jolt. This woman had not deliberately channeled any technique. This was the automatic manifestation of great dao, which was extremely shocking.

This was the effect brought on by a Divine Fetus.

“Fairy Shu!”

“Fairy Shu!”

“Fairy Shu!”

All those from the Wide Prosperity Heaven approached to greet her. Even Tang Minglong couldn’t help but open his eyes, and glanced at Shu Yarong’s face. His wrinkled face showed a strange expression, and then he closed his eyes back again. He continued to meditate, appearing to be unconcerned by all else.

Shu Yarong was exquisitely beautiful. Though Liu Han was also a beauty, and she was ranked just below her, when the two women stood side by side, one would discover that Liu Han was obviously inferior to the former.

However, everyone had no choice but to admit that whenever Shu Yarong had appeared in the past, she would immediately become the sole center of attention of the whole area, but it was a different case now. Her charms were completely suppressed by another woman. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Hu Niu!

No matter from which angle they looked at it, it was Hu Niu that was superior. Though this little girl did not have much of an image—just see, she was already eating in public, one hand holding a chicken thigh, and her mouth oily from her food—anyone’s heart would still be moved by her beauty.

To say nothing of Hu Niu, even those two women by her side were similar.

One’s face was veiled, but her figure was perfect and flawless. Furthermore, she had an unmatchable noble air. She could captivate anyone without any need to show her true appearance.

The other was seductively beautiful. Her almond-shaped eyes were capable of saying words, enchanting and alluring.

Shu Yarong had clearly discovered their presence as well. She looked towards Hu Niu, and a hint of shock flashed through her eyes. There was also an indescribable look in her eyes, a very complex mixture of astonishment and reverence.

Naturally, another began to make complaints to Shu Yarong, trying to sow discord.

Shu Yarong only smiled slightly. Instead, she nodded at Ling Han and Hu Niu, and then walked to one side, waiting silently for the Three Blooms Valley to open.

Fine, Shu Yarong was not willing to move, either.

They could only anticipate Yi then. This guy was incredibly vicious, and would start a fight at the slightest disagreement. He did not care whether he was in the right or not. He only had to beat his foe into submission, so even if he had been wrong, he would become right.

Yi, come quickly.

One day passed after another. Time passed very quickly. Though several other emperor tiers had come—aside from Yi, all the other monarch tiers had arrived—there was still no trace of Yi.

A very great change occurred in the Three Blooms Valley. These several days, wild winds filled the air, as if they intended to break through the heavens. Boom, multiple streaks of fire would occasionally soar skywards, and there would be bolts of lightning striking down as well, as if some existence was undergoing the heavenly tribulation.

“The Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood is about to appear!” Many cried out, appearing incredibly expectant.

Source Power of heaven and earth could only be obtained through a stroke of fate.

Who knew, it might be them that were the fated ones?

For this kind of bizarre scene to appear, it meant that the opening of the Three Blooms Valley would be within the next two to three days.

But where was Yi? Why was he still not here?

One day later.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, a flood of arrows appeared in the skies, shooting rapidly down from the skies, and enshrouding everyone that was standing at the entrance.

“Who dares to be so insolent!”

“Humph!”

“Damn it!”

Everyone moved, and dispersed this wave of attack. This was an emperor tier-level attack. Thus, some looked strained, but for monarch tiers, it could not be easier to deal with.

Xiu, another arrow streaked past, shooting straight for a monarch tier.

“How dare you!” That monarch tier shot out a punch. Peng, the arrow of light shattered, but a flash of blood flickered across that monarch tier’s fist. He had actually been wounded by this blow.

Everyone inhaled sharply. Clearly, the last attack had not been delivered with the full force of the person who had launched the sneak attack.

Xiu, another arrow shot over, but this time, the target had been switched to another person.

One arrow followed another. These attacks were all very crafty, shooting from different angles. It was like the sneak attacker was unleashing his attacks from different locations. Even top-grade monarch tiers like Ling Han, Hu Niu, Shu Yarong, and Tang Minglong were being attacked.

“Who is the bastard that dares to sneak attack Niu?” Hu Niu jumped up, flying into a thunderous fury.

The Empress was fiddling with an arrow in one hand, and the beautiful face under the gauzy veil also showed a hint of anger.

Someone actually dared to launch a sneak attack on her?

“Hahahaha!” Following a loud laugh, a young man strode out, his hands holding a silver bow that was about half a foot long. “I am Ji Wuming, and hereby greet all of you.”
