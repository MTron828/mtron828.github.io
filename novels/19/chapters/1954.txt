Chapter 1955: Shi Xiuwen arrives

“Brother Ling, you really are from the Calm Peace Heaven?” Liu Jie still asked, unwilling to give up.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “As true as can be.”

Liu Jie’s eyes flickered, and after a while, he only darkly said, “Then, after we enter the valley, it is inevitable that we will be on opposing sides. I will definitely not hold anything back.”

“What is it? You want a fight?” Hu Niu immediately piped in. Her attitude was very fierce.

Liu Jie opened his mouth to say something, but then closed his mouth again. In front of Hu Niu, he really was not qualified to make any outlandish boasts.

He looked deeply at Ling Han, and then turned around and left.

Just as he had said, should they meet inside the valley, it was unavoidable that they would have a great battle.

“You seem to have gained his resentment?” Yan Xianlu asked.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “It cannot be helped. Just let him be.”

“What happened?” Yan Xianlu asked again.

Ling Han stroked his chin, and smilingly replied, “It’s complicated.”

They were just talking when Liu Han suddenly ran over, and said to Hu Niu, “Even if you are a woman, I still want to be with you!”

Pu, Yan Xianlu immediately spluttered. Even though he was known as a Divine Fetus that had been born on the Celestial Path, and was as calm and steady as a mountain, all of that had turned completely into nothing at this moment. He coughed endlessly, looked at Hu Niu, and then looked at Liu Han again, feeling completely blown over.

Could it be that because it had been too long since he had roamed around, he was already outdated, and could no longer keep up with the trends?

“You are so annoying!” Hu Niu declared impatiently.

“I know of a type of Celestial medicine that can change gender,” Liu Han said excitedly, “I have thought it over for many days. I like you, and I can’t give up on you!”

“Niu doesn’t like you!” Hu Niu grabbed one of Ling Han’s arms. “Niu likes Ling Han, and only Ling Han alone!”

Ling... Han!

Liu Han’s eyes swept over, focusing on Ling Han’s face. Her expression instantly became icy cold, exuding a frosty killing intent.

Since that was the case, then she would kill Ling Han off first.

“Ugly, do you want to die?” Hu Niu, too, immediately blazed with killing intent. She was the most sensitive to killing intent. This ugly hag actually dared to show killing intent towards her Ling Han. Her first reaction was to kill her.

Liu Han controlled her emotions, and only shot Hu Niu a dazzling smile before leaving without a second look backwards.

She would kill Ling Han, but she would not do it herself.

It would be too easy to do this. She only had to egg on the other monarch tiers to make a move, and with her beauty and status, it was completely a piece of cake for her to make others bite the bait.

Yan Xianlu smirked, and asked, “Have I missed something?” It was no wonder that Ling Han said it was complicated. It indeed seemed extremely complex.

Lao Song and Shan Jitong also arrived consequently. The monarch tiers from the Calm Peace Heaven had all arrived, but because there was a larger number of monarch tiers from the Wide Prosperity Heaven. At present, only half had arrived, and they were all ranked below the top 10.

Even so, when over a dozen monarch tiers arrived at the same time, all of them exuded the kind of aura that came from a ruler of their own domain, capable of causing one to submit to them.

In the future, these people would definitely become Celestial Kings, so naturally their aura soared.

The two sides were clearly divided, and stood on either side of the entrance. Conflict did not erupt, nor did any Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier elites appear to create a massacre, and ruin the many prodigies that had been accumulated for at least ten billion years.

The journey to this Mystery Realm could involve a great many Celestial Kings. Whoever dared to cause trouble here would simply commit a suicidal action.

Thus, the battles this time would only take place among the Severing Mundane Tiers.

Roar!

A loud battle cry rang out, just like the roar of a dragon, but also seemingly like a tiger’s roar, so loud that even the mist in the valley vibrated endlessly. A young man was rushing over from the distance. His appearance was extremely primitive, with only a fur hide wrapped around his lower body. His hair had been tied into several dozen braids, each braid tied with an ornament that was made from a jade-colored bone.

He was clearly only just one person, but as he ran over, it was like a frightening giant primeval beast bulldozing over. Any person or object that stood in his way would only be sent flying and shattered.

“Shi Xiuwen!” Yan Xianlu stood abruptly, his hands involuntarily tightening into fists. His eyes blazed with fire, his fighting spirit burning brightly.

This person was Shi Xiuwen?

Ling Han took a second glance at that “savage”, but as his gaze focused, it immediately drew the attention of the other. Shi Xiuwen also turned to look at Ling Han, his eyes as sharp as blades that slashed rapidly towards Ling Han. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Han was completely unconcerned, but a Divine Sword leaped out of his eyes, greeting the other’s incoming attack.

Boom!

Sword Rays clashed, simultaneously erasing each other. This clash seemed to have resulted in a tie.

Shi Xiuwen bared his mouth in a grin. He had only used one percent of his battle prowess in this blow, but he was sure that the battle prowess that Ling Han had used was definitely more than that. Hence, it was natural that he was the one who was superior.

All of a sudden, his vicious nature exploded. With him sweeping his gaze over everyone that was looking at him, a bout of muffled grunts instantly rang out. Even monarch tiers were no exception. They all turned their heads away, feeling a fierce pain in their eyes, while king tiers and emperor tiers directly cried tears of blood.

In the Severing Mundane Tier, the superiority of monarch tier over emperor tier was the heaviest, which was equivalent to a Yang soul against the fourth severance. Hence, even if they were emperor tiers, it was very normal that they still could not sustain the might of a glare from him.

This guy was a little similar to Hu Niu, extremely vicious and filled with a primitive air.

Shan Jitong and Lao Song couldn’t help but feel their heads go numb. So this was a monarch tier of the Wide Prosperity Heaven?

Too powerful!

Facing Yan Xianlu, even if they were no match for him, they at least had the courage to fight. At least they could be sure that even if they were no match for him, they would still be able to calmly retreat after the battle. But against Shi Xiuwen... they were like lambs that had encountered a fierce lion, only worthy of becoming his prey.

Even the two of them, monarch tiers, were like this, what more the others. All of them had lost all their drive, and could only tremble in fear.

This kind of person... How were they supposed to match that?

Moreover, Shi Xiuwen was only ranked ninth among the prodigies of the Wide Prosperity Heaven, so what about the eight people ranked higher than him? It was said that the top three were all freakish prodigies, and could single-handedly destroy the heavens, and were indescribably powerful.

“My hand is itching, who will fight me?” Shi Xiuwen called out loudly. While he was asking who would fight him, his eyes were fixed on Ling Han.

In his eyes, only this person could barely stand against him in battle, and stepping on prodigies had always been his hobby.

Delivering a blow to his opponent that would render his confidence to bits was one of his greatest pleasures.

“Wild ape, Niu will come and beat you up!” Hu Niu leaped out. She was not the type to care about any form of rules, and would rather move directly.

Boom, an image of the Roc appeared behind her. Immediately, she was using her full power. Clearly, Hu Niu was also excited by the thrill of battle, and gave Shi Xiuwen serious regard, treating him like a powerful opponent.

“So strong!” Shi Xiuwen exclaimed in surprise, delighted. He gave a roar, and stepped up to meet Hu Niu midway. With a tremble of his figure, a massive golden giant appeared behind him. It was brandishing a stone pestle that harshly crashed towards the Roc.

This was a clash between the power of Divine Fetus of both sides. From a certain perspective, this was a clash between two Celestial Kings as well, though both had just released a sliver of their full might.

...The heights of the Celestial King Tier did determine the strength of the Divine Fetus, but it was also affected by the cultivator’s own cultivation level. It was impossible that an Ascending Origin Tier Divine Fetus would be no match for a Severing Mundane Tier Divine Fetus.

Boom, the giant clashed against the Roc, bursting into an intense confrontation. Great dao shattered, turning into countless fragments of seals that shot out in all directions.

Brilliant light filled the skies, and nothing else could be seen.
