Chapter 2598: Group of ancient tombs

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

More and more people came here, not only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, but also the Eighth Heaven, Seventh Heaven, and even lower-level Celestial Kings.

Everyone knew that the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had a great plan to level a dangerous place, wherein hid earth-shattering treasures that could even turn a Celestial King into a Heavenly Venerate!

Who was the first to spread this news? It could no longer be verified. However, it obviously had an amazing effect as it caused this area to be extremely crowded and filled with oceans of people.

When there were too many people, conflicts would inevitably arise. Furthermore, there were no rules in the Celestial King Graveyard. Killing people was a very common thing. Bloody battles occurred on a daily basis. In fact, even large-scale team battles would burst out.

The Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou disguised themselves to participate in many team battles since it would not be conducive for their growth to always work in seclusion. They were unlike Little Terror; its combat abilities had been instinctively ingrained, similar to a War Soldier’s.

Exactly 10,000,000 years passed, and this swamp was finally about to be leveled.

The Celestial Kings from all corners gathered around it. Although the area was still astonishingly large, the swamp was only about 1.5 km in size. There was a piece of land just ahead, but with the thickening mist, it could not be seen very clearly.

All the Celestial Kings were very excited as they had finally completely emptied the swamp after another day’s work, and now they could proceed unobstructed.

“Huh?!”

When they stepped onto this piece of dry land, the fog dissipated, and they could see things within a 0.5 km range. They saw that there were a few large graves erected sporadically around the area. Going by this calculation, there should be more large graves after the fog—the total number would be absolutely staggering.

These tombs were enormous—the tombstones alone measured up to 300 meters in height, and the burial mound itself was like a hill, exuding a strong oppressive, menacing feeling.

There were so many tombs? Which one was the Ancient Tomb?

“Everyone, the Ancient Tomb is in the centermost area. We need everyone to work together to clear a path towards it—there are still some minor hurdles here.” Desolate Moon appeared, and stood at the forefront.

“Friend Desolate Moon, please lead the way,” everyone said.

“Those who are willing to follow my lead to the Ancient Tomb can come along with me. However, there are opportunities in every tomb here—the young ones may wish to explore,” Desolate Moon said. “Where there are opportunities, there will also be dangers lurking. Make sure to stay alert and proceed with caution.”

Everyone was taken by surprise. Desolate Moon’s strength was absolutely incomparable, and yet he showed such hesitation—it simply wasn’t the way an elite would normally behave.

This person was absolutely too mysterious.

After speaking, Desolate Moon strode forward, while a large number of Nine Heavenly Celestial Kings looked at each other, and began trailing behind him.

No one believed that Desolate Moon could have set a trap, because who could have managed to pass through such a terrifying swamp? Even if Desolate Moon had any malicious intention, he could only use what was originally laid out here to target them.

Therefore, the safest way would actually be to follow Desolate Moon. With so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings working together, even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate would feel trepidation.

Besides, should Desolate Moon be telling the truth, and the remaining six parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll were really hidden here, then they needed to follow him all the more.

The crowd of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings left, but told the rest to be cautious, and not get involved in conflicts rashly.

There were too many second-generation young masters here, all of them short-tempered and arrogant. Should a fight break out, neither side would let up until they fought to the death.

“Brother Long, what should we do?” Zhao Shuang asked Ling Han in a low voice. His life was in Ling Han’s hands, and that had dissipated all his temper long ago.

Ling Han’s reply came with a sweeping glance. “I naturally want to go into those ancient tombs and take a look.”

There wouldn’t be any good prospects in following Desolate Moon; with so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings around, Ling Han wouldn’t even be able to get any leftovers. However, if Desolate Moon was telling the truth, and there were indeed opportunities in the other ancient tombs, then Ling Han might as well try his luck there.

After 10,000,000 years, not only had Ling Han advanced his cultivation to the peak stage of the Fourth Heaven, he had also completely mastered and merged the three parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scrolls—his battle prowess had naturally improved further as well.

Ling Han was confident that as long as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King didn’t make a move, even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t be able to stop him. Of course, he still would not be able to defeat such an opponent—he hadn’t reached that monstrous level of power necessary to be able to overlook the power gap of four whole cultivation levels.

“However, as long as I advance into the Fifth Heaven and add the Divine Demon Sword, I can definitely fight equally against an Eighth Heaven Celestial King1. Even if Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings decide to make a move, I will still be able to escape easily.” Ling Han smiled.

After so many years, he was finally about to reach the pinnacle in terms of Regulations, reaching the strongest level in the traditional sense.

“Follow me!” said the Yin River Celestial King. As soon as the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had left the scene, he was the undisputed leader of the younger generation.

Yang Xiaoling had no objection, and when Zhao Shuang saw that Ling Han also had no objection, he naturally would not be objecting, either.

‘Let’s go then.’
