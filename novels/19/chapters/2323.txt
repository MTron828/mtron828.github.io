Chapter 2323 Using the Ancestral King blood, consecutive breakthroughs

They would definitely kill You Yuan to keep the secret. Thus, they were already being extraordinarily merciful to be willing to leave him an intact corpse.

You Yuan was unafraid. He was a Monarch Star. As long as their cultivation level was equal, he would be invincible.

“Just in time. I can test myself on you guys!” he declared menacingly. Before he killed Ling Han, he would use these five people as a sacrificial offering.

“How could the spatial passageway have crumbled for no reason?” Ling Han, the Empress, and the others also appeared in a small forest. There was a massive spot after an explosion where they landed, and was completely barren.

The chaotic stream of spatial energy that had seeped out when they had rushed out had caused such great damage. “Was someone sniping us from behind?” the Empress asked.

Their group had obtained the Ancestral King blood, which would definitely be coveted by others. Then, it was not impossible that they would be tailed so someone could make a move on them.

“That should be it.” Ling Han nodded.

“Then, should we now go and meet up with the others?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.

“Let’s go.” They traveled a few days, and did not encounter Yuan or Qi Shuang, yet Wally turned back to human form first.

“I have already finished the modifications,” he said as light shot from his eyes, forming a screen in front of him. Immediately, endless scenes flashed past.

In his previous studies of the refinement technique for Ancestral King blood, Ling Han had already had a vague grasp, and now seeing Wally’s demonstration, he couldn’t help but nod repeatedly. With a combination of the two, he had extremely large gains.

He did not walk any further, and said, “I have to study it first.”

He entered into the Black Tower, and comprehended the technique beneath the Reincarnation Tree. Only a day later, he began the refinement of the Ancestral King’s blood.

The first time ended in failure.

Second time was also a failure.

Third time...

He failed endlessly. Thankfully, there were many Ancestral King corpses inside the Black Tower. Even if he failed a few hundred times, it would not completely use up his Ancestral King blood supply. After all, he would only take a bit every time.

By his 26th attempt, Ling Han finally succeeded.

Actually, this was alchemy, using medicinal ingredients to dispel the dominating factors inside the Ancestral King blood so that it could be used by cultivators that had low cultivation levels.

In a single stroke, he had refined several hundred portions, and only then did he stop for a rest.

“I have deduced the refinement technique of Ancestral King blood essence based on this.” Only then did Wally speak slowly. He really had extremely good patience, finally saying his next words after such a long time.

“Give it to me.” Ling Han was elated. He had just about “used” an Ancestral King, but still had no idea how to handle the blood essence.

Wally did not have the habit of keeping others hanging. Immediately, he handed the new refinement technique over to Ling Han.

Ling Han stayed another several days under the Reincarnation Tree, and then continued to start refining Ancestral King blood essence.

Because he had already gained a certain amount of experience, he had only failed seven times, and then already refined the Ancestral King blood essence.

“However, even if it is refined, the energy in the blood essence is too shocking. It can still only be used after advancing into Ascending Origin Tier.” Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head, feeling slightly sorry. The effects of blood essence were stronger than ordinary Ancestral King blood essence’s by who knew how many times, yet he could not use it now. It was truly a pity. “Come, everyone. Let’s not journey first. I have something for you!”

Ling Han gave a lot to them. He supplied Ancestral King blood just like it was ordinary wine, bottle by bottle. Whoever wanted it just had to directly rub a bottle of it on themselves.

The women naturally followed his lead. Since Ling Han said that they should pause their journey, everyone naturally stopped with no worries, and began cultivating with the Ancestral King blood.

“Our cultivation level is too low. In the Thousand Academy Tournament, there should be a great many people whose strength is superior to ours. Hence, what is important now is to increase our cultivation level.”

Ling Han and the others rubbed the Ancestral King blood on themselves, and then began comprehending Dao beneath the Reincarnation Tree. An astonishing amount of energy as well as the martial comprehension of an Ancestral King were contained in the Ancestral King blood. After dispelling the murderous and dominating aura inside, it was an extremely precious treasure for a cultivator, comparable to a Celestial King Tier Great Herb.

... Just how many Celestial King Tier Great Herbs were there?

In history, aside from a super great war breaking out between two realms, having so many Ancestral Kings die in a single battle would only be that time when Ling Han had killed them with trickery, so his gains were astonishing.

Only a month later, Ling Han had reached the peak stage of the Third Secret. He consumed a Thousand Year Dream Pill, and entered into the Timestream, arriving at the place where time ended. He harvested the power of time there to build his Fourth Secret palace. Then, he began to endure the heavenly tribulation.

After successfully advancing to the Fourth Secret, Ling Han did not stop, but rather continued using Ancestral King blood to increase his cultivation level.

However, though Ancestral King blood was precious, it could not be used continuously, or its effects would diminish, but Ling Han was very wealthy, and was not concerned at all. All he wanted was the swift advancement of his cultivation level.

Hence, he was spending very lavishly. Anyone beneath Celestial King Tier would be throwing up blood at this. You were really too f****** wasteful.

Yet Ling Han was completely unconcerned. He had lots of Ancestral King corpses, so what was the point of retaining them?

Moreover, wouldn’t he still have Ancestral King blood essence after advancing to the Ascending Origin Tier?

What was the most important now was cultivation level.

“If you raise your cultivation level so swiftly, your foundations will be unstable,” Wally told him truthfully.

Ling Han nodded. “I know. I will turn around to re-cultivate my foundations after I have cultivated the Eleventh Secret, and only after I have perfected my foundations will I then break through to the Ascending Origin Tier.” Without a sufficient cultivation level, he could only use the Divine Demon Sword to intimidate his enemies. This did not correspond to his dao heart.

Having his own strength was what it meant to be truly strong.

The cultivation of the Empress and the others also soared madly. With how valuable the Ancestral King blood was, and how it was spent on them like it was worth nothing now, it would be strange if their cultivation levels did not increase madly.

Of course, the fastest was Ling Han. After all, he was the true owner of the Origin Magic Cube, and had once been an overlord of a realm, so his knowledge of Regulations surpassed that of everyone else.

The Empress and the others had just advanced to the Sixth Secret, but Ling Han had already rushed to the Fifth Secret. Furthermore, it was like this speed could not be inhibited at all. Without the slightest pause, it instead became even faster.

When Ling Han advanced to the Fifth Secret, he had also cultivated the Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique, which allowed him to turn himself into the flow of time. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It not only could be used in battle, but could also help Ling Han truly grasp the secrets of Time, and he would be able to speed up his own time, as if he had entered into a Time Cultivation Chamber, and greatly increase the speed of his cultivation.

The Sixth Secret, Seventh Secret, Eighth Secret, Ninth Secret, Tenth Secret!

Ling Han’s rate of cultivation was shockingly fast. It could not be helped. Who asked him to possess the Ancestral King blood, the Origin Magic Cube, and the Reincarnation Tree?

In just a mere 50 years, he had already soared from the Third Secret all the way to the Tenth Secret. No one would be able to believe this if he told them.

The Empress and Hu Niu had also attained this cultivation level, but none of them had been able to advance into the Eleventh Secret. This would need too much accumulation of energy, and even if they possessed Ancestral King blood, they would still be unable to make the leap in a single step. As for Bewitching Maiden Rou, she stopped at the Sixth Secret. Her potential could only allow her to go so far, and being able to reach the Sixth Secret was already extremely remarkable.

“Looks like we will not be able to break through for the moment. Let us find and meet up with the others first.”

They set out. Of course, they headed to a city nearby. If they still could not find Qi Shuang or Yuan, they would have to go to the Four Splendor Academy by themselves. In any case, there was still around 40 years of time left, and they would not miss out on this great event.

They were in a mountainous area, and had only found a mountain village after traveling for a good few days. Upon inquiry, they found out that they had completely gone against their original goal. The nearest city was in the opposite direction.

After making some adjustments, they set out once more on their journey.

“Ba, I’ve finally found you!” A cold voice rang out.

It was You Yuan.
