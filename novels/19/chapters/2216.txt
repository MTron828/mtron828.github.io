Chapter 2217: Timestream

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Time was the most mysterious power.

Time could not be reversed. Even the most powerful person would not dare to trace back time, and attempt to reverse the past, affecting the present, and destabilizing the future.

Yet now, the powerful figures discovered that someone had actually entered into the Timestream, and was actually going against the flow.

They were all stunned, and then extended their divine sense to execute a search in the Timestream.

“So, it is the spirits that have entered into the Timestream.”

“The effects of the Thousand Year Dream Pill.”

“The past cannot be changed, as it would affect the present and the future.”

“However, the Thousand Year Dream Pill has actually appeared again?”

“This is a forbidden pill recipe. The heavens forbids it from appearing as it would incur jealousy from the heavens. It was lost long ago.”

“The five of them… Have they gained the fortune of the heaven and earth?”

The powerful figures communicated with their divine senses for a while, and then withdrew their gazes. Even if they were all Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, they could not go against the Timestream. This was a taboo of heaven and earth, and even they could not accomplish that.

Ling Han and his group went against the flow of the Timestream. They saw the development of the universe and stars, but not very clearly. Everything flashed by too fast.

However, their speed was still increasing, getting faster and faster, such that they couldn’t even see any kind of scene, only the time endlessly falling back. When their speed had reached the pinnacle, past, present, and future had lost all meaning, and speed itself was also meaningless.

Weng, they suddenly shifted from extreme speed to absolute stasis. Everything around them had become grotesque and variegated, filled with bright colors, yet impossible to describe at all.

Was this the Time Mystery Realm?

As per what Small Tower had said, Ling Han began taking steps and walking.

At present, he was only a spirit, and there was no such thing as form. He could manifest into any kind of form or shape he wished, but he had still taken his own form. Not only he, the Empress, Bewitching Maiden Rou, and the Rain Emperor were all in their own forms, yet they all looked like masses of light, with a kind of vagueness about them.

Hu Niu was different. In one instant, she had become a drifting cloud, and in the next she had become a pig, a dog, and then would turn into Ling Han’s form. She was having a lot of fun.

They opened their mouths to speak, and it was direct communication through divine sense. No matter how far they were from each other, they could communicate their intent to another person instantly.

“Continue onwards,” Ling Han said.

They walked, and only after a while, a raging great river appeared ahead of them.

The river water was extremely strange. There were actually suns, moons, and stars floating in the water, and change of time was flowing.

“The Timestream!” They were all shocked.

At first, the Timestream was only a kind of analogy, but they did not think that there really was such an existence, now unfolding in front of their eyes.

“Don’t touch it,” Ling Han warned. “Time cannot be reversed. We are in spirit form, and cannot disturb time, but even with the slightest touch, we will be assimilated by time, and will never be able to return to our physical bodies.”

These words had been spoken by Small Tower very seriously.

The Rain Emperor and the others all nodded their heads. Even if Hu Niu was slightly reluctant, she still expressed agreement with a pout.

They went upstream of the Timestream. In the river water, they could see events that had happened endless eons ago. However, they could not really decipher most of the events. The scenes were too scattered and fragmented, and there was not much use in doing so, either.

“What I want to know is how the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable died. Additionally, the breakout of the storm of darkness eight epochs ago.”

The Timestream was organized in sequence. The closer they were to the source, the longer ago the events would have happened.

The five of them traced the ages.?Boom, all of a sudden, a wave emerged, surging towards the five of them.

“Step aside!” Ling Han quickly moved, grabbing the three women simultaneously, and then rapidly retreated. The Rain Emperor’s reaction speed was not slow at all, and he practically moved at the same time that Ling Han did.

“If you are even touched by the water of the Timestream, an instant would be eternity. You would be lost in eternal time.”

This was the most mysterious and noblest power of the heaven and earth.

Time could be traced back, but definitely could not be touched, as it would affect the present, and change the future.

“One epoch.”

“Two epochs.”

“Three epochs.”

“…”

It was unknown how long they had walked for. In this passage of time, time itself was meaningless. There was no past or future here, only present—no matter where Ling Han and his group walked to, that would be the present.

“Eight epochs ago!”

They had finally walked to a crucial point, but they immediately looked disappointed.

This stretch of the Timestream was actually completely blurred, like water that had been disturbed.

“Why can’t it be seen?” Hu Niu asked curiously.

“Could it be that this period of history is too important, so the heaven and earth do not permit watching?” Ling Han guessed.

As it implicated a Heavenly Venerate, it was naturally very important.

“Let’s go. Perhaps we can see more clues ahead.”

They continued onwards, walking on the banks of the Timestream.

In the Timestream, they saw a great many powerful figures that would shake the world in the future, like the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha and the Imperial Void Celestial King, which helped Ling Han to finally gain a further understanding of these mighty figures.

Thus, they traced back endlessly like this, but there would be occasional lapses in time, burying some major events deeply.

10 epochs, 50 epochs, 100 epochs!

The Celestial Realm was chillingly old. They had walked past 100 epochs, and still they had not reached the end. The Timestream was still flowing vigorously. However, there were lapses of time everywhere, hiding who knew how many truths.

140 epochs!

They had finally arrived at the end of the Timestream. A grassy plain appeared ahead of them. There were blades of grass growing, but upon closer look, the grass would be wilting soon. Some grass seeds had fallen, and very soon new grass would be sprouting and growing, the cycle repeating itself.

At first, Ling Han was unconcerned, but he was then stunned.

The green grass… was actually all Celestial medicines!

Just how long could Celestial medicines be alive?

If it was a Celestial King Tier Great Herb, even it living a whole epoch would not be anything strange. But in this place, as far as the eye could see, these Celestial medicines had only lived a mere several breaths from birth to wilting.

Just what kind of frightening flow of time was this?

“If we enter, would we also instantly age?” The Empress could tell this, her heart wary.

“No.” Ling Han shook his head. “We have ingested the Thousand Year Dream Pill, and while the medicinal effects are active, there is no way anything will happen to us.”

They advanced, passing the Timestream, and entering that grassy plain. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As expected, they were protected by a mysterious power, and were not corroded by the power of time.

The grassy plain was astonishingly huge. They walked and walked, and quietly kept account of the time. Perhaps over 100 years had passed, but the grassy plain was still that same grassy plain. Turning their heads, they could see that the edge of the grassy plain was actually right behind them.

In other words, they had walked for over 100 years, but in truth, they hadn’t progressed the slightest bit forwards.

In this place, time was a mess, coexisting with chaos and order.

Weng!

A terrifying power surged out, and a strong chill rose up in Ling Han and his group at the same time. It was as if they had fallen into an ice cave. Even their souls were instantly frozen.

In the skies, an eye appeared.

The bizarre thing was that this was just a slitted eye, with the white of the eye golden, while the pupil was silver. Indescribable seals flickered, as if it was interpreting the secrets of time.

This slitted eye swept a look over Ling Han and his group.?Weng, a Divine Sword fell out of the eye, blooming into countless cold blades that struck out at Ling Han and his group.

Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not attack in the Timestream. This would reverse the past and present, and change the future.

Only a Heavenly Venerate would not be affected by the Regulations, and could do as they liked.

Hiss, this was actually a move from a Heavenly Venerate!

Most likely future as compared to the past, so it’s still past..
