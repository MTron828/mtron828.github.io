Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Sorry, Senior, I forgot about you. This underling was calling the large black dog.”

The black donkey didn’t truly try to mess with him. It quickly stepped off him, and said, “Zhou Heng praised you to heaven and back, but after observing you left and right, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything special about you.”

‘Zhou Heng?’

Ling Han was slightly surprised, saying, “Senior, you have a good relationship with Zhou Heng?”

“Heh, I single-handedly raised that brat!” the black donkey said in a smug voice.

Ling Han involuntarily glanced at the large black dog as he silently nodded in his mind. These two were definitely identical in personality. They weren’t afraid of drowning in their own bullsh*t.

“Brat, what’s with that look?!” the large black dog and the black donkey instantly exclaimed in unison.

‘As expected.’

“Did Senior Zhou Heng have any instructions for me?” Ling Han asked.

The black donkey was slightly surprised, and it replied, “Indeed. The brat Zhou Heng indeed told me to deliver some words to you. You’re quite smart, huh?”

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “Has Senior Zhou Heng gone to the Realm Battlefield?”

The black donkey nodded, and replied, “Recently, the attacks of Hysteria have suddenly become increasingly wild and violent. An astonishing number of Heavenly Venerates have gone over to deal with it. In fact, Hysteria has even launched some new attacks that we’ve never encountered before, so we’ve suffered very large losses. Because of this, the high-level Heavenly Venerates have all gone over to keep watch.”

“How grave is the situation?” Ling Han asked in a solemn voice. The Realm Battle was intricately linked with every single person. Once Hysteria breached their defenses, the entire Genesis World would fall.

“Brat, this isn’t something that you should be worrying about now,” the black donkey chided. “Aren’t you curious about the message that the brat Zhou Heng left for you?”

Only at this moment did Ling Han say, “Of course I’m curious.”

The black donkey couldn’t help but feel stifled. Judging from the brat’s expression, it was clear that he wasn’t especially curious. He was simply acting in a perfunctory manner.

“The brat Zhou Heng said that if you’re not looking to raise your cultivation quickly, you can very well stay in the martial academy and advance in a slow and steady manner. However, if you want to soar to the Ninth Heaven in the shortest time possible, you can indeed go to a certain place,” the black donkey said anyway.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. “What place?”

“A very dangerous place. A single misstep can consign you to eternal doom,” the black donkey said with seriousness.

Not only was Ling Han unafraid, but he became even more excited. “Please tell me, Senior.”

The black donkey shook his head, saying, “Your reaction is truly just as Zhou Heng predicted. You’re indeed interested in that place.”

Ling Han chuckled upon hearing this. The large black dog and the black donkey were like carbon copies of each other, yet he and Zhou Heng were also extremely similar people.

What did it matter that the place was riddled with dangers? Dangers would definitely be accompanied by opportunities. Moreover, wasn’t overcoming dangers and improving oneself the best method of cultivation?

“That place… is called the Celestial King Graveyard,” the black donkey said.

“Graveyard?” Ling Han wore a strange expression as he looked at the black donkey. This donkey wasn’t telling him to rob graves, was it?

“It’s not a true graveyard. Instead, far too many Celestial Kings have died there, so it’s akin to a graveyard.” The black donkey pondered for a moment before continuing, “Mm-hm, it should actually be called an unmarked burial ground. Many Celestial Kings aren’t even buried.”

Ling Han was astonished. “Just what kind of place is this?”

“In the beginning, this was a prison that held some of the most depraved and sinister Celestial Kings,” the black donkey explained.

“Since they were depraved and sinister, why weren’t they directly executed?” Ling Han asked.

The black donkey shook its head, and replied, “Some Celestial Kings have an extremely powerful background, so many problems will be caused if they’re executed.”

Ling Han fully understood at this moment. In this day and age, people with powerful backgrounds wouldn’t be executed no matter how severe their crimes. At the most, they would only be banished and locked up. Of course, this was unless some paramount being acted quickly to execute them in the commotion.

However, with the threat of Hysteria, everyone’s aim was naturally to resist Hysteria’s invasion. Because of this, they naturally needed to unite their elite forces. They couldn’t cause strife because of one or two Celestial Kings, could they?

“It’s because of this that the Celestial King Prison appeared,” the black donkey said with a nod. It knew that Ling Han had already made sense of the situation. “With the passing of time, the number of Celestial Kings in that prison also increased. Along with it, the prison also expanded in size.

“That’s a land with no rules and no regulations. It’s a land that’s overflowing with slaughter, violence, and darkness. Perhaps just a single wrong glance can trigger a battle of life and death.

“At some point in time, a Celestial King surprisingly snuck into that place, aiming to train himself. In just 100,000,000 years, he directly rose from the Fourth Heaven to the Ninth Heaven. When he reappeared and spoke of his experiences, he caused a huge commotion.

“Many Celestial Kings tried to emulate him. However, with more people sneaking in, this phenomenon was naturally discovered by the Celestial Kings inside the prison. Thus, these people face brutal and cruel slaughter.

“In that place, Celestial Kings fall every day. The corpses of Celestial Kings are littered everywhere. However, nurtured by the blood of Celestial Kings, that place is also home to more Celestial medicines than anywhere else.

“Brat, do you still want to go?”

The black donkey looked at Ling Han, continuing, “If you choose to go, then you’ll be responsible for your own life and death! In fact, in order to prevent Heavenly Venerates from interfering and saving people, several Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates came together to form a restriction. This land is easy to enter, but extremely difficult to exit.

“I also can’t appear when you encounter perilous dangers. Only when the promised time arrives can I come over to pick you up.”

A grin instantly spread across Ling Han’s face. “Of course I want to go!”

The black donkey grimaced, and said, “You’re not going to mull over this for a while longer?”

“No need!” Ling Han said in a resolute manner.

The black donkey huffed and puffed, saying, “It was predicted by that brat Zhou Heng again! I’ve lost again! Arrrgh! You stinky brat! Will mulling over this for a while longer kill you?!”

Flames were blowing from the black donkey’s nose. This was a power transcendent above the Regulations. In fact, this was terrifying fundamental power.

Ling Han, the Empress, and the large black dog hurriedly retreated. Only Wally watched on with keen interest. His eyes gleamed, and it was as if he wanted to uncover the theory and equations behind this power.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I’m truly sorry, senior donkey.”

After venting its frustration for a while, the donkey suddenly chuckled, and said, “No worries. As long as I send you away, can’t I say anything that I want?”

In other words… the donkey was going to lie.

‘F*ck! Just what kind of Heavenly Venerate is this? How utterly shameless!’

There was a glimmer in the large black dog’s eyes, and he suddenly leaped over to hug the black donkey’s leg, saying, “Brother, Grandpa Dog has finally found an idol. From today on, I’ll become your follower!”

The black donkey was extremely smug. This was the epitome of shamelessness.

Ling Han was rendered speechless. The two of them would screw over heaven knew how many people in the future.

He turned to the Empress, and asked, “What about you?”

She didn’t speak, simply replying with a dazzling smile.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. The Empress would definitely advance and retreat with him. Moreover, he possessed a Spatial Celestial Tool now, and even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would have great difficulty trying to damage it. Thus, it was fairly safe for the Empress and the others to follow him.

Of course, this was as long as he could keep himself safe.

“Brat, you definitely can’t reveal your true identity after entering the Celestial King Graveyard. The Celestial Kings there have been locked up for far too long, so many of them have gone cuckoo in the head. Moreover, murders occur every day, so all of the people there are crazy psychopaths. They absolutely abhor Celestial Kings from the outside world who go there to train.

“So, if you’re exposed, you’ll be hunted by everyone. It’ll be useless even if you have three heads and six arms and even if you’ve reached the Ninth Heaven. With a punch each, they can pummel you into the ground.”

The black donkey warned him of the dangers.

Ling Han nodded, saying, “Rest assured, senior donkey. I’ll definitely be careful.”

“Tsk, rest assured? Just who do you think you are? Are you worthy of my worry?” the black donkey said with a snicker.

However, Ling Han chuckled upon hearing this. The black donkey was just like the large black dog. They were indeed detestable, yet they also had their soft side. However, they would always hide this side of themselves and purposefully speak in a depraved manner.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
