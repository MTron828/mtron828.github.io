Chapter 2581: Tamed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han scraped off a tiny bit of the Ascending Dragon Pill before examining it with his divine sense. However, it was naturally difficult to determine what ingredients had been used and what refinement processes had been employed.

He placed it inside his mouth and tasted it, and this instantly caused enlightenment to flash across his eyes. It was as if the Great Dao were before him, within touching distance.

It was no wonder that this pill could increase the chance of advancing through the Celestial King Tier. Its effects were truly heaven-defying.

He called Tang Yuan over, and started to ask him about the Ascending Dragon Pill.

“Where did you get it from?”

Tang Yuan’s reply was extremely simple. “My father gave it to me.”

As for where Tang Mingbo had obtained it from? The Azure Ghost Celestial King.

Ling Han stroked his chin. If he wanted to obtain the pill recipe of the Ascending Dragon Pill, perhaps he had to seek out the Azure Ghost Celestial King?

The person who had invented the Ascending Dragon Pill was definitely a genius among geniuses. According to Tang Yuan, every single city in the Celestial King Graveyard had Ascending Dragon Pills. Even though they were astoundingly dear, they were certainly not hard to find.

‘Strange.

‘This kind of precious alchemical pill should be extremely few in number.’

However, it was a shame that Wally wasn’t present. Otherwise, Ling Han could get him to analyze the pill. In terms of this, Wally was countless times more capable than him, a grand alchemist. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If he had a chance, he would need to take a look around the mansion of the Azure Ghost Celestial King.

In fact, it was most likely no secret that he had forced Luo Fuming to retreat. Thus, it was possible that the Azure Ghost Celestial King was already aware of his existence, and had intentions of recruiting him.

However, why hadn’t he seen the Azure Ghost Celestial King yet?

Perhaps he was busy with other matters, so he had no time to deal with Ling Han right now.

It wasn’t long before Lu Li gave a reply, accepting Tang Yuan’s challenge. Tang Yuan was ecstatic upon hearing this. He had waited for so long, and it was finally time for him to exact revenge.

They agreed to hold the battle in three days’ time. This would be a battle between Blood Martial Kings, so it was only natural that it would gather a lot of attention. When the tournament ground released news of this, it instantly sent countless people into a frenzy.

If someone were to conduct a survey, they would quickly discover that there was one-sided support for Shi Yuan, Lu Li’s Blood Martial King.

Why was this?

This was because Ling Han’s taunting behavior had been far too detestable, causing his popularity to plummet. In fact, everyone in Ghost King City wanted to see him killed. However, in another sense, this was also a sign of his draw power. Otherwise, would there be so many people paying attention to him?

Being infamous was also a sign of fame.

The day finally arrived, and with it, a flood of spectators. The tickets to enter were pushed to an astonishing price, yet they were still extremely difficult to get a hold of.

Ling Han was called out after waiting in the resting area for a while. After becoming a Blood Martial King, he was afforded much better treatment. Meanwhile, his opponent also appeared at the same time.

Shi Yuan—a Blood Martial King who had already achieved nine victories. Taking into account the fact that victories would be deducted after a loss, his achievement was truly something to be proud of. However, even Niu Da and Niu Er had been slain by Ling Han, so it would truly be a miracle if Shi Yuan, a Third Heaven Celestial King, could achieve victory against Ling Han.

The commentator was introducing them at the moment, and the spectators were all fervently cheering for Shi Yuan. Meanwhile, Ling Han felt bored out of his mind. This person had a lower cultivation level than him, so how could he excite Ling Han’s fighting spirit?

In the stands, however, Tang Yuan couldn’t feel more different. He was filled with excitement. In fact, he would be delighted even if Ling Han were only pummeling a Mountain River Tier weakling. After all, this signified his victory over Lu Li.

And that A’Yuan!

He furiously clutched the arms of his chair. He would have that person dead!

However, it was a slight blemish that Lu Li hadn’t come even though he had accepted the challenge.

Perhaps he had foreseen a loss, so he had decided against coming lest he was humiliated before everyone.

A sneer tugged at Tang Yuan’s lips as this thought flashed across his mind.

The battle began, and sure enough, Shi Yuan was convincingly killed by Ling Han in just a few exchanges.

“Do you feel extremely ecstatic? Perhaps you want to rub this in my face?” Lu Li’s voice suddenly sounded behind him.

Tang Yuan faltered for a moment before feeling immense delight. He had never imagined that he would one day feel happy hearing the voice of Lu Li.

Haha! He had won this battle, so wouldn’t it be a shame if there was no one for him to humiliate?

He immediately turned around, and was just about to speak. However, shock quickly spread across his face.

This was because he saw not only Lu Li, but also Yang Xiaoling.

This was a poisonous spider who could rank in the top three among all of the second-generation young masters. Right now, however, she was like an obedient wife as she accompanied Lu Li. Moreover, one of Lu Li’s hands was beneath her dress, wantonly playing with her breasts.

‘This…!’

Tang Yuan understood that Yang Xiaoling was a bold and unrestrained person who had astonishingly unconstrained sexual relationships. However, it was only ever she who toyed with other men. Thus, how was it possible that she was being toyed with by Lu Li at this moment?

In terms of strength, Yang Xiaoling was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, far more powerful than Lu Li. In terms of background, Celestial King Yang Que was also far more powerful than Lu Gaoquan. There was a ranking among the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, with the Azure Ghost Celestial King being first, and Yang Que and Dongfang Po being second and third, respectively. The gulf between them wasn’t great.

Meanwhile, Lu Gaoquan was only ranked around 10th, not too different from Tang Yuan’s own father.

Thus, what right did Lu Li have to wantonly toy with Yang Xiaoling?

It was precisely this confusion that caused a cold chill to run down Tang Yuan’s spine.

Lu Li sat down, and Yang Xiaoling kneeled down next to him, giving him a massage. She was as obedient as a maidservant.

“Tang Yuan, are you shocked?” he asked with a smile.

In fact, it wasn’t only Tang Yuan who was astonished. Even Zhao Shuang was rendered completely speechless. The scene before them was incomprehensible and almost impossible to believe.

“I always live up to my words!” Lu Li said smugly.

Before, he had said that Yang Xiaoling would enter his bed. By the looks of things now, this had become a reality. Yang Xiaoling was like a prostitute as she followed him, and did she still have a sliver of dignity left?

Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang were both speechless with shock. They would need to spend several days to digest this.

“Tang Yuan, your level is far too low, so I can’t be bothered playing around with you anymore,” Lu Li said in disdain. “However, since you insist on playing, I’ll satisfy your desire.

“I’ll give you a chance… Kneel!”

Tang Yuan immediately humphed upon hearing this. Was this a joke? Even though he didn’t know why Yang Xiaoling was as obedient as a dog, Yang Xiaoling was Yang Xiaoling, and he was himself. How could he yield to Lu Li?

To say nothing of Lu Li, he wouldn’t even yield to the Yin River Celestial King!

“In your dreams, Lu Li!”

Lu Li roared with laughter, saying, “Why don’t we make a bet? Tonight, you’ll definitely come to my residence, and you’ll kneel down to me like a dog! Oh, that’s right, don’t forget to bring your own dog when you come. I’m quite interested in him.”

“I said, you’re dreaming! Wake up, will you?” Tang Yuan said coldly.

“Heh, see you tomorrow.” Lu Li stood up and left.

Yang Xiaoling obediently followed him, and it was as if she had replaced A’Yuan. However, there was fury and humiliation hidden in her eyes.

After a while, Tang Yuan looked at Zhao Shuang, and said, “Did that really just happen?”

“It wasn’t someone disguised as Sister Ling, right?” Zhao Shuang asked. He couldn’t accept this, either.

Tang Yuan shook his head, and said, “Wearing a disguise is easy. However, where would one find a female Fourth Heaven Celestial King? Moreover, who dares to impersonate Sister Ling?”

“What… in the world happened with Lu Li? How did he obtain such astonishing power?” Zhao Shuang sucked in a sharp breath. His hands and feet felt ice-cold, and he paused for a moment before asking, “Will you go?”

Tang Yuan humphed, and replied, “Even if that was truly Sister Ling, she’s Yang Xiaoling, and I’m Tang Yuan. He wants me to yield? Pei! That’s impossible! He wants me to become his dog? I’d rather die!”

However, Zhao Shuang didn’t dare to agree blindly. “Just what kind of temperament does Sister Ling have? Yet, she was still completely tamed by Lu Li. Tang Yuan, don’t be so sure of yourself!”

Tang Yuan didn’t reply. He had his own pride and dignity. What did it matter even if Lu Li became a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? His father was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so what did he need to be afraid of?
