Chapter 3324: The Demonic Rat is showing off his might

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

General Hengtian was one of the few elites of Inscription Tier, and he was actually covered with injuries. He was in an extremely sorry state.

What was going on here?

Who in the world could wound him, and injure him to this extent?

Tang Yue and the other descendants of General Hengtian all exclaimed in shock. This was the pillar of support for their Tang Clan. If General Hengtian collapsed, the glory of the Tang Clan would also be gone.

“Subject Tang, what powerful enemy have you encountered?” Chen Fengyan asked softly.

“Your Majesty, it’s a Demonic Rat!” General Hengtian said with a bow.

Everyone in the world only knew that the Holy Emperor was the strongest elite, but only those with powerful strength like them knew that this Holy Emperor was more than ten thousand miles ahead of everyone else.

In front of Chen Fengyan, he only wanted to worship him.

Chen Fengyan gave an “oh”, and said, “Tell me the details.”

“Yes.” General Hengtian nodded, and said, “I was ordered to eliminate the Demonic Beasts that destroyed the villages. I finally encountered them two days ago, but when I led my troops to meet them, I was severely wounded.”

A look of grief appeared on his face, and he said, “The three thousand elite troops that I brought were all killed. In order to report the strength of the Demonic Rat to Your Majesty, I fled with my life. Please punish me, Your Majesty!”

Chen Fengyan’s expression was slightly dark. Three thousand elite soldiers had all been killed, and this caused a stabbing pain in his heart.

And hearing the words of General Hengtian, everyone was extremely shocked. The one who defeated General Hengtian was actually a Demonic Beast?

Hiss, what Demonic Beast was so outrageously bold that it actually dared to commit a crime in the Dark North Nation?

However, he was very strong. This was General Hengtian that he had defeated.

“Subject Tang, you don’t have to blame yourself. It’s not your fault,” Chen Fengyan said. He looked to the west, and continued, “Moreover, we’ll be able to exact revenge soon.”

‘What?’

General Hengtian couldn’t help but turn around to look, only to see a black shadow shuttling over from the sky.

This was a massive rat, about the size of a normal human. It flew over like a streak of light, without any rise or fall in its course at all.

Fly, flying?

A Demonic Rat that could fly?

They clearly hadn’t seen any wings on it, so how could it fly?

Hiss, did this mean that its cultivation level had reached an indescribable level, that it could even fly physically?

“Gagaga!” The rat released a strange laugh, “So, this so-called emperor is here!”

Ling Han’s heart clenched. Sure enough, this was the Demonic Rat that had escaped from the formation. Compared to that day, its strength had increased by who knew how many times. After leaving its weakened state, it was so powerful that it could make one lose all hope.

Would even an Enlightenment Tier elite possess such strength?

“How dare you!” Grand Tutor Hong and Yang Bai immediately rebuked harshly.

“Two minor characters who are only in the Inscription Tier dare to be impudent in front of Lord Rat?” The Demonic Rat said coldly, “What General Hengtian, what shameless boasting. He was smacked down by Lord Rat with a single paw. If it weren’t for the fact that I wanted to use him to lead the way, I would have killed all of you. Do you think that this kind of trash would be able to escape from Lord Rat?”

Hiss!

Hearing these words, everyone felt a chill run down their spines.

This Demonic Rat was obviously aiming for the Holy Emperor. What kind of confidence did he have that he didn’t even take the Holy Emperor seriously?

However, if its words weren’t false, then even General Hengtian wouldn’t be able to withstand a single strike from it. Just how powerful would his abilities be? He would probably be able to compete with the Holy Emperor.

Neither Grand Tutor Hong nor Yang Bai looked afraid, because Chen Fengyan was standing behind them.

Everyone had this kind of belief in their hearts, and that was as long as their Holy Emperor was present, he would be able to suppress everything.

“After seeing Your Majesty, why aren’t you paying your respects?” Grand Tutor Hong asked coldly.

“Hahaha, just a little kid in Enlightenment Tier, is he worthy of Lord Rat’s respect?” The Demonic Rat laughed loudly, its expression filled with disdain.

“Impudence!” Grand Tutor Hong charged over, his blood and Qi boiling at the first instant. He knew that his strength was definitely inferior to the Demonic Rat, so he had to go all out.

Not only that, but he also took out a sword. Patterns of light flickered, and Sword Qi surged.

“Sigh, this planet has really declined. Just how prosperous had it been in the past? Too bad, too bad!” The Demonic Rat clicked his tongue as he casually waved his front claws. Pa, there was no flash of light, but Grand Tutor Hong was sent flying.

“Sigh, this world has been suppressed too much. It’s already been so many days, and Lord Rat’s strength still hasn’t recovered by one-ten-thousandth!”

Everyone was gaping, completely rendered speechless.

Grand Tutor Hong was an elite of the Inscription Tier, yet he was actually no match for the Demonic Rat!

What was even more shocking was that the Demonic Rat actually didn’t use its full strength.

Heavens, just how terrifying was this Demonic Rat in its strongest state?

Doubt arose in everyone’s minds for the first time. Could the Holy Emperor defeat this Demonic Rat?

It was not that the Holy Emperor was not strong enough, but rather that this Demonic Rat was so terrifyingly heaven-defying.

“Do you also want to be sent flying by Lord Rat?” The Demonic Rat looked at Yang Bai and bared his teeth in a grin, revealing his two massive front teeth.

Yang Bai humphed and didn’t retreat.

“Hehe, Lord Rat’s ears have grown tired of hearing these words these days. Something about how the Holy Emperor is invincible, how the Holy Emperor is invincible in the universe… Lord Rat will show you today that even the so-called Holy Emperor can only prostrate at the feet of Lord Rat!” The Demonic Rat was very arrogant.

It released its own aura, which surged out in all directions like a tsunami wave.

This aura was incredibly terrifying, and even Yang Bai’s body was trembling. It was as if a gust of wind could blow him over.

Even someone as strong as Yang Bai was like this, so there was no need to mention the others. The entire plaza was filled with people kneeling.

It should be known that the people here were all the pillars of support of the Dark North Nation, yet they could not block a sliver of aura from the Demonic Rat. What did this mean?

A Demonic Rat was enough to sweep aside all opposition in the Dark North Nation!

Ling Han was also unable to stand. This pressure was too terrifying, but how could he possibly kneel down in front of a Demonic Rat? He forcibly leaned back, and flopped onto the ground instead.

Just as Yang Bai could no longer hold on, and his spine was about to be bent, pa, a hand stretched out from behind him and pressed down on his shoulder. Instantly, a power circulated, causing him to straighten his back again.

“Your Majesty!” Yang Bai was so excited that he was about to cry. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Chen Fengyan nodded, and said, “Subject Yang, go and rest first.”

“Yes, Your Majesty!” Yang Bai said respectfully. He naturally knew that he was completely no match for this Demonic Rat. He couldn’t even match its aura, and if he stubbornly helped, he would completely be holding Chen Fengyan back.

“Yi?” The Demonic Rat looked surprised, and stared at Chen Fengyan. “How can a mere Enlightenment Tier elite rival Lord Rat’s aura? Unless… you’re not an Enlightenment Tier elite!”

“This is my territory. You killed my citizens, so I’ll make you pay with your life today,” Chen Fengyan said calmly. It was as if he weren’t facing an indescribably powerful Demonic Beast, but rather facing an extremely ordinary Demonic Beast.

“Gagaga, shameless boasting, what shameless boasting!” The Demonic Rat laughed loudly.

Chen Fengyan leaped forward at an indescribable speed, instantly appearing before the Demonic Rat. It was as if he had been standing right there in the first place.

Peng!

Chen Fengyan threw a punch, and the Demonic Rat was sent flying.

One punch, dealt with, f***!
