When the other nine members of the Five Sects ran to the old woman, they all stopped. Each of their faces was covered with ice, with a sliver of indescribable coldness.

The 10 of them had joined forces, and Ling Han still managed to flee. Not only had he successfully fled, he had taken advantage of the time when they had separated to pursue him, and turned the tables around to kill one of them.

It should be known that Ling Han previously had been severely wounded.

What a frightening physique, what frightening recovery ability, what frightening schemes, and what frightening decisiveness!

Faced with this kind of enemy, all nine felt their hearts grow heavy.

“This brat... has to be gotten rid of as soon as possible.”

“That’s right, or we will all have a tragic end!”

The nine of them looked at the old woman’s body, whose head had been smashed, and felt their hearts shudder. They felt sympathy that came from seeing a peer killed in this way. This kind of thing could possibly happen to them as well.

Even the four people from the Heaven’s Sword Palace and Absolute Saber Sect, who had cultivated Sword Heart and Saber Heart and severed their other emotions, unmoved by external factors, could feel a full-body shiver. That was because Ling Han did not only possess the Misty Soul Capturing Flower, but his abilities on their own were even more amazing.

Perhaps Ling Han would have the strength to overthrow the Five Sects in another 100 years.

To Sun Moon Tiers, 100 years’ time was really much too fast, and it was completely impossible that there would appear a genius that could save them from their desperate crisis in the Five Sects in this little bit of time. The time given was much too short.

This was the scary thing about top-grade prodigies. 100 years might only seem like a blink of an eye to you, wherein nothing would change, but for a prodigy, it was enough time for an explosive improvement to appear in their strength.

“Spare no expense, find this brat and kill him!” All nine forced out through gritted teeth. It was no longer a matter of pride, and not about how they could snatch away his fated opportunity after they killed him. It had become a problem of their own survival.

There was no one who would be willing to wait for death, especially in the case of elites like them. They would definitely counterattack madly.

After Ling Han ran a distance away, he once again entered into the Black Tower.

He was very pleased with himself. Despite being ganged up on by 10 elites, he still managed to get rid of one.

“However, this was done with the help of the Misty Soul Capturing Flower, I myself am still not strong enough.” Ling Han very soon suppressed his self-satisfaction, and reflected on himself.

“Three months’ time... is almost up again!”

Small Tower appeared, and informed Ling Han that he could enter into the Immortal Flame Cauldron to temper himself again.

Ling Han shivered, yet still stood up without hesitation. Running in a panic due to being hunted down by the Five Sects caused him to be even more determined to pursue true strength.

He threw himself into the cauldron to be tempered by the immortal flame.

Three days later, Ling Han came out of the cauldron. Naturally, he was still an infant, but looked to be about 10 months old.

“Allow me to correct. If you can maintain this kind of rate of improvement, you will be able to completely grasp Rising From The Ashes after about 100 more times,” Small Tower said.

That was right. A few hundred times dropped to 100 times could be considered a massive improvement.

Yet Ling Han’s expression was still dark. He had to go through this 100 times to be able to complete tempering his body with immortal flame. Just the thought of it made him nauseous.

But he had just tempered his body with the immortal flame, so he forced himself not to think about it!

Ling Han drew out the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill and ate it. This was his main motive in agreeing to temper his body with the immortal flame.

He needed more power.

Under the Reincarnation Tree, three days were equivalent to three years.

Ling Han stood up. His cultivation level had progressed one step further and reached the late stage of the medium extreme, while his battle prowess had soared up to the early stage of the consummate level. Added with the help of heaven’s might and the Divine Demon Sword, he could even fight someone in the late stage of the consummate level.

“However, I will still be a bit weak against an opponent in the peak stage of the consummate level, what more when the Five Sects still have elites whose battle prowess surpasses the peak stage, and their number is very astonishing as well.”

Ling Han was not self-satisfied. If his cultivation level could advance into the consummate level, then he would truly be capable of looking down on the Five Sects.

“I’ll use the trash from the Five Sects to test out my battle prowess.”

Ling Han left the Black Tower, and took the initiative to make trouble with the Five Sects.

The moment he appeared, he found out that the Five Sects had really spared no expense to look for him now. Anyone from Wolf Fang City received a bounty notice. If they found Ling Han, and revealed his location to the Five Sects, they would be given a Realm Spirit Stone as reward.

Though Wolf Fang City had a law that stated that Immortals were not allowed to have internecine strife, the Five Sects were only looking for Ling Han, and did not state that they wanted to do anything to Ling Han... though everyone knew that it definitely would not be anything good.

Though the Two Realm Battlefield was huge, there were also many people. Soon, someone discovered Ling Han’s whereabouts and passed the information to the Five Sects, and the members of the Five Sects immediately charged over.

After a bloody battle, Ling Han successfully broke through the siege. Though he suffered serious injuries, he also took the lives of two elites in the early stage of the consummate level of the other side, showing his character trait of being unwilling to take a loss in the slightest.

This battle brought fear to the Five Sects because they discovered much to their shock that Ling Han had become even stronger.

Only a mere few months had passed, and Ling Han’s power had actually improved so apparently. This was too astonishing.

The Five Sects had gone crazy, and began to search for Ling Han even more urgently, willing to spare no expense to destroy Ling Han. If it was not because they could not pay the price, they even wanted to ask Heavenly Body Tier elites to move, and that would ensure their success.

However, Ling Han went to the camp of the Purple Moon Army.

He had not seen the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden for a long time, and the latter had to know that the Five Sects were currently targeting him. He had to meet the beauty at least once and reassure her.

Holding the token, Ling Han entered into the Purple Moon Army.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was just worrying about him, and had just completed a huge mission with the army. Thus, she decided to ask for a few days of leave, and planned to have a good reunion with Ling Han.

Ling Han was naturally greatly pleased. Unfortunately, he had still not completely grasped Rising From The Ashes at this moment, so his true physique was only as big as a baby of 10 months old. He did not even have the ability to push her down, or have her push him down instead, so he could only be like a eunuch who made a trip to the brothel, unable to do anything.

The couple shared a sweet time, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was extremely stunned by Ling Han’s rate of advancement. She knew that Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor, but he could not have been as fast as this even with Divine Pills.

“Come, I’ll show you something good.”

Ling Han brought the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden into the Black Tower, and showed her the Reincarnation Tree as well as that Saint that could no longer be considered a Saint.

However, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was still extremely stunned.

What kind of good fortune had actually befallen on Ling Han that even the incomplete spirit of a Saint was staying inside his Spatial God Tool? In comparison, the fact that Ling Han possessed a Spatial God Tool seemed to be insignificant because Saints could forge Spatial God Tools. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“When I break through to the Heavenly Body Tier, I can go into seclusion here. But as for now...” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shook her head. Her breakthrough was different as she needed to accumulate the power of her bloodline. This was something that the Reincarnation Tree could not help with.

The couple talked for a while longer before finally coming out of the Black Tower.

Ling Han started a fire, and began barbequing some precious ingredients. He added the Godly medicine from the Black Tower as well as a beard[1] of ginseng from the old ginseng. The old ginseng had plucked it from himself after he advanced into the Sun Moon Tier, so it was really extremely nutritious.

However, to extract all the nutritious essence from this pot of ingredients required a very, very long time.

After about two days, an extraordinary aroma wafted, and could be smelled in a 10 miles’ radius.

Ling Han had just ladled out a bowl of soup for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden when a small beast popped out from who knew where, drooling as it stared at that bowl of soup.

“So adorable!” Instantly, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s eyes lit up.
