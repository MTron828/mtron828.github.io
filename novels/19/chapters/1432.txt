Chapter 1433 All King Tiers!

Zhang Qing was just about to ascend the mountain, yet he suddenly stopped in his tracks, his jaws dropping wide open. It was as if he were struck by disbelief.

Not only him, but everyone in the surroundings was also stunned.

Gazing at the cloud of blood that had once been Liu Shiyuan, then turning to gaze at Ling Han, who was still casually retracting his fist, they felt a sensation of frightening numbness spreading over their bodies. There was also an indescribable chill rising in their hearts. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

That was Liu Juntian’s younger brother!

To put things into perspective, at least several hundred of the cultivators present could insta-kill Liu Shiyuan. However, even if Liu Shiyuan slapped them across the face, most of them would still choose to play along with him, perhaps even sticking their heads forward to let him slap them more. Meanwhile, those who were more courageous and powerful might dodge his slaps. However, in terms of fighting back, no one would dare to even think about this.

This was simply due to one reason—Liu Juntian.

Now, however, someone had actually dared to kill his younger brother! This... The sky was going to collapse!

They could imagine just how wild with rage Liu Juntian would become. Under his wrathful fury, it was even possible that he would kill all of the people present.

Who told them to stand idly by as his brother was killed?

There was bitterness in their minds. Who knew that Ling Han would kill him? Who knew that Ling Han dared to kill him? Moreover, Ling Han was a king tier! Even if they knew he was going to attack, how many of them would be able to stop him?

They were done for... Ling Han had poked a hole in the heavens!

The surrounding cultivators were all as quiet as a mouse. What were they going to do now?

“Y-y-you dare?!” Zhang Qing stammered. He was also stupefied. ‘Even if you’re a king tier, openly killing the younger brother of another king tier is an utter provocation! This is creating a life-and-death feud!

‘Anyhow, where is your courage coming from?! Didn’t you hear Liu Shiyuan say? Liu Juntian is a rank two king tier!

‘Rank two!

‘How many rank two king tiers exist in the world?!’

However, Ling Han didn’t pay any heed to him. Liu Shiyuan had actually dared to speak uncouthly of Empress Luan Xing and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden! How could he tolerate this? To say nothing of Liu Shiyuan, his reaction would have been the same even if it were Liu Juntian who had uttered those words. He would simply respond with a punch.

“Let’s go.” The six of them walked away and started to climb the mountain.

‘Holy f*ck! How domineering!’

These people dared to climb the mountain even though they had killed Liu Juntian’s younger brother. Just how courageous were they?

‘However, are you certain that you can oppose Liu Juntian?’

Although he was only at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, he was already regarded as the number one elite of the Liu Clan. Moreover, he had even been praised by a Saint before. His battle prowess could only be described as peerless.

Zhang Qing was completely flabbergasted. Although he wished that he could kill Ling Han, he couldn’t help but feel impressed by his demeanor. This was the courage that a true king tier should possess! He dared to kill, and he dared to face the turmoils that would arise from such an action. His resolve definitely wouldn’t be swayed by others.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others ascended the mountain, appearing as relaxed as could be.

“Holy f*ck! Am I seeing things?”

“Am I also seeing things?”

“Gasp!”

Everyone drew a cold breath. “All six of them are able to ascend the mountain. Moreover, it appears like they’re all ascending it with ease!”

“Holy motherf*cker! Six king tiers!”

“Heavens!”

They all clasped their heads in astonishment. This was inconceivable! Six king tiers had actually appeared at once!

There were obviously more than six king tiers atop the mountain. However, which of them hadn’t arrived alone? At most, they had only brought with them a few followers. As such, they had all initially thought that the Rain Emperor and the others were merely Ling Han’s followers. Gazing at them now, they realized that the level of followers would have been raised to a completely new level if those five people were truly Ling Han’s followers.

Their incredible power was abundantly clear for all to see. Zhang Qing was also doing his best to climb the mountain, yet he was exerting all of the effort that he could possibly muster. However, the distance between him and Ling Han’s group was steadily growing larger and larger. His body was drenched in sweat, yet he couldn’t catch up to them no matter what. Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others were casually chattering and joking among themselves, appearing as carefree as could be.

If they knew that there were still two king tiers in Ding Ping and Jiuyao—just that they couldn’t ascend the mountain, because they hadn’t reached the Heavenly Body Tier yet—the expressions on their faces would definitely be even more peculiar.

“Which galaxy did they come from? It’s far too terrifying! It actually produced so many king tiers!”

“Perhaps that young man is also a rank two king tier? If that’s the case, he naturally doesn’t need to fear Liu Juntian.”

“Heh, you really have a wild imagination, don’t you? Do you think it’s that easy to become a rank two king tier? There mightn’t even be one such king tier among 10 king tiers!”

“Nothing in the world is absolute. Haven’t you heard the story? In the past, there was a Shi Clan that produced three king tiers. Moreover, they were all rank two king tiers!”

“Er... I’ve naturally heard about that! However, can they compare to the Shi Clan? At that time, the Shi Clan had a Saint! Those king tiers all possessed the bloodline of a Saint!”

“But if he isn’t a rank two king tier, how would he dare to ascend the mountain?”

The people at the foot of the mountain became engaged in a heated debate. Of course, they were even more eager to witness the battle that was about to explode atop the mountain. Once Zhang Qing brought the news of Liu Shiyuan’s death up, a bloody battle would definitely erupt among the king tiers.

This wouldn’t be sparring. Instead, it would be a genuine life-and-death battle!

“Interesting. There’s a hint of pressure from this wind, and it targets one’s divine sense,” Ling Han said.

“This is the doing of a Saint,” the Notionless Saint said. He was the most qualified to speak about this. “I also did something similar in the past, setting up a forbidden region that only king tiers could enter.”

The others all chuckled indifferently. This Saint was very fond of blowing his own trumpet. In the beginning, they had all been startled and astonished by his stories. However, they had all become immune to it now, and they wouldn’t pay much heed to his exaggerated stories.

“As long as one has reached one pinnacle level, they’ll develop an extremely powerful resistance to this might. If they reach two, they can almost ignore this might,” the Rain Emperor said with a nod.

Among them, Empress Luan Xing was the least affected by the might of the wind. She had reached three pinnacle levels, which was an incredibly rare feat, even among Saints. In other words, even if the Star Sand Saint were suppressed to the Heavenly Body Tier, he mightn’t necessarily be able to defeat Empress Luan Xing.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was facing a slight struggle. After all, she hadn’t reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier. Rank one king tiers could only just manage to climb this mountain with ease.

They weren’t climbing quickly, and they were also comprehending the dao of the Saint as they advanced. This might wasn’t just might alone, but also possessed a wisp of the Saint’s dao. Thus, comprehending it would be of some benefit to them.

Zhang Qing was climbing the mountain as if his life depended on it, yet he continued to fall further and further behind Ling Han and the others. Eventually, his figure was blocked by a jutting face of the mountain, rendering him invisible.

15 minutes passed, and Ling Han and the others reached the peak of the mountain.

A flat platform had been forcefully carved into the top of the mountain, and gazing at the cut marks, it was clear that this platform had been carved numerous years ago. Perhaps it was also the doing of that Saint. There were 30 or so people on this peak, though only four of them were women. The remaining people were all men. However, regardless of gender, they were all extremely handsome and beautiful youths. Even though some of them had horns, tails, or wings, this didn’t prevent them from possessing charm and charisma that was capable of bewitching countless people.

This was the demeanor of king tiers.

The king tiers were currently discussing dao, analyzing the transformations of fire-element Regulations. However, upon sensing the new arrivals, they all turned around to look. Seeing Ling Han and the others, they couldn’t help but feel astonished.

Six king tiers had actually arrived at once? Moreover, by the looks of it, they were already very well acquainted with each other. Not only that, but it was also clear that the relationship between them was very good.

This was obvious when looking at the distance between them. If they weren’t friends, who would feel comfortable allowing someone to stand within nine meters of them? After all, they were all king tiers!

At this moment, the king tiers atop the mountain all developed a sense of hostility toward them. This was because this group of king tiers was far too powerful. If they weren’t rank two king tiers, it was possible that they could be easily defeated by this group.

“Friends, I’m Shangguan Heng, the host of this king tier gathering. Dare I ask for your names?” A young man with wings on his back walked over, a warm smile on his face. It was as if he had no feeling of superiority.

Hu! Hu! Hu!

At this moment, Zhang Qing’s figure finally appeared in the distance. He was like an exhausted dog, his mouth wide agape and puffs of white vapor blowing from it. His face was drenched in sweat, and his body was equally as soaked.
