Chapter 3338: Yue Empire

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was great news.

Aside from the Dark North Nation, a powerful force had sent an envoy to the Imperial Capital. Their initial intention was to seek an audience with the Holy Emperor, but the Holy Emperor had once again begun his seclusion, and the Council Chairman had received him on his behalf.

As it turned out, aside from the Dark North Nation, there was another powerful force?

This caused the citizens of the Imperial Capital to feel surprised. They had initially thought that the Dark North Nation was the overlord of the Celestial Sea Planet. Demonic Beasts and the like could only hide deep in the mountains and seas. They had never thought that such a force would suddenly appear.

However, what was going on with this force, and how strong was it?

Coincidentally, Xuanyuan Dingguo came to visit him, so Ling Han asked this

Xuanyuan Dingguo had already broken through to the Extreme Bone Tier. In fact, he could have broken through long ago, and had suppressed his cultivation level for the sake of the Xuanyuan Gang. However, now that a new member of the Xuanyuan Clan would soon enter the academy, he could also successfully retreat.

He laughed mischievously, and said, “You have really asked the right person.

Now, only the descendants of the Four Great Generals and Grand Tutor Hong would be able to come into contact with this kind of secret.

“Stop showing off. Hurry up and tell me,” Ling Han urged.

“That force calls itself the ‘Yue’ Empire,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said.

“How powerful is it?” Ling Han asked again.

“The envoy this time is the son of the Yue Emperor, as well as the descendants of several Great Generals. According to what I’ve found out, the son of the Yue Emperor is an elite of the Enlightenment Tier!” Xuanyuan Dingguo whispered, unable to hide his shock.

Before the battle with the Demonic Rat, everyone thought that the Holy Emperor was also an Enlightenment Tier, and also the only Enlightenment Tier elite of the Dark North Nation. His cultivation level was similar to the cultivation level of the son, so how could he rival the Yue Emperor?

However, to the vast majority of the citizens, in their impression, the Holy Emperor was an existence of Enlightenment Tier. Thus, if the information about the envoy from the Yue Nation spread out, what kind of massive impact would it cause?

Moreover, even though they both had sons, none of Chen Fengyan’s descendants had even reached the Enlightenment Tier yet. However, his descendant had already reached the Enlightenment Tier. With such a comparison, didn’t this show that the Emperor of Yue was even more impressive?

“Then, what does Yue Empire want to do?” Ling Han asked.

“They want to recruit us to become subjects of the Yue Empire,” Xuanyuan Dingguo spat. “They must really be dreaming. Just think about what kind of existence the Holy Emperor is. He’s so domineering and heaven-defying, so how can he become someone else’s subject?”

“However, the Holy Emperor is presently in seclusion, and even the Council Chairman dared not make a rash decision. The decision would have to be made after the Holy Emperor comes out of seclusion.”

Ling Han nodded. This time, the envoy from the Yue Empire had come with ill intentions, and actually wanted to make the Dark North Nation submit to the Yue Empire. They were very ambitious. Furthermore, for such an important matter, only an Imperial Prince had been sent out, and they did not send out anyone like a Great General, which showed how arrogant this Yue Empire was. They were completely not taking the Dark North Nation seriously at all.

Upon further thought, in name, the Dark North Nation only had one Enlightenment Tier elite, and any random Imperial Prince they sent out was also an Enlightenment Tier elite, which showed how powerful the Yue Empire was, so there was naturally a reason for their arrogance.

“Sigh, I don’t know if it’ll lead to a war between nations,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said worriedly.

Yue Empire’s strength was extremely powerful, while Dark North Nation’s only invincible existence was Chen Fengyan. He was only one man, and once a full-out battle broke out, it was very likely that both sides would be severely wounded.

Xuanyuan Dingguo left. He had just broken through, and was in dire need of stabilizing his cultivation level.

Ling Han was the same. He was already at the peak stage of the Third Change. Theoretically, he could already attempt to break through to the Fourth Change, but he needed actual battle to strengthen his foundations.

Where could he participate in actual battle?

The Imperial Hunting Ground was not a bad place. There were Extreme Bone Tier-level Demonic Beasts, but normally, no one was allowed to enter, so this path would not work.

Where else could he go?

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel rueful. Previously, there were a large number of enemies, such as Fang Ziping and Cheng Hu, but why didn’t they appear at this time? If he fought more with such elites, his cultivation level would definitely be stabilized very quickly.

He could only trouble Xuanyuan Dingguo again.

“Practical battle?” Xuanyuan Dingguo pondered for a moment. “There is indeed

such a place, but it’s too dangerous.”

“Where?” Ling Han asked.

“The underground arena,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said. “According to the laws of the Majestic Empire, this isn’t allowed to exist, so it can only be carried out underground in secret. However, this industry is extremely profitable, and I heard that Hong Tianbu has an underground arena.”

“Oh?” Ling Han found this strange, and said, “Hong Tianbu is also short of money?”

Xuanyuan Dingguo smiled, and said, “That’s right. Although Grand Tutor Hong’s salary is quite high, he also has many descendants. Every single person needs a large amount of resources to cultivate. How can it be enough if they don’t get some side jobs?”

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle, and said, “Then the Four Great Generals should be about the same, right?”

-Hehe.” Xuanyuan Dingguo didn’t admit it directly. Instead, he said, “Every clan will more or less have some black income. In the Majestic Empire, this is considered an open secret.”

“Not only the Four Great Generals, but even the various Imperial Princes are involved, especially those that have the ability to contend for the throne. They have a large number of death warriors under their command. Without a large amount of money to spend, who would follow you?”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Then make the arrangements. I’ll go to the underground arena to fight.”

There was no need for him to be reserved with Xuanyuan Dingguo. That was because the pill recipes that he had provided had allowed Xuanyuan Dingguo to make a great profit. At the same time, his status in the Xuanyuan Clan had also soared, and he owed Ling Han a huge favor.

“All right.” Xuanyuan Dingguo nodded, but after some thought, he continued, “However, though your cultivation level is not high, your abilities are too strong. It would be difficult to find an opponent that can match you.” “If it wasn’t difficult, I wouldn’t have to look for you, right?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Haha, just because of your words, I’ll definitely find someone for you,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said.

He left, and after a mere two days, he came to find Ling Han again, and said that everything had been arranged.

At night, Ling Han followed him out of the academy, and arrived at a seemingly ordinary bar. However, after passing the inspection, they entered a secret passage, and as they went downwards, everything suddenly became clear.

This place was very big, and there was an arena in the middle. Its length and width was about 30 meters, and even such a large arena only occupied one fifth of the space, which showed how big this place was.

Right now, there was an intense battle going on in the arena. However, this was only at the level of Meridian Opening Tier. Ling Han glanced at it before retracting his gaze.

This underground arena was very lively, and there were at least over a thousand people watching the tournament. Furthermore, they did not care that the present battle was only Meridian Opening Tier-level. As long as there was blood splattering, it would incite their emotions, and cause them to scream in excitement.

Xuanyuan Dingguo leaned over and whispered, “Those contestants have all committed serious crimes, and each of them can be sentenced to extreme punishment.”

Ling Han nodded. Looks like there was still involvement from the army in this underground arena. Otherwise, how could the criminals on death row be brought here?

Very soon, the battle on the arena came to an end. It ended with one person’s lower abdomen being pierced through, and it would probably be very difficult for him to keep his life.

“Next, our long-victorious champion, Xin Si, versus Ma Jiu, who has been in the limelight recently!” A middle-aged man who looked like a host jumped into the arena, and shouted at the top of his lungs, “Now, everyone can place your bets!”
