This Third Tier Heavenly Venerate moved aggressively, grabbing at Ling Han.

Because he did not know how strong Ling Han’s background was, he did not deliver a fatal attack, and merely wanted to capture Ling Han. Of course, if it was proven that Ling Han did not have any backer, or his backer was not strong, he would definitely kill Ling Han with a casual strike.

…He dared speak to a Third Tier elite in this manner, so just this kind of attitude would warrant his death. Just look, how many people were laughing at him? He could not afford this embarrassment.

Ling Han channeled the Tenth Seal, and his whole person instantly exuded an incredibly sharp killing intent, as if he had turned into the White Tiger that was vicious and ruled over slaughter. His vicious might soared sky-high, the murderous aura even solidifying.

!!

Ling Han met this assault with a punch. Peng! The Tenth Seal added with the might of the Fists of Fury instantly burst out with incomparable power.

A shock wave reverberated out, and Ling Han’s figure trembled, but that Third Tier Heavenly Venerate was directly sent flying.

‘This…!’

Everyone was dumbfounded. Were they dreaming?

How could he be so powerful?

Yet Ling Han himself was very clear. Though this Third Tier Heavenly Venerate was not much inferior to him in terms of power, he had struck too casually, and had not used any kind of Heavenly Venerable Seal or secret technique, so how could he be able to block the might of Ling Han’s punch?

“When did such a terrifying character appear?” someone murmured.

“He is practically a freak.”

“Where did he pop out from?”

Ling Han flicked his hand, and closely looked at the other members of this group. Only then did realization dawn on him. As it turned out, the people who were lining up here were all Third Tier Heavenly Venerates.

It should only be Third Tiers that were worthy of lining up here. Once the Third Tiers had their turn, then it would be the Second Tiers, and then finally the First Tiers. The hierarchy of the cultivation world was strict. A Second Tier would crush a First Tier, and a Third Tier would also crush a Second Tier, and that was what resulted in the present situation.

Ling Han, a First Tier, going to line up was equivalent to having broken the rules, so it was no wonder that he would be targeted.

Since Ling Han had already made his move, he naturally would not be concerned further. He glanced at the remaining 10-plus Third Tier Heavenly Venerates. “Do you guys wish to battle me?”

None of these Third Tiers replied.

Fighting with Ling Han would only bring them losses, and there were no profits to be gained.

Why was this so?

If they won, wasn’t it a matter of course for a Third Tier to defeat a First Tier Heavenly Venerate? There was nothing to be proud of in that. But if they lost… they would be utterly humiliated. A noble, dignified Third Tier Heavenly Venerate had actually lost to a First Tier Heavenly Venerate; had they been living all this while for nothing?

If this had been any other time before, they naturally wouldn’t believe that there would be such a ridiculous thing, but a powerful feeling of alert now rose up in their hearts.

This First Tier was too freakish. Even if that Third Tier had not unleashed his full strength because he had underestimated Ling Han, it still could not change the fact that Ling Han was powerful.

Peng! A loud bang resounded, and a figure streaked over from the distance, landing heavily in the plaza, and creating a powerful shock wave. Even Second Tier Heavenly Venerates would have to go all out to be able to block the force of this shock wave, and First Tier Heavenly Venerates were directly sent flying from the impact.

It was that Third Tier from before. He was extremely furious. To be sent flying by a First Tier was an excruciating humiliation.

“You, are, courting, death!” Now, he did not care what kind of background Ling Han had. Even if the latter was the only son of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, he would still kill him without the slightest hesitation.

“Hehe, you speak as if you have suffered some grievous wrong!” Ling Han shook his head. “Ask yourself first, do you have the right to feel angry?”

“Die!” That Third Tier Heavenly Venerate charged out, a blurry seal glowing in his hand. This time, he naturally would not make the same mistake. He was using a Heavenly Venerable Seal and secret technique at the same time.

Ling Han still responded with the Fists of Fury and the Tenth Seal. He threw a punch, and the force of his punch actually turned into a white tiger that was several hundred meters in length, and pounced right on that Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Peng! That Third Tier brandished a palm in response, but the white tiger seemed to be solid, and was actually pushing him backwards. Not only was he pushed back to his original position, he was still retreating further than that, showing the absolute disadvantage that he was at.

Those Third Tiers all narrowed their eyes at this.

Ling Han’s power was slightly stronger, and this was something they could accept, but what they could not accept was that Ling Han could actually force a Third Tier backwards with an attack from a distance. This was too exaggerated.

It would have to be a Fourth Tier, at least, that could have such overwhelming might, but if this really was a Fourth Tier that had struck, that Third Tier would not have just been sent flying. Instead, even his body would have been blown up.

This was not because Ling Han was overwhelmingly strong, but rather that the secret technique or the Heavenly Venerable Seal he used had the ability to induce qualitative change, and that was why he was so inconceivably strong.

Ling Han was also surprised. He had not thought that the Tenth Seal would have this effect.

“Your temper is quite hot; come and fight again!” Ling Han crooked a finger at that Third Tier.

That Third Tier’s face was filled with fury. He wanted to accept the challenge, but when he thought about how he had not been a match for Ling Han even when he had gone all out, he would only be asking for his own humiliation if he made another move.

His chest rose and fell rapidly, and after a long while, he clenched his fist, turned around, and sat down at the side, making no further noise.

He would swallow this injustice, and he would accept this loss quietly.

The other Third Tiers exchanged looks, and one of them suddenly spoke up, and said, “Young friend’s natural talent in cultivation is truly shocking, and has truly impressed us. Thus, we are willing to let Young friend be the first in line.”

Oh, so nice of them?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then replied, “Then thank you.”

He walked to the foremost position, and waited quietly.

After several days, a figure appeared in a flash, and there was another person here.

This was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. His expression was filled with disappointment. He shook his head, and immediately strode off, without addressing anyone.

He had failed the test? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han leaped, and had already entered through the light door.

Instantly, he realized that he had entered into a different area.

With the experience at the White Tiger Palace, Ling Han immediately realized that this was his spirit that had entered into another space. His true body should have already entered into the palace, but if he failed to pass the test, he would be expelled, just like that Third Tier from before.

He surveyed the area. This was a land of fire.

The Vermillion Bird was aligned with fire, so it was not unexpected for such an environment to appear. However, both White Tiger and Vermillion Bird primarily focused on offense. It was only that the White Tiger was aligned with metal, and represented sharpness capable of piercing through any enemy, while the Vermillion Bird represented fire that could burn through anything.

‘Fine, then I will just fight to my heart’s content again.’

Boom! The flames surged, transforming into a single word: kill!

In the test at the White Tiger Palace, one could never step back, and here it had become a simple word “kill.”

...

So how intensely did he have to kill?

Boom, boom, boom! The ground trembled wildly, and an incredibly colossal metallic figure appeared ahead of him. It was 300 meters tall, and seemed to be forged from metal. It had no eyes or mouth, and its face was just a blank slate.

It soon reached Ling Han, and directly stretched out its arm to press down on him.

It was too massive. The descent of this strike was as if a small mountain was falling down on him, golden light seeping about.

Ling Han unleashed a battle cry, and still met this oncoming strike with Fists of Fury. He had yet to advance it to Third Tier, and needed this kind of intense battle to increase his Fist Intent.

Peng!

He received this attack, and the metallic figure’s body trembled, instantly crumbling, and turning into countless pieces. However, this was only for an instant. These pieces immediately joined back together, reforming its body.

Boom! This metallic figure sent out a strike again.

Huh? It could not be killed?

Ling Han raised his fist once more, and sent the metallic figure flying again. Boom! In midair, the metallic figure’s body was once again shattered, but similarly, it immediately recovered again.

...
