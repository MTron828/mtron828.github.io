Chapter 1856: Finding a helper

There was naturally no way that such a sudden event could affect Ling Han.

Within the capacity of the game rules, he really was not afraid of anyone. The prerequisite was that he, too, had to be playing according to the rules, and could not step too far out of bounds.

If a Dividing Soul Tier did not move out, who could do anything against him?

Ling Han clapped his hands. This Saintly Material was considered as his gift. In any case, he definitely did not want it back any longer. Even if it was plucked out, it would stink for 10,000 years.

He used the seal to open the cultivation chamber, entered, and then drew out his cauldron, getting ready to concoct alchemical pills.

“Young Master Yu!” Zhu Jin hurriedly approached to help Liu Yu up. He first helped him pull out his head from the tiles.

“My behind! My behind!” Liu Yu wanted to rub his behind, but he had just stretched his hand back, and was immediately assaulted by agonizing pain. He involuntarily pushed his waist forwards, but with a move like this, the bamboo pole also went in further, and his behind felt another bout of extreme pain.

It just so happened that someone had walked out from the cultivation chamber. Seeing how there was a long bamboo pole stabbed into Liu Yu’s a*s, he was first stunned, and then immediately erupted with raucous laughter.

He was definitely not the only one. The stone chamber doors beside him had also opened, and another person walked out. He similarly was stunned for a moment before laughing so hard that there were tears in his eyes.

“Brother Ma, what is this man doing?”

“He’s a pervert that likes having his a*s stabbed!”

“What hardcore tastes!”

The two of them clearly knew each other. They should have come together to cultivate here as only then could they exit at the same time. As they watched Liu Yu, they conversed, and then walked outwards.

When Liu Yu heard this, his face naturally turned dull red in color, and he felt as if his whole life had become dark and gray, without the slightest bit of brightness left. He gritted his teeth, and said to Zhu Jin, “Bastard, quickly pull that thing out.”

Zhu Jin nodded, and placed his hands on the bamboo pole.

“Ow, ow, ow!” Liu Yu called out quickly. With each slight tremble of the hand, his a*s would be tortured another time.

Zhu Jin suddenly drew out with force, and the bamboo pole was finally pulled out. Then, with a pu

, an arrow of blood also sprayed out from Liu Yu’s a*s.

“Ah...!” Liu Yu screamed out again, but it was better to deal with painful things quickly. After this bamboo pole had been pulled out, though the pain he suffered was heart-piercing, and he felt a sudden moment of emptiness, he finally needed not suffer any more torture.

He covered his behind with one hand, fire practically shooting from his eyes. His trousers had naturally been completely dyed crimson from blood.

“Bastard, we are completely irreconcilable!”

“Young Master Yu, forget it,” Zhu Jin advised. He was a native citizen of Alchemy City, and naturally was very clear about the laws of the city.

Ordinarily speaking, if Liu Yu wanted to get his revenge, he could only find a Severing Mundane Tier to take vengeance for him, or wait until Ling Han went into some desolate, remote location so he could send out a Dividing Soul Tier instead.

But from the strength that Ling Han had previously displayed, how many Severing Mundane Tiers could actually be capable of suppressing him?

It would probably have to be someone at king tier level, right?

...Zhu Jin was only a normal severance, and as he saw it, Ling Han definitely could not be a king tier. Otherwise, what did he mean by coming to the fifth level? And because Liu Yu was an outsider, the application to enter into the second level had not been approved yet, and that was why he could only tour around in the first level. Otherwise, he would not have met Ling Han, either.

Thus, though Ling Han’s previous display was astonishing, Zhu Jin still thought that he could be suppressed by a king tier.

The problem here was: how were they supposed to get a king tier to move out for them?

To say nothing of the fact that he, Zhu Jin, definitely did not have that ability, Liu Yu similarly did not.

“You get lost!” Liu Yu pushed Zhu Jin aside, his expression filled with loathing. As he saw it, Zhu Jin had only wanted to watch him being humiliated. Otherwise, why hadn’t he helped him just now?

To offer a few words of advice so insincerely, who didn’t know how to do this?

Despicable!

Zhu Jin wanted to make another attempt. After all, the Zhu Clan was a merchant clan. “Young Master Yu—”

“F***, are you scramming or not?” Liu Yu glared, feeling that Zhu Jin was repulsive, practically not so much better than Ling Han.

...He had suffered such a massive grievance, and he actually advised him to forget it? F*** him!

Did he think that he really had to depend on their Zhu Clan?

Humph, there were quite a number of clans fighting to express goodwill to him. It was only that he had been blind to actually choose a guy like this that was so cowardly and disloyal!

“Humph!” With a flutter of his sleeve, he rushed out the doors. However, with him leaving like this, his behind was naturally shockingly painful, and his hands involuntarily came up to support himself. Then, with his legs clamped tightly together, he walked ahead in an incredibly awkward manner.

However, a Severing Mundane Tier was still a Severing Mundane Tier after all. Even walking in such a manner, his speed was still incredibly fast. In an instant, he had disappeared without a trace.

Zhu Jin couldn’t help but sigh. He did not know how to react, but ultimately, he did not set off in pursuit any longer.

He was also a man that had his pride. He had already repeatedly humbled himself, yet was only brushed off with a cold shoulder. He had really had enough!

Liu Yu walked some distance away, and involuntarily stopped, beginning to ponder.

Whom should he find?

Actually, he also knew the laws of Alchemy City. Thus, if the helper he found was not strong enough, that would actually be seeking his own humiliation.

“That’s it; I’ll find Sun Dong!” His eyes lit up, and he clapped his hands. However, because of this action, it pulled on the muscles in his behind, causing him to yell out again. The passersby on the streets all turned to look in his direction.

Liu Yu hurriedly entered into his Spatial God Tool. Whatever the case, he had to change his clothes first.

“The Sun Clan’s strength is very impressive in the first place, and Sun Dong is even known as the Little King Tier, with a cultivation level of fourth severance peak stage. He is just a little proud, and not as obedient as the others, which was why I didn’t seek him out.

“Hehe, the Sun Clan is also a supporter of Holy Son Lu Xianming. If Sun Dong is still unable to deal with that brat, his only option would definitely be to ask for help from Lu Xianming.

“If even Lu Xianming still can’t do anything to that guy... then I’ll yield!

“I’ll go seek Sun Dong out now!”

Liu Yu exited the Spatial God Tool, and walked all the way to a brothel in an incredibly awkward manner.

Sun Clan was a three-star force. Their main clan was at the fourth level. If Liu Yu wanted to find the Sun Clan, he had to first contact members of the Sun Clan, and have the Sun Clan step out on his behalf to be able to bring him up to that level.

But how could Liu Yu have so much time?

Thankfully, this Sun Dong was most fond of frequenting brothels, and the prostitut!on industry was best developed on the fifth level. In a whole year, there were at least eight months that he had spent here. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Thus, Liu Yu very proficiently found his way over. After all, he, too, had played around here for some time, so he knew his way around.

The people in the brothel also recognized a big customer like him, and when they saw him enter, they all greeted him respectively.

“Hey, Young Master Yu, why are you clamping your behind so tightly? It can’t be that you played too wildly last night, and got , right?” A woman approached him, and used the silken handkerchief in her hand to lightly slap Liu Yu’s chest.

If this was any other time, Liu Yu would definitely laugh out loud, and take the advantage of the opportunity to grope her breasts a bit, but now his rage was unbridled. Pa, he had delivered a slap right at that woman’s face.

“Who are you saying has been ?” he demanded sinisterly, feeling an urge to commit murder.

Instantly, everyone fell silent out of fear, not daring to make the slightest noise.

“Hahahaha, Liu Yu, why are you in such a nasty mood? You really got ?” Amidst a bout of loud laughter, a young man walked out, each of his arms slung around the shoulders of a woman in revealing clothing on either side.

It was Sun Dong.

“Young Master Dong!” Liu Yu hurriedly approached. In front of the other party, he did not dare to put on any airs at all. This was also the reason why he had not sought out Sun Dong previously, as he would not have any feeling of superiority.
