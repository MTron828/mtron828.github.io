Chapter 971: Trapped

“Mountain River Stones!” Meanwhile, the eyes of the old man from the Luo Clan were burning with desire as he stared at the seven Mountain River Stones.

There were a whopping seven special attribute Mountain River Stones! If these were all used on a single individual, the Luo Clan would be able to raise a super genius!

That was unlike him, who could only remain at the low extreme forever even though he was a four-star genius. He was merely a “freak” who had been forcefully raised specifically for exploring this Heavenly Sea Mystery Realm. In this world that was brimming with Immortal level cultivators, what good was a battle prowess at the peak stage of the medium extreme?

What the Luo Clan needed was someone with a battle prowess at the Sun Moon Tier, or perhaps even the Heavenly Body Tier!

Seven special attribute Mountain River Stones could elevate one’s battle prowess by one star—this was a certainty when going from one star to two stars. However, it was less certain when trying to go from two stars to three stars, or from three stars to four stars.

Naturally, it was harder to advance the more powerful one already was. To four-star geniuses, seven Mountain River Stones might not even be enough to elevate their battle prowess by half a star.

Regardless, special attribute Mountain River Stones were precious treasure, and also the main objective of their journey.

The four people from the Luo Clan didn’t wonder where the Beast King had gone, nor did they think about why Ling Han had appeared here.

They didn’t care!

“Haomin, retrieve the Mountain River Stones!” the old man from the Luo Clan instructed.

Luo Haomin hurriedly nodded. “Yes, Seventh Uncle!” A look of excitement spread across his face as he walked toward the pitch-black boulder.

He was given priority nurturing in the Luo Clan, and had received such nurturing a thousand years or so before Luo Ba and Luo Lie. In terms of talent, however, he was actually slightly inferior to Luo Lie. Among those who received priority nurturing, his importance was also ranked behind Luo Ba.

However, Luo Ba was already dead now, so his position naturally shifted upward. He... had the right to obtain these special attribute Mountain River Stones!

“Oi, oi, oi. Don’t stick your hand out to take what’s not yours. That’s the behavior of thieves and bandits,” Ling Han said with a smile. His body flashed away at a speed faster than Luo Haomin’s.

“Since I’m here, what right do you have to keep them?” the old man from the Luo Clan sneered. He let go of the huge net and lunged toward Ling Han.

He didn’t take Ling Han seriously at all. Ling Han was merely at the Shattering Void Tier 1 , and it was meaningless even if he was invincible in his own tier. After all, that was only limited to the level of mere mortals. Against someone of the Immortal level, such cultivation was truly nothing to behold.

Ling Han didn’t retrieve his bow. Instead, he used his body as a bow and his Origin Power as an arrow as he fired a shot toward Luo Haomin.

What level had his power reached right now? Near the peak stage of the medium extreme! Thus, even though he didn’t use a bow and an arrow, the might of his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow still reached the peak stage of the medium extreme!

Luo Haomin also didn’t pay Ling Han much heed. After all, he still had his Seventh Uncle supporting him from behind. He was only focused on the seven Mountain River Stones. This was an incredible amount of wealth, and truth be told, he couldn’t earn this much even if he was sold.

He completely ignored Ling Han’s attack, and continued dashing forward.

How tremendously quick was the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Pu!

The Origin Power arrow instantly pierced Luo Haomin’s back and exited through his chest. The Origin Power of the arrow was almost exhausted, and the entire arrow immediately vanished into thin air.

‘How is this possible?!’

Luo Haomin slowly turned around, and tried to grab something with his hand. However, before he could even extend his arm outward, his body had already started to collapse.

Peng! His aura vanished as he crashed to the ground.

He, a one-star genius at the peak stage of the low extreme, was actually killed with a single strike!

The old man from the Luo Clan was both furious and shocked. He had already caught up to Ling Han, and he roared in anger as he threw a fist toward him.

‘You killed someone from my clan, so it’s only fair if I kill you too!’

“Die!” he bellowed.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You’re not powerful enough!” Then, he also raised a fist, and swung it toward the old man from the Luo Clan.

Peng!

The old man from the Luo Clan was instantly sent flying by the impact of the strike. He was indeed at the peak stage of the low extreme, and was indeed a four-star genius. However, this didn’t mean his power could definitely reach the level of the medium extreme. Wasn’t he seeking death by fighting Ling Han head on?

Ling Han lowered his fist, and calmly continued toward the pitch-black boulder.

The three people from the Luo Clan all wore expressions of shock and disbelief. Ling Han had merely been at the Shattering Void Tier when he’d entered this Mystery Realm. They were unable to fathom how he had suddenly become strong enough to send a powerful cultivator at the peak stage of the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier flying after only 10 days or so.

“Mountain River Stones!” The old man from the Luo Clan suddenly came to a realization. Only Mountain River Stones could allow cultivators at the Shattering Void Tier to easily advance into the Mountain River Tier. Moreover, their cultivation would advance rapidly, and they wouldn’t come across any bottlenecks before the peak stage of the low extreme.

‘Gasp! How many Mountain River Stones did this brat obtain?’

The two youths from the Luo Clan also realized this fact. Raging jealousy welled up in their hearts. They had already entered this Mystery Realm dozens of times, yet they had only managed to obtain three Mountain River Stones in total! Moreover, those three were just ordinary Mountain River Stones!

“Activate the Crimson Ground Locking Net!”

“Capture him!”

The old man from the Luo Clan didn’t dare underestimate Ling Han anymore. This ant from the small world had already been incredibly powerful at the Shattering Void Tier. Now that he had reached the Mountain River Tier, his abilities before he reached the medium extreme would be on par with cultivators who were truly at the Mountain River Tier—even if he had only ranked up thanks to the effects of the Mountain River Stones.

One had to realize that this brat had passed eight levels of the academy’s assessment when he entered the Scarlet Heaven Academy. He had the potential of a four-star genius!

The three people spread the huge net toward Ling Han.

Ling Han immediately put the seven Mountain River Stones away. He definitely couldn’t allow them to be snatched from him. However, after putting them away, there was already no time for him to dodge. As a result, he was covered by the net.

Ling Han was slightly astonished as the huge net radiated with a power that forcefully suppressed his cultivation level. He was already close to the peak stage of the low extreme, yet right now, his cultivation level was just at the early stage of the low extreme.

“Hahaha!” The three people from the Luo Clan roared with laughter.

This was the Crimson Ground Locking Net, and it was forged specifically to target the Lava Beast King. The Luo Clan had poured a huge amount of resources into forging it. However, this would all be worth it as long as they could capture that Beast King.

After all, if they succeeded, they would be able to obtain an endless supply of special attribute Mountain River Stones this time, then the next time, and yet the next time afterwards...

Even the Beast King was no match for this net, much less Ling Han.

Now that he was inside the net, he was nothing more than a trapped beast.

“Brat, hand over the Mountain River Stones. If I’m in a good mood, I might even gift you a swift death,” one of the youths said. His name was Luo Jian.

“Hmph! He dared to kill members of the Luo Clan, so it’s not excessive even if we dice his body into 10,000 pieces. It’s a shame we can’t do this publicly,” the old man from the Luo Clan said regretfully. They could kill him in this Mystery Realm as doing so would be relatively obscure and hard to verify. However, publicly killing a student of the Scarlet Heaven Academy?

They could try if they didn’t want to stay in the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire anymore.

“Then we’ll slowly refine him!” A cruel smile appeared on Luo Jian’s face. He knew that Ling Han’s physique was incredibly tough. It was on par with a Level One Godly metal.

“Die!”

The old man from the Luo Clan retrieved a sword that had numerous veined patterns on its body. It emanated a brilliant glow as he activated it.

This was a Level One God Tool, and the clan had only bestowed it to him for the sake of this journey into the Mystery Realm.

He raised the sword and stabbed it toward Ling Han’s heart.
