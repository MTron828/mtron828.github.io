Chapter 852: Reinforcements

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Kill!” Ling Han also brandished the Revere Life Sword. Shattering Void Tier ten stars of power was enough to completely activate this sword, and he also threw out the Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation. Every bit of Shattering Void Tier power was precious right now.

The great battle immediately ensued.

At first contact, Great Ling Empire was at a disadvantage, an absolute disadvantage.

On the demon servants’ side, there were too many Shattering Void Tier elites, and the king of demon servants even reached Shattering Void Tier nineteen stars of battle prowess, a notch stronger than Yi Shuang Shuang, instantly making her unable to cope with him.

Yi Shuang Shuang bawled in anger. If it were in the immortal realm, she could kill this kind of trash ten thousand times with a breath, but she was actually in a disadvantageous position here, suppressed by the realm power.

If she unleashed a full-strength attack, she would be able to annihilate the king of demon servants, but she would be ejected out of the vast lands, and the foreign realm was sealed off by a formation which was enough to kill her.

Perish together? She obviously wasn’t willing to.

She revealed all her strength, trying hard to buy time. Now, all that could be done was to wait for Purple Moon Emperor Court’s reinforcements.

Ling Han was hard-pressed—even with power of the nation’s blessing, only his battle prowess advanced to Shattering Void Tier, while the others at most charged up to the Deity Transformation and Heaven Tier.

Thus, the Shattering Void Tier battle prowess he had on his side were only Feng Po Yun, Yi Shuang Shuang, and him; counting the Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation, it would barely be four.

The other party had over a hundred Shattering Void Tier elites, and more importantly, every one of them had power of Shattering Void Tier’s ninth layer, and their battle prowess easily reached ten stars—the stronger ones even reached fifteen stars.

How could this be blocked?

The instant they came into close combat, the Great Ling Empire suffered heavy casualties.

However, they had to fight!

If these demon servants entered the north region, the north region would become a hellish land, then the same with three other regions, and lastly middle state; even the sea region wouldn’t be able to escape from such fate. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

So, they had to be stopped here.

As long as Ma Duo Bao arrived in time, his twenty stars battle prowess would be sufficient to make a clean sweep of the enemy.

Ling Han fought desperately, using the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven and the Demon Fairy Steps, saving people everywhere. Relying on his formidable physique and nature-defying recovery power, he attracted the joint attacks of large amounts of elites.

The other party rather feared him. It couldn’t be helped. Ling Han’s current battle prowess was Shattering Void Tier twelve stars, even thirteen stars, and on top of his physique and recovery power, he was enough to pose a serious threat to large amounts of Shattering Void Tier demon servants.

Moreover, he was also Great Ling Empire’s emperor—after killing him, everyone would no longer receive power of the nation’s blessing, so he obviously became the highest priority target.

This suited Ling Han’s intention. Fighting several hundred Shattering Void Tier elites fiercely, he finally controlled the injuries and deaths of Great Ling Empire’s troops.

However, Ling Han was in a miserable condition.

The opponents were demon servants, and the arts they cultivated were inharmonious with this realm, filled with corruption and evil. The striking power of their Origin Power wasn’t very strong, but the destructive power went beyond it, causing immense damage to Ling Han’s physique.

Ling Han’s physique was equal to rare metal, but their Origin Power was like acid, which could slowly refine him!

Fortunately, Ling Han’s recovery power was amazing. Still, under the repeated bombardment of hundreds of Shattering Void Tier enemies, his arms and legs were slowly corroded, and blood cavities appeared all over his body. After enduring for half a day, Ling Han was forced to use Indestructible True Fluid, instantly fully recovering his body.

However, soon, bloody cavities reappeared on his body, looking so horrible that one could hardly bear to look at him.

“Niu will help you!” Hu Niu stepped into the vast sky and circled around the demon servants, lessening Ling Han’s pressure.

However, her power hadn’t advanced to the Shattering Void Tier, and her influence was severely limited, making her bawl in anxiousness.

The fierce battle carried on, and three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Ling Han was still holding out, but he only had one drop of Indestructible True Fluid left.

... Even Indestructible True Fluid had a resistance factor, and after continuous use in a short period of time, one drop’s effects were obviously inferior to the previous.

When the last drop of Indestructible True Fluid was used, what would he do?

“Sorry, sorry, we came late!” With a loud halloo, eight men and women flew over from afar. Every one of them emitted an imposing presence that could shake down the skies.

The eight Kings arrived!

“Arriving late is always better than not arriving!” Ling Han squeezed out a smile. “Everyone, join the battle immediately!”

“Alright!”

The eight Kings all attacked. They each had Shattering Void Tier fifteen stars of battle prowess, and with their help, Ling Han’s pressure was instantly greatly reduced.

Peng, peng, peng , the Rock Spirit also ran over from afar. Its speed was no match for the eight Kings, truly making it run for its life.

“Ga, ga, ga, come all at once, just so that all of you can be killed!” The king of demon servants sneered.

“You dare to divert your attention when fighting this lady?” Yi Shuang Shuang spread open her 3000-meter wings and slashed as if using two heavenly axes towards the king of demon servants.

“Hmph, you think you can fight This King for this long because you’re strong enough?” the king of demon servants said in disdain. “Come, form the formation. This King drink his fill of these humans’ blood today!”

A hundred Shattering Void Tier elites immediately dispersed, and formed some sort of formation. Instantly, their bodies emitted demonic Qi one after another, surging into the body of the king of demon servants.

Hong , the aura of the king of demon servants instantly grew explosively..

Even Yi Shuang Shuang’s face paled, and she said seriously, “Not good, this power is just about twenty stars!”

Shattering Void Tier’s limit was twenty stars, but strictly speaking, it was power that couldn’t surpass twenty stars—with the addition of martial arts, mystic arts, and the like, battle prowess could surpass it. For example, Ma Duo Bao without power of the nation’s blessing had Shattering Void Tier twenty stars of battle prowess, and on top of power of the nation, Shattering Void Tier twenty stars was easy for him to achieve.

The king of demon servants operated some sort of formation, which extracted the powers of the other demon servants and added it onto his own body, giving him an instantaneous leap in power.

If power could approach close to twenty stars, then battle prowess surpassing twenty stars wouldn’t be difficult.

How was this going to be dealt with now?

“Where’s Brother Ma?” Ling Han asked.

“Thousand Corpse Sect’s Eighteen-eyed Corpse King appeared and revolted, his majesty personally went to suppress it,” the Lunar King said.

Everyone’s expressions were gloomy. Could these demon servants have discussed it in advance with the Thousand Corpse Sect?

It was very possible because Thousand Corpse Sect was established by an elite of the underworld that went into the immortal realm.

“Hahaha, all of you will die!” The king of demon servants attacked, swatting its palm at everyone. Demonic Qi pervaded, and even eclipsed the world.

“Where’s the Eye of Heavenly Dao, hurry up and punish these filths!” The Rabbit jumped in anxiousness.

Yi Shuang Shuang shook her head, and said, “These demon servants were originally from the vast lands, but only cultivated demonic arts, transforming their bodies into those of the underworld, so the Eye of Heavenly Dao won’t expel them. Moreover, the tier of the king of demon servants didn’t break through to the divine level, and so he also won’t be expelled by the Eye of Heavenly Dao.”

The Lunar King struck with her palm, while shouting at Yi Shuang Shuang, “Can’t you say something that makes people happy?”

“Then everyone can’t be birthed on the same year, same month, and same day, but can die on the same year, same month, and same day. Does that count as something that makes people happy?” Yi Shuang Shuang said with a smile, and also attacked with her palm, joining hands with the eight Kings and Ling Han to resist the king of demon servants’ overwhelming attack.

Hong!

The attack swatted down, and Ling Han, Yi Shuang Shuang, and the eight Kings were all sent flying, every one of them hacking out loads of blood—not dying immediately was truly good luck.

However, they couldn’t even block a single move of the king of demon servants together—was there still hope?
