Chapter 2202: Collecting on behalf

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng, Gu Yushu was still retreating, and he destroyed another wall.

“That’s another 20,000,000.” Ling Han totaled the compensation.

Liu Jun could no longer hold back. He jumped up, and exclaimed, “That isn’t even your shop!”

Right, Gu Yushu had retreated out of the pharmacy. The wall he had crashed through belonged to another shop, and the latter did not have the slightest relation with Rain Imperial Pavilion.

Ling Han glared at him. “You are such a busybody. Can’t it be that I am collecting on the owner’s behalf?”

Collecting on behalf?

Liu Jun shuddered. He looked behind Gu Yushu, and it was densely covered with buildings. As he retreated, he continued his path of destruction. If Ling Han was collecting on their behalf as well, then would Liu Jun be able to pay for the compensations even if he sold himself into service for the rest of his life?

‘Gu Yushu, you should rise up and counter, I beg you!’

Unfortunately, the heavens did not heed his plea, and neither did Gu Yushu. He was still destroying one wall after another loudly, and Ling Han called out numbers that would make one’s heart race in quick succession.

Liu Jun felt like he was about to pass out. Though he had seen the world, when he thought of the debts that he might have to bear, his face turned ashen.

However, his worries soon ended.

…It was not that Gu Yushu had managed to rise up and counter, finally getting a chance at victory, but rather that he had finally been defeated by Hu Niu, and had been pressed onto the ground while he was being beaten harshly. Then, it was natural that there was no way that he could destroy any more walls, chairs, or anything else.

“980,000,000 Star Stones, thanks for the business.” Ling Han looked at Liu Jun, smiling widely.

Liu Jun felt his vision darken. He had really passed out.

Firstly, it was due to anxiety, and secondly, because of anger. How could anyone do that? They had just destroyed a few walls, a few tables and chairs, and they had to pay so much.

“A*s-rape! A*s-rape!” Hu Niu returned energetically, holding Gu Yushu up by the scruff of his neck. When she arrived at the doors of the pharmacy, she gave a careless toss, and Gu Yushu was sprawled out on the ground, and very coincidentally, his behind was raised high.

The little girl took out a metal rod, her expression filled with anticipation.

“Stop, stop, stop.” Ling Han hurriedly stretched out his hand to stop her. It was fine to play around, or use it as a threat, but you couldn’t actually do it.

“No, Niu wants to play!” Hu Niu pouted.

“It’s not fun,” Ling Han persuaded.

“It’s fun!” Hu Niu acted spoiled.

Ling Han directly stuffed a chicken drumstick into Hu Niu’s mouth. “Be good and eat some meat.”

Hu Niu was still mumbling, very much wanting to spit out this drumstick to express her displeasure, but this chicken drumstick was unexpectedly especially delicious, and she could not bring herself to spit it out. She could only chew on it viciously as if she was venting her displeasure.

As she ate, she looked regretfully at Gu Yushu’s behind. She had not forgotten her idea of an a*s-rape at all.

Even if he was heavily injured, and slightly out of his wits, Gu Yushu suddenly felt a chill rise up in his heart—cultivators had an instinctive feeling about danger, especially when it was a monarch tier like him.

Ling Han grabbed both Gu Yushu and Liu Jun, and stuffed them into chairs. With a tremor of Origin Power, the both of them slowly came back to consciousness.

The first thing they saw was naturally Ling Han’s widely smiling face. His expression was completely innocent and harmless, yet Liu Jun was incredibly clear just how vicious the heart that lay behind this face could be.

Then, they saw Hu Niu who was chewing on a chicken drumstick, looking like she was enjoying herself one moment, and then glaring at them ferociously the next, causing chills to rise up in both their hearts. They could tell now that this girl wasn’t the type to be reasoned with.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Come, let us discuss the matter of compensation.”

“I have no more money,” Liu Jun was very frank. “You know that I am not lying.”

Previously, he had already emptied all his savings.

Ling Han glanced at Gu Yushu again. “I don’t care which of you is paying, as long as the bill is completely cleared.”

“How much do you want? I’ll pay,” Gu Yushu said proudly, and tossed a disdainful look at Liu Jun.

And he called himself an alchemist? He couldn’t even pay compensation for a few broken walls and chairs.

Liu Jun shook his head internally, thinking, ‘Brother, you are going to cry later. This guy would not blink before ripping someone off.’ Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Very straightforward!” Ling Han clapped a hand on Gu Yushu’s shoulder. “I like the straightforward type like you.”

A mild amount of self-satisfaction actually rose up in Gu Yushu, but he immediately chased it away.

“All right then. 980,000,000 Star Stones, and since you are so straightforward, I’ll make it a whole sum for you, so it will be one billion Star Stones,” Ling Han said.

Gu Yushu instantly gaped, looking at Ling Han in disbelief. His only thought was this person must have either gone mad, or his brain must have been burnt to actually dare ask for such an exorbitant sum…

Wasn’t it just a few chairs and walls? One Star Stone was completely enough.

Ling Han was displeased now, and demanded, “What is the meaning of that look and expression? You don’t want to pay compensation? And you were just patting your chest so confidently, saying that you were very straightforward, but why have you become petty now?”

Gu Yushu shivered, and then said, “But it can’t be as exaggerated as one billion!” Furthermore, when others made it a whole sum, they reduced the amount, but in your case, you were increasing the price?

“Are you saying that I am screwing you over?” Ling Han looked towards Liu Jun. “Come, you say it. Aren’t I always so honest and sincere, fair and just to the point of public indignation?”

Liu Jun was in no mood to complain about Ling Han’s improper use of words. Being looked at by Ling Han with such a cheery, but actually filled with killing intent, stare, how could he possibly dare to say anything that was detrimental to Ling Han?

“Young Master Han is the most just,” he hurriedly declared.

“You see!” Ling Han clapped his hands, “as expected” written all over his face.

Gu Yushu really wanted to kick Liu Jun to the ground. What were you cowering for? This place was Lishui City, and they were also disciples of Saintly Origin Academy. How could Ling Han dare to do anything to them?

Though it was not that all 22 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were based here, as long as one or two of them were present, their divine sense could reach all corners, so how could they possibly sit by and watch them get killed?

Of course, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King couldn’t possibly bother with trifle matters like this, either. This was also why Ling Han dared to publicly blackmail them like this.

Who asked them to trifle with him first? No matter how much he ripped them off, he was in the right.

“It’s too much!” Gu Yushu said, lowering his head.

Though Ling Han was really too vicious, he actually could not take out so much money, which was also slightly embarrassing for him.

“Ah, you’re so poor?” Ling Han looked like he was mourning for his misfortune. “And you call yourself a monarch tier?”

Gu Yushu felt very wronged. If the resources that were poured into him were traded for Star Stones, then to say nothing of one bullion, it was even more than 10 billion. But how could the money spent on him be compared to the money he actually had?

Even for a monarch tier like himself, it was already very impressive if he had 100,000,000 Star Stones, and one billion was really too much.

“Give me some time, and I’ll definitely collect the amount.” He forced out the answer through gritted teeth, unable to bear such humiliation.

He would rather first throw the one billion Star Stones onto Ling Han, then ask someone to help, and deal with Ling Han, taking the Star Stones back.

“How can that be allowed? What if you renege on your debt?” Ling Han shook his head.

“I definitely won’t!” Gu Yushu guaranteed again.

“Stop spouting nonsense, and take out all your money first!” Ling Han took out a steel rod. “If you continue to chatter needlessly, I will a*s-rape both of you first!”

Hu Niu immediately pouted. And he said that a*s-rape wasn’t fun; it was clear that he himself wanted to play, but did not allow her to.

Both Liu Jun’s and Gu Yushu’s face were pale with fear. If they were to be publicly a*s-raped, how would they be able to face others in the future?

“I’ll pay! I’ll pay!” both of them hurriedly called out..
