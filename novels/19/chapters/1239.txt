Chapter 1240: Realm Spirit Stone

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The old ginseng was running super fast, but Rabbit’s strength was his speed. At the time, he was even able to compete with Hu Niu. The further he chased, the nearer he came. His furry claws were just about to catch hold of the old ginseng.

“Mommy!” The old ginseng hurriedly buried into the ground, but Rabbit was actually also capable of travelling in the ground.

People said rabbits knew how to tunnel, and it was indeed true.

Xiu, the old ginseng suddenly scrambled out of the ground, and when he saw Ling Han right in front of him, he couldn’t help but be greatly elated, and hurriedly pounced over.

A white figure swept over, and they saw Rabbit also pop out. When he saw Ling Han, he involuntarily paused, and then said, “Brat, quickly help me stop that ginseng. I can give you a bite!”

This rascal Rabbit was still as stingy as it had been; he actually would only give him a single bite!

Ling Han laughed, and said, “It has already entered into my bowl, so why should I still give you some?”

He shot out a fist, and delivered a punch at Rabbit’s claws.

“Brat, you are really too disloyal!” Rabbit called out, his figure flashing so fast it was like a flash of lightning, wanting to avoid Ling Han’s fist and continue to catch the old ginseng.

Yi, this damn rabbit had actually broken through to the Sun Moon Tier?

Ling Han was shocked. This speed of cultivation was really quite shocking. No, it was practically unimaginable!

Though he was thinking that, he merely flicked a finger, and Sword Qi spread out, suddenly blocking Rabbit’s path. This Lightning Sword Technique was both fast and fierce. Practically no one on the same cultivation level could avoid it. They could only parry it, or be unable to oppose its blade.

“Brat, help Grandpa Ginseng kill this rabbit, and I will give you something good!” The old ginseng had drawn out a pink bib undergarment from who knew where, and was waving around it in his hand.

Ling Han’s face darkened involuntarily. This perverted ginseng was currently standing on his shoulder as he waved around the undergarment. What would be left of his image?

“Hahahaha!” Rabbit was instantly laughing loudly as he rolled around on the ground. He was practically tearing up from his laughter.

“Yi?” The old ginseng paused, and then asked, “Brat, you know this bastard rabbit?”

“Carrot, what did you call me?” Rabbit immediately jumped up, his red eyes widening.

Ling Han felt a headache coming on. Why was it that those beside him were all unreliable? He held out a hand and pressed down, and said, “Rabbit, why are you here?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This guy should still have been in the Great Ling Empire.

“After Uncle Rabbit came to the Immortal Realm, I went out to play around. Coincidentally, I actually barged into an ancient Transfer Formation, and have thus ended up here.” Rabbit sighed. “However, I am very shockingly lucky, and actually picked up a Divine Pill. After I ate it, I carelessly gained Sun Moon Tier cultivation.”

F***, what kind of luck was that?

Ling Han shook his head. He had just barely entered into the Sun Moon Tier after so much effort. This kind of speed of advancement was already astonishingly fast, but he could not hold a candle to Rabbit’s natural luck. He just ate an alchemical pill, and reached the top in a single leap.

However, if he had depended on alchemical pills to advance, his foundations would definitely be unstable, and it would also be impossible for him to cultivate the pinnacle level. If it was not for the fact that Rabbit was born with extremely fast speed, a Sun Moon Tier like him would not have much battle prowess. For example, it was only because the old ginseng had not broken through to the Sun Moon Tier that he had to escape. Otherwise, there would have been no need for him to run. If he fought with Rabbit, it was really indefinite who would be winning in the end.

When the old ginseng saw this, he couldn’t help but feel a burst of courage, and shouted at Rabbit, “Bastard Rabbit, you have chased me all this way, come quick and kowtow to apologize to your Grandpa Ginseng!”

“Carrot, come quickly into Uncle Rabbit’s bowl!” Rabbit was naturally not going to show any weakness, either.

“Stop! Stop! Stop!” Ling Han stretched out his hands and pressed down. “Rabbit, where is that Transfer Formation?”

He had not thought that there would actually be a Transfer Formation connecting the Joint Peace Planet and this place. Then it would be convenient for him to return in the future. He would not need to waste another two years’ time in the galaxy.

“Brat, let me advise you to give up that idea.” Rabbit shook his head, and seriously said, “That ancient Transfer Formation is extremely complex, and requires corresponding coordinates to be able to reach a specific place. You have completely no idea where the Joint Peace Planet is. If you start it up rashly, you will only be sent to the ends of the universe.”

Ling Han was stunned for a while, and then immediately said, “You damn rabbit, you must have tampered with that Transfer Formation, right?” If that wasn’t it, he just happened to be transferred from the Joint Peace Planet to the Cloud Apex Planet, so a return trip should be along the way as well.

Rabbit’s eyes immediately turned in all directions. After he had transferred over, he had no idea what was going on, so he fiddled and tweaked around with it, and ruined the Transfer Formation entirely. That was why he didn’t want to let Ling Han know.

“Che, that Transfer Formation was too old. After it brought Uncle Rabbit over, it collapsed by itself. How could that be my fault?” He waved his short stump of a tail, and pushed all the blame cleanly off himself.

Ling Han sighed. It looked like he would still have to use the Cloud Piercing Shuttle to return. Thankfully, it was only two years’ time, and he could also cultivate in the Black Tower, so it could not be considered too much of a waste of time.

“Looks like you are doing quite well here?” He did not think any further of the Transfer Formation.

“Of course!” Rabbit said proudly. “The medicinal effects of that Divine Pill that Uncle Rabbit ate have not been completely expended, and my cultivation level would grow considerably each day. Joining some fights here and exercising would be most suitable.”

And that was also because on the Cloud Apex Planet, the humans and Demonic Beasts had joined forces because of their shared enemy. Otherwise, it this had been the Joint Peace Planet, this rabbit would have long since been made into a stew.

Yet the old ginseng’s eyes lit up, and he waved the undergarment in front of Ling Han’s eyes as he quietly said, “Brat, let’s kill this bastard rabbit, all right? Just listen, this bastard rabbit said that there are still some medicinal effects active inside its body. If we eat it, it would definitely be greatly beneficial!”

“Carrot, what did you say?” Rabbit, who was also one with sharp ears, immediately jumped up. “Just see if I won’t eat you!”

“You want to eat your Grandpa Ginseng? You are still 8,000,000 years too early!” The old ginseng used Ling Han like a shield, and ran around in circles around him.

Meanwhile, Rabbit was chasing after him as he circled around Ling Han, and the other was running around on his body.

Pa! Pa!

Ling Han stretched out both hands, and caught hold of both Rabbit and the old ginseng at the same time. He said, “Do you believe that I will cook the both of you, and make a pot of rabbit stew with ginseng for some nutrition?”

Both Rabbit and the old ginseng kept quiet out of fear, sensing that this guy in front of them was also a glutton.

Ling Han tossed both the old ginseng and Rabbit on the ground, and said, “Rabbit, you have been here for quite some years. What have you found out?”

Rabbit took a look at the old ginseng, and couldn’t help but salivate. Then, it said, “In the Two Realm Battlefield, Spiritual Qi is lacking, and for cultivators, it is the worst kind of place. However, also because this place is where the two Realms intersect, the collision of the Regulations of two Realms would occasionally evolve and become solid.”

“Oh?” Ling Han was surprised. Regulations could not be seen nor touched, and that was why they were so difficult to comprehend. Yet they would actually evolve and become solid?

“That is known as the Realm Spirit Stone. If one refines it, he would be able to comprehend the Regulations! Uncle Rabbit had once found one, and had indeed advanced a huge step on the grasping of the great dao after refining it.

“Hehe, it is said that sometimes, even Saints of Genesis Tier would come to the Two Realm Battlefield to find Realm Spirit Stones. However, this thing is really too rare. Furthermore, the higher the cultivation level, the more Realm Spirit Stones one would need to advance another step further.”

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder the two great Imperial Empires were so actively fighting against the Netherworld, or maybe it should be said no wonder why conflicts would erupt so frequently between the beings from the two Realms. That was because everyone wanted to find Realm Spirit Stones here!
