Chapter 1826: Emperor tiers join forces

This time, Luo Changfeng’s expression really changed drastically. In fact, even his skull was starting to go numb.

He had already used the Celestial King Tier technique, yet was still incapable of suppressing Ling Han.

Gasp!

It was either that this brat was the descendant of a Celestial King, or that he had obtained a supreme opportunity, and that was the only way he could match the Celestial King Tier technique.

His eyes immediately lit up. If it was the latter possibility, and he obtained it, then perhaps he would have a chance of becoming a Celestial King himself!

Just how many Holy Sons and Holy Daughters had come out of the Thundercloud Palace?

Many, very many!

As generations passed, after the “old” “Holy Sons” and “Holy Daughters” advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier, they would no longer hold the position of a Holy Son or Holy Daughter. Instead, they would become elders, but throughout this epoch, no second Celestial King emerged from the Thundercloud Palace.

Why?

Celestial King Tier was too hard to break through to. Even a Celestial King Tier force would have extremely great difficulty to produce a true heir. However, Celestial Kings were the true immortals. They could even shatter the Immortal’s Tribulation easily, and there was no fear that the entire force would suddenly crumble when the Celestial King died one day.

Luo Changfeng was confident that he could reach the Ascending Origin Tier. As for becoming a Celestial King? That was practically impossible for him.

Thus, he needed the Heavenly Dao Jade to deliver the fifth severance.

If he succeeded in achieving the fifth severance, then becoming a Celestial King was a sure bet. Furthermore, he would definitely not be limited to just the First Heaven.

However, aside from the Heavenly Dao Jade, there were other treasures that could help one to advance to the Celestial King Tier in this world, such as... the Source Powers of the heaven and earth!

He examined Ling Han’s hands closely, and his heart skipped a beat. He asked, “You have obtained the Source Power of heaven and earth?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ling Han was slightly surprised. The other party was actually capable of recognizing the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water.

Seeing Ling Han’s expression, Luo Changfeng instantly confirmed his guess internally. He had guessed correctly, and when Ling Han saw the dawning realization in his expression, he understood that the other had actually just been throwing out random guesses.

However, he did not hide it. He opened up his right palm. Boom, a flame soared, and it was formed completely from symbols of great dao. “This is the Nine Heavens Flame.” Then, he stretched out his left hand, and similarly opened his palm. This time, though, a cold air rose. “This is the Xuanyin Source Water.”

‘F*ck!’

Luo Changfeng had practically never uttered any swearwords in this lifetime, yet now he had a strong urge to curse.

Source Powers of heaven and earth, just what kind of rare and precious existence were they?

Even the majority of Celestial Kings could not possibly possess them, yet a mere third severance cultivator had actually possessed these two Source Powers of heaven and earth.

What justice was there left in this world?

A smile slowly appeared on Luo Changfeng’s lips. Then, he laughed loudly. “Ling Han, Ling Han, you are really my lucky star!”

Ling Han also smiled, and said, “Are you about to say that I have come from so far away just to deliver two Source Powers of heaven and earth to you?”

“How could that not be the case?” Luo Changfeng asked arrogantly. By now, he was sure that Ling Han was definitely not the descendant of a Celestial King Tier force. Otherwise, what Celestial King would let their disciple possess two Source Powers of heaven and earth?

Since that was the case, on what basis could Ling Han match a Celestial King Tier technique? Did he think that just because he had two Source Powers of heaven and earth, he could do whatever he liked without any scruples?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Your thoughts are too fantastical!”

“Oh, then what if you add me into the equation?” Zihe Bingyun’s voice rang out. Her figure appeared elegantly, her right hand holding a sword that was as bright as autumn waters.

Luo Changfeng frowned slightly, but subsequently relaxed.

By now, he had guessed that Zihe Bingyun had told him about the Mountain Treasure because she was in fact targeting Ling Han. The reason was that she could make use of him to deal with Ling Han. But to be honest, though his words might seem very confident, he was similarly filled with wariness towards Ling Han.

If he joined forces with Zihe Bingyun, that would be combining two Celestial King Tier techniques, and that would definitely mean their victory was guaranteed.

Ling Han’s eyes passed over her, and his killing intent immediately blazed as he glared at Zihe Bingyun.

“I want the Nine Heavens Flame,” Luo Changfeng said.

“Fine!” Zihe Bingyun nodded, and the two of them had instantly reached an agreement.

One wanted the Nine Heavens Flame, while the other wanted the Xuanyin Source Water. Both of them knew that it was impossible for them to take sole possession of two Source Powers of heaven and earth with the other here, so they could only share the spoils. However, even a single Source Power of heaven and earth was already incredibly awesome. Even the majority of Celestial Kings could only feel envy.

Obtaining a Source Power of heaven and earth meant they would definitely become a Celestial King—otherwise, that would definitely mean death.

Ling Han smirked coldly. “Two corpses, and you are still daydreaming!”

“Die!”

Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun both launched an offensive against Ling Han at the same time. One charged from the right side, while the other took the left side. Though they had never worked together before, as emperor tiers, they could understand what the other wanted with a single look, and their cooperation was flawless.

Ling Han would have to face two great emperor tiers at the same time!

The Empress did not move. Though she was an emperor tier, there was still a gap of a minor level, so she would not be of much help to Ling Han. She might as well just obediently watch from the sidelines to avoid causing trouble for Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou was restless. She could somehow match a third severance peak stage emperor tier, but both Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng had Celestial King Tier techniques. Against this kind of secret technique, she could only feel helpless resentment.

Thus, seeing that the Empress did not move, she also sat and watched from the sidelines.

Ling Han was fighting the descendants of two great Celestial King Tier forces, but he was not the slightest bit afraid. The Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water were both entwined around his fists, and as he rained down a barrage of punches, he was not being reasonable at all. He was just using this kind of method to crush his opponents.

Who let this be his Source Powers, so there was no need for him to fear using them too much?

But Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng could not do the same. One had the Celestial King Tier Regulations, while the other wore a precious armor. Both would come to a time when they were completely used up, so which of them dared take him on forcefully?

In a clash between strong enemies, it would be the braver one that would win!

Ling Han showed his full domineering demeanor, and Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng could only dodge his blows. They wanted to wait until Ling Han was exhausted, and then turn around to deliver a counterattack to kill the latter.

But how could such plans possibly succeed?

“We can’t go on like this!” Zihe Bingyun communicated to Luo Changfeng through divine sense.

Luo Changfeng understood it completely. At this moment, he did not dare to underestimate Ling Han in the slightest, yet coveted the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water even more.

A Celestial King Tier technique[1] might be strong, but that, after all, was not a power that belonged to him personally. There would ultimately come a time when it would be used up. However, if he could obtain and refine a Source Power of heaven and earth, then that would be a completely different story.

This person in front of him was clear proof. With two great Source Powers of heaven and earth, not only was he capable of matching a Celestial King Tier technique, he could be extravagant with his use of them because there was no need for him to worry that he would use them up, and there was no need to worry that he would be powerless later on.

Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind, and he said, “This is the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm!”

Zihe Bingyun was also a smart person, and immediately realized. “As long as one has lost the Blood Dragon Armor, then the Fire Element of heaven and earth is capable of eliminating even an Immortal Palace Tier!”

For example, even though they had Celestial King Tier techniques, they still had to wear the Blood Dragon Armor before they dared to enter into this place. A Celestial King Tier technique was supposed to be used on the Heavenly Dao Jade, and not the Fire Element in this place.

Of course, it was not that Celestial Kings did not have a technique that could help them be immune to the Fire Element of heaven and earth, but if it was something that could be resolved with a Blood Dragon Armor, what was the point of going the extra mile?

The two emperor tiers immediately found a strategy, and when they once again launched their attacks at Ling Han, they were aiming fatal strikes madly at the clothes he was wearing.

This...!

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily became strange. Those two should know that he was not wearing the Blood Dragon Armor. If he said it out, he was really afraid that the two of them couldn’t accept the fact.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

But Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng did not take other things into consideration at all. They both thought that they had found the perfect method to deal with Ling Han, and inflicted damage at all costs, determined to make Ling Han naked.

[1] I think it’s about C King Tier regulations they got injected with instead, but it keeps on appearing like this.
