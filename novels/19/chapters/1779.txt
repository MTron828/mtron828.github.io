Chapter 1780: Purity Sect

TIme passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, another three months had passed.

In this period of time, no other members of the Fu Clan came to create trouble for Ling Han. As he thought about it, they should be focusing all their killing intent on the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

Ling Han was unafraid. At present, though he was still unable to defeat an opponent at the peak stage of the fourth severance, his physique was really too strong. Even if a peak stage of fourth severance suddenly ambushed him, he could not possibly kill him with a single strike, and there were so many trump cards in his possession—the Nine Heavens Flame, Xuanyin Source Water, Ten Beasts Technique, and so on. Which one of them was any ordinary technique?

There was an entry restriction in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. Ling Han simply felt that it was a playground specially readied for him, and he only had to concern himself with traveling at his ease. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Changsun Liang, Xiao Sheng, and the others had come even later than Ling Han. They entered the Heavenly Dragon Academy as well, but they were unable to obtain the qualification to enter into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. At least this time, they would not have the chance to enter.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel rueful. When they were in the Black Moon Sect and Xiao Clan, which one of them was not an unrivalled prodigious king tier? But now, they weren’t even able to get an entry slot. No wonder others said that it was better to be a big fish in a small pond rather than a small fish in a big pond.

After he and Changsun Liang met once, he boarded a battle ship belonging to the Fu Clan, getting ready to set out towards the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

A battleship had been dispatched this time, which showed how much regard the Fu Clan had for this journey. That was because there were only three such vessels in the entire Fu Clan, and each battleship possessed the battle prowess of the peak stage of the Immortal Palace Tier, and was one of the strongest trump cards of the Fu Clan.

The battleship set out, and aside from encountering an elite of the Ascending Origin Tier, anyone who dared make a move on it rashly would definitely be turned into bits by the heavy cannons that the vessel was armed with.

There were many people on the ship, forming a considerable number of small circles. For example, Ling Han naturally would be together with Fu Gaoyun, and aside from the 10 of them, there were two other people.

One of them was Fu Xiaoyun.

It was very normal for her to be here. As Fu Gaoyun’s younger sister, whom was she going to follow if not Fu Gaoyun?

And the other was Situ Xiaozhen.

She was the only granddaughter of a three-star alchemist, so how easy would it be for her to get hold of an entry slot? And before setting out, the two great alchemists had called Fu Gaoyun over, telling him to take good care of Situ Xiaozhen. Otherwise, they would really burst his n*ts, and guarantee that they would never grow back again.

This scared Fu Gaoyun horribly. The two great alchemists were definitely not just speaking idle threats.

Thus, there was another “boss” in this room of theirs, and she was indeed a boss. Her mouth was filled with crude words as she teased Fu Gaoyun at one moment, and she would be teasing Fu Xiaoyun in the next, being outrageously brazen.

Ling Han and the Empress did not mingle with them, and locked themselves in their rooms. Then, they entered into the Black Tower, and began comprehending Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

They wanted to increase their strength as much as possible.

The ship’s speed was astonishing. Only a mere month later, it had already arrived at the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. This region was a complete wilderness enshrouded in layers of mysterious fog, and the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm lay within.

It was said that there was no fog inside. This was a formation that had been laid down by a great sect all those years ago, and it was now incomplete, with its destructive power greatly reduced. There was only a little bit of fog rising in the surroundings, which could only cause confusion, but did not have much destructive power.

The true killing intent lay within the Mystery Realm. The aura and Regulations had been left behind by elites in that great war all those years ago, and did not disperse even after uncountable years had passed, being astonishingly terrifying.

Someone had deduced that this could possibly have been a Celestial King Tier-level great sect all those years ago, yet the reason why it had fallen into decline would remain an unsolved mystery.

Though the only protective measure left behind to guard the Mystery Realm was the confusion formation, it still could not be underestimated. Rashly barging in could possibly lead to getting lost. Though one would have managed to enter into the Mystery Realm, if he encountered chaotic Regulations wreaking havoc, that would mean an insta-kill.

Thus, they definitely had to enter through the main entrance, reducing the risk as much as possible.

After coming to this place, the battleship slowly descended. There was not just a single battle ship anchored here, but rather at least 10 of them, and different flags were hung on every single vessel. They were also painted in different colors, but strangely, aside from that, these battleships all looked practically the same.

After Ling Han asked Fu Gaoyun, he found out that these battleships were not built by the forces themselves, but were rather purchased from outside.

Massive Military Pavilion!

This was a four-star force, yet unlike other great sects and clans, which used battles to expand their territory, they did business, and what they sold were various types of weapons—from small-sized swords and bows all the way to large battleships. They were able to forge any kind of battle weapon.

The wealth accumulated by the Massive Military Pavilion was enough to cause envy, but there was definitely no force that dared to feel covetous desire towards this wealth. This was a four-star force!

Furthermore, the Massive Military Pavilion earned their profits through selling battle weapons, and they possessed hundreds of Ascending Origin Tier-level battleships. Who dared to rashly start a war with them? Aside from Celestial Kings, there really was no one that dared to bully them.

“Liu Clan, Beiyu Clan, Qianzhao Clan, Teng Clan, Ancient Rain Sect... Purity Sect!” Fu Gaoyun’s eyes swept over the gathered masses, and would pause slightly over each battleship, and reveal their origins.

When he counted the sixth battle ship, he paused for a slightly longer moment, and a strange expression appeared on his face. It was a mix of wariness and longing.

“I never thought that the Purity Sect would have come this time as well!” Cheng Zhong’s expression was also a little ugly.

Ling Han was puzzled, and asked, “Is this force very powerful?”

“Very strong, and very troublesome.” Fu Gaoyun shook his head. “The Purity Sect only accepts female disciples, and all the members of the sect are specialized in the art of seduction. Their opinion is that any problem that could be solved through seduction definitely should not be solved through battle.

“However, their art of seduction is really very strong, and one would fall for it unconsciously.” He sighed.

Cheng Zhong laughed loudly. “Our Young Master Yun is a man who has tender feelings for the fairer sex. Years ago, he discovered a Celestial medicine that had just taken form in a Mystery Realm, and it could be considered extremely valuable. In the end, though, there was also a Holy Daughter of the Purity Sect there at the time. She enticed our Young Master Yun, and compelled our Young Master Yun to surrender that Celestial medicine to her readily.”

Fu Gaoyun involuntarily showed a hint of embarrassed ire, but it was more of an expression of infatuation, as if he was still remembering that Holy Daughter’s tenderness.

“When he returned to the clan, Young Master Yun was harshly reprimanded, and almost lost his succession rights. However, Young Master Yun is not the only one who has experienced loss at the hands of the Purity Sect. Putting aside our Fu Clan, even when it comes to the Lunar Sect, whose strength is top grade, their Holy Son has not experienced just a few losses like this, either,” Cheng Zhong continued, redeeming a little pride for Fu Gaoyun.

Fu Gaoyun’s expression became serious, and he said, “Brother Ling, you must not be careless. The art of seduction of the Purity Sect has long surpassed primitive ****, and has advanced to a kind of bearing that will make you unconsciously feel mercy and willingness to sacrifice everything in order to protect the user.”

He paused, and then continued, “Liu Huaiyu belonged to the Purity Sect. However, she is only a discarded disciple!”

Only now did Ling Han become serious; Liu Huaiyu was actually just a discarded disciple!

It should be known that her art of seduction was already very advanced, and even he sat up and took notice. Going by the look of things, just how frightening were the members of the Purity Sect in the art of seduction, and how strong was the level of mastery of a Holy Daughter at it?

“The Purity Sect is different from other forces. They only have a single Holy Daughter whose name is Rou. No one knows what her surname is, but all address her as Bewitching Maiden Rou, or rather Fairy Rou. There is a legend that says if one could find out her surname, he would be able to become her dao partner.”

“Because of this legend, it is unknown how many people have investigated everywhere, which shows how extraordinary and bewitching Bewitching Maiden Rou is.”

Fu Gaoyun showed a hint of yearning. In the past, he had spent a short while with Bewitching Maiden Rou, and this also became the most beautiful memory in his life. Even if he had lost a Celestial medicine for the sake of it, he did not regret it in the slightest.

Ling Han, though, was filled with a sliver of curiosity. He wanted to see this Bewitching Maiden Rou, and find out how astonishing her charms were.
