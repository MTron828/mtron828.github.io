2944 Universally Condemned

Ling Han was also slightly annoyed.

Thank you readers!

Being able to engulf life essence to raise his cultivation was indeed a very astonishing and useful ability. However, this was also something that he couldn’t control at all.

Right now, everyone’s gaze was locked onto him, and even those who had been undecided before were now looking at him with expressions of contempt and disgust.

He was Hysteria’s subordinate, so he was naturally despised by all.

“Ling Han, do you have anything else to say?” Feng Wuding asked with a smug expression.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “So what if this is the case? It’s just a coincidence.”

“You’re trying to say this is a coincidence?” Feng Wuding said with a humph. “Then why don’t I have the same ability?”

“How would I know? Because you’re an utter fool?” Ling Han casually replied.

“You…!!” Feng Wuding was on the verge of exploding in fury.

Xin Qihu waved a hand, and said, “Ling Han, you’re also a fellow commander, so we won’t make our judgment so quickly. However, this matter is of great importance, so it’s vital that you cooperate with us. Right now, you need to give up all resistance and surrender yourself. As for whether you’re genuinely a subordinate of Hysteria or not, this will naturally be determined by the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates.”

Ling Han looked at Xin Qihu. This person was truly old and scheming. He was clearly trying to capture him, yet he was making it seem as if he were doing everything for the greater good.

“Everyone!” Lin Youlian suddenly said. “Before accusing Ling Han of being Hysteria’s subordinate, have you ever thought about how many enemies he’s killed up until now? If he’s genuinely Hysteria’s subordinate, why would he do this?”

Many people instantly nodded in agreement. Ling Han had indeed killed countless members of Hysteria’s army these past few years. In fact, at least a third of the intelligent monsters had been killed by him. Otherwise, their frontlines would have definitely had to retreat an unfathomable distance.

It was truly hard to believe that Ling Han was a traitor.

“Heh, if he hadn’t done this, how could he have won our trust?” Nalan Xiong said.

“That’s right, all of this was definitely part of his plan. The destruction that he can bring to the Flaming Frost Realm and the Genesis World is definitely far greater than the damage that he’s brought to Hysteria’s army,” someone else said.

“Moreover, if it weren’t because of his identity as Hysteria’s subordinate, how could he have marched through Hysteria’s army with such ease?” someone else added. “Even though Lord Xin, Lord Lin, and Lord Wu are all more powerful than Ling Han, none of them are able to do this.

“So be it if Ling Han only managed to do it a single time. However, he was able to do it tens of thousands of times! Is Hysteria’s army truly that helpless against him?”

‘Indeed!’

Everyone nodded in agreement. Ling Han was indeed freakish, but in reality, his battle prowess was still slightly inferior to that of Lord Xin, Lord Lin, and Lord Wu. Even the three of them were unable to march through Hysteria’s army with ease, so why was Ling Han able to do it? Moreover, he was able to do it tens of thousands of times!

Was there truly nothing suspicious about this? Who would believe it?

“That’s right! Why was Ling Han able to do that?”

“He was definitely coordinating with Hysteria’s army, and they definitely went easy on him on purpose!”

“How detestable! If Ling Han continued to kill them like this, his reputation and prestige would definitely soar higher and higher. If he truly became our leader, we would be killed without even knowing what hit us!”

Everyone exploded in anger.

Bai Mifan and Xuan Feng were both infuriated. As members of the guerilla strike force, just how many dangers had they faced? Had they not witnessed this with their own eyes? Moreover, a traitor did indeed exist. However, that was Fu Yuan, not Ling Han.

They tried to speak up for Ling Han, yet their voices were immediately drowned out by the seething and ferocious criticisms being launched toward him.

Ling Han didn’t get angry. In fact, he had already anticipated this result. He simply looked at Xin Qihu.

He had fought with Xin Qihu many times, and Xin Qihu was one of the few people who knew about his trump card.

He could tear apart space and freely travel between dimensions. It was because of this that he was able to march through Hysteria’s army with ease.

To his disappointment, however, Xin Qihu didn’t speak up to explain this.

This person always adhered to the principle of justice. However, they weren’t facing Hysteria’s army right now, so no one could blame Xin Qihu for not speaking up. In the future, he could simply say that he had forgotten about Ling Han’s ability.

“Capture him!” everyone roared in fury. They were all filled with rage and indignance.

When on the battlefield, what were they most afraid of?

The answer was naturally being stabbed in the back by their own ally.

“Ling Han, if you still have a sense of justice in your heart, then give up your resistance and surrender yourself. Whether you’re guilty or innocent, we’ll naturally give you a fair trial,” Xin Qihu said calmly.

Feng Wuding wore a cold smile as he watched on. Ling Han was already unable to turn the tables.

He was a traitor.

He was the Flaming Frost Realm’s enemy.

What did it matter how powerful Ling Han was? What did it matter that he had been defeated by Ling Han before?

Wasn’t Hysteria even more freakish? It was able to suppress all of the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates by itself! But what did this matter? Would anyone worship Hysteria? Would anyone belittle the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates simply because they were weaker than Hysteria?

This same principle also applied to him, Feng Wuding.

Ling Han sighed upon seeing this. Were they really going to force him to do something?

Lin Youlian opened her mouth again, saying, “We need to consider this matter more carefully! Ling Han is one of the five commanders, and his battle prowess is also astonishing. Everyone has witnessed his great contributions. Yet, you want to capture him because of a few rumors and random coincidences? This isn’t just.”

“Lin Youlian, that’s where you’re wrong. Everything that’s related to Hysteria has to be treated with utmost caution and seriousness. Otherwise, just how terrifying will the consequences be? It’s simply unimaginable,” Xin Qihu said in a stern voice. “As for whether Ling Han is guilty or not, the Seventh Tier elites will naturally be able to figure this out.”

He was focusing on one argument, and that was the fact that they had to treat everything related to Hysteria with utmost seriousness. Since Ling Han was suspected of being Hysteria’s subordinate, they naturally had to treat this case in such a manner as well. They would rather wrongly accuse someone than wrongly exonerate someone.

Most people supported this position.

“Capture him!”

“Capture him!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Capture him!”

Their roars were like crashing waves that rose one after another.

“Ling Han! Kneel and surrender yourself!” Feng Wuding said with a smug expression. He was truly in control of everything at this moment.

“Weakling intoxicated by success.” Bai Mifan couldn’t help but curse.

Ling Han glanced at Feng Wuding, and said, “If you want a beating, then come over here. I’ll make sure to beat you until you’re satisfied.”

“Then let’s hold a vote,” Lin Youlian said as she looked at Wu Haoyang.

She was confident that Wu Haoyang would support her. At that time, it would be two votes to two again. Even if they ignored Ling Han’s vote, they would still have no option but to put the matter aside for the time being.

Xin Qihu smiled, but he didn’t take the bait. Instead, he said, “I feel like everyone deserves a say on this, so it should be voted on by everyone… What do you all say?”

“Yes, that’s exactly right!”

“We also want to vote.”

“That’s right! Trying to force me to battle alongside a spy and a traitor? Heh, how could I feel at ease? If Ling Han isn’t captured, then I’ll have no option but to leave.”

“I agree!”

“I also agree!”

Everyone nodded in approval. They couldn’t accept Ling Han walking free.

Xin Qihu shook his head at Lin Youlian, saying, “Lin Youlian, it’s best that we respect everyone’s opinion. Otherwise… how can we lead a disunited and demoralized army?”

There was hesitation on Lin Youlian’s face.
