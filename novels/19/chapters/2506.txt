Chapter 2507: Gifting a Mine

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Friend!

Surprisingly, the Azure Sun Celestial King continued to refer to Ling Han as a friend. What did this signify? This signified that the Azure Sun Celestial King was willing to treat Ling Han as his equal, as someone with equivalent status to him.

Who could enjoy a status equivalent to Celestial Kings?

Naturally, only fellow Celestial Kings.

Gasp!

Luo Xing and Li Juan were both stunned upon realizing this. Even though they had already harbored suspicions, they were still given a huge fright when this was confirmed.

They had actually brought a Celestial King back?

However, this person didn’t look like a Celestial King at all!

Ling Han smiled faintly, and replied, “Alright.”

“Please!” the Azure Sun Celestial King said as he gestured in invitation.

He then grabbed his two disciples and flew away first, appearing relaxed and elegant as his robes billowed in the wind. However, his speed was in fact astonishing as he soared toward the mountain.

Meanwhile, Ling Han calmly ran beside the Azure Sun Celestial King, not falling behind a single inch.

Upon seeing this, Luo Xing and the others finally dispelled all of their doubts. Ling Han was definitely a Celestial King. Otherwise, how could his speed match that of the Azure Sun Celestial King?

......

In fact, even the Azure Sun Celestial King was slightly shocked. No matter how he looked, Ling Han was only at the Hidden Radiance Stage. It was only because of Ling Han’s shout just then that he had confirmed that he was at the Celestial King Tier. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have rushed over in astonishment.

In any case, he truly couldn’t make head nor tail of Ling Han’s situation. Even as a Celestial King, he was still filled with confusion.

After arriving atop the mountain, Li Juan retrieved the golden-veined frog. This naturally delighted the Azure Sun Celestial King.

This main medicine was truly far too difficult to obtain. Because of the Cloudy Dream Marsh’s peculiar environment, even the vision of Celestial Kings would be severely affected. As such, trying to find a golden-veined frog there would be incredibly difficult.

Moreover, he hadn’t been able to leave, either, so he had no option but to send his disciples out. Unexpectedly, they actually managed to surprise him with success.

The Azure Sun Celestial King took his leave first, impatiently rushing away to concoct the medicine to save his wife. When he finally finished, three days had already passed.

When he returned to meet Ling Han, he wore an extremely exhausted expression. However, this still couldn’t conceal his excitement.

“Thank you so much, friend!” the Azure Sun Celestial King said as he clasped his hands in gratitude.

If it weren’t for Ling Han, they would have definitely failed to obtain the golden-veined frog. At the same time, it would have also been impossible to uncover that Ji Xueming was a traitor, and the Duplicate Moon Sect might have truly suffered the terrible fate planned for them. It might have suddenly collapsed one day, and perhaps the Azure Sun Celestial King would have been able to flee, but his wife would definitely be killed.

Thus, the Azure Sun Celestial King was extremely sincere when he expressed his gratitude.

Ling Han calmly accepted his thanks, saying, “We can regard this as fate!”

The Azure Sun Celestial King naturally became even more moved. He talked about all matters under the sun with Ling Han, and this caused him to admire Ling Han even more.

Ling Han also seized this opportunity to ask about the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Even though the Azure Sun Celestial King’s knowledge of this matter was limited, he at least still knew one important piece of information.

That was, one million years ago, Heavenly Venerate Zhou Heng had returned with numerous supreme prodigies, placing all of them in the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. This had caused a huge stir.

World’s paramount!

Ling Han repeated this in his mind, and he couldn’t help but chuckle. With the Flaming Frost Realm being a super high-level dimension, and with so many Heavenly Venerates working together, this academy indeed had the right to be named as the world’s paramount.

Zhou Heng had said that it wasn’t only him bringing prodigies to the academy. Several other Heavenly Venerates would also be bringing monarch tiers and monarch stars over from the various dimensions, nurturing them in the hopes of producing more Heavenly Venerates. Thus, the World’s Paramount Martial Academy would definitely be brimming with supreme talents.

Would there be freaks with an Evolution Index of 12?

Most definitely.

Ling Han’s fighting spirit was instantly ignited. In fact, he was itching to immediately rush over to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy to spar with all of those prodigies.

Ling Han asked for more detail about the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, yet the Azure Sun Celestial King didn’t know much about this topic. Ling Han was slightly disappointed upon learning this.

Forget about it, he would worry about this when he went to the academy. In any case, it was inevitable that he would go.

When they parted, the Azure Sun Celestial King directly gifted a mine to Ling Han in order to express his gratitude.

Several days later, Ling Han appeared in this mine.

“Heh, what a sly person this Azure Sun Celestial King is,” Ling Han said with a smile and a shake of his head.

This was the mine that the Red Flower Sect and the Duplicate Moon Sect had been fighting over this entire time. In reality, it was still unclear who owned this mine. On one day, the Red Flower Sect might push the Duplicate Moon Sect away, and on another day, the opposite might happen. Thus, neither sect was able to mine this area.

Now that the Azure Sun Celestial King had gifted this mine to Ling Han, his act of seeming generosity was actually accompanied by this troublesome baggage as well.

From another perspective, the Azure Sun Celestial King was also greatly disheartened. In his fight for this mine, he had come extremely close to losing his wife. This allowed him to reach a realization. There was no need to care so much about some external matter.

However, he was also unwilling to surrender this mine to the Red Flower Sect for no reason. Thus, gifting it to Ling Han was naturally the best course of action.

“He’s also managed to transfer this trouble to me,” Ling Han murmured. If the Red Flower Sect discovered his presence in the mines, they would definitely send people over to stop him. Thus, unless Ling Han was willing to abandon the mine, it was inevitable that they would clash.

In any case, it was possible that Divine Metal existed in this mine. Even if this was only a possibility, Ling Han was still determined to explore it.

He was in desperate need of Divine Metal. He needed to forge his own Heavenly Venerate Tool.

Ling Han continued to mull over other issues as he walked toward the mine.

He definitely had to eliminate Heavenborn. However, a sliver of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s imprint most likely existed inside Heavenborn, so would it be possible to destroy the latter’s soul and allow the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable to take over?

If this were possible, wouldn’t the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable be reborn?

With the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s prodigious talent, and with Heavenborn’s incredible physique, just what kind of lofty height would he reach in the future?

Ling Han was filled with eager anticipation upon thinking of this. He had never dreamed about being the lone hero in this world. Hysteria had reached the Seventh Tier of the Heavenly Venerable Tier long ago, and it had more so transformed its own body into a dimension. Its strength was definitely paramount in the Genesis World.

Slaying Hysteria by himself?

That was simply impossible.

Thus, the more Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates there were, the better. After reaching a certain number, they could definitely rival Hysteria. When this number was surpassed, could they perhaps slay Hysteria and bring peace and tranquility back to the Genesis World?

As long as Hysteria remained, the Genesis World would face the threat of being fully engulfed by it. At that time, everything would descend into desolation and destruction.

“Halt!”

Just as his mind was wandering, not paying attention to the surroundings, he suddenly heard the angry shout of someone.

He looked up, only to see a mountain face before him. There were camps to either side, yet one of them was already empty. Meanwhile, the other camp was fervently constructing something.

The person who had shouted at him was an Ascending Origin Tier elite. He wore a gray hat, and his eyes were filled with sharpness and ferocity.

It was clear that the Duplicate Moon Sect had already retreated. Right now, the Red Flower Sect was preparing to open this mine. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ling Han smiled, and said, “The Azure Sun Celestial King has already gifted this mine to me. You guys don’t need to worry about me, either. I’ll leave after having a look around.” He naturally couldn’t care less about ordinary ore. He only needed Divine Metal.

“Haha! What an absolute fool!” the man with the gray hat said with loud laughter.

Swoosh!

He dashed forward and viciously thrust forth his spear, causing the wind to whistle.

Even though Ling Han only appeared to be at the Hidden Radiance Stage, this man was an extremely careful person. Thus, he had attacked with his full strength, afraid that Ling Han had cultivated some technique that allowed him to conceal his true cultivation level.

After all, the Duplicate Moon Sect’s sudden retreat was far too unreasonable. Thus, it was only natural that he acted with extreme caution.

Ling Han simply ignored him as he continued to stride forward.

Peng!

The spear struck him, yet an even more terrifying power reverberated, causing the spear to instantly shoot back.

The butt of the spear was blunt, yet it ruthlessly pierced through the heart of the man with the gray hat with a plop.
