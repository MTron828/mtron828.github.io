Chapter 1187: Obtaining the Divine Fluid From Amidst an Army of Thousands

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

More and more powerful cultivators appeared, and they all unleashed their most powerful abilities.

Only eight of the people present had reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, though Hu Feiyun wasn’t participating in the battle. Theoretically speaking, these seven people would be the most powerful individuals here. However, this was only in theory.

Meanwhile, there were many more people who had severed their own cultivation. In fact, there were over 100 of them. Their power was no weaker than that of the seven king tiers, and their battle prowess was also immensely impressive. This was in no small part due to the fact that they had been at the Sun Moon Tier before, which meant that they had already grasped more powerful Regulations of heaven and earth.

There was no need for all of them to team up, however, as just a group of 10 such cultivators would be enough to trouble Shen Zhu’er, Shi Anguo, and the other young king tiers. The young king tiers would have to wait until the effects of the forbidden pills wore off before they could counterattack and suppress these elderly cultivators.

With these 100 or so people joining the battle, chaos instantly ensued.

However, Shen Zhu’er, Shi Anguo, and the others still displayed their impressive might. Although everyone’s power was similar, this didn’t mean that everyone’s battle prowess was also similar. In addition to power, one’s battle prowess would also depend on the techniques that they practiced.

King tiers were king tiers. Among those who possessed similar cultivation levels, the battle prowess of king tier prodigies was a level above everyone else.

Apart from Wu Zhe, who was slightly weaker, the other five king tiers were all in the thick of the action. They attacked each other and fought over the drop of Thousand Source True Fluid as they blasted everyone else aside.

“Beat it!” An elder reached over to push Ling Han away. Power that was close to the Sun Moon Tier fluctuated over, and this was the strongest power that this mystery realm could contain. At least, this was the case for outsiders—they would be targeted by the restriction if their power exceeded this level.

As such, this level of power was almost invincible!

“You’re already so old, yet you still speak in such an impolite matter. You truly deserve a beating.” Ling Han humphed, retrieving his Divine Demon Sword and unleashing the Lightning Sword Technique.

“What?!” The elder let out a muffled groan as he was sent flying by Ling Han’s sword strike. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His expression changed drastically. That strike had been far too quick, and he had barely been able to see the trajectory of the sword light before he had been struck. Moreover, the destructive power of that strike was also incredible. It had ripped through his Origin Power defenses and cut deep into his flesh.

Gasp!

If they fought head-on, he would definitely be cut into pieces after 10 or so exchanges.

‘Impossible!

‘That strike was quick, yet it was still insanely powerful. How can these two qualities exist at the same time?’

This thought had barely left his mind when Ling Han had already charged past him.

Peng, peng, peng!

Ling Han unleashed several more strikes, and many more cultivators were sent flying into the distance. Beads of cold sweat dripped down the elder’s forehead. He felt that he would never be able to understand this sword strike, no matter how many times he saw it in action.

He was definitely no match for Ling Han, unless he grew much stronger, or unless they had a crushing advantage in numbers. If he faced Ling Han alone, he would lose in a very short amount of time.

Ling Han cut through the crowd of fighting cultivators, and he became the seventh young king tier of this location. From the perspective of others, he could rank sixth among the seven king tiers as he was evidently stronger than Wu Zhe. This was because Wu Zhe didn’t enjoy a significant advantage over the older generation of cultivators.

“Damn it!” The cultivators who had been sent flying were enraged, and they all launched counterattacks at Ling Han as if in tacit understanding. All kinds of dazzling lights and divine patterns streaked through the air toward Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly and borrowed the power of their attacks to increase his speed.

Peng!

He was like a human cannonball, and he instantly sent the dozen or so people in front of him flying. He had the power of several elites behind him, and thus the force of this collision was absolutely devastating.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

The crowds separated like scattering flowers as everyone stumbled to the side.

Ling Han was unscathed, and he continued to charge forward.

The surrounding cultivators were all stunned. ‘What kind of fighting technique is this? Are you a f*cking human weapon?!’

Could the situation have been any crazier? Ling Han had been struck by a barrage of attacks, yet he had actually taken advantage of their momentum to increase his speed and knock others aside! His defenses were downright freakish! Who could injure him?

Ling Han had already charged into the core area of the battle. This was the battleground of He Tao, Shen Zhu’er, and the others. They continued to fight over that drop of divine fluid, yet none of them was able to successfully obtain it. There was an endless collision of powers, and this caused the divine fluid to continuously jump through the air.

“Humph!” Shen Zhu’er and the four other king tiers were all extremely displeased upon seeing another competitor appear. They didn’t hold back as they started launching attacks at Ling Han.

Although they had already made an agreement to cooperate at the end and open a treasure storage together, they would still be competitors before that. It was just that they had a bottom line—they definitely wouldn’t kill any of the other six king tiers.

Ling Han laughed heartily and completely ignored the attacks of the other five king tiers. He extended his hand toward that drop of Thousand Source True Fluid.

He had a freakish physique, so he could do as he pleased.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Countless attacks roared toward Ling Han, yet he didn’t even attempt to block them. The furious attacks tore his clothes to shreds, and then left a few blood marks on his skin.

‘F*ck!

‘The king tiers attacked him together, yet they only left some blood marks on his skin?!’

Everyone was transfixed in shock. Meanwhile, Ling Han took advantage of their hesitation to grab the drop of Thousand Source True Fluid and place it into his Black Tower.

“Hand it over!” the five king tiers shouted as they attacked him.

“Hurry up and hand it over!” The older generation of elites outside the core area of battle also launched attacks at him. Attacks rained down on Ling Han, and it was as if the sky were about to collapse. It was a petrifying scene.

Ling Han was too lazy to even block them, and he simply crossed his arms before his chest.

The attacks crashed down, and the divine patterns that were intertwined within them radiated with a brilliant glow.

These attacks were all near the level of the Sun Moon Tier, and even elites at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier would be horrified if they were to face such a violent barrage of attacks. They definitely wouldn’t dare to face it head-on.

However, Ling Han remained where he was and calmly allowed the attacks to hit him.

Boom!

The earth shook, and shock waves swept into the surroundings. Clouds of dust billowed into the air. Ling Han was sent flying, yet when he landed, everyone was shocked to discover that he had only received some minor, superficial wounds. Not a single one of his bones had been broken, and he definitely hadn’t been smashed into a pulp.

“You guys want me to hand the divine fluid over? Then show me that you’re powerful enough to take it!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Come on, I don’t mind playing around with you people.”

‘You’re the target of so many elites, yet this is just a simple game to you?

‘You’re far too arrogant!’

However, they had to admit that his physique was indeed monstrous. Him being able to survive the barrage of attacks just then was proof. He had been hit by over 100 attacks, yet he had walked out of it as if nothing had happened. That being the case, who could still pose a threat to him?

The five king tiers were the first to stop attacking Ling Han. The other cultivators gradually stopped attacking him as well. There was no point attacking him any further—it was impossible to snatch that drop of Thousand Source True Fluid from him.

“Done?” Ling Han asked with a beaming smile. He sat down where he stood.

“Why aren’t you leaving?” someone asked in an interrogative tone.

According to the standard convention, those who obtained a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid would immediately leave. After all, it was far too dangerous to remain. If one remained, they would be ganged up on by others, and it would be impossible to withstand the endless waves of attacks.

Moreover, those who could obtain a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid were definitely very powerful. Once they left, there would effectively be one less powerful competitor. As such, this would also be beneficial to others.

Leaving after obtaining a drop of divine fluid was the standard convention.

“Why must I leave?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

His physique was invincible, so he could naturally stay to fight for more Thousand Source True Fluid. Anyhow, there was no rule mandating that one had to leave after obtaining a single drop of divine fluid.
