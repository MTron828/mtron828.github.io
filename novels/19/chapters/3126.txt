3127 Investigating the Mine

Ordinarily, the Jade Dragon Mine would send a batch of jade seeds every 10 days. This was the sect’s greatest source of income. Then, these jade seeds would be distributed to every disciple.

He had thought that it was only because of the weather that they had been delayed for a day or two, but the expected delivery had already exceeded the limit by five days. This wasn’t right.

Sending Ling Han instead of an elder was to establish Ling Han’s prestige as a Dao Child. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Only by doing more things could one gain prestige and be trusted.

“This is a Talisman Weapon.” Sun Jian handed Ling Han a piece of paper that was suffused with a yellow hue and exuded a hint of antiquity. “If you really encounter great danger, drip your blood on this and throw it out.”

“Talisman Weapon?” Ling Han took the yellow paper, and was slightly surprised.

There was such a thing in the Genesis World as well. A great elite would attach a portion of their battle prowess to a tool through a special method. When thrown out against an enemy, it could unleash a terrifying might.

However, it was not triggered by blood, but by divine intent.

Sun Jianfang could actually make Talisman Weapons?

“This was passed down from ancient times. I also found it in the ruins of the Ancient Dao Sect,” Sun Jianfang explained. “There aren’t many such Talisman Weapons. Furthermore, because it has been too long, its power should have been weakened. It can only attack with the power of Ten Meridians.”

What did Ten Meridians mean?

Ability to release mystical power!

Therefore, even though it was just a piece of paper, it could unleash great power.

Sun Jianfang still treasured Ling Han very much. He had bestowed him with a Ten Meridians level Talisman Weapon, so if Ling Han went to a small mine to investigate the situation, even he should not have any problems.

“Alright, I’ll set off immediately.” Ling Han nodded.

He was currently in the early stage of Six Meridians, but his power had already reached 8,500 kg, which was comparable to the early stage of Eight Meridians. Coupled with the Demonic Monkey Fists, he would just barely be able to put up a fight against Li Changdan if they were to meet in battle, even without the suppression of his cultivation level.

Therefore, with the addition of a Talisman Weapon, he was full of confidence.

“Go, be careful.” Sun Jianfang waved his hand.

Ling Han returned to his residence and made some slight adjustments. He rejected the little handmaiden’s suggestion to accompany him, carried his longsword, and left the mountain.

With Li Changdan’s many years of connections, even if his reputation had plummeted—as the saying went, a centipede dies, but never falls down—he was still capable of some feats. He could not be underestimated.

Six Meridians to fight against Nine Meridians, and he was at the peak stage of Nine Meridians at that. Ling Han did not think that he had any chance of winning, unless he threw out the Talisman Weapon.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then began to take a roundabout route, weaving through the mountain forests, and choosing all the paths that no one would take.

Now that he had more than 5,000 kg of strength, it was naturally much easier for him to cross mountains and ridges than before. After spending some effort, he arrived near the Jade Dragon Mine two days later.

Because of this mine, a village had been built here. The miners usually ate and lived here, and they would only return to the town once in a while.

Of course, the miners here were all ordinary people. Only 13 supervisors were disciples of the Ancient Dao Sect, and one of them was the leader. His cultivation level was Eight Meridians, and his abilities were not considered weak. With him here, he could even kill a ferocious tiger with a single punch.

Ling Han arrived at the village, and immediately felt that something was amiss.

Even though it was afternoon, and the miners were supposed to be working in the cave, the entire village was as quiet as a ghostly village, which naturally made him feel that something was amiss.

Where did everyone go?

The miners weren’t around, but there had to be someone who would start a fire and cook.

As Ling Han walked through the village, his longsword was already in his hand. Although he had yet to grasp any sword techniques, it was still better to hold a sword in this sort of situation.

Whoosh. A mountain breeze blew over. It was clearly September, but there was actually a chilling feeling to it.

Ling Han’s footsteps were very light. He walked from the entrance of the village to the back, and didn’t discover a single person. He also observed carefully, but didn’t find any traces of a fight.

It seemed that the people here had run away on their own, so nobody caused any damage. Otherwise, even if they encountered a super elite, it would not be so… peaceful, right?

Ling Han started from the end of the village, searching house by house.

Empty, empty, empty. When he was about to reach the village entrance, he finally found a clue in one of the houses.

In fact, he didn’t know if it was a clue or not, but it was a scale the size of a fingernail. Judging from its shape, it was impossible to determine which animal it had fallen off.

The other clue was that it had a fishy smell. Although it was only a scale, the smell it emitted was incomparably dense.

It was also because Ling Han had detected this fishy smell that he had gone to look for the source of the fishy smell, which was why he had found this scale.

Could it be that a ferocious creature had appeared and eaten all the villagers here?

Was that possible?

There were 13 Ancient Dao Sect disciples here. The strongest one even had the cultivation level of Eight Meridians. What kind of ferocious creature could not be defeated by them?

In fact, not a single person survived?

In that case, such a ferocious creature had to be at least Nine Meridians or in fact Ten Meridians.

“Hmm?”

He heard light footsteps. Had a survivor returned?

Ling Han walked out of the door. Shua, a cold light flashed past, slashing towards his head.

This attack was fast and ruthless, and its power was even more vigorous.

In such a strange place, Ling Han naturally would not be careless. He had long been prepared to face danger, and thus he immediately parried the attack with the longsword in his hand.

Ding!

A crisp sound rang out, and he felt his right hand go slightly numb. However, this attack was also neutralized by him.

But at this moment, another cold light shot over.

There was more than one person who made a move!

Ling Han’s feet shifted, and he dodged this attack. His entire body felt a bit of pain. After the exchange of blows, he was still able to forcefully make such a change despite the fact that his power was surging. This was truly too much.

However, the third attack came as well.

Ling Han had used up all his power, and it was impossible for his body to change directions again. How could he neutralize this attack?

Nothing was impossible!

Ling Han channeled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, and the power in his meridians once again channeled inconceivably, providing him with an endless supply of power.

With a great flip, he finally dodged the third attack.

There was no fourth attack.

Three people appeared in front of Ling Han.

Rui Yuanliang, Yang Fei, and… Li Changdan!

The three of them actually joined forces?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and gave an oh in his heart. Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang had been humiliated badly enough by him during the Dao Child selection, while Li Changdan had lost his position as the Dao Child, and had not been able to become the son-in-law of the He Clan because of this.

Thus, the three of them hit it off right away.

Haha, this Li Changdan was cautious indeed. He was clearly at the level of Nine Meridians, but he didn’t choose to act alone.
