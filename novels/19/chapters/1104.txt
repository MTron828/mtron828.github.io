Chapter 1105: Tricolor Wind and Fire Lotus

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was very pleased—he had not put much power into this blow. It was completely the power of the Divine Demon Sword alone.

It was obviously just a Level Three God Tool, but because his martial intent was engraved on it, it actually possessed might above its level. It was definitely capable of matching a Level Four God Tool.

...So even God Tools could have tier-surpassing battle abilities?

Shua , the remaining violent fish hurriedly flicked their tails, and fled in the opposite direction.

Previously, Ling Han had merely descaled them, but did not kill them, which made these violent fishes have no qualms about attacking him, but when they discovered that this man was not a saint and was not to be trifled with, they naturally made a swift getaway.

“So this is the greatest Divine Sword in the world?” Shui Yanyu had naturally seen Jin Zhihui, and knew that he had especially come to deliver a sword to Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “I owe him a huge favor.”

Shui Yanyu smiled, and said, “This is definitely a big favor, but I believe that only in your hands would this sword really reach its pinnacle. For a swordsmith, this is what he would most want to see. Otherwise, if it was hidden in his own hands, it would only be covering a brilliant pearl with dirt.”

“Wife, you are getting better and better at talking; your little mouth is really very sweet.” Ling Han grinned, acting like he was about to pinch Shui Yanyu’s cheek, causing the latter to directly roll her eyes at him, filled with irritation.

“I am really expectant. Let us have some even more powerful violent fish, and let this sword advance to the height of Level Four Godly metal.”

Shui Yanyu peered into the distance, and abruptly turned ashen as she exclaimed, “You jinx!”

A giant fish was swimming towards them. It was as much as a few thousand meters long, and though it was not the largest, when the waves it created surged towards them, they directly swept both Ling Han and Shui Yanyu away. They did not have the slightest ability to resist.

“The strength of this fish has reached Sun Moon Tier at least!” Ling Han declared.

The giant fish approached tumultuous, opened its huge mouth, and all the surrounding seawater suddenly began surging towards its mouth. Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were no exception, either, as they were sucked along with the seawater, heading towards it.

“Move!” Ling Han shouted.

The Asura Demon Emperor quickly charged out. The power of Sun Moon Tier surged, and shooting out a fist, it compressed the seawater, forming a shock wave that continued to become bigger, and slammed towards the big fish.

Peng!

The massive fish was suddenly sent flying a few thousand meters. The strength behind this punch was extremely immense. A part of its body had even caved it, causing bloody water to seep out.

The giant fish charged back in rage born from pain. With a sweep of its tail, a furious wave rolled out.

The Asura Demon Emperor went to meet this strike. Though he was pitifully small in size, he did not lose in terms of strength. He shot out a fist in a direct confrontation with the giant fish, and both sides were sent flying back.

The man and fish battled furiously. Neither of them were cultivators in the true essence of the word. One was a puppet, depending on True Origin Stones and formation patterns which allowed it to possess battle prowess of the Sun Moon Tier, whereas the other was gifted by nature, possessing a massive body and frightening strength.

This was just like an ant. How long would it have to cultivate to be able to possess strength equivalent to a normal human’s?

The power on both sides was more or less equal. However, the puppet had an advantage in that it lacked the ability to feel pain, and its body was forged out of high-grade Godly metal. Naturally, it had a huge lead, and after a few dozen moves, a great many scales had been torn off the giant fish, which began to bleed.

It was afraid now. With a flick of its tail, it fled quickly.

“F***, I am really too awesome now!” The Asura Demon Emperor declared proudly. Being able to send an opponent of the Sun Moon Tier fleeing was something that he couldn’t even begin to imagine doing in the past.

This was too awesome!

When he saw Ling Han walk over, the Asura Demon Emperor immediately wiped the conceit off his face, and switched to a pandering expression. He exclaimed, “I am really too grateful to you, Master! Master, you are like a second parent to me, the bright sun on the path that I am walking, wherever you shine is where light is...”

He began to ingratiate himself with Ling Han madly, completely having no idea what the word ‘sickening’ meant.

“Enough, enough. I’m about to vomit.” Ling Han hurriedly waved him off, causing Shui Yanyu to purse her lips in an amused smile.

Only then did the Asura Demon Emperor sheepishly become quiet, feeling that he had not praised enough. In any case, he could not possibly increase his abilities through cultivation, so he had been training his skill of sucking up these few days.

It was so rare for him to have such a good opportunity to use this skill. He had not thought that just when he had barely started, he would be stopped, which made him a little depressed. Why did Master not allow him to show off his strength?

After sinking deep into the great sea, this forest showed its magnificent appearance.

These massive weeds were no longer of the same dark green color, but had become brilliantly colored. Some were purple, red, and orange, and the colors of the fishes had similarly become even richer and more colorful.

However, the threat posed by these fishes increased further—these big giants obviously did not have the slightest tremor of Origin Power, yet were born with divine patterns, which gave them unique abilities.

There were gigantic octopuses that would spit out ink when encountered, dyeing their surroundings completely black. Not only could they not even see the fingers on their own hands, even their divine sense would be completely blocked, causing one to become completely blind, and they could only submit themselves to attacks.

There were giant fish that had multicolored sharp spikes growing from their heads. Ling Han watched one penetrate the body of another huge fish with a spike, killing the latter in a single move.

And there were also others that possessed strong poison. There was completely no need for them to strike their opponents directly. The area they swam through was a zone of poison in itself. A great many giant fish directly turned over and died, killed easily by poison.

This was a dangerous place: big fish would eat small fish, and small fish would eat cultivators. Of course, when big fish feasted, they would not mind also eating a few cultivators as they did.

Everywhere, there were the bones of giant fish. There were also severed body parts of cultivators. Usually, there would only be an arm, a leg, or a head, floating around in the huge sea.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle was not useful in this underwater area, so Ling Han did not use this God Tool. When they met with giant fish below the medium extreme of Sun Moon Tier, he would have the Asura Demon Emperor deal with it, and if they encountered even stronger ones, they would hide into the Black Tower. They would only leave when the coast was clear.

The fish here still had a bit of value. The bones of some fish were made of metal, their quality comparable to Godly metal of the same level. Thus, as long as they met such fish, Ling Han would draw them into the Black Tower. In future, he could use them to increase the might of the Divine Demon Sword.

In a certain corner of the deep sea, Empress Luan Xing was standing opposite an old man, and near them, there was a tricolored lotus flower in full bloom. Even in such an environment, one could still smell its beautiful fragrance.

As expected, this was a divine herb. Otherwise, how could it have attracted the attention of Empress Luan Xing? But that old man was actually capable of standing strong against her, showing that his abilities were definitely extraordinary.

They both stood with hands crossed behind their backs. In a diameter of about three meters around them, there was actually not even a drop of seawater, which showed their powerful abilities, being capable of blocking even the seawater in this place. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“This is merely a Tricolor Wind and Fire Lotus, and would need at least a few million years to evolve into a Seven-Colored one. It is not of any use to you at all, so why don’t you allow me to have it? I shall not take it for nothing, either. I am willing to part with three Dragon Fragrance Pills as compensation. How about it?” the old man asked.

Tricolor Wind and Fire Lotus was a unique treasure of heaven and earth. If a Mountain River Tier cultivator drew it into the space of his Dantian, he would be nurtured by the Divine Lotus at all times. Not only would his cultivation rapidly accumulate, he could also communicate with the Dao of Heaven and Earth with the help of the Divine Lotus because it was a great treasure of the heaven and earth. Even the comprehension of his cultivation level would be amazingly accelerated.

However, when the cultivator advanced into the Sun Moon Tier, the essence of the Divine Lotus would have been expended, and would naturally wilt.

This was still a Tricolored one; if it had reached Five Colors, it could be used by Sun Moon Tier cultivators, and for a Seven-Colored one, even Heavenly Body Tier elites would treat it like an ultimate treasure.
