Chapter 40: Reward

Translator: Lonelytree

“Tell me, what do you want? As long as it’s something I can do, I’ll definitely satisfy you.” Said Marquis Alina generously as he looked at Elin.

For a family that controlled many of the iron mines in the Empire, the financial power of the Alina family was no laughing matter. At the very least, he was one of the most powerful Marquises in the Empire.

Marquis Alina’s thoughts were also very simple. Since Eli had saved his life, he would naturally do his best to satisfy Eli’s needs. This was the rule of the nobles.

He would pay some money, but Eli had sacrificed a precious bottle of medicine.

He also wanted to see what kind of things this young man wanted.

Was it Noble’s title, a large number of gold tarls, or a Manor?

“my Lord, I believe you’ve heard from count Gimori what I need. I only need the violet irises. ” Eli answered calmly.

“Only violet irises?”

Marquis Alina raised an eyebrow in surprise.

He had already said that he could let Eli name his conditions, but Eli only asked for purple irises.

Naturally, he had heard about Eli’s request from count Gimori, but he did not expect that even after he had offered such luxurious conditions, all Eli wanted was the violet irises.

For a moment, he was a little stunned.

“Are you sure you only want the purple irises? Money, a Manor, you can ask for these. I can even help you think of a way to get a noble title.” As if uncertain, Marquis Alina asked again.

“Yes, I only want the purple irises!” Eli nodded.

It was fine even if he didn’t have any money now. At most, he could go to the casino to get some money.

He didn’t need a Manor or a villa. After all, in a few decades, or even a hundred years, he would have to change his identity and place of residence. It would be a pain to have one. He preferred to rent a place. If the place were too big, he would definitely need servants, which would be detrimental to his experiments.

With the title, there would be more social interactions and trouble, which he felt was a little boring.

“Alright, then.” Marquis Alina helplessly nodded. This was the first time he had wanted to give something but could not.

However, this also made him think even more highly of this young man.

“I really like you.” Marquis Alina looked at Eli in admiration. “but just the purple irises aren’t enough. How about this? I’ll let you go to my warehouse and pick three items. Anything will do.”

As if thinking it was too little, Marquis Alina added.

This time, before Eli could say anything, Marquis Alina extended his hand and said, ” you can’t refuse this. It’s a gift from a Marquis.”

“Alright then. Thank you, my Lord.” Eli nodded.

The warehouses in this world were not really just storerooms. Most nobles would store precious items in their warehouses, and a Marquis ‘warehouse would naturally have more precious items. Perhaps, Eli could even find some good stuff inside.

“It’s okay. You deserve this. This is for you!” Seeing that Eli had accepted it, count Alina smiled, then suddenly reached out to his chest, took off his noble badge, and handed it to Eli. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“This is the friendship of the Alina family. If you have any needs in the future, take this badge, and the Alina family will do their best to help you.”

“Alright, thank you, Lord Marquis.” Eli took the badge.

He couldn’t refuse this. First, this thing might really be useful in the future. Second, it represented the friendship of the Marquis family. He couldn’t say no, right? that would be too disrespectful to the Marquis.

“Hmm, then that’s all for today’s conversation. If you need any help, you can contact me through count Gimori, or you can take the badge directly to the Alina family’s territory. Cough, cough, cough.” It seemed that the Marquis was not in good health. He coughed twice after he finished speaking.

After coughing, he pulled on the rope beside him.

A Bell rang outside the door.

The other door of the room opened a few seconds later, and a few doctors came in to take care of the Marquis.

At the same time, a middle-aged man in a black suit walked in. The Marquis waved him over and seemed to say something. Then, the man walked over and said to Eli, ” Mr. Eli, let me bring you to the warehouse.”

Eli nodded and stood up.

He glanced at the doctors surrounding the Marquis, then turned around and followed.

...

Soon, the middle-aged man led Eli to the warehouse.

This was a warehouse built against a mountain. It was separated from the outside by a thick iron door. There were two knights standing guard outside at all times. Moreover, this place was very close to the castle. If anything happened, there would be a large number of Knights to help immediately.

“This is warehouse No. 1. It contains the marquis’ best collection!” The middle-aged man brought Eli closer to the warehouse.

“Number one. Are there any other warehouses?” Standing behind the man, Eli asked.

“Of course. The Marquis has three warehouses here, and their value is lower in order. The Marquis usually rewards people with stuff from warehouse number three. Although I don’t know what you did, the Marquis must like you very much.” The middle-aged man, who was actually the Marquis’ Butler, looked at Eli with a smile.

“I see!” Eli nodded, indicating that he understood.

The Marquis was very powerful!

“You can go in now.” The middle-aged man then went to negotiate with the guards and gave them some badges. Then, the two knights slowly opened the door.

As soon as he opened the door, a cloud of dust rose, and Eli looked inside.

The interior was very large, basically in the shape of a cuboid. There were shelves on both sides with all sorts of things placed on them. Although he only took a glance, Eli still found many good things.

“The warehouse is huge. You can take your time to choose.” The Butler patted Eli’s shoulder, indicating that he could go in.

Eli nodded and then walked in.

Entering the warehouse, Eli began to look around.

It had to be said that this place was worthy of being a Marquis’ collection, and there was no lack of valuable items.

For example, Eli saw a piece of sapphire. Its purity and appearance were all top-notch. He estimated that this one piece of sapphire could be sold for a hundred gold tarls.

Of course, Eli guessed that this was probably one of the more valuable items in this storage unit.

“I wonder what’s the situation in warehouse 3? ” Eli’s hand brushed past a valuable piece of armor, and he felt a little tempted.

“This is the tail feather of a Sunbird!”

“This is an ore that is impossible to find in the empire!”

“This is wood with spirituality! ”

The warehouse was huge, and Eli was impressed. He looked at each item one by one, and although most of them were ordinary items, he did find quite a few that he could use.

As he walked, Eli suddenly stopped and stood in front of a shelf.

There was a black ball-like object on the shelf.

“Isn’t this the shed skin of the hundred transformation beast?” Eli’s eyes lit up.
