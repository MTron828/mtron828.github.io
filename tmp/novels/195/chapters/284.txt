285 The Final Battle

Hence, they were a bigger threat to the bloodline tower than usual since this was their last stand.

..

Winter was approaching.

At this moment, more than 100000 people had already gathered on the battlefield between the Holy tower and the bloodline tower. It was a sea of people. Even if there was a gap in between, one could still see the oppressive aura of the other side.

!!

At this moment, within the bloodline tower’s camp, dozens of warlocks were sitting in a tent and having a small meeting.

Those who could come here were at least third-circle, and in the most central position sat Vivika, who was a late-stage third circle, next to Nikola.

As the absolute core of the bloodline tower, the two of them were definitely the center.

“How many people from the Holy tower are here?” Vivika asked.

“Tower master, there are almost 100000 Wizards, and tens of thousands of magical beasts gathered outside the Holy tower. They have even pulled up the magical beasts used for transportation!” Rodin reported.

Now that the heart of darkness was long gone, he was completely at ease with the bloodline tower.

“Yes.” Vivika nodded.

“100,000 isn’t a lot. After all, most of them are apprentices. It would be good enough if they had 10000 or 20000 official warlocks. However, since they had even brought the transport magical beasts, it seemed that they were really planning to put all their hopes on this battle!”

“Sir, we are sure to win this war. Not only do we have the advantage in numbers, but we also have Sir Hydra!”

“Indeed!”

“Lord Hydra is so powerful. I really don’t know how powerful Lord Herman is. He hasn’t shown his face for many years.”

A Warlock broke the silence, and the atmosphere immediately eased.

“We can’t be careless. There’s the hourglass behind the Holy tower. No one knows what will happen!” Nikola said, and his undead aura shocked everyone!

At this time, they also realized that they were celebrating too early.

“Nikola is right. You can look down on the Holy tower, but you can’t relax about the hourglass.” Vivika nodded.

“However, it seems that the main body of the hourglass is not interested in the Holy tower, so the hourglass will probably not show up in this war.

“Also, my teacher told me that he would make a move if necessary!”

“What?! Lord Herman is going to join us?!

“It can’t be!”

The warlocks exclaimed in surprise. After all, it had been a long time since Eli had shown his face!

“Mm, that’s it then. Release the news that we’ll launch the final battle in three days!” Vivika looked at the crowd, her eyes sharp.

“Yes!”

The warlocks all nodded.

The war was finally coming to an end!

..

“Three days, how arrogant!”

In the Holy tower, Situ slammed the news from the frontline on the table before he looked up and scanned his surroundings. There were also a dozen warlocks, all of whom were high-level members of the holy tower.

“How are the preparations?” Situ asked.

“It’s almost time. Everyone who can come has come!” Woox said.

“Alright,” Situ nodded.

“What other ideas do you have? you can tell us now and see if we’ve missed anything!” He looked at the crowd and asked.

Everyone looked at each other, but no one spoke.

In fact, the Holy tower’s situation was obvious to all, and it was really bad.

They didn’t even see much hope of victory. Whether it was in terms of basic strength or high-end combat power, they were far inferior to the bloodline tower.

Moreover, there was also that giant snake called Hydra, which made everyone feel even more terrified.

Even an ordinary Warlock at the peak of the third circle was no match for it.

“It doesn’t matter. You can tell me what you’re thinking!” Seeing that no one was speaking, Situ frowned. Had the momentum already dropped to this extent?

“I have an idea.”

Suddenly, a Warlock raised his hand! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Udo?” Woox looked at the person beside him. It was his student, Udo.

“Speak.” Situ glanced at the two of them and then said.

“Can I not participate in the battle?” Udo said through gritted teeth.

In fact, since the start of this war, he had been doing the logistics work and was unwilling to fight with the bloodline tower. As Woox’s student, he had the right to do so, but now, he had no choice but to fight.

The Holy tower was the place where he grew up, and Herman had saved his life several times.

He was also very conflicted, which was why he said that.

“You won’t fight?!” The smile on Situ’s face slowly faded.

“Udo, what are you saying?!” At the side, Woox slammed the table and stood up. He angrily rebuked Udo, “What kind of time is this? You’re actually afraid to fight. Men, throw him into the prison!”

Two guards immediately walked over and pulled him back. Udo did not resist, and even after he was pulled out, Udo did not say a word.

“Milord, he still doesn’t know any better!”

After seeing Udo being pulled out, Woox said to Situ.

...

“Oh, it’s okay. He’s still young!” Situ shook his head.

He slowly stood up and looked at the crowd. “Everyone, we won’t lose this battle.”

“The time hourglass’s Lord Klay has arrived. He is a half-step celestial existence. When the time comes, he will help us kill Vivika, Hydra, and the others.

“When the war is over, we will have everything again!”

“Half-step celestial?”

“Time hourglass, Klay?”

The warlocks were initially shocked by the sudden turn of events, but their eyes lit up when they heard the news.

Half-step celestial?

Although he didn’t quite understand this level, from what Situ said, it was the level that could end this war.

Everyone’s low spirits were immediately restored.

It was finally their turn!

...

“Everyone, get ready. Three days later, it will be time for you to show your loyalty to the Holy tower!” Situ said with a smile.

“The Holy tower will win!”

“We will definitely win!”

..

Three days later, in the morning.

The sun had yet to rise, and the world was still in a subtle state.

Although it was summer, the temperature on the battlefield seemed to have frozen. Between the two sides, it was so quiet that one could even hear the buzzing of mosquitoes. Everything seemed to have stopped!

The horn from the bloodline tower sounded.

Vivika was floating in the sky. At this time, Nikola, Rodin, and many other three-circle warlocks were standing beside her, and the Army of the bloodline tower was under her feet.

Tens of thousands of warlocks were gathered together, and the entire ground was like a black ocean. As for the magical beasts, they were also bound to the front of the camp, as they would be the first line of the battle!

Among them, there was also a huge three-headed snake, Hydra.

Hydra’s huge body was standing in the middle of it. When it stood upright, it was dozens of meters tall. There were also a large number of shadows wrapped around its body, making the warlocks not dare to approach it.

“The final battle! I’m so nervous!”

“With Lord Hydra here, we will definitely be able to win.”

“The Holy tower is definitely not our match!”

On the ground, the warlocks held their weapons and stared at the Holy tower warlocks in the distance.

“The smell of death!”

Nikola took a deep breath.

Undead were always accompanied by death, but today would undoubtedly be an unprecedented battle. Many people would die, but as long as he didn’t die, he would become stronger again. And this was a precious opportunity for him.

He looked at the ocean of undead in the sky. Those were his accumulations, but he had released them all today without holding back, just so that he could unleash his power to the greatest extent.

“I hope I don’t die!” Rodin’s heart and liver were trembling!

He had always been a coward, or he wouldn’t have run away when he saw Herman.

Even though he had a third circle, a battle of this level would still be extremely dangerous!

“I hope Grandmaster can come.” Aisha stood next to Vivika, looking forward to it.

At this moment, she already had a third circle. However, when she looked at the Holy tower’s camp, she still felt her heart palpitate. She didn’t know what that was, but she knew that the holy tower had a backup plan.

Time passed by slowly.

Traces of light appeared. Everyone looked over and saw a round sun slowly rising on the horizon. It emitted a warm light and dispelled the cold of the night.

At this moment.

In the sky, Vivika’s voice also spread throughout the battlefield.

“Kill!”
