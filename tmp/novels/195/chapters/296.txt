297 Eli Kills

“These are all chimeras from the Mage era. Be it the techniques, the materials, or even the runes imprinted on them, they are all things that can be used as references!”

Eli picked up a piece of the Chimera’s core and observed it carefully.

It had to be said that Luo ye’s group really didn’t know good materials.

However, this was normal. This thing was indeed useless to warlocks.

“After digesting these, Nikola’s talent should be able to rise a bit more!”

Eli silently put away these things. There were quite a lot of them.

“Luo ye is a good person!”

Eli had just entered the secret plane and was walking along the path that Luo ye had taken.

After he finished collecting, he continued to move forward according to the route Luo ye had shown in his memory.

Soon, he arrived at the canyon.

In the huge Canyon, countless undead had once occupied it, but it was now silent. As for the castle in the center, it had long disappeared!

“After Luo ye’s treatment, there’s no danger here!” Eli exclaimed.

The danger was gone, but there were still many good things!

Eli stretched out her hand, and his mental strength surged like a wave, quickly spreading across the entire Canyon. Pieces of mental strength fragments began to appear. These were the fragments of the undead after they died, but the group of warlocks obviously had no way of collecting them.

The soul fragments were like pieces of mirrors, flickering in the air and gathering in Eli’s hand. Gradually, a soul crystal slowly appeared!

“The quality is very high. It’s almost at the limit of the third circle!” Eli silently kept it. This kind of thing would be useful sooner or later.

He might need a lot of these things for his breakthrough.

Continuing forward, he came to the area where the castle was.

As soon as he entered the area, a thin black thread suddenly emerged from the void and flew toward Eli like a Black bolt of lightning.

But Eli’s reaction was faster, or perhaps, he had already noticed this shadow.

The silvery-white eye turned, and a spiritual force field appeared. The black thread gradually slowed down under this force, and then it was wrapped up by silver spiritual force threads, trapping it!

“Not bad!”

Eli took it. He had never come into contact with this kind of curse.

And it seemed to be much stronger than the ordinary curses he used to cast. Perhaps, Eli could manipulate it for his own uses. After all, it had been a long time since his curses had been upgraded.

“Luo ye was a good person.”

“Let’s continue!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Eli continued to look ahead, and everything was normal.

Soon, he walked forward while collecting the garbage that Luo ye and the others didn’t like!

He found high-level knowledge about the study of the soul in a laboratory, some things about alchemy in a Wizard Tower, and a precious magic plant that could enhance the five senses.

Just like that, Eli walked along the path that Luo ye had walked, laughing as he collected the goods.

Luo ye and the others would suffer, and he would take the harvest!

Luo ye was a good person.

At this time, he was very close to Luo ye and the others. He also saw the mechanical mage tower and the mechanical objects that were spread around it.

However, when he saw this, he quickly retreated.

It wasn’t because they were avoiding danger, but because someone was coming.

..

“We were tricked?” Milo was confused and did not understand what Hall meant.

“Yes.”

Hall took a deep breath and looked around.

At this time, they were in a forest with towering trees nearby. It was quiet, so the voices of the two were very obvious. Fortunately, there was no one else here.

“Are you saying that there’s a problem with the ruins?” Milo asked. He still did not understand what Hall meant, but he believed that Hall would not lie to him.

“No!” Hall shook his head. “there’s a problem with the Holy tower,” he said. “or rather, we might have been deceived!”

“Oh?” Milo’s eyes turned serious.

Hall took a deep breath and said, “When I first came here, I felt that the Holy tower always made me feel uneasy, but I didn’t find any problems. At first, I thought I was overthinking it.

“But just now, Luo ye used the sacred flame the celestial placed on his body. That flame not only suppressed the curses of those people, but it also passed through me and made my blood throb!

“It made me understand what happened.”

Hall’s words became slower and slower, and his expression became uglier and uglier. “we seem to have been deceived by something. In fact, we have never visited the city in the Holy tower. We have been in the same area all this time!”

“What?” Milo’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Try to recall the specific details!” Hall laughed coldly.

Hearing this, Milo immediately began to recall the details.

However, what terrified him was that he couldn’t remember any details. Something made him subconsciously ignore those things. All he remembered was that the Holy tower was normal and the kindness of Herman.

“An illusion?” He suddenly said.

“That’s right, but it might not be a simple illusion.” Hall nodded.

It seemed like Milo had finally realized it, but he only realized that he could not remember the details.

...

It seemed that the illusion that affected them was unimaginably powerful. It was as if it had directly distorted their minds. This was too terrifying. What kind of bloodline could achieve this?

“But I still can’t remember, and I still feel that the memory is very real!” Milo took in a breath of cold air and felt a chill down his back.

The power on the West Coast was stronger than they had imagined!

“We have to inform the others.” He looked at Hall.

Hall also nodded. He was also afraid of an accident, so he first called Milo and then went to inform the others.

Hall was about to take a step forward, but suddenly, the spider-sense belonging to the human-faced giant spider erupted again. He felt a huge wave of fear covering him like a dark cloud, and it was just nearby.

“What?” Hall gritted his teeth and looked over.

Between the trees, a man with black hair and black eyes walked out. He looked at Hall and sighed, “Why can’t you guys just be a little more obedient?

“However, it’s not your fault. It’s normal that the power of the celestial can temporarily nullify the influence of the silvery-white eye!”

“Herman!”

Milo and Hall’s eyes widened when they saw who it was.

...

“Why are you here?” Milo asked directly, his eyes full of caution.

There was definitely something wrong with this person who had been following them.

The two of them stood together, looking at Eli. The aura of a half-step celestial instantly spread out, and their blood began to flow through their bodies like a raging Dragon!

“Eli, it seems like you know something?” Hall looked at Eli.

“Tell us, what is the reason for all this? I don’t know why you’re here, but you won’t be able to do anything in front of two half-step celestial warlocks!”

Hall’s eyes had already turned a deep purple, and several Spider lances had grown out of his back. With a slight shake, a tree that was tens of meters tall to the side was instantly split in half.

Milo’s body was surrounded by a large number of flames, and his eyes had turned red. He looked similar to Woox, but he was much stronger than Woox.

At this moment, the two half-step celestial warlocks unleashed their full power.

In the face of an unknown enemy, they made a common choice.

Looking at this scene, Eli smiled, and boundless shadows began to spread out from his body, instantly covering an area of several kilometers. His bloodline had also been activated, and a pair of Golden Dragon eyes looked at the two of them.

“Third circle later stage?”

The two of them were dumbfounded when they sensed Eli’s strength!

So weak?!

The corners of their mouths began to rise.

“Milo, kill him with all your might. I feel that something is wrong!” Suddenly, Hall said to Milo.

“Alright!” Milo nodded.

Then, the two of them flew into the sky at the same time. The powerful restriction could only allow them to fly for a short time. Looking at the shadows that were following them around, the two of them began to unleash their bloodlines.

Hall let out a hiss, and a mass of black liquid slowly appeared in front of him. It was huge and emitted a strong stench. With just a drop, a large pit several meters deep appeared on the ground.

Poison was spiders’ expertise.

Milo’s entire body bloomed like the sun, emitting light and heat. A round wheel of fire slowly appeared in his hand. It was really like a sun. The moment it appeared, even a big tree more than ten meters away from the two of them started to burn.

“Do it!”

The two of them looked at each other, and then they charged straight at Eli.

The two accumulated attacks came at the same time like thunder.

The two half-step celestial warlocks did not hold back at all!

For a moment, the sky turned into two colors, one purple and the other red. This was the joint attack of two half-step celestial warlocks.

“Go to hell!”

Hall laughed coldly.

Such an attack, let alone a late stage, even an ordinary peak late stage, would find it difficult to block.

No matter who Herman was, he had to die today!

However, to his surprise, Herman didn’t seem to be flustered at all. He raised his hand unhurriedly, and a black color started to appear in his hand.

It was like a black hole, exuding a terrifying power.

At first, the two of them felt something, but as they got closer and closer, their bloodlines seemed to accelerate at the same time. It was their bloodlines wailing and feeling fear.

The black light gathered.

This was the shadow dragon’s most powerful attack, and the shadow dragon’s breath burst out again.

The black light flew out, and a black light pillar flew toward the two of them.

In the shadows and black light, the poison and flames swayed like duckweeds in the wind and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“How is this possible?”

“So strong!”

The two of them were dumbfounded. They wanted to escape, but the black light had already arrived.

The two of them only managed to hold on for a few seconds in the huge shadow of the black light before disappearing into thin air.

The black light did not stop after it had destroyed the two of them. It continued forward and smashed into a mountain. By the time the black light dissipated, the upper half of the mountain had already disappeared without a trace, leaving only a smooth track.

One strike.

He had killed two half-step celestial warlocks and flattened a mountain peak.

“Why force me to make such a big commotion?” Looking at this scene, Eli shook his head.

If they had met him 30 years ago, they might have had a chance.

But unfortunately, 30 years had already passed.
