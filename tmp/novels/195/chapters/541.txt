542 Finishing off the Warlock Alliance

“Eli!”

The patriarch of the Press Family looked at the person who came out in front of him, and there was only shock in his eyes. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Why was he here?

Upon hearing the name, the others quickly connected the name to the appearance of the person in front of them. Their expressions changed drastically, and they tightened their grip on their weapons.

“Eli? Why are you here?” Saladin looked at Eli with a serious expression.

“Naturally, I walked in!” Eli looked at everyone, then at the mountains of mechanical creations and monsters in the distance. He sighed and said, “I still have to thank you for helping me clean up so much trouble. Otherwise, it would be a little troublesome for me!”

Hiss!

Everyone’s expression changed again when they heard what Eli said.

“Did you follow us?”

Saladin’s face was ashen as he gritted his teeth. However, he was deeply puzzled!

They had clearly seen the spatial rift close. How could Eli have followed them in? Could it be that he had already prepared in advance? Did someone in the family tell him in advance? There was a traitor in the family!

His brows furrowed as he looked at the Warlocks around him.

Obviously, he was not the only one. The others also thought of this, and their expressions became strange.

In the end, Patriarch Press broke the silence and said to everyone, “We’ll talk about our internal matters later, but we have to deal with this problem of Eli first. Otherwise, if this matter is leaked today, I’m afraid we’ll really be destroyed!”

“You’re right. Let’s kill Eli first.”

“That’s reasonable!”

Everyone agreed. Even if there were really a traitor, that would be a matter for the future.

Saladin stood up, and his aura gradually burst out. Layers of golden flames burned in the surroundings, and pairs of wings appeared behind him.

He chose to transform into a half-bloodline because of the suppression here.

“Eli, you are very strong, but we have seventeen Thousand Leaves Warlocks here, and seven or eight of them are peak Thousand Leaves Warlocks. You will die here today!” He looked at Eli with killing intent.

He was not the only one. The other sixteen Warlocks also looked at Eli and activated their bloodlines.

Compared to the previous ten-man team, the seventeen-man team, this time, was basically made up of Thousand Leaves. If it were the previous Eli, he would definitely turn around and leave. However, things were different now. He was already a thousand flowers mage.

Thinking of this, he raised his head, and his black eyes gradually turned into pure gold.

Scales covered its body, and a dragon’s tail slowly extended from its tailbone. Its shadow covered its entire body like ink, emitting a devouring power.

Shadow Dragon Bloodline!

He looked at the other side, and the other side was also looking at him.

Saladin looked at the warlocks around him and then at Eli, who was standing opposite him. He could not help but feel a surge of confidence. He had never faced Eli before, so he only felt that his aura was normal.

Not far away, Patriarch Press’s heart was pounding.

Too many people had lost miserably to Eli. He was a little afraid when he saw this person!

If it were a one-on-one battle, he definitely wouldn’t have the courage. Fortunately, the remaining high-end combat forces of the Alliance were here today. Even if it was Eli, there was no way he could escape!

“You will die here!” He looked at Eli with hatred.

If not for him, they would not have fallen to this state.

“Let’s attack together and kill Eli directly. Don’t cause any more trouble!”

Saladin opened his mouth again. The flames in his hand condensed into a huge sword, and he pointed it at Eli.

“Good!”

The others nodded and silently spread out a little. Following that, the laws on everyone’s body began to appear. Some gathered strength, some took out weapons, and some tensed their bodies. Patriarch Press did the same.

They looked at Eli, waiting for the final order.

During this time, Eli didn’t move, but he had already activated the secret technique of Explosive Blood. The tree of laws in his body swayed, and countless leaves of laws rippled. The flower of laws was also ready.

Just like that, the two sides faced off for a full three minutes.

Three minutes later!

Saladin suddenly moved his feet and flew towards Eli. The flames emitted by the flaming longsword in his hand burned a hole in the space!

“Attack!”

As if it was a signal, the remaining 16 Warlocks instantly attacked as well. Each of them had a ferocious killing intent on their faces as they charged toward Eli.

Seventeen attacks!

They formed an umbrella and attacked Eli from every direction.

Moreover, each attack was their strongest technique. Although they did not use their bloodline avatars, the power that erupted from them was enough to burn mountains and boil seas, shocking everyone.

This joint attack was much more powerful than the previous attack on Eli.

“Go to hell, Eli.”

Saladin’s eyes were filled with passion, and there was only Eli in his eyes.

“Why isn’t Eli moving?” However, Press, who was among these people, looked at Eli, who was still not making a move. He felt a little lost and had a bad feeling.

However, the confusion was instantly replaced by firmness.

With such a powerful attack, what could Eli do?

The closer he got, the more confident he became. Not only him but everyone around him did not look confused at all. They were all determined.

Weng!

Suddenly, a wave of energy entered everyone’s senses.

What was that?

Everyone looked at the center. At this moment, Eli raised his head, his face calm.

Calm?

Why was he so calm?

But in the next second, he saw Eli slowly stretch out his hand!

Two blood-colored flowers slowly appeared.

One of the flowers was white, and the other was black. It was as if light and darkness were intertwined, but the aura it emitted was enough to shock them because it was the power of laws that was extremely dense.

“Thousand Flowers!” Therefore, this word flashed across everyone’s mind!

Fear flashed across Press’s eyes. He knew that the ominous premonition had come true!

But this time, he did not have time to think too much, because he was already at close to his target.

In the next second!

They only saw two flowers of laws flying towards them and then exploding, colliding with them. In just an instant, everyone was drowned in the laws.

The flames were extinguished, the body sank, and the storm gradually fell. Everything was drowned in the shadows, and finally, it died in endless time.

When everything dispersed, there were seventeen people lying neatly on the ground in front of him. Shadows entangled them tightly on the ground. Their consciousness had long fallen!

Seventeen Thousand Leaves were defeated so easily.

However, they did not die.

“There’s a great use for them!” Eli reached out and dragged them into the darkness.

“Sir is really getting stronger and stronger!” In the distance, Dylan ran over quickly.

He had been hiding in the back.

However, he looked at the current Eli and felt a heartfelt shock.

Even though he was once a student of an eight-circle sorcerer, even though he was born in that glorious Great Era, he had never heard of a person like Eli.

This was a true Heaven’s Favorite!

Facing Dylan’s flattery, Eli did not care. He just raised his head and looked at the Silver Mage Tower not far away.

“Let’s go!”

Eli took out the key and strode towards the tower.

Dylan took a look and quickly followed.
