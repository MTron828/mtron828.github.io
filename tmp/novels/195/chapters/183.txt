184 The Tilted Tower

After the meeting ended, the White Tower’s various parties quickly took action again.

As the higher-ups of the Blood Alliance were actually acting in secret, the people below did not even know what was going on, so when the White Tower warlocks arrived, they were dumbfounded. But when they wanted to resist, they found that the higher-ups were not there at all.

Therefore, after a simple resistance, the White Tower quickly took over the forces belonging to the blood alliance.

A large amount of loot was transported to the White Tower overnight to the White Tower’s warehouse. Eli would also stroll around these places every day, picking out some good stuff.

However, the result was a little disappointing for Eli. Other than some materials, he didn’t get much good stuff. But after a few days, Eli received good news from Kratos.

“What? you’re saying that the Blood Alliance has a tilted tower that can temper one’s will?!” Eli asked curiously.

“Yes,” Kratos nodded and said, “It seems to be a strange mage tower that the blood Alliance obtained in a mage’s Secret realm. After entering it, one can train their will or mind power. It is of no use to warlocks. Are you interested? ”

“Yes, I’m a little interested. Please bring it back for me.” Eli nodded. He had been hesitating about how to train his mental strength a few days ago, and now there was good news.

“Alright,” Kratos nodded. They might be tempted if it was a tower to train their bloodline, but a tower to train their mental power was of little value.

..

A day later.

Eli saw the wizard Tower.

In the open space outside the White Tower, a slanted tower stood.

It was about eight or nine meters tall and made of black Bloodsoul stone. This was an ore used to nourish one’s mental power. There were a few small pieces, but it was actually made into such a tall tower.

And what was strange was that this one wasn’t standing upright but slanted at an angle of about 60 degrees, which didn’t look ordinary.

“Let me see how one can train one’s mental power here.” Eli glanced at the Mage tower, then walked in.

Bang!

As if passing through a thin film, Eli walked into the Tower.

“Eh, it looks normal!”

What came into view was an ordinary tower. Only the stairs leading to the higher place were strange. They were red, and they spiraled from the bottom to the top.

Was it the stairs? Confused, Eli walked up.

In an instant, Eli felt the difference. As soon as he stepped onto the stairs, he felt as if his mental power was being suppressed, and under this pressure, his mental power actually began to condense at a slow speed.

“This …”

Feeling the immense pressure, Eli seemed to have understood the method to train his mental strength.

It was to forcefully train one’s mental strength through external pressure. The principle was the same as using gravity to train one’s physique, and this special characteristic should come from the Mage tower itself.

“This is amazing.” Eli went up the stairs again.

Bang!

The pressure increased again, and Eli felt that his mental power had also increased a little.

Eli stopped hesitating and quickly climbed up. As he climbed, the pressure on his mental power became stronger and stronger, and he was gradually unable to withstand it.

“A quarter to the second floor!” Eli looked up. He was about a meter away from the second floor, but it was a distance he could not cross.

Compared to the beginning, the mental pressure was at least three to four times greater now. Under such pressure, even movement was difficult for Eli, and this was also his limit.

“I can’t even reach the second floor?”

Eli gasped. This tower had three floors. It seemed that to reach the third floor. One would have to be at least at the limit of the second circle. This should be a tool used by the second circle mages to train their mental strength.

After training for a while more, Eli left the Tower.

“How is it? not bad, right?” At some point, Kratos arrived.

“Not bad.” Eli nodded.

“Uh, haha, for warlocks, this mage Tower is too difficult, unless they have a spirit bloodline. It is said that those from the Blood Alliance who have a spirit bloodline reached the second floor and obtained a second circle spirit power mage tool. Unfortunately, no one has reached the third floor yet, so no one else knows what’s there.” Kratos sighed.

“There’s something else inside?” Eli looked at the slanted tower.

“Yes.” Kratos nodded and glanced at Eli. “there should be. It looks like you like it a lot!”

“Yes.” Eli nodded. This tilted tower was indeed a good thing for a mage.

“Since you like it, you can take this mage Tower. Do you need us to deliver it to you?”

“It’s okay. I can do it.” Eli nodded. With a flick of the secret realm ring on his finger, the huge Magus tower was instantly absorbed into the secret realm.

“A spatial Mage tool?” Kratos’ eyes widened.

A spatial mage tool was one of the rarest wizard tools, and to be able to store such a large Wizard Tower, it must be a huge spatial mage tool. It seemed that Herman was really mysterious!

“Yes.” Eli nodded. Nick had turned his arcane realm into a spatial mage tool, and it was much better than ordinary mage tools in terms of size and other aspects.

This was very normal. Even some high-level Magi would use small worlds as storage tools. Secret planes were not worth mentioning.

“Mm, there are still many things in the White Tower. I’ll take my leave first.”

“Alright,” he said.

Eli nodded, and the two of them quickly left.

..

Three days later.

In the Tower.

Eli looked at the sky through the window. It had been almost five days, and Simon should have left the White Tower’s vicinity.

Taking out a few items, Eli began his long-awaited curse. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

...

“A darkness that is deeper than darkness, a strangeness that is more violent than poison … Today, I, Eli Lucifer, will use 500 years of my life as the price to curse Simon Pobran. I want him …”

In the blink of an eye, 500 years of his life had been consumed. This was not his limit, and he would take it as a test.

..

At this moment, on a distant mountain range.

In the sky, a venom Wyvern was flying, and Simon was sitting on it.

“my Lord, this mission has failed. The new force called the White Tower actually defeated the blood Alliance. The leader is a two-circle Warlock who seems to have a dragon-like bloodline. He is very strong. I tried to win him over but failed.” Simon carefully phrased his words and sent the message to the organization.

“sigh, I actually failed.” Simon shook his head in disbelief.

This sneak attack should have been very stable, but it failed just like that. It was truly difficult to accept.

However, it didn’t matter. It was just a small force in the South.

Simon pulled himself together and regained his will. He looked at the sky in front of him.

“F*ck! Elemental storm!”

...

But in the next second, Simon was stunned. In the sky before him, a huge elemental storm was brewing, and its range almost covered more than ten kilometers.

“I can’t be that unlucky, right?” Simon’s mouth fell open.

The elemental storm was a very rare natural movement. It was very powerful. Once caught in it, an ordinary first-circle warlock would have no chance to escape, and the second-circle warlock would also be in great danger.

What made Simon dumbfounded was that this elemental storm had come too suddenly, and he did not even have time to react. Moreover, he was almost in the center of the storm, so there was no hope of escaping in advance.

“Damn it! Venom Wyvern, descend! Sh*t!” Simon cursed. The venom Wyvern’s eyes also revealed a look of fear. It roared and quickly descended to the ground.

But it was too late. The elemental storm had already arrived.

“Damn!” A trace of panic flashed in Simon’s eyes, and he quickly transformed into his bloodline.

In the next second, the man and Dragon were directly swept into the storm.

..

Three days later.

“Bah!”

Simon crawled out of a pile of dirt on an empty piece of land. He had many injuries on his body. As for the venom Wyvern, there was no trace of it, as it had been torn to pieces by the storm.

“Unlucky!” Simon gasped and looked around. He believed that he was in an unfamiliar mountain range.

“Where is this place?” Simon was already a little dumbfounded.

After resting for three days, he continued his journey.

“I hope everything will go smoothly.”

Simon set off again with a slight injury.
