182 Counterattack

Bang!

It was as if two energy masses had collided, and Eli instantly crashed into Pabulo.

Huge versus small.

However, to everyone’s surprise, three seconds later, a huge figure flew out.

Pabulo!

Pabulo flew out, but Eli remained in the same spot.

He had been sent flying!

This was the bloodline of the mountain Giant, and strength was their forte. Yet, he was actually sent flying by Eli.

All the White Tower warlocks looked at Eli in shock. No one had expected that the Leader of logistics would have such terrifying and outrageous strength.

He was so strong, but he had been working in the logistics department for more than a hundred years. This was too f * cking ridiculous.

This was the first time they had seen Eli in battle, and it was also their first time knowing that he was actually so powerful.

At this moment, the warlocks from Blood Alliance were all looking at Eli in shock. Their impression of this Warlock was that his virus had caused their failure back then, so they thought that he was just a fellow who studied minor arts. They never thought that he would actually be this strong.

Meanwhile, in the corner, the peak second circle Warlock from before was looking at Eli curiously. ‘This bloodline seemed interesting. It seemed like this White Tower was not as simple as it seemed.’

However, he had no intention of making a move. He only watched quietly. He had not participated in the previous battle.

On the other side, Pabulo flew through the crowd and crashed into a building. The building instantly collapsed and buried him, sending smoke and dust into the air.

“PAH!”

The ruins began to move, and Pabulo slowly crawled out, spitting out the rock that had accidentally entered his mouth. Then, he saw the cracks on the rock outside his body, and his brows twitched as he looked at Eli again.

“Your bloodline power is strong, but that’s not enough to break through my defense. The mountain giant’s defense is one of the best in the third circle.” Pabulo walked out of the ruins, and more rocks attached themselves to him. “Although my strength is inferior to yours, you definitely can’t break through my defense. With such a strong defense, can you still kill me?”

Pabulo’s expression also became serious, but his style remained the same.

Seeing that Pabulo was fine, the blood alliance Warlock also relaxed. In their opinion, Pabulo’s defense was ridiculously strong. There was no way that Eli could break through Pabulo’s defense.

On the other hand, Eli was a little speechless. ‘This man likes to talk too much.’

Glancing at Pabulo, Eli took a deep breath.

The power of his bloodline was activated to the extreme, and pressure from his bloodline was released. He looked around and saw that it was already nighttime, which was when the shadow dragon was at its strongest.

A large number of shadows rushed towards Eli, and countless shadows gathered in his hand. At the same time, Eli’s huge mental power also gathered in his hand. This was the second special trait of his bloodline talent. It could fuse with other powers.

This was Eli’s most powerful fusion attack, and it instantly shot toward Pabulo.

“That won’t be able to break my defense,” Pabulo revealed a sinister smile as he activated the power of his bloodline.

In the next second, the small ball formed by the shadows attacked.

However, what surprised Pabulo wasn’t the power of shadow but that there seemed to be another power within it. It was silent, but it instantly exploded, making Pabulo feel as if his brain was being stirred, and his consciousness became a little blurry.

It was a mental attack!

The mountain Giant had a huge amount of power, but its spirit was very weak. However, due to the scarcity of Mages, he had never encountered a powerful mental attack.

At this moment, his control over his bloodline power was instantly thrown into chaos.

“No!”

At this moment, the rock defense on his body was instantly released. To his shock, the shadow Ball had also exploded. In less than a second, endless shadows instantly drowned him.

Three seconds later, the shadow disappeared.

Pabulo’s corpse appeared on the ground.

There was silence. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The originally noisy battlefield instantly fell silent.

No one thought that the battle would end in an instant. Whether it was White Tower or blood Alliance, they were all a little dumbfounded.

“I …”

Kratos didn’t know what to say when he saw this scene!

He looked at Eli with a complicated expression.

This guy was too f * cking strong. He was even stronger than him. Looking at his strength, he was definitely one of the strongest among the two-circle warlocks. How could he not be confused?

After all, who wouldn’t be dumbfounded if a subordinate of a hundred years suddenly burst out with strength stronger than you at the critical moment of life and death?

“Is this Lord Herman?” he asked.

The other white Tower warlocks also understood with a hint of shock. They looked at Eli. For a long time, they couldn’t believe what they saw.

Killed in seconds?

The victim was Pabulo, who was at the limit of the second circle!

“I knew it.” Rawls ‘mouth twitched. He knew that Eli was strong, but he didn’t expect him to be this strong.

Seeing Eli acting cool was worse than dying for Rawls.

“This is Herman, the one who taught me gambling skills.” Evena didn’t say anything. She suddenly understood why Eli had always been so calm.

Because he had the ability to face danger, he naturally did not panic.

..

“How is that possible?”

On the other side, the blood alliance warlocks were also dumbfounded.

...

They didn’t know what to say.

“Lord Pablo actually died, just like that?”

“The White Tower is actually hiding such a powerful combat force?!”

“That’s impossible!”

The remaining nine second-circle warlocks looked at each other, not knowing what to say.

This reversal was too fast.

..

After killing pabulo, Eli walked to the White Tower.

The people on the outside made way, and Eli walked to the center.

“Herman, you …” The others had complicated expressions on their faces.

“don’t think too much. Today, we can’t let a single person from the Blood Alliance off,” said Eli directly.

...

“But we’ve used up too much energy,” Kratos said resentfully.

However, the next second, a dozen bottles of potions were thrown over.

“What is this?” Kratos was puzzled.

“Bloodline potion. They can recover your bloodline power.” Eli said casually.

“Bloodline potion. Isn’t this the potion you developed before? I don’t think it’s useful to us.” This was one of the potions that Eli had modified, so Kratos was puzzled.

However, he still consumed it immediately. He instantly felt that his bloodline power had recovered by more than a quarter. This was completely different from the previous potion.

“The previous one was an emasculated version,” Eli explained casually.

The others were speechless.

The bloodline potion was one of the signature potions of the White Tower, but today they found out that it was an abridged version.

Soon, Kratos distributed the potions to everyone, and their combat power began to recover. Then, everyone looked at Eli and Kratos, waiting for orders, while Kratos looked at Eli.

“Why are you looking at me? you’re the chairman!” Eli asked, baffled.

“Oh, right. Haha, I forgot.” Kratos touched his head in embarrassment.

It was mainly because Eli’s sudden change was too great, and he didn’t know how to face it. Now, it seemed like the change wasn’t that great, and he was still the same Herman.

“Then what are we going to do next?” Kratos then stuck his head out and asked with a sneer.

Eli was speechless.

“Kill them.” Eli glanced at Kratos speechlessly.

“Mm, then let’s kill them.” Kratos nodded and stopped moving. He then shouted to the Warlock behind him, “Kill the blood alliance Warlock, leave no one alive.”

The battle began again.

This time, after killing three or four second-circle warlocks, Eli took a break and watched Kratos go on a killing spree. However, it was only for a short while before his eyes shifted to the warlock in the corner.

This black-robed 2nd-circle Ultimate Warlock had yet to make a move.

In fact, he had noticed this Warlock when he had just arrived. This Warlock was very strange. He had been standing in the corner silently and did not do anything. He just watched.

On the other side, under Kratos’ lead, the other three or four warlocks were quickly killed. Kratos walked toward Eli while the other warlocks surrounded and killed the other blood alliance warlocks.

The barrier that had once prevented White Tower from escaping had now become their greatest obstacle.

..

On the other side.

“Who are you?” Eli looked at the black-robed Warlock and asked.

“I’m not from blood alliance. I just came to take a look, but they don’t seem to be very useful.” The black-robed Warlock took off his hood. It was a middle-aged man. “but I seem to have discovered something with even greater potential.

“Hello, I’m black Isotta second circle warlock Simon Pobran. You can call me Simon.”

Black Isotta?

Eli frowned. Which faction is this?
