461 The Attention of the Western Regions

The Amina Family!

Thank you readers!

Green Field Border!

Selona was hiding in a cave far away from the city, looking up at the city wall not far away!

At this moment, the city wall was almost completely empty. There was no one guarding it. All the Warlocks had to evacuate urgently!

“The Colossal Dragon clan is an overlord-level faction in the green fields. Their combat strength is powerful, and they are on a completely different level from the outer region and even the inner region.” Selona lowered his head and muttered the information about this race. The more he thought about it, the more shocked he became. He was even more shocked that the dragon race would travel thousands of miles south.

As he pondered, he seemed to have sensed something and looked further away.

Suddenly, a dark cloud that covered the earth flew over from afar… No, it was not a dark cloud but hundreds of giant dragons.

” About 500 of them, each of them at least third circle, with a body size of 50 to 60 meters. There are even more celestial, all of which are hundreds of meters in size. I’m afraid there are more than 100 of them. Among them, there are probably 20 to 30 of them at the Radiant Sun level, and there are nearly 10 of them at the peak of the Radiant Sun level. Of course, there’s also that 1,000-meter dragon at the front. I think it’s even stronger!”

The more Salona looked, the more shocked he became. He even found it difficult to breathe.

Too many…Too strong…Even first-class forces wouldn’t dare to take this number lightly, let alone second-class forces.

The dragon roared as it arrived. It did not destroy the city but flew past it without a care!

Meanwhile, Selona lowered his head because he realized that he had been too reckless this time. He even vaguely saw that the dragon in the lead seemed to have glanced at him, which made his back wet. However, the dragon did not seem to care about him and continued flying forward.

A few seconds later, seeing the dragons leave, Selona leaned against the wall behind him!

“Sir Eli!”

Although they had survived the disaster, they were more worried about the future of the Amina family.

In this direction, the dragon race’s goal was probably the Bloodline Tower.

“Can Milord really defeat these giant beasts?”

Selona felt that the road ahead was a blur!

…..

“Milord, there was a human celestial hiding there just now. Shouldn’t we kill him?”

In the sky, Blue Dragon Sais asked Dragon King Giovanni curiously.

Giovanni turned to look at him and said, “Don’t cause trouble. Our goal this time is to save Ortiz and show our deterrence. There’s no need to cause trouble. After all, even if the mages left, there would still be some powerful Warlocks.

“Yes, sir!” Sayis nodded!

In fact, they were thinking too much. When the powerful dragon race flew across the sky, no faction in the Western Regions would dare to stop them.

Even the second-class forces had their heads tucked under their pants, allowing the giant dragon to trample on their dignity!

However, they soon discovered to their delight, that as long as they did not block the way, these dragons would not attack. This was exemplified by a level 2 faction that had accidentally blocked the dragon’s way. As expected, the faction was instantly ravaged by the dragons, and in the blink of an eye, the faction that had blocked the way was reduced to nothingness.

As time passed.

All the factions also discovered a problem. Although these dragons would occasionally stop, their direction was very clear.

That was the Bloodline Tower!

This discovery shocked the entire Western Region, and it also gave rise to many ideas in all the factions!

…..

Holy Tower!

Pagoda Master Sacred Sword listened to the information his subordinate told him, and his expression became more and more serious!

“How could the Bloodline Tower offend the dragons in the green fields? These foreign races have never come out of the outside world. What is the reason?” Holy Sword frowned, feeling extremely troubled!

The enemy this time was too powerful, and their opponent was the Bloodline Tower.

This meant that one of the two sides would suffer heavy losses, or the other would be destroyed.

It would be fine if the Dragons retreated, but once the Bloodline Tower was destroyed, it would be a heavy blow to the Western Regions. As the economic center of the Western Regions, it was no joke. Once it was destroyed, countless forces would be affected!

And there was another important reason, which was that Eli had saved them before.

“Pass on my order, immediately set off to provide support. We still need to make it at this distance! ” Holy Sword stood up and said with a serious gaze!

“Yes, sir!”

…

At the same time.

The other two forces in the eastern part of the Western Region, the Twilight Lizard Family, and the Sea Demon Family, also caused a huge commotion!

Twilight Lizard Family.

The head of the family, Qigu Mark, frowned and said to his subordinates, “The distance is too far. We won’t support them. I don’t think the Bloodline Tower will win!

“The dragon race is too strong. They even have a half-step fifth-circle dragon. If my guess is correct, then the Bloodline Tower will be finished. Helping a hopeless family will only consume our benefits.”

“Yes, sir!”

The subordinate nodded and left!

The Siren Clan.

Vicky Hayley also frowned and couldn’t help but sigh. She was thinking about whether she should support them or not!

“Sir, the Twilight Lizard Family has no intention of supporting the bloodline tower at all. They seem to have pulled back their forces.” a Warlock reported.

“What?” Vicky frowned but did not respond!

Ever since the last time, the Bloodline Tower had established connections with a few other forces. A large number of rare goods had also allowed their forces to obtain a certain level of improvement. It could be said that they were all people who had obtained huge benefits. However, the Twilight Lizard’s decision at this time was no different from betrayal!

Should they make the same choice?

After all, the opponent was indeed powerful.

After thinking for more than ten minutes, Vicky finally sighed and waved her hand. “Get ready for backup.

“The lord saved us before, so we can’t abandon the lord in a time of crisis!”

“Yes!”

The Warlocks from both sides quickly gathered and left their respective areas. The patriarch of the Twilight Lizard Family only smiled contemptuously when he heard this.

He was not optimistic about the future of the Bloodline Tower!

Go ahead…In any case, if a few forces were damaged, he would be the only winner!

…

The Heart of the Abyss!

Although the Green Field was too far away from here, the news still spread faster than the dragons’ movement.

“Sir, this is what happened!” Tuman smiled at Nero.

” Good, good, good. A 1,000-meter giant dragon. Its strength is probably already half-step fifth circle or infinitely close. Eli is definitely no match for it. This damn guy is finally going to die.” Nero smiled happily, not hiding his hatred for Eli!

Recently, they had investigated and found that almost every plan that had been destroyed or obstructed had something to do with the Bloodline Tower. Although they couldn’t be sure, they were definitely related to them. If it was true, it meant that it was definitely under the instructions of Eli!

Seeing Nero’s smile, Tuman also smiled happily and said, “If the Bloodline Tower is destroyed, then we can continue with our plan. Because of them, we have been delayed for decades!”

“Okay, let’s wait for the good news.”

Nero nodded.

Tuman also responded with a few words and then left. However, this time, he did not hear the sound of things being smashed behind him. Instead, he heard loud laughter!

He was very happy!

….

As the dragon flew, countless forces gathered at the Bloodline Tower. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At this moment, the Bloodline Tower was like a lone wolf targeted by a tiger. The others were animals observing the surroundings. There were bats that wanted to drink blood, vultures that wanted to eat meat, and even former clansmen who wanted to help…

Everyone was waiting.

At this time, the dragon race that had crossed thousands of mountains finally arrived at its destination, the Bloodline Tower!
