Chapter 31: Escape

Translator: Lonelytree

Soon, Evans came to another table.

These were Byrne cards, similar to the poker cards in his previous life, but there was a huge difference in both the number of cards and the way to play them. However, they were still cards, and there was not much difference in essence.

Just like before, upon his arrival, he was immediately sent to the center of the gambling table.

It was different from the previous one-on-one games. This game was a group game.

“Sir, let me introduce you to the rules!” As usual, Evans greeted the waiter directly.

What he meant was to play to your death.

During this process, Eli looked at the gambling table with interest, just like before.

‘Hmph, you’ll be crying soon!’ Evans thought viciously.

The game soon began.

In the first round, Eli won a silver Tarl.

Evans gave the waiter a confused look, but the waiter told him that he was just lucky.

In the second round, Eli lost ten silver tars.

Evans let out a sigh of relief and looked at him as if he could already see the scene of him crying out an hour later.

However, when the third round began, the situation changed.

In the third round, Eli won one gold Tarl.

In the fourth round, Eli won fifty silver tars.

In the fifth round, Eli won ten silver tars.

...

Ten minutes passed, and Eli didn’t lose a single round, as if the loss just now was just an accident.

‘How is this possible?’ Evans was already sweating. He had a feeling that something was not right.

He looked at the waiter, who also looked like he had seen a ghost.

They could use special methods to know what the cards were. However, the man in front of them seemed to not only know the cards but also seemed to be able to calculate what everyone was going to play and win step by step.

But how could that be possible?

Could someone really calculate all these in such a short time?

Was he still human?

Even the best gambling master in the casino couldn’t do it.

The waiter took a deep breath and then opened the cards again.

This time, the bet was bigger, and Eli won two gold Tarls from the dealer.

“I win again, haha.” Eli laughed loudly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As Eli won more and more, some of the others also started to gamble with him. They also won some money and looked happy.

At this time, the waiter was a little afraid to show his cards.

“Show me your cards!” Eli said as he looked and tried.

“Alright!”

The attendant played his card again.

Eli won another fifty silver tars.

“Show me your cards!” Eli said as usual.

The waiter was already a little unsteady on his feet. He looked at Eli like a hungry wolf opening its ferocious mouth, about to take a big bite.

“We’re finished!” Evans’ forehead was already covered in sweat.

In a short ten minutes, Eli had already won more than a dozen gold tarls.

This was completely beyond his imagination.

This also completely overturned his previous thoughts. ‘How was this a fat sheep? this was clearly a terrifying giant wolf!’

He knew that he could not go on like this. He raised his head and gestured to the attendant to continue, then said to Elie, ” Sir, you can play first. I’m going to the bathroom.”

“Go, go, go!” At this moment, Eli seemed to be having a good time as he casually dispersed him.

Evans immediately walked out of the crowd, but he didn’t go to the bathroom, but to the back of the casino.

On the other hand, Eli was shouting loudly as usual, with a faint smile at the corner of his eyes.

‘I know where all the cards are and even what your next move will be. Can you beat me?’

...

Evans knocked on a door.

“Come in!” A rough voice sounded.

Evans opened the door and walked in. In front of him was a large room, which was filled with smoke. A man with a scar on his face was holding a naked woman and touching her up and down.

He seemed to be a little unhappy when he saw Evans, but he also stopped. He knew that something must have happened, or he wouldn’t have come here.

“What happened?” The man asked as he leaned on the sofa.

“Boss, it’s like this...!” Evans quickly told him about what happened with Eli.

“How much did he win?” The scar-faced man asked directly.

“It’s already twenty gold tarls.” Evans gave a specific number.

“What?” When the man heard the number, he pushed the woman aside and widened his eyes. He didn’t expect that much.

Although the casino was huge, it was possible that their daily profit was only a dozen gold tarls, and that included other expenses. In other words, if Eli had taken it away, they would have worked for nothing for many days.

And what was even more terrifying was that Eli was still playing.

“Send someone to keep an eye on him first. Isn’t he still in the carriage? You guys keep a close eye on that carriage.” The scar-faced man said sternly. He then called two more people in and said, “Dave and Jones, you guys are Knights. You should know what to do when he gets out.

The two men who were called in were strong and muscular. They both nodded. In a while, they would be ” vagrants ” who had accidentally stolen Eli’s money.

“You go back first and stabilize him.” The man said to Evans.

“Alright!” Evans nodded.

By the time Evans returned to the table, there was already a pile of gold and silver tarls in front of Eli. Judging from the discussions around him, it had only been a few minutes, but he had won another dozen gold tarls.

At this moment, the waiter was almost unable to stand steadily. He looked at Eli as if he had seen the devil.

Seeing that Evans was back, she felt a little relieved, but her arms were still shaking.

As expected, Eli won again.

At this moment, a group of people had already gathered around Eli. They looked at Eli with a fanatical gaze. They had already earned quite a bit by following Eli’s lead every time.

Hence, this meant that the casino suffered a huge loss.

“I’m going to the toilet!”

This time, Eli didn’t ask for the cards to be revealed as usual but stood up instead.

He put away some of the gold tarls and asked Evans, “Where’s the toilet?”

Confused, Evans pointed to the direction of the casino, and then Eli swaggered to the casino’s toilet.

Evans was not sure if he really needed to go to the bathroom. Although there were windows in the bathroom, they were all tied up with iron bars. It was impossible for ordinary people to break the window and escape. Even an intermediate Knight could not remove the iron bar without making any noise.

In addition, Eli still had seven or eight gold tars worth of chips on the table.

So, Evans followed him and waited outside the toilet.

Ten minutes passed.

Eli still didn’t come out.

“Something’s wrong!” Evans felt that something was wrong.

He immediately called for his men and rushed into the toilet.

However, when they entered, they only saw that the window, which was originally sealed by the iron rod and iron sheet, had a large hole in it. The iron rod was bent.

As for Eli, he had already disappeared without a trace.

“We’re done for!” Evans’ body went limp and fell to the ground. Then he shouted to his back, “Quickly chase!!”
