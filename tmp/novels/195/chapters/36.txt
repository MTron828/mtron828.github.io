Chapter 37: Alex in Despair

Translator: Lonelytree

After the Count entered the carriage, the coachman whipped the horse, and the carriage began to move.

Soon, the carriage entered the city. When the citizens saw that it was the Count’s carriage, they all made way for it. The carriage did not slow down and quickly headed toward the destination.

In the carriage, count Gimori sat in the main seat, with two physicians sitting on either side. It was very quiet in the carriage, and no one made a sound. Suddenly, the count coughed, then looked to the side and asked, “doctors, do you think a potion can cure the Marquis ‘poison? ”

The two physicians were both in their forties, but they did not have much hair. One of them was stunned when he heard the Count’s question, but he still answered, “That’s not possible!”

“We don’t know what kind of poison the Marquis is suffering from, but it should be a mixed poison. It’s not possible to cure him with a bottle of medicine.”

“Indeed. If it were that simple, the Marquis would not still be in a coma.” The other person nodded in agreement.

“I see!” The count nodded and did not say anything.

He reached his right hand into his clothes and could still feel the hard and cold touch of the potion bottle.

...

Jun Lin city was not big, but it was not small either.

The Alina family’s territory was to the West of Junlin, several kilometers away.

In just 20 minutes, the carriage had passed through the city, left the city, and arrived at its destination.

When they arrived at their destination, count Gimori alighted from the carriage. A middle-aged man in Black clothes came up to him and saluted, “Long time no see, my Lord.”

He looked at the count and the two doctors behind him. He had an expression of understanding and said, ” “My Lord, are you also here to help the Marquis?”

“Also?”

Count Gimori asked.

Were there that many people?

Very quickly, he knew that his guess was correct.

The man didn’t say anything. He led count Gimori into the room. Soon, they arrived at a large living room.

The living room was already packed with people.

Count Gimori roughly estimated that there were dozens of them.

There were barons and Viscounts everywhere, and there were even a few counts. Of course, there were all kinds of doctors. Some of them were brought by nobles, while the others were from the Empire’s mystic academy.

The nobles stood on one side, while the mystics were on the other side, led by a woman in a white robe. Count Gimori knew this woman. She was the woman who had asked him for investment with scholar Clement last time. The elegant student was also following behind her.

“How’s the situation?” After bringing the count here, the Butler left. Count Gimori walked over and saw a familiar Viscount.

“Your Excellency!” The Viscount said respectfully when he saw him. He then began to explain the current situation.

“Ever since the Marquis had been poisoned and fell into a coma, the Marquis ‘family had first asked their own doctors to help, but it was to no avail. Thus, they asked the mystics for help and successfully stabilized the Marquis’ condition.

“However, that was all. They wanted to detoxify the poison, but they had no way to do so.

“But yesterday, the Marquis’s situation had suddenly taken a turn for the worse, so many self-proclaimed nobles had come. Alina’s family had not stopped them, as they had also hoped to gather everyone’s strength to save the Marquis.”

“Oh, isn’t this count Gimori?”

Count Gimori was listening to The Viscount’s report when a voice suddenly rang out.

He turned his head and saw a man in a gorgeous black suit walking toward him. Behind him was an old man with a white beard.

“Count Monchi!” Count Gimori frowned.

Count Monchi and he were both subordinates of the Marquis, but they didn’t get along. They both wanted to win the support of the Marquis, but they were evenly matched.

“It seems like you’re here to help too.” Count Monchi looked at the two people behind count Gimori and laughed.

“Hmph, that’s none of your business.” Count Gimori did not stand on ceremony and glanced at him.

“Hehe, then you’ll definitely lose this time.” Count Monchi smiled and invited the old man behind him to come out. He said, ” this is Doctor Robert. You might not have heard of his name, but he was once the chief doctor in the palace. Many doctors are his students now!

“The two doctors you brought are so young. They might not be able to do anything!”

The man was showing off.

The corner of count Gimori’s mouth twitched. He was not in the medical business, and it had been a few days of hard work to find these two.

“Teacher!”

What happened next caught him even more off guard. As Doctor Robert walked out, the two doctors behind him actually walked out and bowed to the old man.

The two of them were actually Robert’s former students.

“Haha!” Even Count Monchi did not expect this, and he laughed out loud.

“The Marquis’s poison is very complicated. It’s not something you two can handle.” Robert was already very old, but his tone was still full of confidence.

“teacher, we were invited by count Gimori!” The two of them did not expect to meet their former teacher here, but they still stood on the Count’s side.

“Yes.” Robert nodded and did not say anything.

He had many students, and these two were just above average.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Count Gimori, it looks like you don’t stand a chance this time.” Count Monchi patted Count Gimori’s shoulder and left.

Count Gimori took a few deep breaths and told himself that he was in a Marquis’s house and could not use force.

Damn it. He was so angry that he had no way to refute it.

At the same time, the door to the living room suddenly opened, and a few doctors came out. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Count Gimori looked over. Through the door, he could see a room. There was a large bed in the room, and Marquis Alina was lying on the bed. Several of his immediate family members were around the bed.

“No!” The doctor walked to the Count and shook his head. They were brought here by the Count to help, but it seemed like they had not made any progress.

“Is there anyone else who has a way?” At this moment, someone else walked out of the door.

Alex looked at the large group of nobles and people from the mystic academy before him and sighed.

“Let us try again?” At this time, the old woman in the lead of the monastery stood up, followed by a few people.

“Alright!” Alex knew that these mystics had already been studying the illness for a few days, and he hoped that they would be of some help.

The mystics entered the room, and Alex ordered them to close the door.

The others waited.

Half an hour later.

The people from the monastery came out again with depressed looks.

“Anyone else wants to try?” Alex’s tone became even more downcast.

“I’ll do it.” Count Monchi raised his hand.

“This is the former chief doctor of the palace, Doctor Robert!” He introduced him to Alex.

“Hello, Doctor Robert!” Alex’s eyes lit up, and he invited the doctor and the Earl in before closing the door again.

An hour later.

The door opened, and Doctor Robert walked out with a frown. Monchi followed closely behind, silent. It was obvious that he had not found a way.

“it’s impossible. The poison in the Marquis’s body is a mixture of at least ten different types of poison. It has already penetrated deep into his internal organs. There’s no other way.” Robert said, shaking his head.

“Ah, even Doctor Robert can’t solve it?” Robert was a big Shot in the medical circle, and many doctors knew him.

“I can’t!” Robert didn’t deny it.

However, his words were like a bolt of lightning to the other doctors.

Robert was once the chief doctor of the palace, and if he said no, it seemed like the Marquis was beyond saving.

For a moment, the room was filled with groans.

“Anyone else wants to try?” Alex was also in despair. The person lying inside was his own father.

“Oh, right. Count Gimori, do you want to try?”

At this time, Count Monchi, who was not far away, suddenly spoke as if he wanted to vent his frustration.

“Ahem, forget it. I’ll take care of it.”

So many people had failed, and the Marquis had already been given a death warrant by Robert. Count Gimori was ready to give up.

“Let’s try!” Alex suddenly said with a mournful expression.

To him, there was still a little hope if he tried. He was like a drowning man who was unwilling to let go of the little bit of hope.

Count Gimori looked at the sorrowful Alex and thought of the potion that Eli had given him. He hesitated for a moment before agreeing, “Alright then!”

“I’ll try.”

He was already here.

After all, he wouldn’t be the only one who failed anyway.
