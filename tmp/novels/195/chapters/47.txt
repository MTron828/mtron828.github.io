Chapter 48: Warning

Three days later, Eli and scholar clement met this miss Windsor in a restaurant in the empire.

“Hello, I’m eli, Herman’s junior. This is my teacher, scholar clement. ”

In a luxurious private room, Eli extended his hand to the lady.

“Hello, I’m Windsor!” Windsor and eli shook hands gently. she was wearing a light pink dress today, matched with her long, date-red hair. Her pretty face made her look even more delicate and beautiful.

“I’m Herman’s teacher, scholar clement!” he said. Scholar Clement also nodded at Windsor. He also felt that something was wrong.

Would such a beautiful girl really like Herman?

“Everyone, please sit down!” Herman was chuckling at the side. He was obviously very happy.

Everyone took their seats.

The waiter began to serve the dishes, and scholar clement inquired about Windsor’s situation.

Windsor also answered very seriously. It was clear that she had come prepared. It would be a little difficult to tell if it was real or fake based on this.

Hence, Eli chose a more direct method.

While a few of them were chatting, spots of light that looked like stars appeared in the bottom of Eli’s eyes. in the darkness, Eli’s vision gradually changed.

The air was filled with all kinds of pheromones, just like the stars. This was the zero-circle spell, information eye, which could observe things that could not be seen with the naked eye.

He looked at the three of them.

Herman’s body was very clean. Other than some pink substances, there was all kinds of dust, the smell of horses, and the air mixed together. It was a very normal situation.

As for the pink, it was probably from Windsor.

Scholar Clement was in a similar situation as Herman.

But when eli turned to look at Windsor, he was instantly stunned.

At this moment, apart from Windsor’s own pheromones, Herman’s, a small number of Eli’s, and scholar Clement’s, there were also other types of pheromones belonging to other males on her body. He estimated that there were dozens of them.

There were still seven or eight pheromones left in her body, which meant something.

This was because the pheromones that Eli mentioned were not regular pheromones. They could usually be retained in a human body for three to six months.

This meant that within half a year, Windsor had had sex with at least seven or eight people.

And Eli observed that Windsor had been with the same person every day for the past few days.

But if he remembered correctly, Herman had been staying in the library for the past three days.

What he had guessed was right. There was no love at all.

Scholar Clement and Windsor seemed to be having a good conversation. This woman called Windsor still had some tricks up her sleeve. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to charm Herman so much.

However, the main thing was that scholar Clement was asking ordinary questions. Thus, Eli decided to take the initiative.

“Cough cough!”

Suddenly, eli coughed twice, and a few of them looked at him.

“It’s like this. As for me, I’ve always been very interested in foreign cultures. I’ve also learned a lot about them. I heard that Miss Windsor is from another country. May I ask you a question? ” eli said with a smile.

Clement was speechless.

‘Since when are you interested in a foreign culture? Why didn’t I know about it?’

“Of course, you can.” Windsor smiled in response. She didn’t refuse the question at all.

However, a few minutes later, the smile on her face gradually froze, and small beads of sweat appeared on her forehead.

The more confident she was earlier, the more panicky she was now.

In the beginning, the questions that Eli asked were really about the foreign country. She knew most of it, but for some reason, Eli suddenly started asking about her situation here and what she had been doing there!

However, how could Windsor reveal what she had been doing in the empire? She could only make up stories!

However, the more Eli asked, the more logical his questions became. This left Windsor at a loss for an answer, and she was afraid.

It was a pity that Lyas was not here, or she would have been able to empathize deeply with Windsor’s feelings.

Just as Windsor was about to collapse, suddenly, Eli laughed and said, ” that’s all I have to ask. Thank you, miss Windsor, for answering my questions. ”

“It doesn’t matter!” Windsor didn’t seem to have expected why Eli had suddenly stopped, but she still felt as if a stone had fallen from her heart.

‘God, it’s finally over.’

Herman, who was standing beside him, was also puzzled As to why eli was asking a bunch of seemingly unrelated questions. However, since the questions were harmless, so he didn’t stop him.

In his heart, other than his mother, eli should be the person he had the best relationship with. he was willing to believe that eli wouldn’t do anything bad to him.

But this time, he felt that it was probably eli who had made a mistake.

After that, they chatted normally. However, Eli would still interject occasionally, and Windsor would answer very cautiously every time.

After chatting, Eli and the others left first.

“Eli, I told you Windsor is a good girl! ” along the way, Herman said to eli.

Eli just looked at him calmly.

‘My stupid senior!’

“Oh, right, I forgot something. I’ll go back and get it.” As if remembering something, Eli suddenly said.

“Alright, alright!” Herman and scholar Clement nodded and watched as Eli returned.

…

“This is too terrifying!”

At this time, in the original private room, Windsor wiped the cold sweat on her forehead and panted as she watched the few of them leave.

In fact, she had experienced similar meetings many times, and it had always been the same situation in the past.

She and David had been traveling between different countries and cities. Windsor had relied on her beauty to attract some people’s interest and then deceived them.

Of course, they would usually not choose people with real status, as that would make things difficult for them. They would usually choose people who had some money but no power.

And this time, they met Herman.

Originally, they only wanted to make a small profit, but after hearing that Herman had a house that was worth nearly 100 gold tarls, they immediately decided to grab him.

That was why all these things happened. Otherwise, they would have left a few days ago.

After all, they had already earned more than a dozen golden tars from Herman, which was normal for them. But this time, they wanted more.

But today’s meeting really made her a little scared. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Every time eli asked her a question, she felt as if he had seen through her.

“Fortunately, it’s already over. They shouldn’t have noticed the problem. ” Windsor took a deep breath and prepared to leave.

Suddenly, the door to the room opened again, and someone she didn’t want to see walked in. It was Eli.

“I’m sorry, I forgot something!” Eli walked in politely.

“Do you need me to help you find it?” Windsor didn’t expect eli to return again, and her heart started beating rapidly again.

“It’s okay. I remember where it was!” This time, Eli walked in directly, then walked to the table and picked up a copper coin from it.

” oh, it’s here indeed. I almost lost it. ”

Windsor, ‘Don’t scare me like that.’

” Oh, right. Miss Windsor, there’s something I need to tell you,” Eli said in a relaxed manner as he put the brass tarts back into his money bag.

“What?” Windsor was rather puzzled.

“You’re not suitable for Herman. Please leave him.” Eli looked up at Windsor.

Windsor’s pupils instantly widened, but she still replied, “I don’t understand your suggestion. Herman and I are truly in love. ”

Eli walked towards the door, and as he passed Windsor, he said coldly in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “This is not a suggestion. It’s a warning!”

” if something happens to Herman, I’ll have a lot more work to do. I’ll be very unhappy. ”

The cold voice reached Windsor’s ears, making her feel a little cold. Just as she was about to say something, she realized that eli had already left the room.

After a few minutes, she also left the room.
