144 Investor

The fields were located on both sides of the camp. Eli was on the east side, while Rawls was on the west side, so if there were no accidents, it was almost impossible for them to meet.

Rawls wanted to get rid of Eli, but of course, he would not just sit back and do nothing.

Planting magic herbs in the field was something that Eli was already very familiar with, so he spent half an hour planning things out again. Then, he instructed his subordinates on how to plant each magic herb and how to prepare specific nutrient solutions. All of this took a few hours.

After that, Eli completely stopped caring about the magic herb field. He only went to take a look occasionally. Rawls, on the other hand, went to the magic herb field often, constantly giving orders here and there, and so on.

On the other hand, Eli had also received news about Tijie. The new mage camp was located in the Chris mountains, far away from the Warlock camp. She had also brought along the magic potion that Eli had given her before she left, and she had advanced by one step, becoming the person in charge of a small department in the camp.

!!

Tijie was Eli’s servant, but Eli’s intention for her was to help her explore the current mage’s world, so he still gave her some resources.

Of course, it was the same for Little Ross. If necessary, Eli would invest in him. Eli hoped that he could become stronger and climb higher in the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.

Of course, this was only one of his investments. It didn’t matter if it succeeded or not. He had invested in quite a number of people anyway. Even if one of them succeeded, Eli’s cost would be recovered.

This was also one of the joys of being immortal.

He was just repeating what he had done in Bryne.

Speaking of raising them, of course, Eli wouldn’t forget his two students, Vivika and David.

From what he could sense, David didn’t even seem to be here at this time, and the path he chose seemed to be that of a mage. What’s more, he had already broken through to the second circle and surpassed Eli.

On the other hand, Vivika was on the path of a bloodline warlock. She might still be on this continent, but she was not very close to Eli. She was currently at the level of the limit of the first circle and was about to break through.

As for the other information about the two, Eli had no idea.

As for whether they would meet in the future, it would depend on fate.

The two of them still had Eli’s imprint in their minds. At the moment, Eli wasn’t too worried, but he felt a little awkward. It felt like the two of them had already surpassed him.

“Sigh, but they’re all going to die eventually!” He shook his head and hoped that they would be able to hold on until the day they met him.

…

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Everything in the camp was slowly recovering, but there was a small problem in the magic herb field.

“What kind of insect is this?” Eli frowned as he looked at a small worm on the silent Crescent.

They were about the size of a fingernail and were blue and white in color with black spots all over them. They were clinging to the silent Crescent and destroying the magic plants.

This was a small bug that had suddenly appeared in the silent Crescent’s plantation area yesterday. There were not many of them, but they were very harmful to the silent Crescent. They would constantly release a type of pheromone that destroyed the extraordinary characteristics of the plants.

“Sir, we found these bugs yesterday, but we’ve tried many methods to no avail. What’s more troublesome is that these bugs reproduce very quickly.” Rona said with an anxious expression.

The silent Crescent was the magic plant that grew the most in the magic herb field. He couldn’t let anything happen to it.

“Okay, I know. Have you done the ultrasound, potions, and bloodline suppression? ” Eli asked with a frown.

“Our potions aren’t working yet, and these bugs seem to have a strong resistance to sound waves. The bloodline is useful, but it requires a bloodline of two circle and above to release its aura. Only then will these bugs leave slowly.” Rona said.

“Is that so?” Eli frowned.

The reduction in the production of the magic plant would definitely have an impact on him. One had to know that as the Minister, one would be responsible for the production yield. Eli could stay at the field to chase the bugs away, but he didn’t have the time.

“Okay, you guys use other methods first. I’ll go back first.” Frowning, Eli thought for a moment, then caught a few bugs and left.

On the other side.

Rawls also frowned and was at a loss for what to do with these insects.

This was not something he was good at!

He immediately looked for some of the warlocks with insect bloodlines he knew and began to discuss with them. However, these warlocks only studied their own bloodlines and did not know much about pests.

He walked around and found that not a single Warlock understood the bug.

“These people only study their own bloodline.” Rawls finally let out a sigh helplessly.

It was so in the current mage’s world.

After leaving another house, he came to the side of Eli’s magic herb field by chance. This was also his first time here.

‘Eh, he’s actually made some adjustments too.’ Rawls was surprised to find that the layout of the magic herb field was different from before. He thought that nothing had been done.

It wasn’t like Eli was lazy!

Rawls acknowledged Eli slightly, but when he walked to the silent Crescent area and saw that only a few people were using human strength to drive the bugs away, his mouth twitched.

He had overestimated Eli.

“It’s true. It looks like I’ll be able to get rid of him when the time comes.” Rawls actually relaxed a little. Since Eli was so lazy, it would be much easier to drive him away.

However, Rawls felt that the other magic plants were growing quite well.

Most of the plants here were two-year-old, so he couldn’t see anything now.

After some observation, he left the place.

…

Eli brought the bug back to the laboratory.

Eli started a new experiment and began to study the bug in a targeted manner, preparing to solve the bug problem.

Eli’s choice was to prepare to change it from reproduction. It was difficult to kill it directly, but it was still possible to make it lose its fertility.

In any case, the lifespan of this insect was very short, probably only one or two days.

Regarding similar research, Eli had done a lot of it back when he was researching bloodline creatures. Now, he was just simply trying to replicate his earlier experiments, so two days later, Eli made the potion.

He took the potions to the potions Department and asked Evena to have the staff produce a lot before returning to the potions field.

“Minister, will this really work?” Rona asked in confusion as he looked at the sprayed potion.

“You’ll know tomorrow.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

The next day.

“Oh my God!!!” Rona knelt on the ground and picked up the bug corpses in the magic herb field, his face full of shock.

On the ground, there were many tiny insects, but these eggs hadn’t hatched. There was no sign of life, and they were almost completely dead.

These were all caused by that magic potion.

“Boss, did you make this?” Rona said with a dumbfounded expression.

“What do you think?” Eli cast him a glance.

Rona was sincerely convinced.

…

Soon, the news about the magic potion gradually reached Rawls’ ears.

However, he only knew that the magic potion Department had a magic potion that could cure the bug. He did not know who had concocted it, so he could only ask for some from Evena.

Instead of giving Rawls an answer that day, Evena came to ask Eli.

“Just give it to him. It doesn’t matter.” Eli did not care about these things.

Rawls was just like that. He was just a little narrow-minded. Eli didn’t mind. He told Evena not to tell him that he was the one who concocted the potion.

Soon, Rawls also received the potion.

That night, he looked at the bottle of magic potion and revealed a deeply puzzled expression.

“How is this made? What’s the principle behind it?” Rawls was dumbfounded, not understanding the principle at all.

After a simple analysis of the drug, he was even more confused.

“Which master made this?” Rawls shook his head, feeling that no one in the camp could develop a magic potion so quickly. It was simply ridiculous.

The others didn’t seem to care, but only he knew how high the level of the person who made the potion was.

“It’s a pity I don’t know him. If only he were the one who taught me potionology.” Rawls sighed with emotion, ” no, am I qualified? ”

This kind of potioneering master must be at least a second circle Warlock. The current warlocks’ potioneering skills are really average.

Warlocks had given up too much, and potioneering had already declined to an unbelievable level. Official warlocks were not sensitive to certain elements due to their bloodlines, and there were very few Potioneers, and even fewer high-level Potioneers.

At the very least, there was no doubt that Eli was the strongest in the camp.

Just like that, Rawls used Eli’s potion without his knowledge.

When he saw the effects the next day, he also sighed.

“It’s too powerful.”

He finally heaved a sigh of relief after the matter with the insects was resolved.

To him, as long as this matter was resolved, a year later would be the time for him to kick Eli out.

“How can there be two heads in one department?” Rawls sneered.

He just wanted to defeat Eli fair and square. It would be easy because he had been working so hard.

Just like that, Erdo passed the busiest year of his life.

Watching Rawls diligently handle the potions and dispel the bugs in the herb field every day, Eli heard about it and flipped over from his recliner.

Rawls could do whatever he wanted.

Eli had done his part.

Rawls was very hardworking, but he was a warlock. Although he had done some research, compared to a warlock, like Eli, he lacked practice. There were some things that he did, based on his experience, without understanding the reason. There was no comparison.

It could be said that this was a match between Rawls and Eli. It was also a battle of thought between Magi and warlocks.

Warlocks who had lost their yearning for the truth relied on excavating bloodlines to become stronger. However, for mages, knowledge, and truth were their weapons, and potioneering was one of them.

“I really miss the Mage world of the past!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

In the office, Eli looked at Rawls, who had gone out again, and sighed. Then, he turned his body over again.

It felt so comfortable to recline at work.
