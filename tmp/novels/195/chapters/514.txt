515 Dissipated Courage

Golden Cicada Merchant Association.

Jin Ji sat on the chair with a lonely expression. His hands were hanging down, and his gaze was listless as he looked into the distance, like an old man in his twilight years.

At this moment, a large number of Warlocks were flying out of the fallen floating city. Huge magical airships were constantly transporting the resources of the Chamber of Commerce.

“It’s over!”

Jin Ji sighed.

But suddenly, with a bang, the door behind him was suddenly pushed open. A figure hurriedly walked in, panting heavily.

Jin Ji turned around in shock and looked at the person who had just arrived.

“Conilla, why are you back?” Jin Ji asked in surprise.

“Milord, Milord, we won, we won.” As if he didn’t hear him, Conilla roared loudly, his eyes filled with ecstasy.

“We won? Who won?” There was a flash of light in Jin Ji’s eyes.

“It’s Sir Eli. Eli has advanced to the fifth circle. He fought with three fifth circle Hamis Family members in the sky above Bloodline City, and all three of them died!” Conilla’s body trembled as he shouted.

Jin Ji also stood in, the light in his eyes completely recovering.

“Sir, we don’t need to leave!” Conilla wept with joy.

A smile appeared on Jin Ji’s face, but he still shook his head and said, “No, you still have to leave, but you can leave half of the people behind.”

“Why?” Conilla asked.

Jin Ji sighed again, his gaze distant. “Do you think the Warlock Alliance will let this go? Would the Hamis family let it go? The Hamis Clan was a clan that possessed the power of a warlock powerhouse. The Bloodline Tower would only face an even more terrifying attack!”

Conilla’s face also darkened, and he asked bitterly, “Is there no other way?”

“No.” Jin Ji shook his head, but his expression became fierce. He said, “However, it’s not like we don’t have a chance. The Warlock Union has been suppressing the various factions for thousands of years, and now, the exploitation of resources is becoming more and more serious.

“This might not be a bad opportunity. You don’t have to go to the central region. I want you to go to the other regions and contact all the factions that are rejected by the alliance.”

Jin Ji slowly stood up and said, “Let them pressure the Alliance. Maybe they can change everything. Remember to be fast!”

Mordor’s eyes lit up.

..

Conilla City!

He was afraid.

“How is this possible?” Azak slumped in his chair, not understanding how things had developed to this point. How could Eli be at the fifth circle? How could we lose?

“Ely!”

Azak muttered the name, trembling.

Although he was only a half-step fifth circle Warlock, he had never looked at Ely in the eye. After all, they were six ancient bloodline families, a sixth circle bloodline family!

However, this time, three of his clan’s fifth-circle warlocks had died, which made him really afraid.

Three!

At this moment, Azak felt his head buzzing.

If there were three, or even thirteen half-step fifth circle warlocks who had died, he would be heartbroken, but he would definitely not be like this. However, the death of three fifth-circle warlocks meant that their family’s high-end combat strength would be weakened by at least a quarter. It was a devastating blow to them.

“Not only the territory but also the resources. I’m afraid that my limited speaking rights in the Alliance will also plummet.”

Azak thought about the consequences, and suddenly a ring flashed on his finger.

“Are you that impatient?” Azak’s face darkened, but he still activated his bloodline and connected to the ring. Then his consciousness sank into the ring.

When he opened his eyes again, he was already in the meeting room of Heaven City. The heads of the other families looked at him with sparkling eyes.

Gulp!

Azak’s throat moved slightly.

It was already half an hour when Azak returned.

After he returned, he sat calmly on the chair and sighed. He muttered, “I have to kill Eli and Roland and promise not to invade outside the Hamis family’s territory for 300 years, not to occupy the resources and increase contribution to the Alliance.

only to reduce the Alliance’s income?”

“Haha!”

Azak suddenly laughed and gritted his teeth. “A bunch of old guys. You didn’t want to face Eli, so you just let us do it. What can my family do in 300 years? Can we nurture three more fifth-circle warlocks in 300 years?”

Of course, this was just a complaint. He knew very well that he had no other choice at this moment.

“Come on. Can Eli defeat the Germinal and the Divine Tree Warlock? He could defeat the Germinal Warlock but what about the Divine Tree warlock?”

He gritted his teeth.

At this time, they had confirmed that the fluctuation ten years ago came from Eli.

After advancing for ten years, perhaps a true prodigy could indeed defeat three people of the same level, but it was absolutely impossible to defeat the Divine Tree warlock because they were on a completely different level.

“Eli, you’ve completely angered a noble bloodline family!”

Azak’s eyes were bloodshot, and his blood was rolling like waves.

This time, the Hamis family had no choice but to kill Eli.

If Eli didn’t die, then they would be the ones to die.

He was very clear about the Alliance’s actions! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Southern Region.

Sea Dragon and the patriarch of the Sea Sharks family gathered in secret again.

The two of them looked at each other and then laughed at the same time.

“Awesome, it’s still Eli. This guy is actually a fifth-circle human. He really shocked the world with a single feat!” The Sea Dragon Clan Head’s face was brimming with a brilliant smile.

“Hehe, indeed. I’m too happy to see the Hamis family suffer.” The Sea Shark Clan nodded.

“But our opponent is the Warlock Alliance. I’m afraid that we’ve completely angered the Warlock Alliance this time.” After he was happy, the Sea Dragon Clan’s head suddenly frowned.

“Indeed!”

“Then what should we do? Should we support Eli?” The Sea Shark Family looked at their old friend.

“Um. To tell you the truth,” the Sea Dragon Clan’s head said, pursing his lips. “Yesterday, I received a message from Jin Ji, the president of the Western Region of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce. He said that he had contacted all the major factions and hoped that everyone could join forces to resist the Warlock Union.

“What do you think?”

“Eh, you received it too?” The Sea Shark Family looked at him in surprise.

“You too?” The Sea Dragon Clan’s head blinked!

“Yes.”

“Then what do you think?”

The Sea Shark Family shook their head.” I don’t think it’s time yet. We’re getting weaker and weaker. We only have one chance.

“I feel that the Bloodline Tower will have a hard time surviving the next attack. I rejected it. I know you very well, so you should have rejected it as well!”

He looked at the other side. As expected, the Sea Dragon clan nodded and said, ” Like you, I also feel that it’s not the right time. We need a leader, but I don’t think the current Eli is enough.

“After all, he is just the Germinal Warlock.”

“Yeah. Sigh!”

In the end, the conversation ended in melancholy.

At the same time.

The eyes of the head of the Wind God Yaolong clan of the Eastern Region lit up. “We’ll accept if the other clan heads agree. Our clan can’t stand another failure.”

The Patriarch of the North Region was even more decisive. He didn’t think the Bloodline Tower had a future.

When Jin Ji received the news, he cursed, “A bunch of short-sighted fellows. It’s their weakness that led to the current strength of the alliance!”

However, he lowered his head and realized that he had gone overboard.

The other families had tried to form alliances before, but they had failed too many times. People like the Bloodline Tower had also appeared before, but they had all failed. That was why they all rejected the idea.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to resist, but that courage had disappeared!
