475 Experiment Successful, World Will Descends

“Recently, there has been a lot of friction between us and the Heart of the Abyss. Wasn’t the Twilight Lizard Family destroyed previously? Normally, that should be an ownerless area, so we naturally want a share of the loot. However, that place has already been occupied by the Heart of the Abyss. Nero said that if we want some of the territory, he wants Sir to go to talk to him!”

In the Tower, Alida looked at Eli with an ugly expression.

“Then forget it. I don’t want it anymore!” Eli replied.

“You don’t want it anymore?” Alida raised her head in surprise.

“No, this matter is settled. Let them have it.” Eli nodded.

He did not expect Nero to start taking action in just a few months.

However, this did not seem like he was preparing to attack the Bloodline Tower. It was more like a personal blow to Eli.

“This time, I’ll endure it!”

The experiment was not yet successful, and Eli still needed to work hard.

..

New Calendar Year 4790.

It had been a year since the last war.

This year, in the eastern part of the Western Regions, in the territory of the former Saka Family, something happened in the Bloodline Tower.

There was a large-scale magic stone mine at the edge of the Saka family. It was invaded and occupied by the Heart of the Abyss.

More than ten people died in the mine.

This was a huge insult to the Bloodline Tower, but the Bloodline Tower’s decision was also unexpected. They didn’t send out their troops but chose to remain silent.

The Bloodline Tower had endured it?!

Everyone was shocked, but when they thought of how powerful the Heart of Abyss was, everyone understood.

However, while they understood, the news of Eli’s weakness and the Bloodline Tower’s cowardice spread throughout the Western Regions. For a time, the Heart of the Abyss’ momentum in the Western Regions soared, and the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower felt extremely aggrieved.

Eli naturally knew about this, but he still did not explain.

But this year, his experiment progress increased again, reaching 98%.

“I still need time.”

Eli said calmly, but he was still a little unhappy with the comments from the outside world!

Three years later.

In the past three years, the Heart of the Abyss had never stopped stepping on the Bloodline Tower.

In fact, one-fifth of the Saka clan’s territory had already been annexed.

The condemnation of the Bloodline Tower’s weakness and Eli’s words flooded in like a tidal wave. Although the Bloodline Tower’s forces weren’t affected much, they were still somewhat uneasy.

Some factions even joined Heart of the Abyss when they saw that the situation was not right.

Eli still ignored everything, but the experiment was at 99%.

Eli stood outside the window and looked at Bloodline City through space.

The city was still bustling, but the atmosphere was clearly not as good as before. Even the number of caravans had decreased to a certain extent. This was all due to the special situation in the Western Regions.

In everyone’s opinion, once the Heart of the Abyss attacked the Bloodline Tower, the Bloodline Tower would collapse in a short period of time and be occupied by the Heart of the Abyss.

Everyone was not optimistic about the future of the Bloodline Tower.

Actually, it wasn’t like there hadn’t been anyone who had tried to instigate Eli over the years.

A year ago, the Hamis family had secretly sent someone over to tell them that they could provide support and ask Eli to start a war against the Heart of the Abyss. However, Eli refused. The Warlock of the Hamis family had looked at Eli in disdain and left.

They probably also thought that Eli was a coward.

“Soon!”

Eli returned to the laboratory and continued his experiment.

..

Another year passed.

In the laboratory.

Eli closed his eyes. His celestial body and bloodline avatar intertwined behind him and continued to fuse.

Illusion and reality collided, and the fusion of the two was getting closer and closer to the limit.

Both powers exploded, and everything in the laboratory exploded. Eli’s body began to tremble rapidly, but he did not stop. He persisted, or rather, he was searching.

Suddenly, Eli opened his eyes, and a bright silver light shone from them.

“I did it!”

Eli suddenly said.

In the next second, a dazzling light bloomed behind him. The celestial body and Bloodline Avatar, which had already reached the final step, suddenly stepped through the final node and fused.

The bloodline avatar gradually disappeared, and the celestial body gradually became focused. Black scales gradually appeared, and the transparent celestial body was gradually filled with shadows. The eyes turned into pure gold like a shadow dragon.

A pair of enormous wings appeared behind the celestial body!

“Celestial Bloodline Transformation!”

Eli felt that he was stronger than ever.

He felt that the celestial body could provide an endless stream of power to the bloodline, and the bloodline made the celestial body no longer illusory.

“This state is much stronger than I thought.”

Eli was overjoyed. Hundreds of years of hard work had finally come to fruition.

” And I’m confident that I can get rid of Nero. It’s time for everything to end.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Eli stood up. Even though the laboratory had suffered heavy losses, he did not hide his excitement.

The day had finally arrived.

“Nero!”

Eli grinned. Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly raised his head. His gaze pierced through the sky, and his eyes were instantly illuminated by a golden light. Then, a vast and desolate will instantly descended.

His will surged into Eli’s body, and Eli’s consciousness gradually dissipated.

At the last moment before he fell asleep, he activated all the concealment arrays in the vicinity!

..

Bloodline City!

Alida was dealing with something when she suddenly felt her blood throb.

She immediately walked to the window and looked at the sky.

In the sky, as far as her eyes could see, the sea of clouds churned, and countless golden lights enveloped the sky. A massive and ancient will enveloped the world, and even just a glance at it made her heart palpitate.

” The World Will has descended! ”

Alida’s voice was trembling, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

..

The City of Dawn!

“Sigh, the seal is about to succeed. Perhaps we need a grand blood sacrifice now.”

Nero said proudly.

Since the last war, both the Warlock Union and the Bloodline Tower have stopped fighting with him. This had allowed him to finally have the energy to deal with the seal. Now, he had reached the decisive stage.

“Eli, he’s just a coward.” Nero stretched his body.

The next second, a dash of gold came from outside the window. He turned his head to look, and his eyes gradually widened.

Sensing that terrifying will, Nero’s soul could not help but tremble. He even felt that his soul was beginning to be injured, and he was extremely shocked.

“The World Will has descended. What exactly happened? Did something big happen? No, someone must have created a new path!” Nero hid in the shadows to avoid the light and did not dare to go out.

He couldn’t understand why the world’s will would descend now!

“I hope it doesn’t affect me.”

Nero panted heavily, feeling worried for the first time in decades.

..

Green Field!

All the elves raised their heads and looked at the sky.

Erwin’s mouth was also wide open.

“The World Will has descended. It’s been a long time since I saw it. Ever since that great war, it has rarely descended. It seems that some creatures have done something extraordinary!” The moon elf walked over and sighed.

“This is the first time I’ve seen it.” Erwin looked at the golden light in the sky and looked at the statue of Eli in the distance. It was also emitting a faint light as if it was resonating.

“Does it have anything to do with you, sir?”

Erwin gritted his teeth, but her heart was in turmoil.

Not only the elves but the other races also raised their heads and felt the familiar and powerful will.

Dragon King Giovanni raised his head and felt the direction of the light. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

“Am I right? This is too ridiculous.” His gaze was dull.

He could only think of one person in that direction.

“Eli!

“Is this your experiment?”

At this moment, he realized that the joke he had made with Ely had come true.

“It’s all thanks to me!”

Giovanni chuckled and fell asleep again.

He was very happy.

There was no need to experiment anymore.
