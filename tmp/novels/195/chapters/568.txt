569 Shock to All Sides

At this moment, looking at Eli, who was shrouded in light in the distance, everyone in the distance felt numb.

” Has the World Will descended?”

” Are you kidding me? Even the world thinks that the Black Fog could cause great damage to the world.”

“This is ridiculous!”

The fifth circle warlocks and the celestials had incredulous expressions on their faces.

In the past few thousand years, the world’s will had only descended three times, and Eli was responsible for one of them. What kind of honor and glory was this?

“Let’s wait for Milord to come out.” Vivika was completely relaxed.

“That’s true!”

The others nodded, but they couldn’t help but look at the light.

..

Within the light.

The boundless world power gave Eli a sense of familiarity!

At the same time, he felt as if his body was changing. His already high talent had once again improved. Some details were also being adjusted, and his comprehension of laws was also progressing rapidly!

In the blink of an eye, the Law of Light broke through to the second level.

It was not just the Law of Light. The other Laws were also rapidly improving. The most ridiculous thing was that regarding the Law of Shadow, Eli felt that all the Laws related to Shadow in his body were merging into it. Change, death, decay…

All of this made Eli feel like he was undergoing a transformation.

“It’s even more exaggerated than the last time!”

Eli understood that this was the world’s reward for him!

“In that case, let me enjoy this great gift.”

Eli closed his eyes and decided not to care anymore. He let the world’s will do whatever it wanted!

..

On the other side.

Most of the fifth circle warlocks stayed behind to protect Eli, who was in the world’s will. As for the others, they left one after another.

Vivika stayed behind to take care of David. At this time, she was shocked to find that the lich had turned into an undead!

She finally understood that the so-called Immortality of the Liches was a fundamental scam. At the same time, news came from other battlefields that not only there but all the Liches on the other battlefields had also died.

She was extremely shocked. The black fog had actually absorbed the life of all the Liches.

Of course, this thought was too shocking, so she wasn’t sure.

“Maybe when this guy wakes up, he will know.”

She lowered her head and looked at David, who had turned into an undead. She was very confused.

From what she had heard from the battlefield, this guy was also a student of Eli, which made her even more confused.

“What’s going on?”

Her eyes flickered as she looked at David and the pillar of light in the distance.

..

Elsewhere, after Eli left the Grassi Land, Alida had been anxiously waiting.

Suddenly, the door opened, and a figure rushed in.

Alida did not reprimand him. Instead, she immediately stood up and asked, “How is it now? Has Sir Eli arrived at the battlefield?”

The Warlock panted heavily and took a deep breath. “Yes.”

“So, what happened?” Alida grabbed the Warlock’s shoulder and said anxiously.

“Things are a little complicated. I’ll make it short. After my lord arrived, he easily killed the Lich of Calamity and the Bone Dragon Lich. Then, the Lich King suddenly appeared on the battlefield. He turned out to be Eli’s student but was easily defeated by Eli. After that, the mysterious black fog drilled out of the Lich King’s body and extracted all the Lich’s power. He reached the peak of the fifth circle and was killed by my lord again. After that, the world’s will descended.” The Warlock quickly explained everything in one breath.

Alida was speechless.

She could understand every word, but she couldn’t understand how they were connected.

Why would the Lich King appear on the battlefield? There was also the Black Fog, the Lich’s death, and the World Will…

Even though she was a fourth-circle celestial, her brain couldn’t understand these things for a moment.

“Madam, it is indeed a little complicated. Let me explain it to you again…” The Warlock spoke again.

Ten minutes later.

“So that’s how it is!” Alida finally understood, but she was even more shocked.

The ups and downs and complexity of this battle were something she could barely imagine. It was also the first time she had seen such a powerful battle. The methods displayed by Eli were even more exaggerated than the previous one.

That was the peak of the fifth circle!

Had Eli already reached this stage?

She couldn’t help but feel shocked.

Suddenly, the door opened again, and a Warlock ran in, panting.

“Calm down. What’s wrong now?” Alida signaled for the Warlock to calm down.

She did not think that this time would be more shocking than the previous ones.

The Warlock nodded and sighed in his heart. “Madam, all the liches within the range of the Lich Tower are dead.”

“What?!”

Alida’s mouth was wide open, and her cry of surprise spread out of the room.

Another ten minutes passed.

Alida finally accepted the fact that the black mist had not only killed the Liches on the battlefield but all the Liches. She had mixed feelings.

She sighed.

What happened this time was too shocking.

“But… The Lich Tower ended just like that? We won?”

She blinked her eyes and felt that it was unreal.

However, this was the reality. The Lich Tower had perished, and the Bloodline Alliance was the only force left on the continent.

She took a deep breath and calmed herself down. Then, she strode out. At the same time, her voice entered the guard’s ears.

“Gather all the higher-ups.”

“A Meeting!”

In an office not far away, Jin Ji, who had just received the news, was also excited.

“I won this time!” He smiled.

..

In the Bloodline City.

In a room.

A woman slowly pushed open a door and said respectfully, “Guild Leader, the lord won!”

“We won!”

A joyful voice came from the room, and then it calmed down a lot.

“I knew he would win. He has never lost!

Prepare the most beautiful clothes for me. When he comes back, I want to see him.”

“Yes, Lady Liliana.”

The room closed again, and the woman slowly left!

..

At the Amina Family.

“We won, we won!”

A smile appeared on Selona’s aged face.

Compared to the past, he was undoubtedly older now. He was almost at the end of his life!

“Soon, the lord will unify the country. I have waited for this day.”

He laughed loudly, his voice echoing throughout the room.

..

Deep Sea.

Laura had been resting, but she was suddenly awakened by Ivor, who had rushed over.

“What’s wrong?” Laura asked curiously.

“The Imperial Dynasty of the Sea Race has called for a meeting with all the members of the Sea Race.” Eval’s face was filled with anxiety. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What’s wrong?” Laura instantly lost her composure.

The Eight Great Imperial Families had attended the meeting at the same time. This had only happened a few times ever since the Imperial Dynasty was established.

” It has something to do with Sir Eli,” Eval whispered when he saw that there was no one around.

“What?!”

Laura’s pupils dilated, and her face was filled with shock.
