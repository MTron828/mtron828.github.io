Chapter 22: Scholar Clement and Investment

Translator: Lonelytree

At that moment, the music came to the last part.

Eli held onto Rias and performed the last part of the dance.

“How is it? Not bad, right?”

Lowering his head, Eli could see Rias’ big purple eyes, her cheeks slightly red, and speak in a voice that only the two of them could hear.

“...Not bad!” The intense dance made Rias’s heart beat faster. She looked at Eli as if she was dreaming in the clouds.

Heavens!

She had never expected that a guy like Eli who was working in the library, could be so good at noble dance.

However, after the shock came bitterness.

‘It’s fine that you’re good at your studies, but why are you so good at dancing too?

‘Can’t you let me have something that I’m good at?’

In the midst of her melancholy, the music finally ended.

In the next second, a round of applause erupted at the banquet, and Alex, Alice, and the others also made their way over.

“Your movements are very graceful and smooth!” Alice praised. Such a beautiful dance. The last time she had seen it was at a banquet with her father, but last time, it was performed by one of the best dancers in the Empire.

“Your performance was wonderful.” Alex was also not stingy with his praise. He even looked at Klein, who was a few meters away and raised his head.

“Klein, what do you think?”

“It’s alright!” Klein’s mouth twitched, and he nodded stubbornly, but the way he looked at Eli was no longer as disgusted as before.

Outstanding people were more or less worthy of respect.

“It’s fine,” David’s heart ached a little as he looked at Eli, who was standing together with Alex, Rias, and many other descendants of the great nobles. However, he immediately consoled himself, “It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter. No matter what, they’re just the children of a few aristocrats. They’re not the real aristocrats who will inherit the title.”

After some self-comfort, David’s heart didn’t ache as much anymore.

And because of this ball, the distance between Eli, Alex, and the other nobles seemed to have increased quite a bit. They were happily discussing some things together.

In the conversation, Eli also realized that few of them actually spoke kindly to the people they knew, and that broke his inherent impression of the descendants of great nobles.

Among them, Eli also introduced Herman to the others, which made Herman secretly happy.

Time passed by quickly.

The band also slowly left, and everyone was taken to their rooms to change their clothes and prepare to hunt.

Eli’s clothes were more casual, to begin with, and since hunting was usually just for fun, he didn’t bring any other clothes.

After changing their clothes, they followed Rias to the back of the castle.

There was a large grassland here, and behind it was a large forest. This was the territory of the Gimori family. For the convenience of hunting, the Gimori family had placed many wild beasts here.

But when everyone arrived, Eli saw an unexpected person.

“Teacher!” Eli blinked.

Not far away, a gray-robed Kurt was following scholar Clement, who was following a man in luxurious clothes. There were also a few people behind the man.

“Father!” On the other side, a figure had already run over. It was Rias.

‘Alright,’ Eli knew who the man at the front was. It should be Count Gimori. Count Gimori walked to the front. He was wearing expensive silk clothes, and his eyes were bright. His body looked strong, and he exuded a powerful life force.

Aside from being a count, Count Gimori also had another identity.

He was also a Grand Knight.

...

“You all know that I’m going to donate some money, but I can’t say for sure who will get it.”

Count Gimori was walking on the road, talking with the six people from the Imperial Library, the Imperial Mystic Academy, and the Imperial Knight Academy.

During the winter last year, he had stored a large amount of grain in advance. After selling it, he collected a large amount of money. Thus, he was prepared to strengthen his contact with the outside world and donate a sum of money.

He was going to donate it to the library since his daughter was there.

However, the Empire’s Mystic Academy and the Empire’s Knight Academy had gotten the news from somewhere and had come looking for him. This put him in a difficult position because his other son was in the Empire’s Mystic Academy, and the Knight Academy had a deep relationship with him.

“my Lord, please donate it to us. Every year, the Knight Academy trains countless outstanding soldiers. We are really short of money. If you give this money to us, we might be able to train a few more Knights today. You are also from the Knight Academy, so you should understand.” The one from the Imperial Knight Academy was an old man, and behind him was a red-haired young man.

“don’t listen to him, my Lord. Your son is still studying at our Academy. He is very outstanding. If everything goes well, he might even become the principal’s student.” An old woman was in charge of the academy and behind her was a gentle-looking man.

The Imperial Knight Academy started to play the count’s emotions, while the mystic academy leveraged with his son.

Count Gimori was also in a dilemma. He thought about their reasons and then looked at scholar Clement, who had not spoken.

Looking at the Count’s gaze, Clement groaned in his heart.

The three of them had more or less been in contact with the Earl, and he was also sent out by the library to deal with public relations.

However, he was a researcher who had been doing research all year round. He had no right to promise anything, but he knew that this money was very important to the library.

The library’s benefits had always been poor, and it had always been dependent on the Empire’s subsidies. Moreover, the Empire did not have much money this year, and as a result, the library was almost unable to get any money. None of them dared to tell their subordinates about this, which was why he had come.

Therefore, after a few seconds, he said in an uncertain tone, “Your Excellency, I can try my best to apply for the title of an honorary scholar from the curator for you.”

Carter, who was behind scholar Clement, covered his head. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Teacher, you’re facing a Count, and a count that’s developing well. Does he lack the title of an honorary scholar? And what did you mean by ‘try’?

Where’s the energy you used to scold Herman?

The Count’s expression did not change.

For him, an honorary scholar title was nothing.

In fact, among the three, the conditions of the Academy were not bad, while the other two were very ordinary. However, he was also from the Knight Academy, so the library was at the back of his mind.

“Sigh, this is so troublesome!” The Count was also a little troubled.

As they walked, the old man and the woman kept trying to persuade the Count. Only the honest scholar Clement walked behind them. He wanted to say something, but he couldn’t bring himself to do so.

Kurt’s face was filled with despair.
