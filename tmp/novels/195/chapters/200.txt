201 Soul Blade

In the quiet slanted tower, in front of the ancient staircase formed by pieces of wooden boards, Eli raised his head, swept past the stairs, and looked up.

He had obtained this tower for more than a hundred years.

But until now, he still had not stepped onto the third level.

When he was a mid-second circle mage, he reached the second floor. The second floor was ordinary, and there was nothing there. He had been walking around the second floor since then. Until now, he had only reached the top of the second floor and had not stepped into the third floor.

He felt that he could do it now.

Eli took a deep breath and went up the stairs. The familiar pressure hit him again.

However, compared to the past, this pressure was not worth mentioning anymore. It was like a gentle breeze, and it could no longer provide him with the effect of compressing his mental force. Eli continued to walk up, step by step, and the pressure increased. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Relying on his 200 points of powerful mental force, Eli arrived at the second level without any pressure. He only took one look at the empty space around him before he continued upwards.

On the second floor, Eli finally felt the long-awaited sense of oppression, but this oppression was still very weak, and it was very limited to obstructing him. The only change was that Eli’s eyes were brighter, which was a sign of mental force activation.

One rank after another.

On the empty stairs, Eli walked up step by step. His body made a series of grinding sounds as he stepped on the steps, but he didn’t care at all and just kept going up.

The tilted tower’s main purpose was to train one’s mental force. Although his appearance did not seem to have changed much, his will seemed to be being hammered by a small iron hammer, and it was getting stronger and stronger.

Soon, he arrived at the middle of the second floor.

“Continue!” At this moment, even Eli couldn’t ignore the pressure. He could only grit his teeth and continue moving upwards.

Eli moved upwards bit by bit and the feeling of his spirit being hammered also changed from a small iron hammer to a large iron hammer. In the end, it was even like a hydraulic press. This made Eli feel like his spirit was about to be crushed.

However, Eli still did not stop. Although it was painful, it was still within his tolerance range. Furthermore, the mental force that he had absorbed a few days ago was slowly compressed again under this pressure, constantly expelling useless impurities.

In this state, Eli reached his limit from the last time, the top of the second floor.

At this moment, Eli’s entire body was drenched in sweat. Due to the suppression of his mental force, his body was also under great pressure. His eyes were like small light bulbs in the dark.

Eli gritted his teeth, and the veins on his face bulged. He had activated his mental force to the extreme in his consciousness, but it seemed like he was still unable to break through. In that case, he activated his bloodline. His bloodline was directly activated, and his mental force was enhanced once again. Meanwhile, his golden pupils were burning like flames.

Eli knew very well that this was his limit. If this still didn’t work, then he would really have to wait until he reached the third circle.

It was as if a limit had been broken. The pressure on his mental force disappeared instantly, and he fell to the ground after stumbling into the third floor.

“F * ck!”

Eli got up from the ground and looked around. It wasn’t much different from the second floor. He was surrounded by the hard tower wall, and behind him were wooden stairs.

What was there?

Eli looked around and saw a small table not far away with a crystal ball on it.

“It looks like this is the reward for the third level!” Eli looked at the crystal ball in front of him and said softly.

To him, the third floor’s reward was not that big of a deal. The tilted tower’s most important use was to train his will. This was just an additional reward.

But even so, Eli was still looking forward to it.

“Let me see what’s inside.” Eli stretched out his hand and touched the crystal ball, and a large amount of information surged into his consciousness.

Ten minutes later, a look of joy appeared on Eli’s face.

This crystal ball was a mage’s inheritance. There were two things in it. One was a Soul Rune imprint. It was this rune that gave the tower such a magical effect. It was a very useful special rune.

A devouring rune had allowed the average-looking Eli to reach his current level. This rune might not be that special, but it did not seem ordinary either. Of course, he would have to slowly dig into it.

Other than this rune, the other part was a spell.

Special spell-Soul Blade.

This spell was very interesting. It was to use mental force to construct a spiritual force blade in the space of consciousness and then use spiritual force runes to continuously compress mental force into it. The longer the time the blade was forged in mind, the more powerful it would be. It was a time-type spell.

Eli liked it very much as well. This spell might not be that powerful if it was accumulated for a few years, but the longer it was accumulated, the more powerful it would be. It just so happened that Eli had no lack of time, so he could use it as a trump card.

“Well, I didn’t come here in vain.”

Putting away the crystal ball, and then checking the other places to make sure there was nothing else, Eli walked out of the tilted tower and into the secret plane.

The realm wasn’t much different from a hundred years ago, but Eli had arranged for many new areas, such as a Botanical Garden, bloodline observation room, and so on. Of course, apart from these, there was also a tree.

“It’s growing so slowly!”

Eli looked not far away. In front of the laboratory, a three to a four-meter-tall tree was growing healthily.

Unlike ordinary trees, this tree’s leaves were very green, as if they were translucent. The trunk also emitted a unique aura. Even without approaching it, one could feel that the concentration of elements in its surroundings was much higher than in other places.

This was the sapling that he had obtained from the bryne Empire more than 400 years ago.

After a few hundred years of growth, it had finally grown two to three meters tall.

This was the first time in his life that he had seen a tree grow so slowly.

However, this tree had increased the elemental concentration in the arcane realm by a lot, so Eli had no plans to refine it into a wand for the time being. He would just treat it as a pet.

It was pretty good. After all, it was difficult for normal pets to live that long. It was just that it was a little weird to treat a tree as a pet, so Eli gave it a name, Euktrahill aka ‘Hill’.

“I’m really looking forward to what it’ll be like ten thousand years later.” Eli glanced at the tree before returning to the laboratory.

He was quite interested in both the soul Rune and the soul Blade, and he wanted to see if he could make them today.

..

“I failed!”

A day later, Eli walked out of the laboratory, unsurprised by the results.

Special runes were rare, to begin with, and their difficulty was naturally far greater than ordinary runes. Eli had overestimated his talent, but it didn’t matter. He had plenty of time anyway, so he could take it slow.

It was better to leave the White Tower for now and lie low until he reached his third circle. During this time, he would contact the White Tower through Ross. It had been a long time since he went to the irises, so it was a good time to go back.

...

But this time, he couldn’t go back to Roland.

Roland was only a second-circle mage, and it had been more than 300 years since he first met Tijie. It would be impolite if he were still alive. It would be fine if he were already a third-circle mage, but Roland was still a second-circle mage. This was the reason why he wanted to train Catarina.

If there were no one to take care of the mundane jobs for him, after a few hundred years, no one in the forces would recognize him. How could he work then? After all, sometimes, strength could not settle everything.

“So I’ll use Alex this time.” Eli thought of this old friend.

He was once a Marquis of the kingdom of Byrne and a friend he made when he was young. He believed that he would not mind.

After making his decision, Eli didn’t delay any further. He explained his intentions to Kratos that day and told him to let Ross take over all his work, which Kratos agreed to immediately.

He knew very well that the White Tower couldn’t do without Herman, but Herman could do without the White Tower, so he even thoughtfully prepared a large number of resources for Eli to take away.

On the third day.

Eli left the White Tower with a large number of resources.

He was heading towards the territory of the iris mages.
