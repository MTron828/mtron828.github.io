Chapter 18: Dark Blue Potion

Translator: Lonelytree

“Eli, it’s hunting. That must be very interesting!” Herman said excitedly after she left.

Hunting was actually a small matter, but sneaking into the Count’s family’s banquet would definitely make his father think highly of him, which was the reason why he was so excited.

“Herman, our teacher taught us that no matter what happens, we should stay calm.” Looking at Herman’s slightly red face, Eli reminded him.

Nobles, especially those with low status like the Herman family, would always yearn to go higher. Even if it was just a small opportunity, it was precious to them.

‘Power and reputation?’

Eli sighed in his heart.

In his eyes, fame, fortune, and power were nothing more than lofts built from clouds in the sky. With the wind of time, they would all vanish into thin air, and there was no point in pursuing them.

However, it was obvious that Herman wouldn’t listen to him, so he could only wait for him to return to normal.

“I’m sorry, I was a little too happy just now.” After a while, Herman realized that his behavior was inappropriate and apologized.

“It doesn’t matter!” Eli shook his head, and the two of them continued forward. They separated in a corridor and went to work.

On the first floor of the library, throwing the hunting matter to the back of his mind, Eli put on his work uniform and organized his books while thinking about other more important things.

For example, he could meditate on his spiritual force, learn spells, and conduct extraordinary experiments.

Three years had changed a lot in Eli.

His spiritual power had already reached 6.0, while his physical fitness was at 1.3.

Compared to three years ago, his spiritual power had increased by 1.5, an average increase of 0.5 per year. But in fact, three years ago, the average increase of 0.05 per month during those few months should have been 0.6 per year, but in reality, it was only 0.5.

It wasn’t that Eli didn’t work hard, it was just that as the total amount of his spiritual power increased, the speed of his spiritual Power’s growth was decreasing. Otherwise, his spiritual power should be around 6.3 now.

The improvement in his physical fitness had nothing to do with meditation. It was just that he had been training for the past three years, so his physical fitness had naturally improved.

“The growth of my spiritual power is still too slow.” Although he didn’t really care about the time, this was a dangerous world after all, and it was better to be as strong as possible.

Saleen’s notes had actually recorded quite a few things regarding the improvement of mental power.

There were two main ways. One was to meditate, which was the normal way, and the other was through magic potions.

There was no need to elaborate on meditation, while magic medicine referred to medicine that could stimulate the improvement of mental strength. Saleen’s notes had a formula for mental strength medicine.

The potion was called the dark blue potion. It was a potion for apprentices. It was very effective for Level-1 apprentices and above. It could greatly increase a wizard’s meditation speed.

The effect was very tempting for Eli. He had been preparing to make it some time ago, and everything was ready.

The only problem was that Eli couldn’t find the materials at all.

The ingredients were specialties from another place. In Junlin city, Eli had only encountered a few of them. He had only found a few of the unimportant ingredients.

“Maybe I should find some materials to replace those precious ones?”

Eli was a little hesitant. Although he was envious of the effects of the complete potion, he was in Jun Lin City, and there were many things he could not find. If he could replace some of the ingredients, it seemed like a good choice.

Even if the new potion only had a portion of the original potion’s effects, it was enough to speed up the growth of Eli’s spiritual power.

Of course, this was only one aspect. In fact, increasing one’s strength did not necessarily require the improvement of mental strength. Weapons were also an aspect. If Eli could make a wizard weapon, he could also increase part of his strength. However, similar to the previous situation, he could not find suitable materials.

“As expected, being poor is an important condition that limits the growth of strength.”

Eli didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. However, after thinking for a while, he had already thought of which materials he wanted to use to replace them. He only needed to buy the materials and then conduct the experiment.

And this step required even more money.

After all was said and done, it was still a matter of money.

Although the salary of a librarian wasn’t low, it was still difficult to satisfy all the needs of a Mage. His salary was basically spent on Mage experiments, and now he only had a few dozen silver tars left.

“I wonder if it’s enough?”

Eli pursed his lips and decided to go and take a look after work.

It was already noon by the time he was done with all the work. He packed up and left.

After passing through a few streets, Eli arrived at the market and entered a shop that sold herbs.

...

“If you want all of these, it should be about three gold tarls.”

“What? so expensive?”

After a simple negotiation, Eli knew the approximate price to purchase the materials he was looking for, which was far from what he could afford at the moment.

“Sir, I have to remind you that some of the herbs here are very rare. It’s very difficult to buy them without an acquaintance.” The shopkeeper was a middle-aged man.

“Is that so?”

He didn’t notice that, but it seemed that he wouldn’t be able to buy the materials he wanted this time.

Money was one aspect, but the channels were another.

He couldn’t do anything about money for the time being, but he might have a way to deal with the channel, which was to find Roland.

As mentioned before, Roland had taken over his father’s Chamber of Commerce, and coincidentally, this Chamber of Commerce was in the perfume business as well as some medicinal herbs business.

If Eli didn’t have any channels, Roland definitely did.

“I can only wait until I have enough money and then go to Roland.”

Three golden tarls would be enough to last Eli for many years. It seemed that the potion brewing would be delayed again.

However, since he was at the herb store, there was no reason for him not to buy anything. Hence, Eli bought some materials he needed for the experiment before leaving.

He returned home with the materials.

Entering the underground laboratory, he arranged the materials and began a new day of experiments.

The entire afternoon, Eli spent it in the experiment.

This was also Eli’s daily life.

The main thing was for a wizard to study, conduct experiments, work, and then have fun. Finally, he would learn what scholar Clement wanted him to learn.

Scholar Clement thought that he would spend a lot of time studying the relevant aspects every day. In fact, he would only take a look when he thought of it. Even so, he had already surpassed Clement in terms of mastery of the relevant aspects.

One could only say that this was the power of a wizard.

In some aspects, Wizards were like gods, of course, this was in comparison to ordinary people and Knights.

Soon, seven days had passed.

Eli was invited to the Moore Manor to participate in the hunt.
