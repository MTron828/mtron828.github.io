234 One Hundred and Fifty Years

Time was like water, and it would evaporate inadvertently.

Fifty years later, Eli once again rejected the silver Moon’s request to explore a trench along the endless sea’s coast.

“It’s only grown this little after a hundred years.”

In the secret realm, Eli looked at the big tree in front of him and sighed.

!!

Its huge body occupied an area of the secret plane and attracted the surrounding elements. There were many branches, and the green leaves were floating. The branches swayed freely as if it was a dream.

After a hundred years of growth, it had only grown about 0.6 meters.

“But …”

As Hill grew up, the tree seemed to be gradually changing.

Eli stretched out his hand towards the tree, and a leaf slowly floated into his hand as if he was greeting it, but then quickly retracted it as if he was embarrassed.

“Do you have self-awareness now?” Eli touched his chin and fell into deep thought.

He had thought that it was a tree without intelligence, but it seemed to have awakened its intelligence all of a sudden. It was quite magical, but it was normal. After all, this was not an ordinary tree.

After a few hundred years of growth, it was no joke to say that Hill’s aura was almost at the limit of the first circle. He was not far from the second circle.

“I feel like something interesting will happen after you reach the second ring!”

There was no reason for it, but that was what Eli felt.

“Looks like I need to apply some proper fertilizer!” Eli smiled and returned to the laboratory.

Behind him, Hill’s branches waved as if saying goodbye.

Back at the laboratory.

As per his usual habit, Eli began to organize his current progress.

At this point, his mental power was already at 245 points. With the accumulation of resources from several forces, it could be said that Eli was improving rapidly. Although he had wasted a lot of resources due to his talent, he felt that it was worth it.

The mental power of the third circle was usually from 200 to 500 points. There was a chance to advance after 400 points. Therefore, according to the simple division, it was actually from 360 points to 430 points as the standard for the middle and late stages.

As for why it was at 360 points, it was because there was a small bottleneck near 360 points. Similarly, it was the same at 430 points. A dividing line had begun to appear in the third ring.

Unlike the first and second circles, the third Circle’s increase in the power of the will had a huge impact on Eli. After all, the power of the will directly affects the ability to mobilize the elements in the outside world. Adding the two of them together, he could now mobilize almost 25 times the amount of elements. He was no longer like a third-circle initial stage mage, or even a late stage third-circle mage.

His potion-making skills had improved a little over the years. At the moment, he could make potions that were equivalent to the middle stage of the third circle, but not the late stages. His mechanical alchemy had already reached the late stage of the first circle. Right now, the first lock had already been opened, and there was nothing special about it.

His learning of shadow spells was also progressing steadily. He had achieved the initial integration of shadow and devouring power, and the power of his shadow spells had been greatly improved.

However, there was still no progress in the soul runes and the statue of faith.

As for the others, they were still ordinary.

Of course, many things had happened in the past few years, but they were of no importance to him. To him, when he had one and two circles, they were major events, but now they were minor events.

Eli also realized that it seemed like the lower his strength was, the more trouble he had. He was still rather relaxed now, but he did not relax completely. Who knew if he would suddenly discover something one day?

Perhaps the next Silver Moon gathering would discover a relic!

The possibility was too low.

..

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

This year, everything was peaceful except for one thing.

Rawls’ vitality had reached its limit.

Rawls was undoubtedly a genius, but he was born at the wrong time.

He lived on the barren West Coast, and even in the barren South, he had obtained a second ring bloodline and developed to the limit of a second ring, without relying on anyone else.

To the people of the White Tower, he was the well-respected Deputy Speaker, but to Eli, he was one of his few friends, and perhaps his only friend.

There were very few moments of friendship between warlocks, and Rawls had been fighting with Eli since he was an apprentice. They had never stopped fighting until he advanced to the third circle.

And so, on this day, Eli walked out of the White Tower and went to visit Rawls.

In the ward, Eli saw Rawls, who was now almost all skin and bones. His eyes only had a faint light, and the bloodline in his body had deteriorated to the extreme.

This was what warlocks were like. At the end of their lives, they might become completely different in a few days, so Eli was not surprised.

There were quite a few people in the room, including Ross, who was no longer young. There were also many new Members of Parliament that Eli didn’t know, but when Eli entered, those who knew him all made way for him.

Some of the newbies did not know who Eli was, so they asked the people beside them. When they only got the name, they all lowered their heads. It was only then that they realized that the man before them was the living legend of the White Tower, Herman.

He ignored everyone.

Eli walked forward step by step to the bed.

“I didn’t expect you to be willing to come out!”

As if sensing that Eli was here, Rawls’ eyelids opened with trembling hands, and he looked at Eli with his chaotic eyes.

“Yes, I’m here!”

“Haha, I’ve never been weaker than anyone in my life. Herman, although I’ve always lost to you, I won this time. I beat you to it!” Rawls opened his dry lips and said in a hoarse voice.

Eli was silent.

“Hahahaha!” Rawls laughed, but after a few seconds, he began to cough. It was obvious that laughing was a difficult thing for him now.

“Herman, can you promise me one thing?”

“Speak!”

“I’m dead; however, the Rawls clan that I’ve created can not die. However, they only have one second-circle warlock. Can you do me a favor and look after them for a short while?” Rawls requested.

...

“Sure!” Eli nodded.

It was such a small request. What else could he say?

Everyone looked at each other. This sentence determined that no one would dare to touch Rawls ‘family after his death, and they would even receive the support and help of the White Tower.

“Well, thank you. I’m a little tired. Can I rest for a while? ” Tens of seconds later, Rawls said to the surrounding people.

“Let’s go!” Ross said as he looked at everyone.

The others left in silence. Looking at Rawls’ state, Eli also sighed and turned to leave.

However, the moment he walked out of the door, he suddenly felt the familiar vitality disappearing. He stopped and turned around, only to find that Rawls had already lost his breath.

“Make arrangements!” Eli said to Ross before leaving. He was still a little sad. Another old friend had died over time. It was a pity.

‘I’m a little unhappy today. I haven’t done a human experiment yet, so I’ll get a prisoner.’

..

Rawls’ death in the White Tower had a new wave of influence, and there was a certain change in power, but it had no effect on Eli.

...

Ross also stepped down as a speaker.

The new president was a former second-circle warlock with decent strength and intelligence. Eli didn’t leave any mark on him either. In the face of absolute strength, he wasn’t worried about any accidents.

..

Just like that, another forty-five years passed.

“359 points, but I can’t break through!” Eli felt the mental power in his body and fell into deep thought.

With the help of the bonus period of his recent breakthrough and a large number of resources, the increase in Eli’s mental power was almost the same as when he was at second circle. This allowed him to reach the limit of the third circle early stage in a short time.

Of course, it wasn’t a short time. After all, it had been 150 years.

But at a certain stage, it was difficult for Eli to cross over.

“I need a new potion, a potion that can help me get a breakthrough!”

At this moment, Eli finally felt the shackles of his talent.

In other aspects, he had also finished learning mechanical knowledge. The knowledge he had collected from the black Isotta was only at the level of the first circle. In order to open the next lock, he also needed knowledge of the second circle.

“Looks like I’ll have to go to the silver Moon banquet!”

As a meeting that was held once every 50 years, in addition to the topics, it was also a huge trade fair. He might be able to go there and see if there was anything he needed.

Moreover, a few years ago, there seemed to be more clues about the discovery of the ruins.

Eli didn’t believe it. After all, such clues often were rumors, and they had been spread several times in the past hundred years.

Therefore, the next Silver Moon gathering would most likely be about clearing up an area or something. In any case, Eli would only participate in the first half of the gathering, and the latter half of the events had nothing to do with him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He just wanted to see if he could buy the potion formulas and magic plants.

Furthermore, Hill was already 4.8 meters tall. He was getting closer and closer to the five-meter mark. He was only a step away from the second circle.

He was very curious about what would happen when Hill reached the second ring.

Another four years passed.

Vivika came to visit with a piece of shocking news.

“The ruins have been discovered!”

“What?” Eli was shocked.
