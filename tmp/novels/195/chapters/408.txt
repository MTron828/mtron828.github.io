409 I, Radiant Sun Warlock Eli, Accept the Faithfulness of the Elves

The priest’s tone was calm, but the content left the elven priests dumbfounded.

“Yolanda, are you crazy? Do you think that’s possible?” One of the dark-skinned old elves said.

“Indeed.” The wood elf priest with green ears also spoke.

The other Elven Priests didn’t say anything, but their eyes told them that it was impossible.

!!

Faced with this situation, the Moon Elf Priestess could only say, “The Mages have returned, and the Mother Life Tree has been found!”

In the next second.

She ignored their stunned expressions and cut off the connection.

Putting away the branch, the moon elf priest returned to her seat and smiled at Eli. “Sir, they will be here soon!”

Ely nodded, but he was smiling in his heart. This Moon Elven Priest was also an expert at keeping people in suspense!

Just wait!

The Elven Priests were also faster than Ely had imagined. They only took half an hour.

Bang!

The door of the treehouse was suddenly pushed open, and a faintly glowing light elf walked in.

The priest shouted at the moon elf priest, “Yolanda, what did you mean just now?”

” Let me introduce you. This is Lord Eli. As for the Mother Life Tree, I’ll talk about it when we’re all here! ” the moon elf introduced to the light elf priest.

At this moment, the light elf priest realized that there was another person there. After hearing Yolanda’s introduction, her eyes widened.

” Hello, I’m Eli. ” Eli said to the elf with a faint smile.

“Hello, Lord Mage!” The light elf immediately stood up straight and said respectfully to Eli as if it was a habit.

“There’s no need to be nervous. Sit down first.” Eli said.

The light elf priest nodded and sat on a chair on the other side.

Her eyes glanced at him from time to time, as if he was a little suspicious.

Looking at this scene, the corners of Yolanda’s mouth curled up slightly.

Time slowly passed. Ten minutes later, the door suddenly opened again, and four elves walked in together!

The four elves all looked different. Eli quickly recognized that these elves were all subspecies of the elves: dark elves, wood elves, blood elves, and flower elves!

All of the elves were looking at the Moon Elf Priestess anxiously, completely ignoring the others.

“I’m very happy that everyone is here. Since everyone is here, let me introduce you again.” The moon elf priestess stood up and walked to Elu’s side. She introduced, “This is Sir Eli from the Mage Alliance. He has returned to prepare for the return of the mages. I’ve gathered everyone here to unite the elves once again. At the same time, this is also the request of the Mother Life Tree! ”

The newcomers were also dumbfounded. They looked at Eli in a daze.

Eli also stood up. At the same time, the Celestial Body behind him spread out slightly, emitting a powerful aura.

Hiss!

Seeing the celestial body, the elves who had experienced the mage era all opened their mouths wide, and their bodies subconsciously tensed up.

Celestial Body was the symbol of a Mage!

“My lord!” Along with the light elf priest, a few elf priests instantly lowered their heads and said respectfully.

Eli looked on calmly because this was the etiquette that the other races had to do when facing the mages.

This meant that the few priests still maintained their reverence for the Mages. Or perhaps it was because they had seen the power of the Mages in the past that they retained their fear of the Mages!

“Everyone can relax a little. I’m just the vanguard!” The arrow was already on the bowstring and had no choice but to be fired. Eli was once again the best actor.

A priest looked at Eli and said, “I wonder how long Milord will be staying here? Do you need us to do anything?”

The other priests also raised their heads and looked at Eli!

As for Eli’s identity, they did not doubt him at all. Based on Eli’s aura, it was impossible for a mage of this level to appear in the current world. He could only have returned from outside.

This was because a fourth-circle mage would have died in their current world already. Their life force would burn five to ten times faster.

Those who dared to come back would not stay for long, let alone come looking for them!

” What I need to do is to turn the world around. I’m starting from the Western Regions, but I can’t do this alone. So I need the help of the elves. Of course, I have to unify the elves first. ” Eli said to them.

“This…”

When the Elven Priests heard this, they looked at each other and seemed to be in a difficult position.

” Of course, this is not only my hope but also the hope of His Excellency! ” Eli explained as he took out a green branch!

The branch was not long and looked ordinary, but when it was taken out, the Elven Priests widened their eyes as if there were rolling waves in their eyes.

This was not all. With the appearance of the tree branch, the air gradually rippled, and a scene gradually appeared in front of everyone.

It was a huge valley, and in the valley, boundless life force was being emitted. In the corner of the valley, hundreds of huge trees stood in a forest. In the center, there was a huge tree with countless branches and thousands of green leaves emitting a unique life force.

The tree seemed to have seen these elves, and a voice came from afar.

” Accept the leadership of the Mages and make the elves great again. ”

The voice belonged to Hill, and this temporary image was created by Eli’s power of celestial and Hill’s branch.

As for the words, they were naturally taught by Ell.

At this moment, the elves in front of him were already crying, and their bodies were trembling.

There was no way they were mistaken. The bloodline connection told them that what they saw was the origin of the elves and their protector, the Mother Life Tree!

In the next second, a priest looked at Ely, bowed respectfully, and said humbly, “The Light Elves accept your leadership! ”

...

The other elves did the same.

“The wood elves accept your leadership!”

” The Night Elves accept your leadership! ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

” The Blood Elves accept your leadership! ”

“The Flower Elves accept your leadership!”

At this moment, Yolanda, the moon elf priestess beside Eli, also came to the priests. She looked at Eli and said respectfully, ” The Elf Clan welcomes your return, sir. We accept your leadership! ”

“Dad, how did Hill do?” At this moment, the passageway had not closed yet, and the voices of some people entered Eli’s ears like children asking for praise.

“Well done.”

Eli smiled and sent his words over.

A few seconds later, the passage closed. Eli looked at the elves in front of him and said, ” I, Radiant Sun Mage Eli, accept the allegiance of the elves! “
