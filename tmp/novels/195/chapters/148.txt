149 A New Order

After receiving Kratos’ message, Eli quickly arrived at the mage Tower.

However, when he reached the door, he realized that he wasn’t alone. Rawls and Evena were also there.

“Herman, Rawls, you’ve been called here too.” Evena’s ears perked up in surprise.

“Uh, indeed. It seems like there’s something important.” Rawls nodded and subconsciously glanced at Eli, the guy who was almost equivalent to his superior.

Ever since ten years ago, Eli had been holding Rawls down.

Rawls tried his best; however, he still didn’t change his status. As a result, he had long been numb.

“Don’t think too much. Let’s go in.” Eli said as he looked at the two of them. The people there were all the core figures that Kratos trusted. It seemed like something big had happened.

Walking through the door, he saw Kratos sitting on a chair.

At this moment, he was frowning, as if something was bothering him.

He only relaxed a lot when he saw that it was Eli and the others. He stood up and walked outside as he said, “Let’s talk next door.”

“Alright,” he said. The three of them said in unison and followed Kratos.

Soon, they were brought to another room. As soon as they sat down, they saw Kratos cover the glass and activate several spell formations. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Seeing that Kratos was so cautious, Eli had a bad feeling. Something big might have happened.

“Don’t worry. It’s just that no one else can know about what happened today except you guys.” Kratos shook his head and looked at them.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere was heavy.

“My Lord, just tell me what happened.” The first one to speak was Evena.

“Actually, I only have one purpose for calling you to come here today. The war is about to begin.” Kratos threw a bomb.

“War?”

The three of them looked at each other. Evena let out a cry of surprise. Rawls also stood up immediately. Eli’s pupils also trembled in disbelief.

War?

With whom?

The shadow lizard sorcerer Academy was the only one nearby.

“Boss, what war?” Rawls asked.

“The shadow lizard sorcerer Academy and the blood Alliance.” Kratos answered.

“Everyone knows about the shadow lizard, so I won’t say it. The blood Alliance is another force nearby. They are the ones who are going to attack the Academy this time. They want to take this prosperous area for themselves.”

“Then, boss…?”

At this moment, the three of them already felt that something was wrong.

How did Kratos know that the war was coming? Obviously, it was not the news from the shadow lizard Warlock Academy. Otherwise, how could they not take any action?

“This time, I’m on the side of the Blood Alliance,” Kratos glanced at the three of them and said.

The three of them were at a loss for words.

Kratos laughed when he saw the three of them dumbfounded. However, he quickly calmed down and smiled mysteriously at them.”I’m just joking. We’re on our side.”

?

Before the three of them could come to their senses, they heard Kratos’ puzzling words again.

“Our side?” Eli asked.

“That’s right!” Kratos nodded and looked out of the window. “The blood Alliance knows that I have a missing sister. They told me that as long as I join them, I can get the specific information about her, but they underestimate me too much.”

Kratos’ face gradually became determined. “How can there be such a coincidence? I don’t believe it. They definitely don’t know where she is. If they did, they wouldn’t have just given me vague information.

“Besides, I, Kratos, have always relied on my own strength. Since they want to use me, I will use this chance to use them.

“The two forces were at loggerheads with each other, and I wanted to carve out a path for myself. My teacher and I had planned this for a long time. Since I couldn’t do what I wanted with my own strength, I would have to rely on more people.”

Kratos’ tone became more and more impassioned, and his eyes shone brightly. Eli also seemed to vaguely understand what Kratos wanted to do.

“Rawls, Herman, Evena, do you understand what I’m going to do?” he asked. At this moment, Kratos slowly walked to the chair, sat down, and asked with a smile.

“You want to leave this place?” Rawls frowned.

“Kratos probably wants to gain some benefits from this.” Evena had a different answer.

“Wrong,” Kratos shook his head one by one.

“Kratos probably wants to establish a new power in this chaotic situation.” Eli was also surprised by Kratos’ thoughts.

“hahaha, Herman, as expected of you. You’ve always had your own ideas.” Kratos didn’t deny it this time. He nodded and said, “What I want to do is to establish a new order on the corpse of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.”

Hearing that, Rawls and Evena’s mouths were wide open in shock. Hearing this affirmative answer, even Eli was surprised by Kratos’ courage.

A new force!

A new order!

The three of them took a deep breath. There was too much information to be gleaned from this. After all, establishing a force was not that simple. There were too many things to consider.

“How are the preparations coming along, Sir?” Evena asked carefully.

“It’s almost done.” Kratos nodded and said, “My teacher and I have been planning this for a long time. You don’t have to worry about this. We just have to wait for the war to start. Of course, this is very difficult, and we can’t do it alone. My teacher has a lot of people, but I don’t have many people here. Are you willing to help us? ”

“I’m willing to.” The three of them said in unison. They had already come this far, so there was nothing more to say.

“Then what does Sir need us to do?” Eli asked.

If he really wanted to establish a force, it was very possible for Kratos to call Eli and the others over for a very important matter.

“Yes. There is something.” Kratos nodded.

“The shadow lizard Academy’s forces are deeply rooted here, and it’s hard to create a big chaos by relying on war alone. It’s also difficult for us to take action, so I need you to go to other camps belonging to the shadow lizard academy and create chaos.” Kratos said calmly.

“Create chaos?” The three of them looked at each other and felt that it was a little tricky.

After all, although the shadow lizard Academy did not have any third circle warlocks, it did have the second circle warlocks. If they were discovered, they might face a large number of pursuers, which was not good news.

“Yes. Create enough chaos in the shadow lizard Warlock’s territory, and then I’ll reward you based on your contributions. I’ll even fight for a chance for you to enter the Parliament.” Kratos said calmly. “Oh, I forgot to tell you. When the new force is established, it will be called the White Tower. It will not adopt an ordinary academy structure, but a Parliament system. The Parliament will decide everything. When the time comes, my teacher will become the master of the White Tower, and I will become one of the three Deputy Masters. There will be twelve representatives, and I can nominate three of them.” Kratos looked at them and said.

Needless to say, the council members were the true higher-ups of the White Tower, the kind that held power.

For a moment, except for Eli, the eyes of Evena and Rawls lit up. They were only the ministers of a camp, but the annual benefits were already great, let alone the higher-ups of a warlock force.

That would allow them to achieve a complete leap in class.

On the other hand, Eli was thinking even more. If he could join the upper echelons of a new organization, then many things would be much more convenient than they were now. Furthermore, the organization would also grow. If one day this organization became the master of this area, then wouldn’t it be like Bryne back then? it would become his private land.

Eli made his decision right away. He thought about the mages who had once conquered the endless world, and he had already thought of a good idea.

“Then when will we make the move?” Eli asked.

“Three months later. Get ready.” Kratos looked at the three of them and said.

“I don’t have many people under me, and you’re one of the few that I can fully trust. So, I hope you can work harder. When the time comes, if you can become a representative, it’ll be much easier for me.” Kratos sighed.

“Don’t worry, my Lord. I will definitely work hard.” Rawls immediately guaranteed. Power had always been one of his pursuits.

With that, he looked at Eli with a burning gaze. He couldn’t plant plants better than Eli but he’d be great at creating chaos.

“I’ll try my best.” On the other hand, Evena maintained her modest character.

“Me too,” Eli nodded, and asked another question.

“Then, Sir, where do we go after we do this?” This was also a key question.

“Uh, about that, you guys might need to maintain your destruction work during the war. I guess this war will last for a long time.” Kratos said tactfully.

In other words, their mission was to continue until the end of the war, and they had no time to rest.

However, to establish a new force might take years or even decades, which was very dangerous.

“Understood, “Eli said.

“Sure. If you have any other questions, you can ask me.” Kratos looked at them and smiled.

“Sir, since this is a long-term job, we definitely can’t come back to take resources at any time. Can we take a certain amount of resources when we leave? ” Asked Evena.

Kratos touched his chin and made a decision. “Each of you can take 5000 magic stones of resources. I’ll give you permission to do so.”

As long as he succeeded, he would have more magic stones. Therefore, Kratos was very generous at this moment.

“Alright, I have no more questions.” Evena took a step back.

“I don’t have any, either.” Rawls shook his head as he had many thoughts in his mind, such as sneaking in or other things.

“I don’t have any, either.” It was the same for Eli.

After the discussion was over, Eli and the others gradually left.

Eli walked out of the door, looked at the mage Tower behind him, and sighed.

“Things are about to change.”
