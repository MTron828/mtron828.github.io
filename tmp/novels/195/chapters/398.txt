399 Slaughter

Boom!

In the next second, a black light streaked across the sky. A Radiant Moon Warlock instantly melted in the black light and disappeared before everyone’s eyes.

After the Shadow Dragon’s breath killed the Warlock, it did not stop. Instead, it flew straight toward the ground and landed a few kilometers away from the battlefield. With a bang, a huge mountain disappeared on the spot, accompanied by a huge mushroom cloud!

In the sky, all the celestials looked at this scene in a daze.

!!

At this moment, Eli also flew out from the clouds and calmly looked at the remaining people.

Gulp!

The Warlocks of the Akasha Family were all dumbfounded. They could only stare blankly at Eli.

Their battle had yet to begin, but their patriarch was already unconscious, and two Radiant Moon Warlocks had died.

What the hell was this?

The celestials looked at Eli and retreated silently.

As for the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower, they all looked at Eli silently.

Greem’s old eyes widened as he stared at Eli as if he was asking him how much strength he had hidden.

Lobelia covered her mouth and wagged her tail. Her heart was in turmoil.

“Did Lord Conilla ask me to come and support Eli? It doesn’t seem necessary!” The Warlocks of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association were also stunned.

He was already prepared to get injured there, but this happened?

One peak Radiant Moon, two full Radiant Moons, and one Radiant Moon were dealt with in less than thirty seconds. Did they need their support?

He even felt that Eli alone was enough to handle this himself.

Selona looked pleased with himself. “I told you that my lord is very strong!”

The other Warlocks of the Amina Family looked at Selona with admiration.

As expected of the family head, his ability to find a background was superb!

As for the other Warlocks, they looked at each other and even felt that they were redundant.

All the celestials felt immense pressure as they looked at Eli.

“Run!”

On the other side, the Warlocks of the Akasha Family had completely realized that this was not an opponent they could deal with. One of the Warlocks shouted.

In the next second, dozens of big shots flew straight to the ground, almost using up all their strength.

At the same time, a huge shadow dragon chased after him.

…

At this moment, the battlefield on the ground had almost come to a standstill!

At the center of the battlefield were three huge pits, and the three members of the Akasha family were inside.

More than ten seconds ago, everyone watched as the huge bloodline avatars fell. Then, they turned into three people.

” How is that possible? That’s the family head! ” Beside a large pit, a Warlock covered in blood was half-kneeling on the ground, his face blank.

He looked at the unconscious figure in the pit and could not believe it.

They were already at a disadvantage in the battle against the Bloodline Tower, and everyone was hoping for the celestials to win. However, their lords lost even more than them. This was too ridiculous!

The other Warlocks of the Akasha Family did not know what to say!

” Everyone, don’t give up. The other lords are still fighting. It’s not like we have no hope! ”

Suddenly, an Akasha Warlock shouted!

The eyes of the others lit up.

That’s right, they had a total of fifteen celestials!

“Wait. Look at that.”

Suddenly, a Warlock from the Bloodline Tower gestured for them to raise their heads.

The puzzled Akasha Warlocks raised their heads.

In the sky, dozens of figures flew toward the ground as if they were fleeing for their lives. Behind them was a huge shadow dragon.

The shadow dragon was even faster. In the blink of an eye, it caught up to a celestial and grabbed his head, crushing it!

With a bang, a celestial died instantly, and his body instantly lost consciousness and fell to the ground.

And this was just the beginning.

Everyone only saw the huge shadow dragon sweep past one celestial after another, and one celestial after another died instantly.

The glow in the heart of the Akasha Family Warlock slowly disappeared.

Seeing the shadow dragons slaughtering the celestials like chickens, they closed their eyes and couldn’t bear to watch.

Their heart turned cold.

How was this a battle? This was clearly a massacre!

They were on completely different levels.

At this moment, the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower were also staring blankly at this scene. Most of the Warlocks knew that Eli had fused with some kind of dragon bloodline.

They had only seen Eli fight in Bloodline City, and at that time, Eli killed Jalin with lightning speed.

However, the shock that day and today brought to everyone was completely incomparable.

...

Jalin was only a waning Radiant Moon.

But today, the peak Radiant Moon and two full moon celestials were already dead.

In the sky, there were many Radiant Moons as well, but under Eli’s attack, they were all the same because they all died in an instant. Not a single Warlock could resist, or rather, they had already lost the courage to resist!

The celestials of the Bloodline Tower slowly descended from the sky and watched this scene silently.

At this moment, they did not know what to say.

” I seem to understand how Pavao died! ” Lobelia sighed.

“And I really feel that my presence here is a little unnecessary.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

They had never felt so superfluous before.

“There are still three celestials left!” Glen suddenly said. Only then did everyone realize that only nine of the twelve enemy celestials had died. On the ground, there were only nine pits.

“Eh, Pavao has awakened!” At this moment, a silent Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce celestial suddenly spoke.

...

Only then did everyone realize that Pavao had woken up.

At this moment, he struggled to fly up from the deep pit and shouted at the camp in the distance, “Sir Ma Mu, please help!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At this moment, there was blood on his chest, and his breath had short, but he still shouted with all his strength.

The three remaining celestials in the sky also perked up when they heard the voice, and they all shouted, “Lord Ma Mu, please help!”

They shouted without any regard for their own safety, their voices echoing throughout the battlefield.

They understood that it was their last hope and their only hope to turn the tables.

At this moment, it was not just the celestials. Even the other Akasha Warlocks were in despair, but a glimmer of light once again lit up in their hearts.

That’s right!

They still had the powerful battle support of the Radiant Sun warlock!

“Lord Ma Mu, please help!”

All the remaining Warlocks of the Akasha family shouted loudly. Their voices echoed across the battlefield, shaking the heavens and earth!

Although it seemed like a long time had passed, it was actually less than a minute since the battle began.
