319 Lifting the Curse

In front of the villa, as the celestial walked out, the others all gathered around.

The celestial only glanced at the crowd and said calmly, ” the curse has already penetrated deep into his bloodline. I’ve tried to use the power of my bloodline to remove it, but it’s of little use!”

After everyone heard this, they sighed.

One of the men, who was dressed in luxurious clothes, walked out and said, “Sir, since it has come to this, I have decided to give up on Jin Ji.”

!!

His face was long and narrow, and his eyes shone with the shrewdness of a businessman.”We’ve already found out that the person who cursed Jin Ji is from an enemy force, and we’ve already taken revenge. Now that we’ve used all kinds of means and Lord is here, I think we should give up on Jin Ji.

“In fact, we’ve already done all we can for the past ten years!”

“Yes!”

The celestial Warlock closed his eyes and nodded after a few seconds.

What a pity, such a good seedling.

He shook his head. From the corner of his eye, he saw a man swaying his body, trembling through the crowd, and walking towards the open door of the villa.

The others also noticed this man.

“Isn’t this Collina? I haven’t seen him in a long time.” A Warlock said to him.

“The limit of the third circle!” The celestial also glanced at him. Although he was not young, he still had a chance to break through to the true spirit realm. Jin Ji actually had such a subordinate.

But from what others said, he had already disappeared for more than ten years.

“Collina?”

The Warlock in luxurious clothes also glanced at him.

No matter what he came back for at this time, it was meaningless.

It was too late.

..

Collina walked into the villa, trembling.

The villa was very large and was divided into two floors. The decorations were gorgeous. There was nothing on the first floor and the second floor. It was empty and quiet.

Collina’s throat moved slightly. His body was almost stiff as he walked in. He went up the stairs and came to the bedroom on the second floor. It was Jin ji’s bedroom.

“My Lord, please don’t die!”

He didn’t even have the courage to open the door, but suddenly, a coughing sound came from inside. The sound was weak and powerless, but his eyes lit up. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His lord was still alive.

He immediately opened the door, and a foul smell filled with the smell of blood came out.

Collina sniffed and looked inside.

On the big bed inside, Jin Ji was weakly lying on it with his eyes closed and his skin exposed. His whole body seemed to have been sucked dry, and his skin was almost sticking to his bones. There were also black marks all over it, and they were still wriggling.

“Lord Jin Ji!” Collina couldn’t imagine how much his lordship had been tortured by the curse over the years to become like this.

He slowly walked forward, his boots making a soft sound as they stepped on the ground.

Fortunately, Jin Ji heard a sound and opened his eyes.

However, one could see that his eyes were turbid and powerless, like an old man in his twilight years.

“Collina!” Seeing that it was Collina, Jin ji’s eyes were still emotionless, as if he didn’t care why Collina had returned after ten years!

“My Lord!” Collina came to the bed.

“Have you delivered the item to master Herman?” Jin Ji asked weakly.

“I’ve delivered it, but my Lord, you …”

Collina didn’t expect that, at this time, Lord Jin ji would be concerned about whether the item had been delivered.

“That’s good.” Hearing the answer, Jin Ji seemed to relax a little. He continued, “I can’t hold on much longer. The curse is already very deep in my body.

“It’s a pity that I can’t do anything for you anymore.”

Collina didn’t say anything as he looked at Jin ji.

He stretched out his right hand, and his fingertips slowly extended toward his stomach. His skin was torn apart, and he reached a few centimeters in. Then, he began to search.

A few seconds later, he reached out his hand, but his clothes were completely dyed red with blood. In his hand was a crystal, a black crystal.

He silently placed the crystal on Jin Ji’s bare skin.

“Collina, don’t waste your energy. The celestial Warlock has already tried!” Feeling the cold touch, Jin Ji forced a smile and immediately spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood.

“master Herman gave this to me. He said it would help you.” Collina said.

“Sir Herman?” Jin Ji’s eyes were filled with surprise.

However, he still shook his head. This was a curse, and even Sir Herman couldn’t help him.

Collina didn’t say anything and just looked at the crystal. The crystal didn’t seem to change at all, which made his expression gradually turn gloomy and a little disappointed.

“So it’s useless?” He sighed.

Jin Ji didn’t say anything. He had tried many things in the past ten years, but if a cure had been out there, he wouldn’t have ended up like this.

The two of them were silent.

Suddenly, Jin Ji exclaimed.

He lowered his head and saw that the crystal was slowly melting. The black shadow inside was slowly surging out and drilling into his skin, entering his body.

“Ah!”

...

The next second, he let out a howl.

As soon as the shadow entered his body, he felt as if it was a wild beast. Then, it began to surge in his body, and a strong feeling of devouring emerged.

The shadow was devouring his curse.

How could this be possible?

Jin Ji howled in pain, but he was extremely shocked.

Collina also noticed the change, and his eyes widened.

What had happened?

Suddenly, he heard footsteps coming from the side.

Collina turned around and found that the celestial he had seen earlier and the other high-level executives of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce had all come into the room. The celestial, in particular, was staring at Jin Ji. It was obvious that they had heard the sound and entered.

“My Lord, this is?” The gorgeously dressed Warlock said to the celestial warlock.

“I don’t know, but I can feel that the curse in Jin Ji’s body is disappearing rapidly!” The celestial was also shocked.

...

What was going on? Why was the curse starting to disappear?

Hearing his words, the others were also shocked.

The group of people stared at Jin Ji, who was howling.

At this moment, a layer of black shadow gradually covered Jin Ji’s skin. Within it, one could faintly see traces of a curse. It was very terrifying.

The shadow absorbed the curse.

As time passed, Jin Ji’s voice grew louder and louder, but everyone could sense that Jin Ji’s injured body was gradually recovering. The curse was really disappearing bit by bit.

Very quickly, ten minutes had passed.

At this time, Jin Ji had already fallen into a coma, but his body was a healthy red color as if he had completely recovered. At this time, little shadows emerged from his skin and gathered together. Even if everyone only observed it, they could feel that this shadow contained something bad!

“What is this?” The celestial warlock seemed to want to touch it, but he only saw a slight fluctuation in the air, and a dimensional crack appeared. Then, the shadow directly entered it and disappeared from his sight!

Did it run away?

He was stunned.

But the others were more concerned about Jin Ji. A Warlock immediately came to the bed and checked unconscious Jin Ji. Everyone looked at him.

A few minutes later, the Warlock raised his head and said to the crowd, “Lord Jin Ji has completely recovered, but his bloodline is a little weak and needs to be replenished!”

Hearing this, everyone sucked in a cold breath.

They still didn’t understand what had happened!

The celestial warlock couldn’t help Jin Ji, but suddenly, he was saved?

What on earth happened?

“Alright!” At the side, Collina directly collapsed onto the ground, feeling much more relaxed. In his heart, he was filled with admiration for Eli. It had actually worked.

“My Lord, this is?” The gorgeous Warlock asked the celestial warlock.

“I’m afraid that there are other celestial forces supporting this little fellow!” The celestial said after a moment of thought.

Jin Ji was one of the core futures of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce and had other celestials behind him. He wondered if this was a good thing.

The Warlock’s eyes widened as if he had not expected this. After a few seconds, he asked tentatively, “Then, Sir, how should we deal with him?”

“How should we deal with him? He’s the Golden cicada of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. He has a chance to become president. Do you understand? ” The celestial only glanced at him, then turned around and left the room, leaving the crowd to look at each other.

‘Looks like I’ll have to take care of him more in the future. He has a celestial behind him!’

The Warlock in a gorgeous robe was the person in charge of the Western Region. At this time, he also silently thought in his heart, ‘with the support of a celestial, that’s not an ordinary bargaining chip!’

He would have the chance to become president in the future!

He had to take care of Jin Ji.

At this moment, the eyes of the other high-level officials of the Western Region also flashed with inexplicable light.

There were actually quite a few golden cicadas, but at this moment, they all placed Jin Ji in a more important position.

Not only did Eli save Jin Ji, but he also changed Jin Ji’s position and situation in the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce without him knowing.

However, the others were more curious about what kind of bloodline could remove the curse.

This wasn’t something a Warlock should be able to do.
