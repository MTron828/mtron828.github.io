488 A Stone Causing Thousands of Waves

Hundreds of thousands of eyes were focused on Eli, and everyone’s hearts seemed to be in turmoil.

“All dead? Those were six half-step celestial warlocks. How could they die so easily?”

” A little too much.”

” The twist today is too ridiculous. I thought that there would be six people ambushing one person, but I didn’t expect that it would be one person ambushing six people. The identity of the prey and the hunter has been swapped!”

“He won just like that?”

“We lost?”

No matter which side it was, they all looked at each other, their eyes filled with fascinating thoughts.

Everything that happened today was truly shocking and astounding. Before the battle, not many people thought that Eli would win, but now, the corpses on the ground still showed that Eli had won!

He was fighting against six people of the same level. They were not low-level, but six half-step fifth circle Warlocks who had a preliminary understanding of the laws. They were all powerful Warlocks in the current world.

Was Eli that strong? Then why have you been hiding? What the hell?

“Hiss, what kind of state is this? It’s at least several times stronger than a pure bloodline avatar. Is this Sir’s experiment?” Nikola’s throat moved slightly. He was shocked when he saw those half-step fifth circle warlocks who had died.

He had never seen such a powerful half-step fifth circle warlock before, let alone in the current world. No, it seemed like Daren had not broken through to the half-step fifth circle stage yet.

Hiss!

“That’s right, My Lord hasn’t broken through to half-step fifth circle stage!” Nikola’s pupils trembled as he remembered that Eli was still at the peak of the Radiant Sun!

It was already ridiculous enough for a peak Radiant Sun to fight against a half-step fifth-circle warlock. However, today, he had fought against six half-step fifth circle warlocks and won easily. Even in the history of mages, such a thing had never happened.

“As expected of my lord.” Nikola sighed and shook his head.

After witnessing the legendary history of Eli, he didn’t think that he would be surprised anymore. However, today, His Lord had once again shattered his understanding.

How terrifying!

“Just…This way… We won?” Vivika blinked her eyes in shock.

She was stunned.

She knew that Eli was strong, but she didn’t know that he was this strong.

“But… This is good too. Brother Eli is fine!” Tears suddenly appeared in the corner of Vivika’s eyes. She felt relieved and much more at ease.

In the distance.

“Damn it, this is definitely big news that will shake the Central Region. The situation in the Western Region is about to change.”

” F * ck, luckily I didn’t leave. Could it be that some idiot has already sent back the news of Eli’s death? Hahahaha!”

“But to be honest, this Eli is simply inhuman. He fought six people of the same level alone. He’s really strong!”

A group of Warlocks from other regions sighed as they quickly wrote down the details of the war and sent them back to their respective families and forces. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

No matter what, today’s battle would change the attitudes of everyone towards the Bloodline Tower, the Western Regions, and even the entire world!

The Western Regions was about to change!

As for the outcome of this war, there was naturally no suspense.

The city was broken, the half-step fifth circle warlocks from the Heart of the Abyss were dead, but Eli was still alive!

..

As the various factions sent the news back, the Western Regions naturally received the news immediately.

Charm Mansion.

Liliana was in a room with her teacher, Lobelia.

Lobelia was drinking tea while Liliana was sitting across from her. She looked anxious, and her eyes were bloodshot.

“Teacher, please let me leave.” Liliana pleaded.

“No, this war has no suspense. I can’t push you into the fire pit. You can go to the central region to develop in three days.” Lobelia shook her head. Her tone was unquestionable.

A few minutes ago, their people outside the battlefield had sent back information.

Six half-step fifth-circle warlocks surrounded Eli!

The moment she received the message, she immediately restricted Liliana’s movements because she knew that if she did not restrict her, she would definitely cause trouble.

Besides, she didn’t think that there was any hope for Eli. In order not to cause any trouble, she planned to send her away as soon as possible. As the person in charge of the Charm Mansion in the Western Region, she still had the right to do so.

“Teacher, please let me go.” Liliana gritted her teeth. Her body was trembling, and her eyes were wet.

” You’re close to Eli. If he dies, the Heart of the Abyss won’t let you off. It’s better to leave this place for now and pretend that nothing happened.” Lobelia shook her head and hugged Liliana.

There was a low sob, and Liliana was crying.

Pa, pa, pa!

Suddenly, there was a series of hurried knocks on the door.

Lobelia was displeased, but she knew that the news was definitely very important at this time.

“Come in.”

The door opened, and a Warlock quickly walked in. He came to Lobelia’s side and whispered something. Lobelia’s expression gradually became dull.

“Teacher, what’s wrong? Is there a turning point in the war?” Liliana looked up with bloodshot eyes.

” A turning point appeared!” Lobelia’s throat moved slightly. She looked down at Liliana and said, “I’m afraid that the position of the person in charge of the western region of the Charm Mansion will be yours in the future!”

“What? You mean…” Liliana looked at the teacher.

“Eli didn’t die. He survived the siege of six half-step fifth circle warlocks and killed six of them by himself.” Lobelia shook her head, her eyes full of shock.

For the first time, she felt a little jealous as she looked at her romantic student.

She should have done it herself back then.

Unfortunately, it was too late.

“Ah, I knew it. Lord Eli won’t lose.” Liliana wiped her tears and smiled.

..

The Amina Family!

In the temple, Selona sat in the main seat with a frosty expression. The Warlocks of the Amina family below also had serious expressions.

They were all waiting, waiting for a result.

As the first force to join the Bloodline Tower, they were bound together with the Bloodline Tower. If Eli failed, their family would be finished.

Therefore, they were all waiting.

Bang!

With a bang, the door not far away was suddenly opened. An anxious Warlock ran as he shouted, “In Rolle City, Sir Eli was surrounded by six half-step five-ringed people. Then, then, then…”

“Then what?”

A figure appeared in an instant. Selona steadied the Warlock with an anxious expression.

The others also had ugly expressions on their faces.

Six half-step fifth-circle warlocks. Did he fail?

“Then, Sir Eli killed six half-step fifth circle warlocks and destroyed Rolle City!” The Warlock gasped and shouted.

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone’s mouths were wide open, and their eyes were filled with excitement.

“We won.”

“His Lord didn’t lose, His Lord won.”

Serona waved his arms fiercely, not caring about the dignity of a patriarch!

..

Hiss!

At the same time, Jin Ji sucked in a breath of cold air and put down the first-hand information he had just received!

He won?

” Six half-step fifth circle warlocks? He won?” Jin Ji felt his body tremble.

There was no doubt that he had won the bet this time, and it was a big win.

“But… Eli, how strong are you?” He took a deep breath and looked out the window.

Outside the window, the sunset was bloody.

It was exceptionally beautiful.
