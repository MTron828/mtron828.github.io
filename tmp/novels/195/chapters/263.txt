264 Silver Eye

Two warlocks walked into the tent.

The tall one was wearing a Black Wizard robe, while the short one was wearing a gray wizard robe. There were hourglasses all over their robes, and they had third circles.

“Two Lords of the hourglass, how are you?”

Woox stood up when he saw them.

“Woox, I heard that your situation hasn’t been good recently.”

The tall Warlock said arrogantly as soon as he entered.

“It’s alright!” Woox chuckled.

“Oh, really? But why did I hear that the heart of darkness has already beaten you guys to a pulp?” The chunky Warlock raised his head and looked at Woox, saying, “How about it? If you consider joining us, we can send more people to help you.

“After all, even though you’re doing well in the central continent, I’ve heard that the Holy tower’s situation isn’t too good. However, it won’t be difficult for us to destroy the heart of darkness on the west coast.”

“Uh, I’m sorry. I grew up in the Holy tower, and I have deep feelings for the Holy tower!” Woox shook his head.

Looking at the two people in front of him, he felt a headache and numbness.

The two of them were sent by the hourglass to communicate with him, but they had been secretly persuading him to join them. As for the reason, he guessed that it was the hourglass or they wanted to return in a low-key manner. They first had to use a certain organization as a disguise and gradually returned to the main area of the West Coast.

But how could he agree to that?

“Alright, I hope you’ll still think that way in the future.” The Thin Man shook his head. “Sergei is very strong. I haven’t seen such a powerful third circle limit warlock in a long time. You guys are no match for him.

“You don’t need to worry about that!” Woox frowned.

“It doesn’t matter. Our offer still holds.” The fat Warlock laughed.

“There’s also Herman, who’s the closest to you, and Sergei. It might be difficult for you to fight them, but it’s not a big problem for the hourglass.”

Woox’s face turned pale.

“Alright, we should get going!”

The two warlocks looked at his pale expression, smiled, and turned to leave.

“Oh, let me remind you. If you lose the war, you may be able to escape, but what about your family? They won’t be able to escape.”

Suddenly, the thin and tall Warlock turned his head and said to Woox.

“I don’t need you to remind me.” Woox closed his eyes and said, after a few seconds.

“Alright, it’s good that you know.” The Warlock laughed, and the two of them left.

With Sergei, although heart of darkness had failed, the Holy tower’s chances of winning were still low. Moreover, there was still the legacy of his family, and Woox would agree to their request sooner or later.

It was only that Warlock called Herman that made them want to grind their teeth.

With this ruckus, their return would take another few decades.

“I’m close to Class 3.”

In the bloodline tower, Eli felt the changes in his talent.

It had gone from a beginner level four. Although it did not reach level three, it was normal. After all, there were only four elemental hearts fish this time. Moreover, he had become resistant to them after being used for a long time.

To be able to raise it to this level was already a pleasant surprise.

“And I can use about 65 times more elements.”

The improvement in his talent had brought a new round of improvement to Eli’s strength. It would probably be easier for him to defeat that group of warlocks at this moment. He could even easily kill ordinary late-stage limit-level third circle warlocks.

As for Sergei … Let’s shake the dice.

The Golden die was thrown out, and it kept spinning on the ground before it stopped.

Five points!

“is Sergei that strong? ” Eli hissed.

Generally speaking, a knowledgeable mage could defeat a warlock of the same level, so he was able to defeat a warlock 70 to 75 times stronger than himself. It seemed that Sergei was at least 70 times stronger than himself!

As expected of the leader of the heart of darkness!

He was very strong, and his bloodline was probably not simple.

“That’s why it’s better to play safe and not fight people of the same level.” In the end, Eli decided to stick to his rule of bullying the weak and wait until he got stronger before he went to fight Sergei.

He probably didn’t have the time to care about him now.

After all, the impact of losing dozens of 3-circle warlocks at once wasn’t something that could be described with simple numbers. At the very least, the heart of darkness would be in chaos for a few years.

As for Eli, he would run back to the iris.

“Next up is the silver eye.”

Eli took out the book and started reading.

The silver Eye was a special type of sorcery that required the branding of special spiritual runes in the eye. It was very difficult, but it was still possible for Eli.

With the passage of time and the growth of his mental strength, his perception was now stronger than before. Even if it were a spell of this difficulty, it wouldn’t take long.

Three days later.

Eli took a deep breath.

His eyes suddenly opened and emitted a bright light. In his eyes, there were streams of mental power flowing and changing. Special runes were rotating in his eyes, which was extremely magical!

And under Eli’s control, a special rune slowly appeared.

It was a round rune, silver in color.

...

At this moment, it was surrounding his pupils as if there was an additional layer. Light bloomed, and a burst of mental power burst forth. The initial integration of the silver eye had been completed.

“It’s almost time!”

Eli slowly closed his eyes, and suddenly, he opened them again, but his eyes were filled with big surprise.

This was because he felt that as the second-circle spell model in his mind, the eye of truth, started to move toward the silver Eye.

In the blink of an eye, the solidified spell had disappeared, leaving only the silver-white eye that bloomed with silver-white light.

“What’s going on?” Eli was shocked!

Although the 2nd-circle solidified spell, eye of truth, was not very useful in battle, it was still very useful in experiments and research. If he lost it, it would be troublesome!

However, he soon realized that the eye of truth had not disappeared but had instead fused with the silver eye!

“what? ” Eli had a strange expression.

He did not know why this had happened, but it did not seem to be a bad thing.

The two pupillary abilities had some overlap, so it was good that they were fused. Moreover, the eyes after the fusion seemed to have the characteristics of the two, tracking and analysis!

...

“Interesting.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face. Furthermore, this eye-bloodline technique also had an offensive effect!

He focused his consciousness, and a thin needle-like mental power quickly condensed and was released through the silver Eye. It quickly penetrated a flying insect not far away!

“the speed is three times faster than usual, and the power and quality have also improved.” Eli sensed this change. At the same time, he felt a trace of his own life force flowing into his eyes. At that moment, his power was slightly stronger than before.

It really was a forbidden spell!

“It’s ridiculous that the spell is able to survive until now. However, it’s quite suitable for me.” Eli sighed.

After so many years of searching, he had not been able to find a forbidden spell that was suitable for him. He did not expect to have an unexpected harvest today. He could only say that this day was destined!

From now on, he would use it every day to see if he could push this spell to a higher level.

Anyway, life force wasn’t valuable.
