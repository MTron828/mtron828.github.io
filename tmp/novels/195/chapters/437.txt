438 The Dragon Clan and the Dwarf Clan

Elven Temple.

Eli lowered his head and looked at the dozens of non-humankind leaders. He took a deep breath and said, “Since that’s the case, all the clan leaders will stay here for the time being. Let’s discuss our future development and how we will connect the various clans in the future. After all, all of you can be considered one now!”

“Yes, sir!”

The chiefs nodded. Indeed, many of them were enemies in the past, but now it was time to end it. Feather King let out a long sigh of relief and relaxed his eyes. Fortunately, his lord was easy to talk to. Their Feathermen Race had finally escaped this disaster.

“But … The situation in Green Field is about to change completely!” The Feather King raised his head and looked at Eli, who was on the temple, with a myriad of emotions!

However, it was still good. At least for now, this was more beneficial than harmful to them. The only thing was that the races in the core area would probably be unable to accept this!

“Races like dragons, dwarves”

…..

The core area!

The sunlight shone into a lake, creating a sparkling light.

At the edge of the lake, a huge red dragon stood at the side. Its huge body was hundreds of meters long, and its huge wings were folded. Its body was covered in red scales, and its red dragon eyes were looking at the lake.

“Blue Dragon, something big has happened in Green Field recently. I think I need to tell you. ”

The roaring sound spread throughout the entire lake, and the surface of the water suddenly began to tremble. Then, a similarly huge creature slowly rose from the water. A huge blue dragon drilled into the water, and its blue eyes looked at the red dragon.” Ortiz, what happened? ”

“The Mages are back!” Red Dragon Ortiz said calmly.

“What?”

The surface of the water suddenly exploded, turning into countless splashes. A blue dragon suddenly left the water, its eyes wide open.

“You must be joking!”

“No, in fact, it has been circulating for a long time, but it has never been confirmed. It was only recently that the Feathermen Race made a move and finally found out that it was indeed a mage.

“Moreover, that Mage claimed to be a mage who had returned from the mage Alliance with the mission of leading the way for the main force. Dozens of races have already announced their return to the embrace of the mage Alliance, almost one-third of the Green Field, except for the core area, has already fallen into his control!” Ortiz’s body was burning with faint flames, which also showed that he was not calm at the moment.

“What do you think we should do? As the strongest race in the green field, what do you think we should do?” He continued to ask.

” My lord is asleep. The dragon race is indeed under our control, but I think it’s best if we don’t do anything. Let that Mage do it. We should ignore him for the time being. This should be our best choice. Who knows, there might be an idiot who will scout the way for us! ” Blue Dragon said.

“That’s not good.” The Red Dragon did not agree!

” Just like how you died a few hundred years ago. You were caught on your way back and had hundreds of liters of blood drawn! ”

Hearing this, the red dragon’s body suddenly froze and stopped talking.

This was his dark history.

That day, he was flying properly and was about to cross the West Coast to return to the Green Field. In the end, he was knocked unconscious by a staff and had his blood drawn.

“Alright then.” The Red Dragon Ortiz immediately agreed this time. He didn’t want to talk about it anymore!

…..

In another direction in the core area.

From the sky, a large piece of black stone land suddenly appeared in the forest. There was a huge pit in the middle of the pit. The pit was a few kilometers wide, and there were dwarves urging the orcs to move the ores before they were moved to another volcanic area.

In the volcano, only the sound of tapping could be heard. This was the forging of thousands of dwarves. As the dwarves who inherited the mage’s alchemy and mechanics, the forging had long been imprinted on their souls. Even Sky City back then was mostly due to their contributions.

Even the legendary Gray Wizard Tower was built with their help.

At this moment, in a rough black stone palace, the tall and strong Dwarf King frowned and looked down at the dwarves in front of him.

“A mage?” The Dwarf King frowned and pondered!

He had never thought that he would hear this familiar name again in his life. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After thinking for half a minute, he slowly said, “Then ignore them. Although I miss the time when I built those great creations, the times are different. A mage can’t do much, nor can he give me any magnificent creations. If he can find the legendary Gray Wizard Tower, maybe I’ll be interested in helping him see and repair it!

“After all, that is the legendary great Magus Tower that can destroy an entire world with one blow!”

The other dwarves nodded in agreement. The dwarves were only interested in construction. Even in the mage era, it was not the mages who conquered them, they were only interested in the mages’ creations.

However, the current human world was no longer worthy!

Unless that Mage Tower reappeared, they might not leave this place!

Just as the Dwarf King shook his head and made his decision, the other races in the core area also decided to stay put. No one was willing to be the first to do so!

…..

Another week passed in the blink of an eye.

A week later.

The matters regarding the alliance of the various races and future matters were also concluded in the Elven Temple. Finally, the various races were temporarily under the control of the Elven Race, and Elven Queen Erwin would be the highest commander of the race other than Eli. As for Eli’s clone, it would be weakened and left here!

Eli walked out of Ivan’s room and looked at the large open space not far away from the treehouse.

At this moment, the ground had already turned into a flat stone floor. On the ground, there was a complicated spell formation that was emitting a silver light. There were many high-level energy cores embedded around it. They were condensed from high-level magic crystals and were the source of energy for this spatial teleportation formation.

“Sir, the spatial array has been built, and the elf race’s potion system has been basically built. Next, we need a large number of magical plants.” A clear voice came from beside him. Eli turned around and saw Erwin in a white muslin robe!

” Yes, the spell formation on the Bloodline Tower’s side is almost complete. After that, there will be an endless stream of potions and resources! ”

Eli said with a smile. He was naturally very concerned about this system that could continuously generate money for him. Moreover, he had already instructed Glen to open the pre-sales of the potion and start harvesting wealth in advance!

“Yes, we’ll follow your arrangements!” Erwin naturally leaned over, and Eli remained calm.

He wouldn’t deliberately stop some things, but he definitely wouldn’t push things either.

He was trying new things, just like with the Mermaid Queen.

” There doesn’t seem to be much to do next. Next, it’s about sorting out the things I learned before, sealing spells, and purification runes, then steadily refining potions to level up, as well as searching for knowledge to break through to the fifth circle. ” Eli was thinking about what to do next.

...

Leveling up was naturally the most important. He had the potion now, and he had only just entered the Sun Crown state. He was still too weak.

After all, things seemed to be stable now, but Eli felt as if the entire world was in turmoil. There were races in the core region of the green fields, and the other regions in the central continent, and Eli had never let down his guard against the Heart of the Abyss!

Something might happen in the future!

From the day he couldn’t see through Tuman, Eli had a bad feeling. After Tuman left the mountain range, he found a large number of wild magic beasts that had been slaughtered!

Of course, Eli also agreed to explore the world fragment in 30 years!

A stronger power would bring more gains and security, not to mention that Eli was also quite interested in that civilization, that terrifying civilization that almost destroyed the mage World!

The second thing was to search for knowledge and materials for the fifth circle. He would reach the fifth circle sooner or later, but the knowledge had not been found yet, which made him very anxious.

After all, it was a sudden breakthrough, but he had to have a direction first. If he didn’t have any info when he reached the peak of Radiant Sun, he really didn’t know what to do next.

The third was to digest the things he had in the past. Ever since he came to the Central Mainland, he had stopped for twenty years. There were still many things he had not studied!

He had calculated that he would start at least three experiments. They were the sealing technique, the purification rune, and the blood bamboo flower.

He planned to let Hill try and see if he could cultivate the blood bamboo to the fourth circle. At least for Eli, this would be a great experiment. Perhaps it would be of great help to Eli in the future. Of course, this would take time!

...

“I want to become stronger. The future is too uncertain otherwise!” Eli’s gaze was determined!

Although he had plenty of time, there were too many unknowns.

Erwin, who was beside him, also followed Eli’s gaze and looked into the distance. She was filled with emotions!

…

Just as Eli was thinking!

The Central Continent, which was located far away from the Western Regions!

The two huge Sky Cloud Whales were tied with long black chains, and the chains extended behind them, pulling a sky-floating island.

Below the island was a magnificent building. The ground was made of precious Black Heart Rock, and the buildings were mixed with gold powder. There were also statues made of elemental crystals on the island, and the lighting was a rare high-grade alchemy lamp. It looked extremely luxurious!

At this moment, in a building in the center.

Jin Ji was standing next to the president of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, who looked like a sturdy old man.

At this moment, the old man suddenly spoke up. ” Jin Ji, speaking of which, you’ve been by my side for decades. You should know the Golden Cicada Merchant Association’s model very well. I also approve of you very much. I feel that you have the hope of becoming my successor in the future! ”

“Milord, you praise me too much!” Jin Ji lowered his head humbly, but he sighed in his heart. It was finally time to go back.

“Are you worried about the situation in the Western Regions?” The president smiled at him.

“Yes.” Jin Ji nodded. After all, the Western Regions was his base camp. Moreover, because he had been by the Guild Leader’s side all these years, he had lost touch with the Western regions.

“You don’t have to worry about that. Your influence in the Western Regions has been expanding rapidly over the years. You’ve almost suppressed the other vice president, Apland!” The guild leader smiled.

“Ah?”

Jin Ji blinked his eyes and was a little dumbfounded!
