450 Flower of Eternal Night, King of Mountain Giants

Everyone flew into the sky and quickly arrived at the giant’s city.

Thank you readers!

On both sides were buildings that were hundreds of meters tall. They were ancient but almost completely preserved. Although everyone was a Celestial warlock, they couldn’t help but feel small.

“It’s really huge!” Eli walked on the road and looked at the houses on the side. Their height was so high that they could enter through the gap in the door without opening the door. It was simply ridiculous!

“Sir, I’ll go inside and scout!” Gade looked at the buildings on both sides and said.

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

Gade quickly left and entered through the gap in the door. Three minutes later, he came out and entered another door. After ten minutes, Gade returned to the group.

“There are only tall stone buildings inside. There’s nothing!” Gade said.

” Alright, let’s go to the city center then. We’ll collect the materials we need first before exploring the city! ” Eli said.

“Sure!” A few of them nodded.

Half an hour later!

Everyone walked to the center of the city.

” Mountain Giant Tree, Eternal Night Flower! ” Eli looked at the thousand-meter-tall tree in the distance and the tiny flowers growing not far away from the tree.

Even the diameter of the giant tree was over a hundred meters. It stood on the ground like a wall of the world, and the branches extended to over a thousand meters. Of course, this plant was also wrapped in black liquid, like a tree of death. What was shocking was that there were countless giant corpses hanging on the branches of the giant tree, swaying slightly in the air!

” I finally know why there are no giants in this city! ” Gade said, but his expression became serious!

“Indeed!”

The others nodded. Although they were only scouting, they could see that this giant tree was definitely at the peak of the Radiant Sun Realm or even above. Moreover, its huge body would probably increase its combat strength. This was undoubtedly a huge problem.

“But it’s not a big problem.” Eli smiled and said to Gade, “I remember that you only need the body tissue of the giant tree in the mountain range. I need the Night Flower, so we don’t need to kill it. We just need to take a part of it!”

Such a huge creature would be a problem, even for Eli. It was better to avoid it for the time being!

Of course, this was not to say that the Mountain Tree was bad. In fact, the Mountain Tree was an extremely rare plant, and its tree core was an absolutely rare material. It contained the unique aura of the Mountain Tree and was an excellent material for refining magic potions and making mage Tools. Even Eli was tempted.

However, the giant tree was too strong. Gade had judged that it was a peak Sun Corona, but Eli had a vague feeling that this was even more terrifying. This clone of his felt a fatal threat, so Eli was determined to only take a part of it and leave the rest for later!

“Yes, sir!” The others also heaved a sigh of relief. If they really had to fight such a huge beast, they really did not have the courage!

Very soon, a few of them finally made a decision. The other four would lure the giant tree, and Eli would first take the Flower of Eternal Night, then help to take down the mountain giant tree!

Boom!

The giant tree in the distance seemed to have woken up at this moment. Countless branches swayed, and a few branches covered in liquid flew toward them like tentacles. Their speed was like an afterimage, and sharp explosions sounded in the air!

Gade and the others took the lead and transformed into their avatars, ready to fight!

Pa!

But before they could get close, Gade’s body was sent flying at a rapid speed. There was a terrifying wound on his body, and one could see the bones inside!

With just one attack, Gade, who was at the Sun Corona level, was severely injured. The other people’s gazes turned sharp, and Eli, who was looking for an opportunity, was also dumbfounded!

The giant tree had hundreds of tentacles, and one of them could easily defeat Gade.

Why was the tree only a fourth-circle creature, but its strength could reach such a level? This didn’t make sense!

Eli was confused, but the others had already started fighting the giant tree. In just a few seconds, they were instantly at a disadvantage. As the battle began, more and more tentacles came from the surroundings, which made them feel like they were being held back.

Their expressions became more and more flustered because they could clearly sense that if they made a mistake, they might be killed instantly. This made them panic instantly. They had completely underestimated the giant tree’s strength!

“Sir Eli!” Stacy dodged again but suddenly saw another branch attacking her from the side. Stacy shouted!

As soon as he finished speaking, a figure suddenly appeared. Eli’s hand turned into a wind blade and directly slashed down. In an instant, the branch broke and was instantly absorbed by Eli.

“Retreat!”

After collecting all of them, Eli shouted at the others, and they all retreated. As for Karel, he was accidentally attacked before he left, so he flew into the distance to retreat!

Soon, everyone returned to the edge of the city. However, there were already two injured people on the team!

“Sir, have you found the Flower you wanted?” Gade clutched his chest and shouted with difficulty!

“I got it.” Eli nodded and took out two flowers from his pocket. They looked like daffodils, but they were black in color. Moreover, there were specks of silver on them, just like the night sky. The quality of the two plants had already reached the fourth circle!

Even Eli couldn’t help but feel a burst of joy as he looked at the flowers. The few months of exploration had finally yielded results!

Of course, he didn’t forget what Gade needed, so he took out a few meters long tree branch.

However, the black mist that had left the main body had already dissipated, leaving only a green branch.

Eli took a portion and handed the rest to Gade.

“Thank you, sir!” Gade thanked him. If it weren’t for Eli, it would have been difficult for him to get this.

“It’s okay. If you didn’t invite me, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to get the Flower of Eternal Night!” Eli smiled and didn’t mind.

“Yes!” The few of them nodded!

The goal of this trip had been achieved. Eli looked at the giant tree in the distance again, thinking about some things.

This giant tree had obviously surpassed the fourth circle level, but it had not reached the fifth circle level. This made him very curious. In this kind of confrontation, even if it were his main body, the outcome would not be much better. It would only be a fifty-fifty chance.

“I’m a little confused!” Eli felt that this should involve his knowledge blind spot, which was knowledge about the fifth circle.

Of course, he couldn’t be blamed for this. Not to mention a fifth circle mage, even a fifth circle Warlock had never been heard of in the Western Regions!

Even the current Heart of the Abyss did not have fifth circle, which was why Eli dared to provoke it all the time. However, the enemy in front of him today reminded him that he needed to be more cautious.

“After I go back, I’ll level up after concocting the potion!” Eli immediately made up his mind.

“Sir, we’ve basically finished exploring this fragment. There’s only one Golden Shrine left. Should we explore it?” On the other side, Gade, who had put away the Giant Tree branch, asked Eli curiously.

Golden Shrine?

Eli raised his eyebrows. If they hadn’t mentioned it, he would have forgotten about the Golden Shrine!

Should he go?

Speaking of which, his harvest this time was actually quite good. However, this time, he had come out as a clone, so there was nothing to be afraid of!

“I want to go. Who doesn’t want to go?” Eli turned around and asked.

Stacy and Gade shook their heads. They were already injured and were unwilling to participate in the unknown risk. The other two Dark Sun Warlocks shook their heads. The battle just now had scared them out of their wits.

“Alright, I’ll explore this place alone.” Eli nodded, then took out a Flower of Eternal Night and handed it to Gade. “If I don’t come out, you can go back and deliver this item to the Bloodline Tower in the Western Region! ”

“Yes, sir!”

Gade took the Flower of Eternal Night and nodded solemnly!

“Then I’ll leave!”

Seeing that the final problem had been arranged, Eli nodded and flew directly towards the temple in the distance. During the process, he even passed through a terrorist attack from the giant tree in the mountain range. Because it grew in front of the temple, this was also the reason why the few of them were unwilling to come.

Soon, Eli stood in front of the temple!

He looked up and saw a golden door that was over a hundred meters tall. Standing below it, he suddenly felt even smaller!

“Let’s go in!”

Eli pursed his lips, and then his mental power shook. The door in front of him was accompanied by a cloud of huge dust and a buzzing sound of friction. The door in front of him opened with a bang, and everything in the temple entered Eli’s sight. However, Eli’s smile froze bit by bit!

The huge temple was empty except for the tall golden divine pillars on both sides and a golden throne that was nearly a few hundred meters wide in the center.

What shocked Eli was that the person sitting on the divine throne was a giant that was nearly 100 meters tall. He wore a gorgeous golden robe and a dazzling throne inlaid with gems on his head. However, his body was in a strange state.

The left side of its body was like a withered tree as if its life force had been absorbed. However, the right side was wrapped in black liquid, just like a corrupted giant outside. Of course, this was not what shocked him. When Eli opened the door, the giant’s turbid left eye looked at him, and the aura on its body slowly spread!

That aura far surpassed that of a fourth-circle creature. Even the aura of the giant trees in the mountain range outside was like that of a newborn child compared to it.

“Sixth circle?”

Eli’s heart trembled. He guessed that the giant in front of him was very likely the legendary Mountain Giant King. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

According to the records, the Mountain Giant Kings were the strongest among the giants.

F * ck, this clone was probably really gone this time.

He took a deep breath and prepared to leave, hoping that the giant would not see him.

However, just as he took a step, a painful voice sounded in his ears.

“Human, help me!”
