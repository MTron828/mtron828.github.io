304 Wanderer Alliance

Thirty years later!

“Not again!”

Eli pushed open the door of a mage Tower and walked outside.

He was currently in a Mage ruin.

!!

Walking out of the door, there were a large number of warlocks. They were currently surrounding the entire ruins, carefully exploring, not missing out on any small places.

Looking at this scene, Eli shook his head.

The map of the mage era that he had obtained from the box recorded the locations of the powerful mage forces on the West Coast. Therefore, eli began to search for the ruins one by one, according to this map, in order to obtain information on breaking through to the celestial level.

However, after searching for 30 years, he still had no results.

This high-end knowledge was harder to obtain than he had expected.

“My Lord, these are all the gains from the ruins!”

At this moment, a Warlock walked over, handed a list to Eli, and reported.

In recent years, the bloodline tower had set up a new department, the ruins exploration Department, which had great power. Its purpose was to dig up things that had been left behind during the mage era, and he was one of its members.

“I know!” Eli nodded and took the list.

Soon, he was a little disappointed.

Still nothing.

“Do I really have to go to the central continent?” Eli frowned.

Without a doubt, the West Coast should be considered a remote corner of the Mage world. Not only was its location not good, but its overall strength was also far from comparable to the central continent.

Compared to this place, there was no doubt that the central continent had more resources and opportunities. If there were a place where such information could be found, it would definitely be the central continent.

“Forget it. I’ll wait a little longer!”

At the moment, Eli really had no intention of going to the central continent. It was too dangerous.

“Mosi, I’ll leave this matter to you. I’ll be leaving first!” Eli said to the Warlock.

In fact, he would only come when he found some huge ruins, but this was undoubtedly another failed exploration. He should go back.

..

Soon, Eli returned to the black Tower prison.

He was in a bad mood today, so he tortured his cellmates.

As the prisoners wailed, Eli returned to his normal life.

Although he had yet to reach his limit, his mental power was already at 450 points. Eli could feel that he was about to reach his own limit!

In the blink of an eye, another five years had passed.

The ruin exploration Department found three ruins at the same time.

However, there seemed to be an accident.

“Grandmaster, of the three ruins this time, only two are within the bloodline tower’s range, and the other is within the Wanderer Alliance’s territory.”

In the wizard Tower, Vivika’s student, the current tower master of the bloodline tower, Aisha, said respectfully to Eli.

“Alright, I got it!” Eli nodded. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Over the years, there had been more and more wanted criminals or escapees in the central continent. In the East of the West Coast, they had gathered and even formed a new force, the wandering Alliance!

Although this force had an ordinary name, its strength was not to be underestimated.

Even on the surface, there were dozens of third-circle warlocks, but they seemed to be afraid of the bloodline tower’s central continent forces, so they had been hiding in a corner. However, due to their powerful strength, they inevitably occupied a large area.

In this regard, the bloodline tower was also very helpless. Although the Wanderer Alliance had a small number of people, their strength was very strong. Even the bloodline tower was not a match for them.

The only one who could take care of these people, Eli, wasn’t too interested either.

“Grandmaster, do we need to take action against the wandering home?” Aisha’s eyes were filled with hope. She hoped that Eli could take action and get rid of this force.

“No need. Aren’t there many other ruins? We’ll talk about it after the exploration,” Eli understood Aisha’s thoughts, but he didn’t intend to cause any trouble before he broke through!

Unless there was evidence that the organization had what it needed.

“Alright then!” Aisha nodded and was a little disappointed. The strength of the wandering Alliance had become stronger and stronger over the years, and she was worried that some unknown changes would really happen.

Very quickly, the exploration of the ruins began.

With the hard work of the Department, in just ten days, the two ruins were explored.

Regretfully, they still did not find anything.

This year, Eli’s mental power was at 454 points.

..

Ten years later.

Eli’s mental power had reached 460 points.

At this time, the outside world’s environment once again underwent a huge change.

Most of the Wanderers who came to the West Coast chose to join the Wanderer alliance. Gradually, the power of the Wanderer alliance began to expand rapidly. In just a few years, they had a complete organizational structure.

But the problem was that as their population expanded, the resources they needed also increased exponentially. The existing resources simply couldn’t meet their needs. In the beginning, they could collect resources from the ocean or some places, but gradually, the resources in those places were insufficient.

What they needed were resources that could be collected on a large scale and were sustainable.

However, this portion was monopolized by the bloodline tower.

...

And so, the test began.

Over the years, the Wanderer Alliance had begun to send warlocks to harass the bloodline tower, and they gradually discovered that the members of the bloodline tower were not as powerful as they had thought.

And with the arrival of the people from the central continent, some news also came.

The bloodline tower almost didn’t care about this place anymore!

Thus, in a few days, they captured several resource points.

The power of the Wanderer Alliance had frightened the bloodline tower branch!

Fortunately, after obtaining these resource points, the wandering alliance did not make any new moves. This made Alice feel a lot more relaxed.

Eli still did not make a move. His current spiritual power was 458 mental points.

In ten years’ time, he had only increased it by 4 points. It was getting harder and harder!

..

Another ten years passed.

...

Eli’s mental power had reached 462 points.

The wandering alliance did not do anything, but the hourglass had made a move.

Traces of the time hourglass’s people had been found in the northern region. This force that had not appeared for more than a hundred years had finally begun to reveal its fangs.

One must know that the hourglass of time was the uncrowned King of this place more than a thousand years ago.

As soon as the people from the hourglass showed up, they occupied a large area near the North and center. Then, they stopped as if that was their purpose.

However, no one dared to ignore them because of this. Everyone understood that the next time they made a move, the situation on the West Coast would change dramatically.

..

Eli wasn’t interested in that.

At this moment, his mental power was almost at its peak, but he had not found any relevant information. In this regard, Eli was also very helpless, but there was nothing he could do.

But what Eli didn’t expect was that five years later, the arrival of an airship would change everything.

At this moment, an airship from the central continent arrived at the region of the bloodline tower.

This airship belonged to a major force in the central mainland.

The Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce!
