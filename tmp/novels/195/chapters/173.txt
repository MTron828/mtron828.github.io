174 High Bounty

Naturally, Dick’s plan was unsuccessful. After all, Eli was a member of the White Tower, and the White Tower stood behind him.

Dick had a stomach full of pent-up anger that he couldn’t vent.

He couldn’t just say that Adams was in the second-circle, right? If he did, they would be guilty. So he could only give up.

He had to suffer in silence, and this was his current situation.

As for the cause of Adams and Molin’s deaths, he guessed that it might really be a second-circle mutated monster in the secret plane. Of course, it could also be that there was a hidden second-circle warlock in the White Tower.

However, this was only a guess. No one knew what exactly had happened.

Just like that, a day later, Dick brought his men and left the place dejectedly.

The ownership of the secret realm naturally belonged to the White Tower. After all, there were only a dozen or so people from the Blood Alliance left, and there was almost no comparison.

They had suffered heavy losses. Not only did they lose a large number of warlocks, but they also lost Adams, a second-circle warlock, and a medium-scale secret plane.

On the other side, many warlocks were telling the story of how Eli had saved everyone. This changed everyone’s opinion of him, and almost all of the warlocks in this batch were truly grateful to him.

They were grateful to him for saving them.

In such an atmosphere, Rawls finally woke up one day later.

After waking up, he heard the stories told by the others and knew that it was really Eli who had saved him. The scene before his assumed death was actually real, and this made him fall into silence.

He clearly remembered that he was facing a two-circle creature.

This even made him doubt his life. When he saw Eli, he didn’t have his previous attitude, but he looked at him with a complicated expression.

Life was like a play!

..

Three days later.

Eli and the others returned to the White Tower.

The others went to the tower to calculate their points and exchange them for resources, but Eli didn’t care about this and quietly returned to his Tower.

With their return, the matter regarding Eli fermented for a short period of time. After hearing the story, many people’s attitudes toward him changed. After all, everyone hoped that their superior was someone who could save them if they were in trouble.

Another three days passed.

Eli received Kratos’ request to meet, and the two met.

“Well done, Herman.”

As soon as Eli came in, Kratos patted him on the shoulder.

“This is what I should do.”

“Let’s sit down and talk,” Kratos pulled Eli to the side of the sofa, and the two sat down.

“What business does my Lord have with me?” Eli asked curiously.

” Because of your performance in the secret plane this time, you’ve also been rewarded with 50000 points, which you can exchange for supplies and even missions,” Kratos said.

“Yes.”

“But today I got you here not for this matter.” Kratos shook his head and then took out a wanted list.

Eli took it. The portrait was of him, and the wanted price under it was 30000 low-grade magic stones. The party who issued the wanted article was the Blood Alliance, and their logo was engraved on it. It was real.

“There is a bounty on me?” Eli frowned.

The Blood Alliance seemed to hate him to the bone!

“That’s right. You’re on the wanted list, so you’d better stay in the White Tower for the time being. With this price, even a person in the Second circle would be tempted.” Kratos said.

“Okay, I understand.” Eli nodded.

This was 30000 magic stones. The blood Alliance made a huge investment.

Fortunately, he didn’t have any plans to go out. After all, it would take a lot of time to learn all kinds of spells, alchemy, and divination.

He also needed time to digest the elemental crystals further.

In any case, the White Tower would provide him with resources, and he only needed to develop slowly in the White Tower. He had made up his mind that he would not leave the White Tower until he had developed to his current limit.

As for the blood required for the devouring spell, he could slowly buy it from the White Tower. After all, it was normal for warlocks to buy blood. As for the mage camp, he would let them slowly develop.

Therefore, the next step was to slowly develop.

The news that Herman was wanted caused a huge sensation at first.

After all, a first-circle warlock’s bounty was so high that many wild sorcerers were naturally tempted. However, when they came to the outside of the White Tower in twos and threes, ready to hunt for Eli, they discovered a problem.

This guy didn’t come out.

That’s right. He didn’t come out at all. Some people even heard that this guy rarely came out of his tower, which made many warlocks extremely confused.

After all, warlocks basically relied on their bloodlines to grow, and in general, battles were the most convenient way to develop bloodlines. In battles, bloodlines could be activated the fastest, which was extremely beneficial to the growth of warlocks. Plus, this was the most efficient way to gather blood.

As for the other methods, potions and research would naturally have a certain effect, but very few warlocks would do so. Since there were simpler methods, why would they choose the more difficult methods?

Therefore, they were very depressed. However, they still chose to wait.

They refused to believe that Eli wouldn’t come out.

They could afford to waste a few years anyway.

A year later, Eli still did not leave the house. Most warlocks were still full of confidence and were basically still waiting. Only a few people left. After all, the benefits were too great.

Two years later.

At this moment, some people had already begun to waver. They only felt that Eli was really a strange person, and another group of people left.

Three years later.

At this time, many people were already a little numb. Some warlocks who were reluctant to give up their previous efforts continued to wait, while most of the others had left.

Five years later.

At this moment, even the most patient warlocks sighed and turned to leave.

They really couldn’t wait any longer.

It was ridiculous that Eli hadn’t left the White Tower for five years.

How could there be such a Warlock?

And among all of them, there was still one person who had not left.

“Herman, I want you dead!!”

Outside the White Tower, an old man with white hair, black eyes, and wearing a gray Warlock robe was hiding in a cave outside the White Tower, waiting.

His name was Sores, a second-circle giant kemoyin serpent Warlock. He was also Adams’s grandfather, and Adams was the only bloodline of his dead son, as well as his only family.

He was here to ambush Eli.

The reason was simple. Every Warlock of the giant kemoyin serpent clan had a soul lamp in their clan, which allowed them to check on the Warlock’s condition. After an inspection, they discovered that Adams had not been killed by a chimera, but by a Warlock.

But they didn’t know who the killer was. In the end, after thinking for a long time, they decided that it was most likely Eli.

To an old Warlock who had lost his only bloodline, he would rather kill the wrong person than let his grandson’s potential killer go.

“It’s only been five years. I don’t believe you won’t come out in ten years!” He pursed his lips, and his wrinkled old face made a ferocious expression.

One should never doubt the impact of losing one’s only blood relative on an old man.

Five years later.

Sores was silent.

It had been a full ten years, and this fellow still had not come out?
