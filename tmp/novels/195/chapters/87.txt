88 Knowledge

The floor where Severo was locked up was completely hidden and was only used to lock up the most important prisoners.

At the moment, there were not many people locked up here, only five or six. When eli looked over, they were all lying inside, having completely lost their desire to live.

“My lord, seviro is in the innermost area.” The guard said as he walked in front.

Soon, they came to the end of the corridor and came to a huge iron door. There was only a ten-centimeter long and five-centimeter wide iron window on the iron door that allowed them to see inside.

Eli looked through the window, and the scene inside was reflected in his eyes.

In the lightless prison, seviro’s feet were shackled with thick chains, and so were his hands. He was strung in the air, his hair disheveled, and his head lowered as if he had lost all sense of the outside world.

And if Eli wasn’t wrong, seviro’s body was covered in wounds, and his life force was like a weak flame. In fact, Eli felt like he would die in the next second.

There was no hope.

“What happened?” Looking at seviro’s expression, Eli felt sad, which was very rare.

“Master, you don’t know how terrifying that old man was. He fought dozens of Knights and killed dozens of advanced Knights. He didn’t care about his life at all. He even killed a Grand Knight, and another grand Knight was seriously injured. In the end, he couldn’t hold on anymore. Otherwise, he would have run away. Now, he is dying.” The guard said with a face full of fear.

“Yes, all of you, leave. I want to go in and take a look.” Eli said.

“But, my Lord, there’s still a certain level of danger.” The guard dissuaded. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Master, you can’t go in. It’s too dangerous.” Eli’s guards also tried their best to dissuade him.

“Get lost. I want to go in!” Eli stared at the two of them.

“Alright!” The guard hesitated for a moment, then immediately went to get the key. He quickly returned and opened the door.

Eli’s guard took a look and left hesitantly as well.

“Seviro!” Eli walked straight into the darkness.

In the darkness, Severo coughed twice. In the darkness, under his loose hair, he couldn’t see Eli.

“Who are you? Am I going to die?” He panted with difficulty.

“You are indeed dying. Your life force is about to be extinguished.” Eli said softly.

This time, seviro didn’t say anything.

In the darkness, he could only hear the sound but not see Eli’s face.

“Just like before, let’s talk about what you’ve encountered this time. Let’s catch up, ” Eli said with a smile.

Seviro was speechless.

Why did it feel a little familiar?

“Sigh, you really make me worry. Old friend, I told you not to do this.” Eli shook his head and slowly approached. His appearance gradually changed, and he returned to his original appearance.

This time, the distance was close enough for Seviro to see Eli.

His eyes widened.

“Eli!” Seviro’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Wasn’t this the deepest part of the prison? How did he get in?

“How did you get in?” Seviro coughed up a mouthful of blood, and his expression changed.

“Didn’t you write me a letter? You didn’t clearly state what you found, so I came to find you,” Eli replied.

Seviro, “…”

He understood that, but how the hell did Eli get in?

“Let’s have a chat. What did you discover this time?” Eli sat on the ground and then took out a bottle of rum from his arms.

“You bastard.” When he smelled the wine, the corners of seviro’s shriveled mouth curled up, but he found himself trapped and unable to move at all.

Suddenly, two gusts of wind passed by.

The sound of metal being cut rang out. Seviro fell from the air. He was dumbfounded when he saw the chains on both sides of his hands break.

“What is this?” Seviro said, trembling.

“Sit down and have a drink,” Eli said.

“Alright!” With all his doubts, Seviro sat down and gritted his teeth. This was because his injuries were too severe.

“Let’s talk about your matter first,” Eli said.

“Alright!” Severo picked up the rum with difficulty and took a sip.

“Since I left Jun Lin for the last time, I’d already harbored the thought of dying outside if I don’t find anything. I knew my condition was getting worse and worse.

“Then, three months ago, I finally finished searching all the places I wanted to check. There were only two places left, and the Empire’s imperial mausoleum was one of them.” Seviro didn’t hold back at all as he spoke. he took a sip of wine and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Eli sat opposite him and looked at him calmly.

“And what did you find there?” Eli asked.

“No, there’s nothing inside. It’s just an empty shell.” Seviro laughed and coughed out a few more mouthfuls of blood. ” I was discovered instead. I wanted to escape, but there were too many of them. I ended up like this. ”

Eli took a sip of rum as well and then said, “Then what about your letter?”

“Didn’t I tell you that there are only two places left? If there’s nothing at the mausoleum, then it has to be at the other place.” Seviro cast a glance at Eli and spat out another mouthful of blood. This time, there was some flesh and internal organs.

Eli didn’t stop him.

Because of Seviro’s condition, he was really beyond saving.

“Where is it?”

“The underground of the palace’s main hall.” Seviro didn’t beat around the bush and said directly.

“Under the main hall?” Eli raised an eyebrow. “Then how can you be sure that it’s not somewhere else in the palace?”

“Ha, I searched every inch of the palace when I was the director, except for that place. Now that I think about it, it doesn’t seem right. That place was solid, but I once felt a slight echo from underground. If I wasn’t a top Grand Knight, I wouldn’t have heard it. But I didn’t think too much about it at that time.

“It also seemed that Saleen metatrin had been there before he died.

“I’m sure his trace could be found under the main hall,” Seviro said bitterly.

If only he had noticed this more than a decade ago.

“Is that so?” Eli was also very shocked.

He didn’t expect this revelation.

However, if it were really there, he would have to think about how about to go about this.

“What about you? What’s going on with you?” seviro mesa then looked at eli.

Eli didn’t answer. He moved his right palm, and a burning fireball appeared.

The light from the fire illuminated their faces, and seviro Mesa was completely dumbfounded.

He looked at Eli and didn’t make a sound for a long time.

“So my dream was realized long ago?” A few minutes later, Seviro spoke with a trembling voice.

“I’m sorry!” Eli apologized.

“It’s okay, haha. I found it. I told you, mages do exist. Haha! ” Seviro Mesa suddenly laughed out loud, and his internal organs spurted out along with the blood.

“Thank you, ” he said to Eli. “I have no regrets in this life! I can feel that I’m going to die soon. Can you go out? I don’t want you to see me in such a sorry state.

“Also, I still have a daughter in Junlin. After I die, she’ll be in danger. Can you help me send her away from Junlin?”

“Alright!” Eli picked up the rum and walked out of the room.

Five minutes later.

Eli felt the aura of the door behind him disappear.

He entered again.

Seviro had already fallen to the ground with a smile on his face. He had lost his life.

Eli sighed.
