218 Talking to Vivika

The tower in front of him was not tall, only three stories high. It should be a small mage Tower, and its location was even a little bit on the periphery.

“Could it be that there’s a problem with the Lord’s spirit crystal? ”

Nikola was a little confused. In his mind, Vivika should be in the most central mage Tower or some other central area. It was a little strange for her to appear here.

He quickly thought of other possibilities.

If Vivika was inside the bloodline tower, she still had to worry about Kloss sneaking in at any time. There was still a huge gap between the middle and early third circle, so it was normal for Vivika to be a little more cautious.

After thinking for a while, Nikola confirmed that there was only one person inside, and flew toward the Tower in the shadow.

He didn’t go through the front door but floated all the way to the third floor. He gently opened the window and saw that there was nothing special inside, so Nikola floated inside with ease.

“Whoosh!!!”

However, as soon as Nicholas entered, his entire soul body suddenly tensed up. The mental power in his soul body instantly began to rotate at high speed, and his eyes widened.

This was because he could clearly sense that there was a wind elemental being behind him. The wind elemental being exuded a strong wind element, causing him to tremble.

What was this?

Nikola was stunned. There was clearly no one there just now!

“Who are you?”

At the same time, a voice came from behind.

“Don’t be nervous. I’m here to help you!” Nikola slowly turned his head and pulled down the hood of his cloak. At the same time, the aura of his third ring slowly spread out.

“Third circle? Who are you?” Vivika took a few steps back and stared at Nikola.

“This is Vivika? She’s that pretty?!” Nikola was a little surprised to see a woman as beautiful as an elf. It was the first time he had seen Vivika.

“Who are you? How did you find me?” Vivika’s bloodline was activated bit by bit, and countless wind elements wrapped around her. Her body was slowly covered with green patterns, and her beautiful eyes stared at Nikola.

Even the people of the bloodline tower didn’t know that she was here, but a third-circle mage, an undead at that, had come knocking on her door. This was a little unexpected.

Looking at Vivika, who was ready to fight, Nikola quickly explained, “Hello, I’m Nikola. You should have heard of this name. I’m the boss of the house of the undead. I’ve come here to discuss something with you.”

“Nikola!”

Vivika naturally realized that the creature in front of her was an undead, but she did not think that he was from the house of the undead. After all, it was only a small force in the South. She did not expect Nikola to be a third-circle undead.

“I didn’t expect you to be a 3rd Circle undead. We’ve been fooled by you. Tell me, what’s your purpose in coming here?” Knowing his identity, she also relaxed.

The house of the undead was a neutral force.

“Respected tower master of the bloodline tower, I’ve already said that I’m here to help you,” Nikola said again.

“Help me?” Vivika had a strange expression on her face.

At this time, almost all the forces had abandoned them, and even the small forces had turned to black Isotta. At this time, someone actually said that he wanted to help her. Wasn’t this a joke?

“Yes, I’m here to help you.” Nikola nodded, then looked at the wind element blade in front of him and said reluctantly, ” but can you please put away the blade first? I think we should sit down and have a talk.”

“Alright,” she said. Facing a third-circle mage, Vivika knew that it would be difficult to kill him. She was also very curious about what the so-called “help” meant.

Soon, the two arrived at the second floor of the mage Tower and sat on the sofa.

“tell me, what is your ‘help’? if you’re just toying with me, you’ll regret it!” Vivika pursed her lips and stared at Nicolay with her green eyes.

“Don’t worry,” Nikola took a deep breath and did not waste any time. He directly released a little bit of the aura of Kloss from his body and said, “I have the same enemy as you. I killed Mason, and now Kloss wants to kill me. If I want to live, I have to kill him, so I’m here to work with you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Vivika’s expression changed.

“You killed Mason?!” Vivika was surprised and couldn’t believe it. “How could you have killed him?”

Ignoring Vivika’s disbelief, Nicholas smiled and said proudly, “Mason has the Earth dragon’s bloodline and outstanding defense. I naturally couldn’t kill him. It wasn’t me who killed him. It was my master who killed him.”

“Your master?”

Even now, Vivika still didn’t believe it. After all, Mason was a three-circle warlock. How could he die just like that? and it all happened too suddenly.

“That’s right. Back then, Mason was killed by master in one move. His combat power was also at the middle or late stage of the third circle, and Master wanted to kill Kloss for my sake.” Thinking of this, Nikola was still very touched.

“Third-circle mid-late stage warlock?” Vivika fell into deep thought.

She should know all the West Coast 3-circle warlocks, but Nikola suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and there was another 3-circle master behind him. This really made her a little confused. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, Nikola’s body did have the aura of Kloss.

“If you really did kill Mason, bring out his body!” Vivika looked at Nikola and muttered slowly.

“I’m sorry, I really can’t do that!” Nikola smiled awkwardly. Mason’s body had been blown to pieces by Eli. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have used the mark as evidence.

“Alright,” Vivika shook her head and asked, “The same question as before, how did you find me?”

“It’s Master who gave me this!” Nikola took out the soul crystal and let it float in the air.

“My aura?”

Vivika looked at the soul crystal in a daze. In the center of the crystal, a wisp of her soul aura was frozen.

She stretched out her hand, and the soul crystal floated toward Nikola. Nikola did not stop her. He saw Vivika break the soul crystal, and suddenly the soul aura floated out. In the blink of an eye, it floated toward Vivika.

She stretched out her hand and touched the soul aura. In an instant, this wisp of soul aura seemed to return to its owner’s body and fused into her soul without any obstruction.

Vivika was shocked.

What was going on?

This was a wisp of her soul. It originated from her. However, the number of times she had released her soul’s aura in the past few hundred years could be counted with one’s fingers. Moreover, it was all to people she absolutely trusted. So, what was this about?

“Who is master you speak of?” Vivika raised her head and looked at Nikola seriously.

“Tower master Vivika, you’ll find out when the time comes. Master is already setting up the battlefield. I’ll tell you the location later.” Nikola also stood up and took out a crystal ball, placing it on the table.

...

Then, he put on his cloak and flew out of the Tower, leaving quickly.

This time, Vivika did not stop Nikola from disappearing.

“Who is it?”

Vivika put away the crystal ball and went to the window.

The moonlight was bright tonight. Nikola’s figure flickered and disappeared in the shadows, leaving the bloodline tower without anyone noticing.

Vivika gritted her teeth. At this time, she believed 90% of Nikola’s words.

The only question was, who was Nikola’s master? Why did he have her soul’s aura?

“Could it be David?” Vivika’s senior brother flashed through her mind, but she remembered that he had left the West Coast and gone to the central continent. Could he have returned?

“In that case, let’s meet when the time comes.” Vivika turned around.

Since things had already come to this, she would accept Nikola’s invitation and kill Kloss together.

At the same time, she could also see who this mysterious person was.
