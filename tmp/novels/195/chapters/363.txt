364 The End (1)

“Attack!”

Jalin’s voice was like the key to a mechanical device, causing the entire Manticore Clan to move.

On the ground.

The Warlocks at the front held their shields and approached Bloodline City step by step. They were orderly and filled with killing intent, and the ground even trembled slightly.

!!

In the sky, countless grey-white birds let out sharp cries and flew toward the Bloodline City under the Warlock’s command. The hundred or so warlocks on the Cloud Whale jumped off the Cloud Whale and hovered above the Warlock’s tail, moving forward.

Jalin’s gaze remained calm.

….

On the city wall.

Glen took a deep breath as he watched this scene. He quickly issued an order, which was passed on by the surrounding Warlocks.

In just a few seconds, the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower were mobilized. On the city wall, arrows were ready to be fired. Many Warlocks also held bows in their hands. As for the Warlocks on the ground, they were already prepared even without any notice.

After charging for dozens of seconds, the Manticore Warlock had already crossed a hundred meters.

“Fire!” At this moment, a Warlock commanding the battle on the city wall shouted.

In the next second, countless crossbow bolts were shot out, making a whooshing sound as they flew through the air. They drew an arc and shot toward the Warlocks in the distance like rain.

The Manticore Clan’s Warlocks on the ground raised their shields, and the Warlocks in the sky ordered the giant bird to dodge.

However, the speed of the arrows was extremely fast. In the next second, many flying magical beasts in the sky were hit and fell to the ground with a screech. The Warlocks on the ground were all badly hit, and some were directly shot to death. Although many Warlocks on the ground had shields, there were still unlucky ones who were shot to death.

The long-range equipment on the manticore’s side also began to activate. Explosions with a radius of nearly two meters flew toward the Bloodline Tower in the distance. Some were blocked by the Warlocks on the city walls, while others fell into the city and caused huge explosions, destroying countless buildings.

This kind of mutual attack lasted for three rounds.

After three rounds, many of the Manticore Warlocks had died, and the defense of Bloodline City had weakened significantly.

At this moment, the Warlocks on the ground had already met the Bloodline Tower and started to engage in close combat. The bloody battle began, and the blood slowly filled the air. The 3-circle Warlocks in the sky also began to transform into their bloodlines. Countless manticore bloodlines erupted and joined the battle.

The 3-circle Warlocks from Bloodline City also began to join the battle.

The number of third-circle warlocks was more than a hundred, but the Manticore clan didn’t bring too many third-circle warlocks this time because they knew very well that victory wouldn’t be decided by them but by the celestial.

On the cloud whale in the sky.

Seeing the situation, Vya flew down to the high wall of the Bloodline Tower and shouted, “Glen, get the hell out here.”

…..

On the city wall.

Many Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower stood behind Glen with nervous expressions.

Glen’s gaze was also solemn as he looked at the nearby Vya. The aura of a True Spirit erupted.

In the next second, he also flew towards the Warlock in the distance.

Glen used his bloodline’s avatar and transformed into a 70-meter-tall Wind Elemental Sovereign. He wore a green crown of storms on his head, and countless sharp wind blades burned on his sharp claws. He then attacked Vya.

Vya sneered, and a 100-meter-long manticore appeared in the sky.

The two behemoths rose into the air and fought in the sky.

“Grandpa.” On the city wall, Alida was watching the battle. Although it had only been a few seconds, Vya had already suppressed the situation.

If this continued, he definitely wouldn’t be able to withstand it for long.

Alida immediately thought of Hydra, but Hydra ignored her, which made her feel helpless.

“I was delayed on the road for too long.” Alida gritted her teeth and looked up.

Then, another figure appeared and transformed into a smaller manticore in midair.

The other celestial, Alona.

As Arona descended, he swung his scorpion tail at the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower.

With a bang, a bloody mist rose. That was because the Warlocks were instantly killed by Alona. The poison on the scorpion’s tail even turned them into a cloud of blood.

Seeing this, the Warlocks on the ground looked desperate.

The Bloodline Tower only had one celestial. Once the second celestial descended, they had almost no chance of victory. During this time, there were also three Warlocks who attacked Arona, but they were easily killed before they could even get close.

Those below the celestial Realm had no chance. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“We’re done for. How are we going to fight this?”

“Another celestial. It looks like I’m going to die here today.”

” I didn’t expect the Bloodline Tower to disappear from the Central Continent like this. ”

On the ground, all the Warlocks were either depressed, desperate or in pain. They were not the only ones. The Warlocks on the city wall felt powerless when they saw the huge manticore that was almost as tall as the city wall. As for the people in the city, they hid in the corners of their homes. Those who were brave enough to look outside the city trembled in fear.

In the sky.

While fighting with Glen, Vya teased him.

“Glen, perhaps you can still hold on for a while, but do you think your people can hold on for long?” Vya dodged one of the blades and said with a smile.

Glen didn’t say anything. Vya was stronger than him, and any distraction could be fatal.
