190 Taking in Nikola Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He smiled?

Nikola was stunned.

He didn’t understand. Since he had forcefully raised his level to three-circle in a short period of time, how could his enemy still laugh? He should know that the lowest level three-circle could easily defeat seven or eight two-circle warlocks.

The burning anger instantly ignited him.

“I want you to die!!!”

At this moment, Nikola, who was nearly thirty meters tall, opened his huge hand and grabbed Eli.

The terrifying undead hand carried a strong mental attack. Even if an ordinary acolyte only touched it a little, their soul would immediately collapse. Even a 2nd circle Mage would not be able to withstand it.

Nikola continued forward, but he still had some doubts in his heart.

The man in front of him was ordinary, but he seemed to be extremely confident. ‘Could he be a third-circle warlock? Impossible. There shouldn’t be such a powerful warlock in the South of the West Coast. Could it be that he had a powerful wizard weapon? That was possible. What was the reason?’

His attack was getting closer and closer to Eli, and his eyes were fixed on him.

Finally, when they were about thirty meters away from each other, Eli moved. He instantly became nervous.

He raised his hand, put it next to the earring, and then flicked it gently.

A bullet?

Nikola did not understand what Eli was doing, but in an instant, his grinning expression froze and then became distorted. A pain that involved the source of his soul made him feel as if he had fallen into hell.

The attack instantly collapsed, and he also hugged his body and began to shake wildly.

It hurt!

It was too painful!

The pain that directly involved his soul made him feel as if he had fallen into an abyss. A few minutes later, he barely managed to recover. Then, he looked at Eli and his earrings.

Vaguely, he seemed to understand something. That earring, the earring that contained his soul, why was it in the hands of this man in front of him?

“You …”

Nikola looked at Eli, and his huge body could not help but tremble. It was extremely funny. Only he knew how terrifying it was when your Soul Origin fell into the hands of a mage.

Eli flicked it again. He had thought of this scene when he first upgraded this mage weapon, but he didn’t expect it to happen so soon. The cause of a hundred years ago bore fruit today.

With Eli’s flick, Nikola began to tremble madly again. His huge body turned into various shapes in the air, and the combined body was even on the verge of collapsing.

At this moment, all the people who were still alive in the capital were watching this comical yet terrifying scene.

The sight of an undead that was tens of meters tall howling in pain in the air, and the cause of all this was a human that was less than two meters tall, was too much of a visual impact.

“Is he the angel that subdues the demons? ”

“It’s too terrifying. Is this really a power that humans can master? ”

“I must be dreaming today. Let me wake up, wake up from this nightmare.”

The crowd was in a heated discussion. This was too shocking for them. The little girl who had been put aside by Eli earlier was also pursing her lips, not saying a word. He was so powerful.

If the lives of ordinary people were already so shocking, the royal family who knew of the existence of warlocks was another story.

At this time, they had all stood up from the ground and stood in front of the great palace watching this scene with their mouths wide open. The king in the lead was so excited that he was trembling, and his voice was mixed with fear.

He used to be a Warlock apprentice, so he guessed that the undead was at least a three-circle warlock. However, the undead was easily suppressed by the man in front of him. Could this man be a celestial?

How was this possible?

In the sky, Eli flicked his earring for the third time.

Bang!

Nikola’s huge body shattered in an instant, while his original body was looking at Eli among the crowd of spirits as if he had seen a ghost.

But to his surprise, Roland didn’t seem to care about him. Instead, a shadow appeared behind him, and all the undead fell into the shadow.

The incantation ring on Eli’s arm glowed with a black light, and his mental power was increasing at a rapid pace.

136.

140.

..

185.

In the blink of an eye, Eli’s mental energy had increased by a full fifty points. Although these were all undead of ordinary people, their numbers were large enough.

If he meditated, it would probably take decades or even centuries to improve this much, but now, it only took a dozen seconds.

One word, awesome!

Eli closed her eyes, sensing the changes within.

Not far away, Nikola was curled up, looking at Eli in fear, not daring to disturb him in the slightest. He was not as arrogant as he was earlier.

After more than ten minutes, Eli opened his eyes and looked at Nikola.

“Hello, let me introduce myself. My name is Roland.” Eli said with a smile.

“Hello, I’m Nikola!” Nikola replied awkwardly.

“You don’t look very happy to see me?!” Eli teased.

“No, I’m very happy. Seeing you today is the happiest thing I’ve ever seen.” Nicola forced a smile and said against his will.

“So fake!”

Nicola, “…”

...

It was very hurtful!

“Do you want to live or die?” Eli looked at Nikola!

??

Nicola’s eyes lit up. Did this mean that he still had a chance to live?

“I want to live. I want to live.” He said hurriedly.

Eli nodded. He had originally intended to absorb him directly, but he now had an even better idea.

“Since you want to live, then you have to work, and it’s a fair trade,” Eli looked at Nikola and smiled politely, ” I need souls, many, many souls. If you can help me collect a million undead, I can even return your soul core to you. Are you willing to do so?”

“I’m willing. I’m willing.” Nikola nodded his head crazily.

“Alright,” Eli nodded. “I’ll let you go, but of course, I have one request. You can’t cause trouble in the South of the West Coast. This is my territory. You have to go further north and help me see the environment there. As for souls, we’ll contact each other when the time comes.

“Oh, I’m going to engrave a Soul brand in your soul spirit. You don’t have any objections, right?” Eli asked.

“No objections.” Nikola nodded bitterly. The soul core was already in Eli’s hands, so the soul brand was nothing.

...

“Hmm, not bad.” Eli smiled and immediately engraved the Soul brand on Nikola.

“Oh, you were once a third-circle mage?” Suddenly, Eli seemed to have sensed something and asked curiously.

“Yes. Then imprint all your knowledge and memories of your breakthrough for me. Also, do you know how to break through to the celestial realm? ” Eli asked.

“Sure, sure, but I really don’t know about the celestial. I had just broken through to the third circle back then.” Nicola answered.

“Alright, alright,” Eli waved his hand and threw out a crystal ball. Nicholas took the crystal ball with a smile. At least he had survived.

Soon, Nikola finished the branding.

Eli kept the crystal ball and was ready to leave. As for the Kings, he had no interest in them.

As Eli was about to leave, he suddenly thought of something. He turned to Nikola and asked, ” you’re from before the catastrophe. Do you know what caused the catastrophe? ”

This was a question that had always piqued his interest.

“Great catastrophe!” Hearing this, Nicolay was also stunned, “My Lord, I know a little about this, but I can’t tell you!”

Eli, “…”

“This is very complicated. I can only tell you that it’s a very powerful world, but I can’t say much about it. It’s best not to mention anything since we’re not celestial!

“That was a terrifying civilization!”

Eli’s brows twitched. Did this mean that the catastrophe was caused by a civilization? Which civilization was it?

“My lord, this is all I can say. Sometimes, knowing too much is not a good thing!” For the sake of his soul, Nikola quickly became one of Eli’s men.

“Alright,” he said. Eli waved his hand, and Nikola did not dare to play any tricks with him.

It was indeed a good thing to know less.

In any case, he would know sooner or later. There was no rush.

As long as Nikola was not caught, he would have an endless supply of undead and souls from other channels. He would go back to the White Tower first. Other things could wait until he was about to advance to the third circle.

It was time to return to the White Tower. Of course, he had to leave the girl at the camp first.
