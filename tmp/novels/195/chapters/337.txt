338 Laura’s Birth

On the other side.

Around Mercury Island.

Thousands of light spots gathered around Mercury Island, emitting a soft light.

On the mountain of Mercury Island, Hydra’s huge body was wrapped around the mountain of the island. Its three heads were slowly raised and were making hissing sounds.

“Silly snake, stop barking,” Doggo said from the mountain beside them.

Hydra was even more displeased, and it glared at Doggo.

“What’s this? According to my database, it’s a little similar to the sea tribe’s power of faith. Eli actually knows this?!” Doggo ignored him and just looked at the light of faith in the sky.

At this time, the light spots also changed. In his vision, countless light spots flew toward the Tower in the center of Mercury Island and then flew into it.

Seeing this scene, Hydra was about to fly into the sky but was stopped by Doggo.

“Your master is gathering faith!”

After saying this, Hydra finally stopped. However, its eyes were filled with doubt. It was obvious that it did not understand, but it also understood that this would not do its master any harm.

After thinking through this, Hydra closed its eyes again.

Since everything was fine, it might as well go to sleep.

At this moment, inside the wizard Tower.

Eli was also stunned. At this moment, countless light spots of faith gathered around him, filling the entire room.

“Is this the accumulated faith of the West Coast in me for nearly a thousand years? ”

Eli felt the number and was a little shocked too. It seemed like the unintentional act of the Vivika back then had brought him benefits instead.

“What do I do next?” At this point, Eli didn’t know what to do either. However, he felt that the light spots around him seemed to have an inexplicable attraction to him, and he seemed to understand.

In the next second, Eli released his consciousness. In the next second, all the light spots surged toward him, instantly covering him completely. The room fell into silence.

The light spots wrapped around Eli like a cocoon, and he absorbed the power of faith bit by bit.

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.

At present, the specks of light were almost non-existent, but Eli’s eyes were still closed. However, a diamond-shaped imprint could be seen on his right forearm, and within it was a resplendent gold, and the imprint was filled.

Eli slowly opened his eyes and couldn’t help but feel happy when he saw the mark on his arm.

He had gained a lot this time.

He called the mark on his arm the mark of faith. It was condensed from the power of faith and had many uses.

Not only could it increase the speed of Eli’s meditation and speed up his cultivation, but it also had the effect of recovery. By consuming the power of faith within it, it could heal injuries and even resist fatal injuries.

Of course, increasing the speed of meditation also required the consumption of faith.

However, it was undeniable that it was still a good thing.

“The reward this time is much greater than I imagined.” Eli was shocked.

The addition of the faith system was like giving Eli an additional trump card. This gave him more confidence about going to the central continent.

It was comfortable, so he went out for a walk.

As soon as he went out, he saw Doggo coming over.

“Congratulations, my Lord.” Doggo congratulated.

“Yes.”

“Then, when are we going to the central continent, my Lord?” He asked again.

“Don’t worry, we’ll be there soon.” Eli laughed.

“Alright,” he said.

Doggo left in disappointment again.

Not long after Eli came out, another person who had come to visit arrived.

“Congratulations, my Lord. It seems that the power of faith is still useful to my Lord.” The mermaid Queen came to visit.

“It’s indeed very useful. I have to thank you for this.” Eli nodded.

Then, he looked at the mermaid Queen’s stomach. Her face was red.

“When is the delivery?” Eli asked curiously.

The Mermaid Queen was shocked.

It turned out that he had already seen through it.

“It should be around three years later.” the mermaid Queen said with her head lowered.

Mermaids had a long reproductive time, not to mention that her child had the blood of the current mermaid Emperor.

“Alright,” Eli nodded.

He was just curious about what was so special about this new son of destiny.

Of course, if he had the chance, he was willing to try to brand the newborn. This might be the last thing he did before leaving the west coast.

Soon, the visiting Mermaid Queen left.

As for Eli, he returned to the Tower and began to experiment with the enhancement of the faith mark.

As the meditation began, faith was slowly consumed.

An hour later, Eli opened his eyes in shock.

...

Double!

It was twice as fast. Of course, this was the fastest possible situation. The consumption of power of faith was also extremely fast.

However, Eli estimated that if he didn’t do anything else, he should be able to maintain a 0.5-fold increase in power of faith. This was because there was still constant replenishment from the West coast, which meant that there were always people on the West Coast who believed in him.

‘It seems that this system is much more powerful than I thought. ‘Eli sighed.

But then a question arose. ‘Why didn’t the mages use this back then? After all, it was a great supplement for mages.’

He guessed that it had something to do with history. After all, the merfolk used to be the mages’ closest ally. Of course, there might be another problem, which was that the Wizards had not realized the benefits of this system. Those below the celestial level did not need it, and those above the celestial level had already formed their own systems, so they did not pay much attention to these things.

It could be considered that Eli had been very lucky!

“The treasure right under their noses?” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

However, it felt really good.

Even Eli had to admit that in terms of support, faith would help him a lot in getting stronger.

He was afraid that the day he left the West Coast would be brought forward.

...

…..

Three years passed in the blink of an eye.

Three years later, Eli was floating in the sky, while the bottom of the sea was the territory of the mermaids.

At this moment, in the largest Palace, a delivery was taking place.

Although it was far away, Eli could faintly hear the mermaid Queen’s pained voice.

With a final loud cry, Eli felt the birth of life.

At the same time, within Eli’s field of vision, in the surrounding void, countless powers of destiny were gathering toward him. To be more precise, they were surging toward the new life. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This was not all. At this moment, Eli could sense that almost all the fish on the West Coast had raised their heads and were looking in his direction, exuding a sense of closeness. This mermaid child had the talent to make the sea tribe feel close to him.

“what? ” Eli blinked in surprise.

It should be known that there were many powerful creatures that were not fully intelligent in the sea tribe. Mermaids like this would probably cause changes in the sea tribe.

“So, is this the blessing of fate? It’s so terrifying!” Eli sighed.

However, he was not envious.

Because it was still the same old saying, the more you gain, the more you lose.

Although this baby had received the favor of fate, there would definitely be many crises in the future. Once he failed, he could also die.

Fate was fair.

At that moment, three creatures appeared on the surface of the sea in the distance.

There was a giant tortoise, a sea lion-like creature, and a giant sea snake.

They were all close to the star rank.

“Get lost!” Eli only took a glance, and a tremendous aura instantly exploded.

The giant turtle and sea lion turned around and ran, but the sea snake still rushed over without any hesitation.

A minute later, the giant sea serpent lay on the surface of the sea, and the surrounding seawater was dyed red. The bloodline curse of Eli had increased from 65% to 68%.

“eat!” Eli called for Hydra to eat.

As for him, he was flying toward the ocean.

The water was directly separated, and Eli reached the underwater Palace. At this moment, in front of the palace, eval was guarding the door.

“Thank you, my Lord.” Eva thanked him.

He didn’t expect that delivery would cause such a huge commotion. Fortunately, Eli was there, or they could be in big trouble. The queen and the newborn might be in danger.

“No problem! I’m here about the contract,” Eli just smiled and looked inside.

“Lord Eli, come in.” The mermaid Queen’s voice came from inside, but it was very weak.

Eli smiled and walked in.

Eval followed behind him, mumbling about the contract.

He felt that Eli wasn’t like a Warlock but more like the group of mages who always liked to talk about contracts and equivalent exchanges.

Soon, Eli saw the mermaid Queen. At this moment, she was lying on a huge shell bed and looked extremely weak. Beside her was a Mermaid Baby, which seemed to be a little girl.

However, what was surprising was that the mermaid Baby exuded a gentle aura.

It wasn’t attractive to humans, but it was attractive to the sea race, and that was why the four-ring sea race creatures were attracted to it.

“Lord Eli, look at this!” The mermaid Queen looked worried,

Her daughter wasn’t ordinary. This was a good thing, but it wasn’t good for them.

“This is your daughter’s talent. It’s just that she’s still young and can’t control it. She should be fine when she becomes an adult.” Eli took a look and said directly.

“That’s great,”

The mermaid Queen’s eyes brightened, but then she became worried again.

The mermaids were a famous long-lived race among the sea race. Their infancy stage was also five hundred years old.

“If you can’t solve it, you can send her to me. I can help suppress the aura and help her survive for as long as I can.” Eli offered.

It was not difficult for him, and he could treat it as an investment. He was also very curious why the baby mermaid had this special power that could enable her to get close to any sea race.

“Wouldn’t that be too much trouble for my Lord?” The mermaid Queen gritted her teeth in embarrassment.

At that moment, she was sure that Eli was really a good person.

The way she looked at Eli had also changed. In the past, she was still a little wary, but now, she was a little kinder to him.

“No, it’s part of the contract.” Eli smiled as he came to the bed.

He looked at the baby mermaid and asked, “What’s your name?”

“Laura!” The mermaid Queen said.

She looked at Eli, looking at her daughter, feeling emotional.

If nothing had happened, her husband would have been the one guarding them, but now it was a human.

Was this fate?

And this might make up for what the child was lacking, even if Eli was just a human.

Was it fatherly love?

??!!

The mermaid Queen blushed again. If this was fatherly love, what was she?

“Then it’s a deal. I’ll be leaving first.” Eli glanced at the mermaid Queen before turning to leave.

Why are you blushing all of a sudden?

However, to be honest, the mermaid Queen was indeed an unparalleled beauty.

Maybe things could happen.
