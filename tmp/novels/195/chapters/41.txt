Chapter 42: The Mask and The Staff

A month later, in the laboratory, Eli stared at the experiment table in front of him without blinking.

On the experiment table, in a container as thick as a bucket, there was a black ball floating. The surface of the ball was full of potholes and looked like there were many small holes. It was the shed skin of the hundred-face beast.

“Next, I’ll add in the upeless flower’s liquid!”

Eli looked at the container calmly and took out another bottle of reagent from the side. The reagent was a strange blue-purple liquid, and he poured it directly into the container.

The liquid flowed into the container, but it did not spread into the water. Instead, it surrounded the sphere inside and began to slowly merge into the sphere.

Just like the first snow melting, the purple gradually wrapped around the black sphere. Then, the sphere began to crack and finally melt.

Half an hour later, there was only a layer of black material floating on the surface of the liquid in the container.

“This is liquid shed!”

Eli waved his right hand, and with a slight movement of his spiritual power, a translucent elemental hand appeared and then gently pulled out the layer of liquid.

The materials had been prepared, and the next step was to refine them.

The elemental hand dragged the materials, and Eli looked to the side. On the ground beside him, a miniature alchemy array had already been carved out. It was layered on top of one another, presenting a complicated yet beautiful feeling.

He placed the materials into the alchemy array and activated his mind power.

Eli’s eyes were fixed on the alchemy array. With the interference of his mental strength, the prototype of a black mask gradually appeared. At the same time, he threw in the other materials one by one, fusing them with the mask.

Half an hour later, the array disappeared.

A black and white mask slowly appeared.

Its left side was black and its right side was white. It was oval in shape, and its surface was extremely smooth. There were only two holes where the eyes should be.

“I’m just missing the last rune.” Looking at the mask, a satisfied smile appeared on Eli’s face.

He took the mask and began to carve all kinds of runes on it.

And this took two hours.

When it was all over, Eli looked at the mask with runes carved on it and really heaved a sigh of relief.

The forging of the wizard tool was a success.

“Let’s call it the faceless one’s mask.” feeling the smooth texture of the mask, Eli named his first wizard tool.

According to the wizard’s classification, this should be a level zero intermediate wizard tool. level zero represented the wizard apprentice stage. After that, wizard tools were divided into three levels, low, intermediate, and high.

This was also a wizard tool that Eli had tailored for himself.

There were only two effects, concealment, and transformation.

By wearing the mask, one could change their appearance at will, as well as hide their soul fluctuations and the strength of their spiritual power.

The former was convenient for the changes in Eli as he grew older in the future and for him to do certain things, while the latter was convenient for Eli to better hide himself.

“This is much more convenient.” Eli took the mask and put it on his face.

Suddenly, the black and white mask seemed to melt. On the other hand, Eli casually imagined Herman’s face in his mind, and a few seconds later, his face had completely turned into Herman’s face.

If Herman saw Eli now, he would probably just shout ‘god’ and faint.

“Maybe I need to find a place to try!” there was a smile in Eli’s eyes. he wanted to go out and test whether this transformation ability was useful or not.

On the same day.

At night, all the casinos were visited by ” harry potter ” again.

All the gamblers claimed that the man was back, and the casino was bleeding in their hearts.

Due to harry potter’s incident, all the casinos had already upgraded their management and detection to guard against him.

But this time, Harry Potter was even more bizarre, like a devil.

There was no trace of him at all.

For a moment, some casinos even suspected that ” Harry Potter ” was not a human.

An urban legend of jun lin city was slowly being born.

…

While the casinos were ready for his arrival, Eli had actually gone home.

After a night’s worth of testing, this transformation ability was really useful. Not only his face but his body’s appearance could also be changed as long as he wanted to.

Coupled with his wizard abilities, he had earned quite a bit of money.

However, to Eli, money was no longer as important as it was in the past. As time passed, money might become less and less useful.

Also, with the completion of the wizard tool, he could change his appearance at any time, so he did not have to worry about monetary issues.

“next up is the staff. At the same time, I can continue with the experiment on the spiritual force potion.”

Just yesterday, the latest batch of purple irises in Locke’s Manor had ripened. The Marquis had sent someone to deliver them to him directly and told him to tell him when he needed to.

…

Another month passed, and in the same laboratory, Eli withdrew his mental strength and looked at the staff in front of him with satisfaction.

This was a staff whose main body was made of spiritual wood. Its outer appearance was that of staff, and it was completely black, giving off a gentlemanly feeling. However, Eli had carved some stable magic circles on it, making the staff as strong as steel, and could be used as a close-combat weapon at a critical moment.

Of course, his close combat ability was only support. The staff’s main role was to help Eli cast spells faster and increase the strength of some spells.

This was a zero-circle low-rank magic wand. It could increase the power of a zero-circle spell by 20%, which was not a small increase.

“Another mission completed. The next most important thing is the experiment of the magic potion”. eli let out a sigh.

Of course, in fact, he had been carrying out experiments on the magic potions for the past month. However, he was very unlucky. Because of the problem with the proportion, he encountered various problems.

For example, the concoctions he made would damage one’s mental energy, cause physical deformity, hallucinations, and so on!

In short, he kept failing. With the success of the staff, eli finally had the time to devote himself to the potion.

However, he couldn’t do that today. He had to go to work.

After briefly tidying up the laboratory, eli walked out.

He changed his clothes, took his cane, and simply tidied his clothes in front of the mirror. He admired his unchanged but handsome face for a while and then walked out of the house.

As soon as he walked out of the house, eli could feel a cold breeze.

A snowflake fell.

Eli looked up. The sky was covered in dark clouds without him knowing, and snowflakes were falling.

Winter was here!

No. Eli shook his head. ‘Many people would freeze to death this winter.’

And if Eli remembered correctly, after winter, the learner certification exam that was held once every four years would also begin. Scholar Clement had said four years ago that he wished for Eli to become a learner.

However, that was a small problem. He would just have to study a little when the time came.

Becoming a learner had never been a problem for Eli.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
