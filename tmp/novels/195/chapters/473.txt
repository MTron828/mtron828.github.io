474 Defeat, During the Experiment

Weng!

The horn’s hum resounded through the sky.

On the ground were the warlocks from the eastern forces of the Western Regions. Holy Sword was flying in the air, and the head of the Siren family stood behind them. Further ahead were two figures standing in front of everyone.

A man and a woman, both wearing white Warlock robes, stood calmly in the sky. They looked indifferent, or rather, they seemed to be exuding arrogance from their bones!

“Are they the Half-Step Fifth Circle Warlocks of the Hamis family? As expected of a member of the Warlock Union. They could actually send out two half-step fifth circle members so easily.”

Holy Sword’s throat moved slightly, and he became even more respectful of the Hamis family.

At this moment, the head of the Siren race was also watching this scene.

“Holy Sword, do you think the Heart of Abyss will be eradicated by the Hamis family because of this?” Vicky turned to her old friend and sighed.

“I don’t think so. After all, that’s the Heart of the Abyss!” Holy Sword frowned. For some reason, he had a bad feeling.

“The army of the Heart of the Abyss has appeared!”

Suddenly, Vicky’s voice rang out. Holy Sword looked towards the ground, and the green land in the distance suddenly turned black and red. It was a large number of Warlocks wearing Abyssal Heart Warlock robes.

Looking at these Warlocks, Holy Sword was stunned. At this moment, the atmosphere became even more intense.

However, in the next second, three black-red auras rose from the sky and headed toward the two Warlocks of the Hamis family at the front. They were filled with bloodthirsty malice.

Seeing this scene, Holy Sword’s expression changed drastically, and his pupils dilated.

Three half-step fifth circle warlock?

How was this possible?

“We’re in trouble!” Vicky’s expression turned ugly.

Everyone had underestimated the Heart of Abyss!

If the situation were not good, they might not be able to leave this place.

..

Holy Tower!

Luo Ye collapsed on the chair behind him, his entire body limp and powerless.

Who would have thought that this war would end up like this?

“They’re all dead. They’re all dead.” The corner of Luo Ye’s mouth twitched, but the tears at the corner of his eyes had already slid down his face. The sadness in his eyes was like a thick fog that could not be dispersed.

To him, Holy Sword was not only the Pagoda Master but also a father-like existence.

“Heart of the Abyss!” Luo Ye gritted his teeth and said these words with hatred.

” Sir, things have already happened. Let’s think about what to do next. After the Heart of the Abyss killed many of us on the battlefield, it sent troops to the east and will arrive in a few days.” In front of him, a Warlock said with a sorrowful expression.

Upon hearing this, Luo Ye closed his eyes.

If they lost the war, they would naturally have to bear the consequences. However, no one had expected that the consequences would be so serious this time. It was so shocking!

The failure of the Holy Tower had already become an established fact, but they still had to continue on their path. They could probably not keep their forces, but most of their forces were still there.

After thinking for a few minutes, Luo Ye sighed and said, “Go join the Bloodline Tower.”

“But my lord, the Bloodline Tower might not be able to resist Heart of the Abyss. Why don’t we try to join the Hamis family? After all, they are a major force in the Warlock Union!” The Warlock suggested.

“No thanks!”

Luo Ye stood up, gritted his teeth, and clenched his fists.

“Although the Hamis family is more powerful, the Western Region is not their main territory. They have already suffered heavy losses, so it is unlikely that they will return here.

” It’s better for us to join the Bloodline Tower. It’s the best choice at the moment. If it’s Sir Eli, the situation might be a little different.”

“Yes, sir!”

The Warlock nodded.

“Go make the arrangements.” Luo Ye’s heart was filled with pain. Then, he walked to the window and took another look at this familiar city. He was afraid that he would never be able to return.

He did not tell the Warlock that there was another reason why he chose the Bloodline Tower.

That was because he wanted revenge!

..

Grassi Land!

“Hiss, is it that exaggerated?” Eli looked at the information in front of him, and his mouth was wide open.

The combat power of the Heart of Abyss was stronger than he had imagined.

“This time, there are three half-step fifth circle warlocks. Including the dead Tuman and Lous, as well as Nero himself, there are already six of them.” Eli took a deep breath.

He wanted the Hamis family to help investigate, but he did not expect the result to be like this!

This time, they had gone overboard!

At this moment, the door opened, and Alida walked in. She said to Eli, “Brother Eli, the Holy Tower has sent someone over, saying that they want to join our Bloodline Tower.”

“Agree to it!” Eli waved his hand.

“Yes, sir!” Alida nodded and left. Time was of the essence.

Watching Alida leave, Eli went to the window, feeling uncertain about his future.

The power of the Heart of Abyss was beyond everyone’s expectations. He was also a little surprised. With so many half-step fifth circle warlocks, even he did not dare to say that he could definitely win.

Moreover, the evil nature of the Heart of Abyss determined that it would definitely pose a huge threat to his current stable environment in the future. He had to deal with it.

“So…Now, I still have to wait for the bloodline experiment to succeed or for a breakthrough. Once I succeed, I’ll have enough power to ensure my stability.” Eli’s will gradually became firm.

Patience, patience.

..

Three days later.

Eli saw Luo Ye again.

However, compared to the past, Luo Ye was no longer as active as before. There was only endless silence and sadness, as well as a desire for revenge.

Looking at him, Eli patted him on the shoulder and didn’t say anything.

“Milord will make a move on the Heart of Abyss in the future, right?” Luo Ye raised his head and asked abruptly.

“Patience!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Eli looked at him and said calmly.

“Alright, then, I will represent the Holy Tower to join the Bloodline Tower.”

Luo Ye knelt on one knee to express his loyalty.

Eli lowered his head and looked at him. He saw the flames of revenge burning in his eyes.

..

The impact of this battle did not only affect Luo Ye and Eli but also the entire Western Region and even the world.

Everyone realized that they had underestimated the Heart of the Abyss and the Western Regions.

The Hamis family was even more furious, but they did not send any more warlocks to the Western Regions. They could no longer bear any more huge losses to the unknown Heart of the Abyss.

In the end, they only suppressed the Heart of the Abyss and expressed their strong condemnation, as well as demanding that the Heart of the Abyss compensate for its losses. Nero ignored them, and the Hamis family was angry and helpless.

Furthermore, during the war, the territories belonging to the Holy Tower and Holy Tower were occupied.

The Bloodline Tower entered a state of alert. Fortunately, it was then that the Heart of the Abyss chose to fall silent.

Meanwhile, Eli’s experiments were still ongoing, and he had made progress during this period of time.

It reached 97%.

It was at this moment that something unexpected happened.

Nero made his move.
