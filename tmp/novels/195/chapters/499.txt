500 Dylan’s Identity

“That’s good!”

Eli nodded and stepped on the Hydra under his feet.

The Hydra let out a hiss and quickly retreated.

” Eli, quickly open it.” In the sky, Dylan looked at Ely with joy.

“We’ll open it when we get back!”

Eli said calmly to the anxious Dylan.

If Dylan’s real body were in the Mage Tower, then it would not be appropriate to open it there. At least, they had to take precautions. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if any accidents happened.

“Alright then.”

Dylan nodded, but his eyes still showed that he was not calm.

Everyone quickly disappeared.

Half a day later.

Three figures were advancing stealthily among the hills in the distance.

The three figures were in front of each other and behind each other. They were all wearing black warlock robes and wide hoods. They even had patterned masks on their faces as if they did not want anyone to know their identities.

“Sir, according to the information we have deciphered, the place ahead should be the place deciphered in the secret inscription diary of the remains of Gray’s student in the eastern region. It should be the place where Gray’s other personal student died.” As they moved forward, a person behind them said.

“Yes.” The person at the front nodded, but there was a flash of joy in his eyes.

There was a sudden discovery in the deciphering of the ruins of the Hamis family. Gray had two direct students. The ruins that day were just one of them. There was another one. It was in the Western Region!

With the idea of monopolizing everything, they immediately buried that piece of information and then sneaked into the Western Region, ready to search for relics to see if they could find anything.

“Sir, there are still about 15,000 meters left!” Warlocks reminded him again.

Everyone continued to move forward.

However, when they were still ten thousand meters away, the expression of the Warlock in the lead changed.

The ground in front of him was covered with a thick layer of dust. Between the hills, there were a large number of trees, soil, and even mountains and land that had fallen.

It was as if another world had covered this place.

“Something’s wrong. Speed up!” The leading Warlock cursed.

At this moment, the three of them looked at the mess on the ground and looked at each other.

“Damn it, what happened to here? How did this place get discovered?!” The Warlock could not believe it. With a punch, he directly smashed the tree that was inserted upside down into pieces.

Without a doubt, they were a step too late.

But who could it be? Bloodline Tower? Impossible. How could they know about this place? This place was so remote…The other families of the Warlock Union? That was possible. Perhaps there was a traitor among them.

As the Warlock pondered, he couldn’t help but look at the two people beside him.

“Return to the clan immediately and let the clan head decide!” His expression darkened as he slowly said.

“Yes, sir!” The two people who didn’t know the situation nodded.

Soon, the three of them left.

..

At the same time.

Eli and the others had already returned to the Grassi Land.

They left in secret, so no one knew when they returned.

When everyone entered the Grassi Land, Dylan shouted excitedly, “Eli, Eli, hurry up. I can’t wait any longer!”

“Okay!”

In the next second, countless spell formations instantly rose up on the grassy ground, and a layer of thick fog completely blocked the vision of the outside world.

After taking the necessary precautions, Eli stretched out his hand, and a Mage Tower appeared. The surroundings were wrapped with sealing spells, and these spells were slowly being unlocked.

Bang!

Eli threw it out, and a mage tower dozens of meters tall appeared on the ground in front of him. The huge weight made the ground tremble slightly.

It was only now that Eli had the time to observe the Tower.

The Mage Tower had a black exterior and was divided into three floors. However, there were no windows on the outside. The only way to the outside world was a closed door at the entrance. There was also an obvious rune on it, which should require a specific Warlock to open.

“Dylan.” Upon seeing this, Eli turned to Dylan. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Dylan’s eyes were fixed on the mage tower as if he had lost all reason. He shook his head after hearing what Eli said and looked at Eli.

“Eli, I just remembered something, including the way to open the door. My main body is definitely inside. Can I open it now?”

“Open it.”

Eli nodded. The measures had been taken.

Dylan received the confirmation and ran straight to the mage tower.

When he arrived in front of the door, he straightened his body and leaned his head against the door. Then, a dazzling rune instantly drilled out of his brain, emitting a faint orchid light as it approached the rune on the door.

Kakaka!

As if it was a match, the door began to tremble slightly, and the rune slowly disappeared.

At this time, Eli was also observing the rune and made some new discoveries.

“So it’s hidden in the brain. If it weren’t for Dylan’s brain, if it was directly destroyed or cracked by other Warlocks, the Mage Tower would probably self-destruct.” Eli silently retreated a few kilometers, calmly watching this scene!

Such measures meant that there was definitely something extraordinary inside.

“Let’s hope that we’ll gain something.” Eli pursed his lips in anticipation.

Soon, the door slowly opened.

Through the door, the first floor was empty. There was nothing.

Dylan seemed to know where his body was and ran inside.

When he came out again, it was already three minutes later, but he was dragging something.

It was a coffin made of blue crystal, emitting a faint light. Inside the coffin was an ordinary-looking body. It was an ordinary robot at the first or second circle. There was nothing special about it. The only thing special about it was that it was missing a head, which should be Dylan’s brain!

“But… Just this?” Sensing that there was no danger, Eli walked over and asked Dylan curiously.

“Milord, don’t be anxious!”

Dylan chuckled. Then, he pressed a button on the coffin, and the coffin instantly turned into a flowing liquid that slowly revealed the robot inside.

Dylan didn’t even look at the robot. He directly took off the robot’s thigh and gently pried it open, revealing what was inside between the silver threads.

A key that was about the length of a palm and a blue chip!

He took out the two of them, then took out the chip and placed it on his forehead. Immediately, a small groove appeared, and the chip entered.

Then Dylan trembled, and one could even see flowing data in his eyes.

Eli did not stop him. The chip was a Mechanical Mage Creation. Mechanical creations were very ordinary things. They were used to store knowledge and past experiences. They did not have consciousness. In fact, this was also the reason why Mechanical Sorcerers could always maintain their rationality.

A few minutes later, Dylan’s eyes gradually became clear.

Eli was also looking at Dylan, waiting for an answer.

Dylan also smiled and looked at Eli. “Sir, I remember who I am. I am Gray’s youngest direct student, a fourth-circle Mechanical Mage.”

Eli’s eyes lit up.

As expected, Dylan was related to Gray, and they were very close.

“Then this is?” Eli looked at the key,

Dylan handed the key to him and chuckled. “Sir Eli, have you ever opened a Mage Tower as big as a planet?”
