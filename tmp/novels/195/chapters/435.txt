436 Faith Descends

Green Field!

The Moon Shadow Forest was the new territory of the elves and the current construction site of the elf palace!

However, at this moment, the atmosphere here was so heavy that the air seemed to be about to freeze.

Elven Queen Erwin stood on the tall steps outside the Elven Palace, followed by five Elven Priests. Behind them were four circle elves from different races, all of them holding weapons and looking up.

It was not just them. At this moment, countless elves in the entire forest were holding bows and arrows in their hands and looking at the sky.

At this moment, there were many Feather Men flying in the sky. They had human-like bodies and pure white wings. They held sharp metal fur in their hands and stared at the ground like giant eagles as if they were ready to hunt at any time.

There were seven or eight more at the front of these Feather Men, but each of them were in the fourth circle.

The one at the front had reached the limit of Radiant Sun. It was the featherman who promised to bring back Eli’s head back then.

At this moment, he lowered his head and looked down coldly. More accurately, he was looking at the elves on the ground and the huge statue not far away.

“Is that the mage they made up?” Yu Yun ignored the elves and carefully observed the statue.

” Yes, my lord. We have been investigating for many years, but we have not found any traces of that Mage. ” A featherman beside him replied.

“I also suspect that this was made up by the elves. Perhaps they were weak back then, so they thought of using the reputation of the mages to make those races not dare to act rashly. After all, the outer world is filled with a layer of world fragments. It’s not that easy to break in!” Another old Feather Man guessed.

” Sigh, it looks like I wasted my trip. But maybe that mage doesn’t dare to show his face! ” Yu Yun sneered and said disdainfully.

The other feathermens also smiled! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

That’s right. Lord Yu Yun was a fourth-circle peak Radiant Sun creature. At this level, even in the current World, he was a top powerhouse. If he advanced further, their Feathermen race could even enter the core area of the greenfield with more abundant resources!

Even if there were mages, they believed that Lord Yu Yun would be able to deal with them easily!

“Wait another five minutes. If that Mage still doesn’t show himself, we’ll destroy this place!”

“Yes, sir!”

…

“Sir, you must come! ” Erwin stood in front of the celestial, biting her lip!

Half an hour ago, the Feathermen had invaded them. With their powerful strength, they arrived at the core area of the elves and surrounded them. At first, they wanted to resist, but when the Featherman in the lead displayed his strength, they understood that everything was useless.

That was a creature on the level of the Radiant Sun. They could not resist it at all!

“My lord!” Erwin prayed.

Erwin wasn’t the only one praying. The Elven Priests were also praying. They couldn’t do much against the Feathermen from the Inner Zone!

Even if it was just Yu Yun alone, it was enough for the few of them to fight to the death. Not to mention that Yu Yun was not the only one from the Featherman Race!

…..

Time passed by slowly!

Five minutes later!

“Forget it. It looks like you’ve disappointed me. What a cowardly Mage!” Yu Yun clicked his tongue.

In his heart, he was even more disdainful of Mages. It seemed that the so-called Mages were only so-so!

No wonder they left in such a sorry state thousands of years ago. They were just weak and brainless people like the Pigmen.

As a new generation of feathermen, they should have a strong will to improve themselves. How could they be scared by a Mage? In his opinion, the Feather King should have been replaced by him long ago.

He shook his head and turned to glance at the Feather Men. Then, he waved his hand indifferently and said casually, “Attack!”

Yu Yun gave the order, and the Feather Men instantly nodded. In the next second, they flapped their wings and flew towards the ground. The many fourth-circle Feather Men flew directly toward the elves of the Elven Shrine.

At this moment, the elves in the forest were shocked. They pulled their bows and arrows and launched a counterattack. The fourth circle elves in front of the elven temple flew into the sky and started fighting the feather men. The elven priests also attacked.

“Queen, please enter the palace and leave through the secret passage. I’ll block them!” The moon elf priestess looked at Erwin with a serious expression.

“No need. Everyone is fighting. How can I leave?” Erwin shook her head and refused.

“Alright then.” The Moon Elf Priestess nodded, but her approval of Erwin increased.

Erwin then took out a slender longsword and flew into the sky with light steps to fight the low-level Feathermen. Seeing that the Queen had come out to fight, the elves were encouraged, and their momentum directly surpassed the Feathermen.

“Yo, the new queen of the elves?” Yu Yun looked down at Ivan and flew toward him, but he was stopped by a few Elven Priests.

” Ugly featherman, your opponents are us. ” The Moon Elf Priests looked at Yu Yun with solemn gazes.

Ugly?

The smile on Yu Yun’s face instantly disappeared, and his eyes gradually burned with anger. He was the most popular featherman among the females!

“Alright, then, let me play with you for a while!” Yu Yun shook his head, his gaze becoming sharp.

In the next second, a storm suddenly appeared. Six tornadoes rolled up from the void and suppressed the six priests.

The battle began!

As time passed, the battle became clearer. Although the elves had a good fighting spirit, there was still a big gap in strength. Soon, the elves fell into a disadvantage. Even Erwin was surrounded by a few Feather Men. Many wounds appeared on her body, and her clothes were torn, revealing some skin!

As for the few Elven Priests in the sky, although they were fighting one against six, they were suppressed.

Finally, after a counterattack, Yu Yun found an opportunity. In an instant, countless feather-shaped wind blades appeared behind him, and they flew toward the priests like waves. The priests were unable to withstand them, and they directly smashed into the ground. Large pits appeared on the ground, stirring up a large amount of smoke!

Erwin, who saw this scene, was also shocked. She found an opportunity to leave the battlefield and fly directly to the ground.

The smoke on the ground had already dissipated, and a few Elven Priests struggled to get up from the crater. They spat out blood and trembled as they looked at the clouds in the sky. Erwin flew over and stood beside the Moon Elven Priestess!

“I’m so disappointed. The elves are really weak. Surrender. If you surrender and make your queen my slave forever, perhaps I can let you off!” Yu Yun said calmly as he looked down at the elves from above.

Hearing Yu Yun’s words, many of the elves were furious. This was a complete insult to the proud elves. To the elves who valued their dignity, this was absolutely impossible.

Even though Erwin and the other Elven Priests were injured, their eyes were filled with rage.

...

“In your dreams!” Erwin shouted angrily.

“Hahahaha, then I can only ask you to die.” Yu Yun helplessly shrugged his shoulders and only said regretfully,”It’s a pity that I didn’t get to see that cowardly Mage!”

“Oh, you wanted to see me?”

At this time, a voice suddenly sounded out. Yu Yun was startled.

“Sir, that statue?” At this moment, a celestial of the Feather Race suddenly pointed at a statue in the distance and shouted.

Everyone went to take a look.

The huge statue standing in front of the elven temple was currently emitting a golden light. A pillar of light shot into the sky, and within the pillar of light, a figure wearing a black wizard robe and holding a staff slowly walked out with a calm expression.

“Are you the mage?”

Yu Yun looked at the sudden change and asked with a frown. The reason why he asked this was because the person in front of him was almost the same as the statue!

“Aren’t you looking for me?” Eli replied with a smile, but his smile became colder and colder!

This time, he was a little late and almost didn’t make it!

...

” Oh, it’s you. Then let me take a look at the so-called Mage! ” After Yu Yun confirmed who was behind Eli, he looked at Eli and smiled contemptuously.

” In front of absolute strength, you’re just here to die! ”

The wings behind Yu Yun flapped. His tone was disdainful, but he was already prepared for battle!

“You’re right!”

Eli nodded.

In the next second, a huge celestial body emerged from his body and transformed into an elemental giant that was a hundred meters tall. He lowered his head and looked down at the feather men. With the help of the giant statue of faith, 40% of the aura transmitted by Eli erupted in an instant, sweeping across the entire battlefield like a storm.

Sensing the aura, the smile on Yu Yun’s face disappeared bit by bit as ifIt seemed like Perhaps this aura seemed to be much stronger than he had imagined. The warning in his bloodline also told him that if a battle broke out, he might die!

Gulp!

Yu Yun’s throat moved slightly. At this moment, he suddenly seemed to understand where the Feather King’s fear of Mages came from!

He was too strong!

Was this what a mage was like?
