400 Eternal Shock

“Lord Ma Mu, please take action.”

At this moment, at the back of the battlefield, Ma Mu had never felt so tormented as that day!

He stood outside a tent behind the battlefield, staring blankly at the brutal scene in the sky!

There was only one thought in his mind. Could he do this?

!!

He felt that he couldn’t do it!

“This is too ridiculous!” Ma Mu took a deep breath and listened to the voice in his ear. He felt a little tortured!

After more than ten seconds, he hesitated for a moment before flying towards the battlefield.

He was a Radiant Sun Warlock, how could Eli kill him in seconds?

….

On the battlefield!

Countless Warlocks raised their heads to look at the rear of the battlefield. The miserable cries of the celestials in the sky echoed in their ears from time to time. In this short period of time, another celestial had died.

” Eli, I’m starting to doubt if you’re really a Warlock from the Bloodline Tower’s branch! ”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in the sky. Everyone looked up.

In the sky, Ma Mu’s figure slowly appeared. His eyes were deep as he stared at Eli. He was wearing silver-white armor that glowed with scales, like a silver sun in the sky. Behind him, there was a large black-purple aura, as if endless darkness was brewing.

The aura belonging to the Radiant Sun Warlocks was also fully unleashed. The radiation power made the Warlocks on the ground somewhat unstable!

” This is the Lord of the Radiant Sun stage. He’s a warlock from our Akasha family. ”

” It’s a completely different feeling from the patriarch. He can definitely defeat the demon, Eli! ”

“This is the Radiant Sun!”

All the Warlocks of the Akasha Family were filled with hope, and their eyes were filled with something called hope.

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower looked at this person and felt a lot of pressure. However, everyone still felt that there was nothing wrong with Sir Eli. After all, his performance just now was invincible.

“No, I’m from the West Coast.” Eli had given up on chasing after the other celestial. He transformed into his human form and looked at Ma Mu in the distance.

“Hmph, I don’t believe it.” Ma Mu sneered, but his tone gradually became tough.” Eli, you are very strong, unexpectedly strong. The Eight-Armed Naga family is much stronger than you think. If you surrender today, I can promise you on behalf of the family head that I won’t attack you! ”

“Haha!” Eli sneered, “Your Eight-Armed Naga clan’s bloodline cultivation land has encountered a problem. You need a place with abundant life force to make a new bloodline cultivation land, and your northern side has all suffered losses. I’m afraid this is not something you can decide!

” Actually, I just want to quietly become stronger, but there are always some scumbags who want to interrupt me!”

This was also what Eli thought. He really just wanted to develop in peace. As for the Eight-Armed Naga family, as long as they did not provoke Eli, Eli really did not want to fight for no reason!

“Alright then!” Ma Mu’s face gradually darkened. It was just as Ely had said.

They indeed had irreconcilable conflicts.

” Then let me see how strong Eli, the Tower Master, is! ” Ma Mu didn’t waste any time.

Countless dark purple bloodline aura emitted from every pore on his body, and endless purple aura coiled around his back like a tornado. The silver armor on his body emitted waves of light as dazzling as the sun!

He took out a longsword with his other hand and flew towards Eli.

On the other side, Eli was holding a spiral staff in his hand as he fought with Ma Mu!

In an instant, countless bloodlines turned into sharp blades that soared into the sky. The two Warlocks were locked in a battle, and Ma Mu activated his sword. Countless blood essence was infused into them, and sword auras tore through the sky. The clouds in the sky were cut into countless pieces. Opposite him, Eli held a spiral staff and blocked every attack of Ma Mu. He did not cause any damage to Eli!

“That’s possible!”

Ma Mu was shocked.

The Eight-Armed Naga was a bloodline that was best at close combat. They had all kinds of weapons at their fingertips. Any item in their hands could turn rotten into magical, killing weapons.

Even celestials of the same level would find it difficult to catch their breath under their storm-like attacks, but Eli was so relaxed.

On the other hand, Eli felt that it was very natural. Although he relied on his powerful spells to overwhelm others, it did not mean that his close-combat skills were bad. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After all, he had 2000 years to practice!

“The lord is being suppressed!”

“Isn’t Milord a Radiant Sun? How is this possible?”

On the ground, the Akasha Family looked at Ma Mu, who was gradually falling into a disadvantage and fell silent.

The hope that they originally had seemed to be destroyed bit by bit!

In the sky, after another attack, Eli also found an opportunity to dodge the blade. His whorled staff directly attacked Ma Mu. Ma Mu could not dodge in time and was hit directly. He spat out blood and flew toward the ground!

Bang!

A huge pit with a radius of several dozen meters appeared on the ground, and many Warlocks even died from this accident!

At this moment, the Warlocks of the Akasha family were silent. They were at a loss, not knowing what to do!

Smoke filled the pit.

Ten seconds later, the smoke dissipated, revealing the figure inside. At this time, Ma Mu used his sword to prop himself up. The silver armor on his body had already shattered, revealing the muscles inside!

At this moment, he raised his head and looked at Eli in the sky. Eli was also looking at him!

” The Eight-Armed Naga that specializes in close combat is only so-so! ” Eli smiled.

Humiliation!

Pure humiliation!

Ma Mu felt his breath churn, and the anger in his heart could no longer be endured.

He threw his longsword to the side, and the broken armor on his body fell off piece by piece. His body emitted a more dark purple blood aura, which instantly enveloped a few miles around him. Even the entire battlefield was instantly enveloped. Many Warlocks directly wailed in pain!

...

When the celestials in the sky saw this scene, they all used their methods to teleport the Warlocks dozens of kilometers away from the battlefield!

At this moment, the smoke gradually dispersed, revealing a figure inside. It was a magnificent body.

It was 500 meters tall, and its entire body was blackish-purple in color. Blood aura swirled around its body like smoke. Its huge head was like a demon’s, and its eyes were filled with cold, killing intent. Each of its teeth was several meters long, like sharp blades.

Its upper body was still roughly human-like, but it had eight arms on both sides. Every arm was covered with pitch-black fur. As for its lower body, it had a huge snake tail covered with dark black scales.

As soon as he appeared, he let out a heaven-shaking roar in the distance. His blood essence transformed into weapons that were held in eight hands. His body was also covered in blood essence, like chain mail.

“Eli!” Ma Mu roared.

The Radiant Sun Warlock immediately activated his strongest state at this moment. Even the Warlocks more than ten kilometers away took a deep breath.

Opposite him, a huge shadow dragon also slowly appeared, emitting a huge cold aura.

However, the Eight-Armed Naga looked even more oppressive than Ely.

The two figures faced each other. The surrounding clouds had long been dispersed. Everyone could only see a dense dark purple blood aura and endless shadows.

At this moment, everyone saw Eli suddenly move. His body suddenly began to glow with a dense bloody light.

...

At the same time, endless shadows gathered in front of him like a huge black hole.

“Radiant Sun Warlock, let’s see how you’re going to block this attack!”

Eli looked at Ma Mu. He had already unleashed his third level of Explosive Blood and was preparing the Shadow Dragon’s Breath.

At this moment, Ma mu was also staring at Eli, his eyes filled with violence and cruelty!

“Come at me!”

Ma Mu extended his eight arms, and the eight Vitality weapons in his hands were raised high at the same time. The power of the Eight-Armed Naga exploded at this moment, and his blood vessels tensed to the extreme. Even his muscles began to crack. In the next second, eight black lights bloomed in an instant!

“Destroy the world!”

Ma Mu shouted loudly. Eight purple-black lights crossed a few miles and gathered into a ball. Then, they flew toward Eli.

At the same time, the Shadow Dragon’s Breath was ready. A shadow that was over a thousand meters long suddenly erupted. The surrounding air trembled, and cracks appeared in space. The surrounding air instantly fell into darkness, and the Warlocks a few kilometers away was sucked into darkness too.

Everyone widened their eyes.

“Protect the Warlocks!” Lobelia shouted.

A pink blood shield enveloped all the Warlocks, and the other Celestial Warlocks also protected the Warlocks around them.

Then, the battle had already stopped. Everyone was staring blankly at the darkness in the distance.

” Why did we provoke such an enemy?! ”

“Can Lord Ma mu really win?”

” What a joke. We still need the opponent’s celestials to protect us! ”

The Warlocks of the Akasha Family stood rooted to the ground with mixed feelings. Their pride before the war had long disappeared without a trace.

The Bloodline Tower was terrifyingly powerful.

No, it should be said that Eli was terrifyingly strong.

At this moment, in the black light in the distance, a dark purple light suddenly collided with the black light. Accompanied by a loud bang, a white light blossomed and tore apart the night sky. It was as if a ray of light had illuminated the world. Then, all the shadows and the black-purple blood essence gradually disappeared.

Everything dispersed.

In the distant sky, Ma Mu’s huge body appeared in front of everyone.

His upper body had completely disappeared, leaving only his huge snake tail standing. Countless dark purple blood was emitted from his waist like smoke. As the blood dissipated, the rest of Ma Mu’s body slowly disappeared like ashes!

Ma Mu was dead!

And this wasn’t just the entire area. In the distance, the ground within dozens of kilometers had already turned into nothingness. Whether it was the mountains or the streams, they had all disappeared, leaving behind a huge crater that emitted the aura of a celestial.

Opposite Ma Mu was Eli.

At this moment, the huge shadow dragon flapped its wings and flew in the air. Under its feet was Nightfall City!

Earlier, Nightfall City was wrapped in shadows and pulled up into the sky by Eli. Eli did this to protect the city while he killed Ma Mu.
