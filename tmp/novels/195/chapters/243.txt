244 Udo’s Message

“AI!”

Looking at Vivika leaving, Eli shook his head.

She knew that there might be a danger, but she still had to go. She really had no choice!

Not to mention the ruins, there were at least a few forces with third circle later stage warlocks. How could her small body withstand them? Even Eli didn’t have absolute confidence in defeating some of them.

!!

After all, not everyone’s talent was weak. Those with good talent would already receive a significant boost when they advanced to the third circle, not to mention advancing to the late stage. This was also the reason why Eli was unwilling to go.

Even for him, there was a certain risk.

So, Eli wasn’t planning on going. It was up to Vivika’s luck.

..

Three days later.

Early in the morning.

Looking at the streams of light in the sky flying into the distance, Eli lowered his head.

The ruins were not too far away from here, so they chose to fly there.

As for the moment, Eli wasn’t in the mood to pay attention to them.

He stared at the fishing rod in front of him with a serious look.

“Hahaha, my brother Herman, I told you that you have beginner’s luck earlier!”

Beside Eli, old John winked and laughed.

As the two of them had nothing to do, they would go fishing at Silver Moon Lake when they had free time. However, it seemed that the last time they went fishing, Eli had used up all his luck. He never caught another fish, not even a small one.

Looking at the motionless fishing rod and the calm water surface, Eli finally had to admit that his luck wasn’t that good.

“It’s okay, as long as we’re happy!” Said Eli to old John with a smile.

He could have used some wizard methods to fish, but he didn’t do so. After all, he did it for pleasure, not for any gain.

“Yes, brother, you’re open-minded!” Old John nodded in agreement.

As a two-circle warlock, how could he be short of fish? Naturally, it was for the sake of happiness.

Fishing time always passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was dusk.

The orange setting sun shone on the shimmering water. Eli and old John were drinking tea and chatting leisurely. As for Eli, he still didn’t hook anything.

It was a peaceful time.

“Hey, what’s that?!”

Suddenly, old John shot up from his recliner and looked into the distance.

Eli found it strange and looked in the direction he was pointing.

The water in the distance seemed to have started to gather layers of elements, which began to surge like waves. At the same time, the entire water surface began to boil, and countless fish jumped out of the water, absorbing the power of the elements.

“That’s a first circle immortal spirit fish!”

“That’s the Sawtooth fish from the second circle!”

Obviously, they weren’t the only ones who were alarmed by the strange movement. All the fishermen on the riverbank had noticed the change, and they were all dumbfounded as they looked at the rare fish!

“The silver Moon banquet!”

Everyone also realized that this was a once-in-fifty-years party. They were all happy and began to take out more fishing rods.

In just a few minutes, fish were caught one after another.

Looking at the fish leaping out, Eli and old John also jumped down from their deckchairs. They looked at the crazy fish and exchanged looks!

“f * ck! That’s the blood God fish!”

Old John was surprised to see a big blood-red fish in the school of fish.

This was one of the most precious fish here. It could increase the concentration of the bloodline and even achieve a bloodline transition. Usually, it would only appear during distinguished events.

The appearance of the blood God fish clearly surprised many people. Eli was still calm, but then another fish jumped out of the water, and he couldn’t stay calm anymore.

Among the school of fish, a multi-colored translucent fish emerged from the water, absorbing a large number of elements. It was surrounded by a multi-colored light.

“That’s the first circle element’s heart!” He exclaimed.

Old John looked at the fish in surprise.

It’s said that the element’s heart is a fish that is formed by the condensation of natural elements. It is pure and flawless. Consuming it can directly enhance a mage’s talent. Although it is not very useful now, it was once a treasure in the mage world!

The element’s heart!

Even Eli was tempted by the fish!

He blinked his eyes!

He had been shackled by his talent for a long time, and even a little improvement would be of great help to him. It could help him save tens, hundreds, or even thousands of years of effort. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, the lake’s elemental energy was turbulent. Under the control of such a huge amount of natural force, even warlocks would find it difficult to use their bloodline power, let alone Mages. Thus, they could not directly enter the lake and could only fish from the shore!

“I’m fishing!”

Eli took a deep breath and looked at the lake with a determined gaze.

He was determined to get the element’s heart, and even the gods could not stop him!

He took out five fishing rods and started to fish seriously.

Old John was in a similar situation. With the appearance of these two extremely valuable fishes, everyone realized a problem. This year’s Silver Moon banquet was much more lively than usual!

...

At this moment, the people of Silver Moon town had also arrived one by one. They took out their fishing rods, and in an instant, almost all of the fishing rods were stretched into the huge Silver Moon Lake.

Everyone was looking forward to the harvest.

So was Eli.

Usually, the banquet would last for two days.

The first day passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli’s eyes were fixed on the fishing rod, his lips pursed.

In one day, although he had some gains, it was not much. As for the element’s heart, it was far worse. Then he asked and found out that it had been hundreds of years since someone had caught that kind of fish!

This made Eli a little depressed.

His luck seemed to have run out on the first day of fishing.

“It seems like I can only wait for the next time!” Eli sighed, no longer holding any hope.

Once every 50 years, it seemed like he would have to come here many times!

...

He wasn’t in a hurry anyway, so what was there to panic about?

With that in mind, Eli relaxed as well. He laid back on the recliner and began to relax his fishing. Everyone around him was dumbfounded at this scene.

Everyone was anxiously fishing, but you actually let go!

All of them were sneering in their hearts, but they didn’t say anything. They were all very busy at the moment and didn’t have time to care about this.

“Brother, you’re really something else!” Old John looked at Eli and drew a cold breath. He also realized what he was doing. Wasn’t he losing his fun of fishing?

He might as well copy what Eli did and lay down too.

The two of them smiled at each other.

For a moment, the relaxed two people formed a sharp contrast with the anxious others.

Leisurely!

Pulling back the rod when the fish came and lying flat when there were no fish, Eli felt much more comfortable.

What element’s heart? I’ll catch you sooner or later.

“Sir Herman!”

But at this moment, a call suddenly came, and a first circle Warlock ran out from the crowd, running towards Eli!

“Hey, you’re the first circle warlock who took us to the mine that day. What’s the matter? ” Eli looked at the person who came and was a little surprised.

“yes, it’s like this. Just yesterday, Lord udo suddenly sent me a message and asked me to deliver it to you!” The first circle warlock took out a crystal ball!

“Oh?” Eli had a strange expression as he took the crystal ball.

Didn’t udo go to the secret ruins? Why was there a message?

Eli’s mental power touched the crystal ball, and in the data space, a piece of information wrapped in mental power was inside. This was used for identification, and when it sensed Eli’s aura, his mental power opened up directly, and the information surged toward Eli.

“the ruins are fake. This is the heart of darkness’s scheme. They have allied with several forces in an attempt to get rid of us and then unify the West Coast. We have been trapped and separated. I used the loopholes in the blockade to send this to you as compensation for saving my life!”

It was a very direct text. It was as if Eli could feel Udo’s anger and shock, as well as a deep sense of fear.

Vivika had guessed correctly. There was really a trap!

At this thought, Eli’s gaze turned serious.

The first circle warlock and old John saw that Eli’s expression had sunk, and they instantly felt that the surrounding temperature seemed to have dropped by a few degrees, so they didn’t dare to speak.

After half an hourglass, Eli finally raised his head.

He said to Old John, who was not far away, “I have a small matter to attend to, so I might need to go out for a while!”

“You want to leave now? Then what about the fishing? someone has to help you.” Old John was surprised.

“Fishing?” Eli frowned and looked around. When he looked past a street corner not far away, his eyes lit up.

“It’s fine. Someone will replace me!”
