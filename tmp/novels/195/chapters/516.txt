517 Arrival

Stomp!

Countless footsteps stepped into the Western Region, and Azak first looked at the vast land in the distance with hatred, then turned his head to look behind him with a smile.

“Sir Anwar, this is the territory of the Bloodline Tower.”

“Yes.” The white-robed Warlock nodded calmly and looked around.

Three Germinal Warlocks followed him from both sides and behind him were hundreds of thousands of Warlocks under the Hamis family, including hundreds of fourth-circle Warlocks.

For this war, the Hamis family chose to mobilize most of their forces.

After all, this time was different from the past. If this dragged on for a long time, it would be a disaster for them. Therefore, they had to resolve it quickly and then recuperate.

“Sir, the Bloodline Tower’s defensive line should be a few dozen kilometers ahead. What should we do?” At this moment, a Warlock flew over and asked the white-robed Warlock, Anwar.

“Directly crush it!”

He said calmly, his tone as relaxed as if they were facing an ant.

The Warlocks behind him nodded in agreement.

This should be the case.

When the Hamis family patriarch came out, there were no more surprises.

Just as everyone continued to set off, Anwar suddenly seemed to see something. He suddenly raised his hand, and a bolt of lightning instantly crossed dozens of kilometers. Then, an explosion of ” fireworks ” bloomed in the distance. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Sir, that should be the Bloodline Tower’s airship!” Azak said.

” Interesting. We can study it after the war. There must be a reason why this small force can grow so quickly. If we can take over their technology, three hundred years of loss might not be a bad thing. It might even be an opportunity for our family.” Anwar narrowed his eyes.

It was said that one looked down on the enemy tactically and valued the enemy strategically.

Anwar was no exception. Although he looked down on the Bloodline Tower and he had only been awake for a few days, he knew that the Bloodline Tower was not a force that rose up because of Eli’s combat power.

He was the core and the system. Each aspect had a great learning significance.

“Good!”

The others laughed in a flattering manner.

Anwar didn’t react, but his eyes gradually turned serious. “Tell the people behind us to hurry up. We’re going to break through their first line of defense today!”

“Yes, sir!”

..

Half a day had passed when Eli received the news.

“The first line of defense of the Bloodline Tower has been broken?” Eli looked at Vivika and Alida in surprise.

“Yes, my lord,” Vivika said with lingering fear.

She was originally at the front line, but she had returned early due to some matters. Who would have thought that the Hamis family would suddenly attack, allowing her to escape the disaster?

“This time, the Hamis family has mobilized too much power. They have four fifth rings, especially one of the white-robed Warlocks. With a wave of his hand, more than a dozen celestials at the defensive line died before they could react.

“We have checked the information. That white-robed Warlock should be the head of the Hamis family, Anwar Hamis. He is a powerful Divine Tree Warlock!” Alida pursed her lips, feeling a great deal of pressure.

“Anwar!”

Eli muttered the name silently.

“Milord, what should we do?” Vivika asked worriedly.

“What should we do?”

Eli slowly stood up and narrowed his eyes. “What can we do? Naturally, we want them to stay on this land.”

“Stay?”

The two of them looked at Eli, and their eyes widened at the same time.

“Let’s go. Let’s see how strong this old man is.”

Eli called out to the distance, and with a hiss, Hydra’s head appeared by the window. Its huge eyes looked at Eli and the other two before it lowered its head.

At this moment, the window slowly opened, and Eli walked toward the window. He then jumped onto Hydra’s head and turned to the two of them.

“Do you want to take a look?”

“Yes!”

The two of them looked at each other and nodded.

Soon, the Hydra flew into the sky.

Eli stood on the head at the front of the huge head.

The strong wind blew in Eli’s wizard robe. Vivika and Alida stood on both sides with different expressions on their faces.

“Sir, are we going just like this?” Alida asked.

“What else?” Eli glanced at him.

“Uh…”

Alida was a little stunned, and a hint of regret flashed through her heart.

That was a Divine Tree Warlock!

Just like that?

When he turned around, he saw Vivika smiling faintly. She spread her arms and felt the breeze in the sky as if she wasn’t worried at all.

The corner of Alida’s mouth twitched. Even you are so calm?!

However, it seemed reasonable when he recalled that Vivika seemed to have been brought up by Eli.

“Alright, alright, alright. I hope everything goes well.”

The worry on Alida’s face was gone as well, and she began to put them down.

It didn’t matter. She wasn’t the one fighting anyway. At most, she would just die.

..

Just like that.

After Alida had been worried for the entire journey, they finally saw their destination. It was the location of the second line of defense in the eastern region, the Scythia Plains.

A huge city stood on the plains, and a steel defense line was built outside the plains. At this moment, hundreds of airships were flying in the sky, and the ground was filled with nervous Warlocks!

Opposite them, countless Warlocks of the Hamis clan were glaring at them. Those high-level Warlocks were flying at the very front, with the white-robed Warlock, Anwar, flying at the very front.

It looked like they were preparing to attack.

“Just in time!” Eli smiled and patted Hydra. “Just fly straight into the center of the battlefield. Don’t worry!”

Hiss!

The Hydra let out a screech and increased its speed once again.

The rapid speed and sound attracted the attention of the entire battlefield. Countless people looked up.

“It’s Sir Hydra. No, it’s Sir Eli above!”

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower shouted excitedly.

One had to know that the opponent this time was too strong. If they started the battle like this, they definitely had no chance of victory. However, it was different now that their lord was here!

In the distance, Anwar also looked up.

His gaze pierced through space and met Eli’s eyes. A smile appeared on his face.

“You’re here!”

Anwar narrowed his eyes as if he was talking to Eli.

“To kill you!”

Eli said calmly.

After saying that, he didn’t waste any more time. The Tree of Law began to ripple, and a leaf of the Law of Shadow swayed without any wind. Then, it began to fall and then slowly floated down, as if it had traveled through time and space and landed in Eli’s hand.

With a wave of his hand, the leaf floated towards Anwar.

“Come, let me see. Did the Warlock Union give you courage? How dare you behave atrociously here!”

Eli looked at Anwar, but his expression became even more indifferent.

He looked at him.

It was as if he was looking at an ant!

At this moment, Anwar, who was standing nearby, had a calm expression on his face.

However, when he saw the leaf, a hint of shock rippled in his eyes, and his mouth gradually widened.

“Thousand Leaves!”
