226 Eli’s Suspicions

“We won!”

In the White Tower, many representatives revealed expressions of disbelief.

They looked at the Chairman’s seat. Ross was sitting calmly in the main seat, and the old Rawls was sitting beside him, his eyes slightly trembling.

“My Lord, is this true?” Someone asked Ross.

Half an hour ago, Ross suddenly gathered everyone to attend the meeting and then threw out this bombshell just now. How could everyone not be surprised?

After all, just a few days ago, the entire White Tower had been in a state of confusion. When they heard about the bloodline tower, they all felt despair. After all, they were determined to stand on the bloodline tower’s side.

It was easy to imagine that if the black Isotta won, then the White Tower would be faced with a disaster. Facing two third-circle warlocks, the White Tower would be as fragile as plastic.

As for Herman, although everyone knew that he was very strong, he was only at the peak of second circle a few decades ago. Even if he really advanced, it would be impossible for him to defeat Kloss.

‘But now, you’re telling me that all the danger is gone. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

‘The bloodline tower had won!’

The only thing on everyone’s mind right now was the joy of surviving a disaster. Although they didn’t know how the bloodline tower won, as long as they won, no one cared about anything else.

Therefore, everyone was only concerned about whether this news was true.

“It’s true. This is the news that the bloodline tower just sent us!” Ross looked at the crowd and said calmly.

“Nice!”

Some people cheered, some secretly heaved a sigh of relief, and some people’s eyes lit up as they looked at Ross and said, ” Sir, the black Isotta has lost. This is also an opportunity for us. They still have a large number of vassal forces. Even if we only accept a portion, it is enough to make our forces soar!”

“Yeah, I think so too.” Ross nodded. “but we have to listen to the arrangements of the bloodline tower. Don’t worry.

“This is the only thing in today’s meeting. Everyone, you may leave first. I’ll inform you when the time comes.”

“Yes, yes.”

Everyone nodded and left in high spirits. They would be busy soon.

After everyone left, Ross shook his head and took out a document. It was a letter from the bloodline tower, but it also contained some arrangements for the future.

This was normal.

However, there was something wrong with the signature column.

Because it wasn’t Vivika’s name, but another person’s name.

Herman.

“My Lord!” Ross sighed. Up until now, he still couldn’t figure out what kind of strength his Lord had and what other cards he had.

After thinking for a long time, he still couldn’t figure it out. After a while, he stood up and left the room. If he couldn’t figure it out, he wouldn’t think about it anymore.

He was only a servant of his Lord, and he only needed to do his own thing.

..

“The bloodline tower actually won. Interesting!”

At this time, in a Tower a few hundred kilometers away from the bloodline tower, Lovell looked at Romeo, who was reporting to him and showed an interested expression.

He had noticed all of this at the start of the war. He had thought that black Isotta would triumph over the bloodline tower, so he had not expected this.

It was really surprising!

“They wasted a good hand of cards!”

In order to follow the legend, many of their forces had sent people to this barren land in search of clues.

Back then, he had come with Kloss. The two strangers had met on the airship and had drunk wine, and enjoyed the scenery together. But now, this fellow had died first.

However, he wasn’t regretful at all. On the contrary, he was a little happy.

Kloss’ foolish actions had caused him to be eliminated first. It was a good thing that Lovell Gaines had one less competitor.

“What a pity!”

He stood up and stretched his body. Although losing a competitor was something to be happy about, he was also very curious about how the bloodline tower defeated black Isotta.

Black Isotta, who had early and mid third circle warlocks, lost to the bloodline tower.

It was really strange!

“Oh, right, Romeo. Do you have any other details?” Suddenly, he turned to look at Romeo, who was not far away, he was also the one he had sent out.

“My Lord,” Romeo took a deep breath. In front of him was the highest-ranking principal of the unicorn Academy. He had to be careful. After a few seconds, he opened his mouth, “There was something wrong. From what I saw, there was someone else supporting Vivika.

“And he’s very strong. He should be the one who killed Kloss.”

“I see!” Lovell’s gaze turned serious. If that were the case, then it would be different.

“Forget it. Let’s ignore them for now. I believe the bloodline tower won’t go too far. After all, their situation is still not very good right now!” Lovell shook his head, then dispelled Romeo.

“Then I’ll take my leave, my Lord.”

Romeo took a deep breath and left.

..

In a room in the high tower of the bloodline tower.

The room was decorated luxuriously and was very large. There was a large bed in the center, and the surrounding walls were inlaid with many gemstones. The floor was also covered with precious rugs.

This was Vivika’s private room, and no one would usually enter. It was where Eli and Vivika met.

“I didn’t expect you to still have this teddy bear!”

Eli looked at the bed. There was a small pink teddy bear lying quietly on it. If he remembered correctly, this was a gift from him to Vivika one night because she said she was afraid she couldn’t sleep.

...

“Yes.” Vivika’s face turned red.

Heavens!

She had forgotten to tidy up.

“Teacher, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s talk about what you’ve been doing all these years.” Vivika sat on a sofa and began to make tea.

She was really curious about what her teacher had gone through.

“I’m just an ordinary man. I don’t have much to say. Let’s talk about you. What have you been through after leaving Brynr? ” Eli smiled and took the tea that Vivika had made.

“Alright, then.” Vivika nodded and put her white finger on her lips. She fell into deep thought for a few seconds before she slowly said, “after I left Bryne, David and I headed east and came to the West Coast. Then, we were at the shadow lizard Warlock’s camp. I don’t know if you know about it, but it seems like it’s gone now.”

“I know.” How could Eli not know that when the death of the shadow lizard was closely related to him?

“yes, we spent a long time there. Then, I happened to pick up the remains of a dead wind elemental elf there and advanced to a first-circle Warlock. However, at that time, I had a disagreement with David. He firmly chose the path of a mage. He went to the central continent, and we separated.”

Eli nodded. In fact, he had almost forgotten that he had such a student.

Compared to Vivika, David’s mage talent was better, and his pursuit of the truth was also very firm. It was not surprising that he chose the mage path. Eli had been observing him, but something seemed to have happened later. The soul brand was too far away, and he could not contact it.

...

Therefore, he didn’t know David’s situation, not even if he was still alive.

Then, Vivika continued to tell him her story, from the time she came to the bloodline tower, to being taken in as Natasha’s student, and then to where she was now. Throughout the entire process, Eli didn’t disturb her and just listened calmly.

“Yes, teacher, that’s all.” Three hours later, Vivika finally finished her story and stopped.

“You’ve worked hard these years.”

Eli touched Vivika’s head and sighed.

For a teenage girl to reach this point alone, there was no need to describe the difficulty.

“Hehe, teacher, don’t underestimate me!” Vivika smiled like a beautiful violet flower blooming.

“Yes, yes, yes.” Eli smiled and nodded, asking, ” what should we do with the black Isotta next? are there any other problems? ”

“that’s all. The next step is to take over black Isotta’s territory. This time, they violated the West Coast treaty. The other forces will not object!” Said Vivika.

“West Coast treaty?”

‘Is there such a treaty?’

“Some forces from the central continent, or as we call it, the Central Road, came here to make a treaty, and the bloodline tower is one of them,” Vivika explained.

Central Road, treaty, bloodline tower.

The more Eli listened, the stranger he felt.

He felt that something was not right.

Hearing this …

The bloodline tower was not a local force!

Could there be some other secret?
