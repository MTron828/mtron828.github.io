282 Council

“My Lord, don’t you think lady Vivika is being too hasty by having us gather here?”

A one-circle sorcerer asked a second circle sorcerer beside him, his tone full of confusion.

“I don’t understand either. Master should have her own thoughts.” John shook his head.

He looked around and didn’t know how many warlocks of the bloodline tower had gathered together. There were at least a few thousand of them, and in front of them were the continuous peaks of the Sofia mountain range. For decades, this place had stopped them from advancing.

They had tried to charge in countless times, but they were blocked by the soul slave Army of the Holy tower. The huge number of soul slaves made them suffer, and they naturally failed to break through.

Today, Vivika suddenly issued a command, and a large number of warlocks were summoned here.

No one knew why, and no one knew what they were going to do!

The only thing they could do was wait!

Wait for an opportunity!

But there was no chance here. Was she expecting the soul slave Army to disband on its own?

John was puzzled!

In fact, this was also what most warlocks were unhappy about. After all, they were suddenly called out from their homes for no reason and then came to the mountain to wait. They didn’t even know how long it would take. It would be strange if they were comfortable!

However, no one dared to express their thoughts. After all, Vivika’s reputation was too high.

And behind her stood the most powerful person in the bloodline tower, Herman!

However, it was foreseeable that if there were no result, Vivika would definitely be criticized by many people.

John shook his head and stopped talking.

He closed his eyes and prepared to rest for a while. Suddenly, a loud noise woke him up!

A Warlock quickly ran over and shouted, “Some of the magical beasts in the sofia mountain range are rioting!”

??

Everyone turned to look at him.

Riot?

How could there be a riot?

John was confused. Then, from the corner of his eye, he seemed to see a shadow flying across the sky like a black light. It flew toward the South without stopping.

Then, another Warlock ran over, “all the magical beasts in the sofia mountain range seem to have gone berserk and lost control. They are running around wildly and leaving the mountain range to escape into the distance!”

The information left John a little confused. He looked around, not understanding what had happened.

But in the next second, he saw that from the exit of the mountain range in the distance, the roars of beasts began to rise and fall. The roars of all kinds of magical beasts were mixed together, and a few scattered magical beasts ran out. It was the soul slave Army.

Just as John was about to do something, he saw the Warlock commander at the front order them to stay where they were.

In the next three hours, they witnessed an outrageous scene.

The Holy tower’s line of defense had run away by itself!

John was confused, and that shadow suddenly flashed through his mind.

Could it be his master?

However, there was no time for him to think because the Warlock in command had already given the order!

“All troops, attack!”

..

New calendar year 3780!

The Holy tower’s line of defense at the sofia mountain range had fallen with the death of the core magical beasts.

On the same day, the warlocks who had been ordered to come here by Vivika rushed into the mountains and occupied the area. They built an outpost and found the destroyed Holy tower camp in the mountains.

It was just a camp that had been destroyed.

When the Warlocks arrived there, it was said that they were stunned.

From the top of the mountain to the bottom, it was almost covered with dead, magical beasts. The shadow path, the fire path, and the ice path still existed in the mountain. The bloodline tower warlocks could even see holy tower warlocks and magical beasts trapped in ice.

The thousands of warlocks stopped in their tracks, stunned. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

No one knew what had happened to the magical beasts and warlocks.

However, they had detected the aura of dead core magical beasts nearby, which made everyone understand that this was the main reason why the magical beasts had fled. An unknown creature had killed most of the core beasts here!

It was simply …

..

“Outrageous!”

In the meeting, Rodin stood up abruptly and listened to Vivika’s report in surprise.

The bloodline tower’s people had been in the mountain range for a day, and they had a basic understanding of the situation. This was the first meeting after the war, but it didn’t make sense to say that it was after the war. They did not encounter any obstacles at all.

“This is the battle report. What do you think? ” Vivika ignored Rodin, put away the document, and looked at the crowd.

Everyone looked at each other.

They didn’t know what to say.

In fact, they still didn’t understand what had happened!

After a full minute, someone slowly raised his hand and asked, “”My Lord, may I ask you a question?”

“Ask away!” Vivika replied.

...

“Did the black shadow take care of the core of the soul slaves? ” The Warlock asked.

In fact, many people had already thought of what had happened at the last meeting. It seemed that many of Vivika’s decisions had been made after the black shadow appeared.

“Yes!” Vivika nodded.

“As expected.”

“I knew it had something to do with that aura. It’s too terrifying. He actually solved everything by himself.”

The warlocks discussed spiritedly as if a doubt in their hearts had finally been answered.

“Could that be Sir Herman? He has not been showing his face for a long time!” The Warlock continued to ask.

“No!” Vivika replied.

“No?” The Warlock frowned. He knew that there were shadows on the battlefield, but he thought that it was his Excellency who had made a move.

“It’s indeed not teacher’s doing this time!” Vivika looked at everyone and said, “This time, it’s Sir Herman’s pet that attacked!”

Before the Warlock could react, his eyes widened in the next second. His voice trembled as he almost screamed, “Lady Vivika, you said that’s his pet?”

...

Not only the Warlock but the other warlocks also widened their eyes.

“A pet?”

“A single pet broke through the defense line that had been troubling us for so long, and he even killed thousands of monsters!”

“Are you kidding me? That’s dozens of third-circle warlocks.”

The warlocks were completely dumbfounded!

They couldn’t imagine how strong a pet could be to have such a record!

Moreover, if pets were already so strong, how strong were the owner?

“Uh, the master is indeed powerful!” After half an hourglass, someone finally reacted, and after a long time, he forced out a sentence.

The others chimed in.

Vivika looked at the scene and shook her head.

She was also very confused!

That day, Eli’s message told her what it was.

At first, she was curious if Eli was going to cause some destruction. But who would have thought that things would go so smoothly?

Even her master’s pet was so strong!

What about her?

How much more help could she still provide her master?

“The only thing I can do is manage everything for teacher!” Vivika’s eyes became firm again. She was not an indecisive person.

Wasn’t it normal for a teacher to be very strong?
