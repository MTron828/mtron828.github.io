154 Seven Years

“Are they finally going to make a move?”

Looking at this line of words, ere shook his head. In the next stage, Kratos’ identity would change to the blood Alliance, which would definitely have a great impact on the situation, and might even lead to the collapse of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.

However, he believed that Kratos would not do that. He would ensure harmony between the two forces so that they would have more time to take action. In the chaos between the two forces, the New White Tower would thrive.

“It’s starting!” Eli’s consciousness began to sense the virus that he had left behind.

Other than a few who were already dead, most of them were intact. They were just waiting for Eli’s command to release them. It would be exciting when the time came, but it was a pity that Eli couldn’t see it.

!!

…

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.

Cross Plains.

The plains that used to be peaceful and harmonious were now in the midst of a war.

Hundreds of Warlock apprentices were fighting. Blood was everywhere, and screams and cries of pain could be heard. The scene of killing enveloped the place, and the atmosphere of fear made it hard for everyone to breathe.

Compared to the wars between mortals, the wars between warlocks were much more dangerous and intense. As the war continued, warlocks were dying at a rapid rate.

Other than these apprentices, the battles in the first circle were the really thrilling ones.

On the other side.

A first-circle sorcerer had already transformed his entire body into a bloodline. His body was covered in tree-like ripples, and countless vines grew on his body, attacking the other side at the same time.

His opponent was also a Warlock who had fused with the bloodline of the red-blooded Wolf. His eyes were red, and he gave off a bloodthirsty aura. He was very agile, and when facing a Warlock with the beech wood bloodline, he could always Dodge as quickly as possible.

The two warlocks continued to fight, and if an apprentice accidentally got close, he would be torn to pieces in the aftermath of the battle.

There were many battlefields like this, but the most eye-catching ones were the two-ring Warlocks in the center.

Two from the shadow lizard Warlock Academy and two from the blood Alliance.

On the side of the Blood Alliance, there were two warlocks wearing wolf masks. On this side, there was an old man and a familiar Warlock, Kratos.

“Go!” The old man said as he looked at Kratos beside him. His body instantly turned into a bloodline, and a large shadow instantly pounced toward the two people opposite him.

At the same time, a large amount of ice and water appeared and collided with the shadows. For a moment, it was like a collision between black and white waves.

It was supposed to be a normal confrontation, but the old man felt that something was wrong because Kratos, who had been standing aside, hadn’t made a move yet.

He turned his head and saw a shocking scene.

Kratos moved, but he did not attack the two people opposite him. Instead, he flew straight toward him.

“Damn it, Kratos, what are you doing?” The old man cursed.

Kratos covered his body with shadow power and launched an attack at the old man.

Bang! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Kratos’ sudden attack caught him off guard. A shadow moved backward and blocked Kratos.

However, he looked at the three people who were already standing together, and a hint of despair appeared in his eyes.

The next day.

The first rebellion led to the shadow lizard’s defeat in an important war. What was more terrifying was that the shadow lizard had lost a second circle wizard, which was a real loss.

And three days after seeing this news.

Eli took a deep breath, and with a thought, more than a dozen viruses were instantly shattered.

…

The war continued.

However, some of the warlock camps suddenly found some bacteria and viruses nearby. At first, they did not pay much attention to it, but as the virus invaded, a large number of apprentices fell sick directly, and they realized the seriousness of the problem.

“Damn it, can someone tell me what’s going on?” In a camp, the second circle shadow lizard Warlock looked at the large number of apprentices lying outside and said angrily.

“I’m sorry, my Lord. I don’t know.” The one standing in front of him was a first-circle warlock, and he was also at a loss.

“Have you found a solution?” The two-circle warlock asked.

“No, we’ve looked through all the pharmacists in the camp, but they couldn’t solve it. This virus doesn’t seem to live for long, so we can just isolate the people.” The Warlock suggested.

“Alright,” he said. The two-circle sorcerer gritted his teeth. They were short of manpower now, and this situation was a little difficult for him to accept.

However, when he heard that there were similar viruses in other places, he immediately realized that this was a conspiracy of the Blood Alliance.

…

“Beautiful.”

In a tent, Kratos smiled as he read the news.

Needless to say, the virus should have been created by Eli. He had to admit that he did not expect Eli to be able to come up with something like this. After all, no warlocks studied this anymore.

Eli was a strange talent.

However, with this wave of interference, their mission could also be more successful, and the White Tower’s power could also slowly grow.

“Time, I still need time.” Kratos looked up at the top of the tent and said.

Although the other two had also caused some damage, they were much inferior compared to Eli.

…

Three years passed in the blink of an eye.

Every once in a while, Eli would release some viruses, and perhaps it was because he had not paid attention to them for a long time, these viruses actually began to slowly mutate and evolve into several versions, which made the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy complain endlessly.

Of course, it wasn’t just them. The Blood Alliance had also occupied some areas of the academy and these areas were also infected with the virus, which made the Blood Alliance very unhappy.

This made the situation even more chaotic and made Kratos so happy that he couldn’t close his mouth because Eli had already told them how to deal with the virus in White Tower in advance, so they didn’t have to worry about this problem.

This made many members of the White Tower know that there was a very powerful pharmacist in the organization who could create not only viruses but also first-class potions. The reputation of ” Herman ” was spreading.

The White Tower was still in formation. Blood Alliance and Shadow Lizard were both facing difficulty.

As for Rawls and Evena, they had their own methods.

Rawls was stirring up monster hordes everywhere, while Evena was spreading false information internally. Both of them caused certain levels of damage, but compared to Eli’s, be it in terms of range or spread, they were much worse.

Rawls was still working hard, working hard to become a member of Parliament, and he felt that he had already won against Eli.

…

Just like that, time passed by slowly.

Occasionally, Eli would also stop the release of the virus. After all, there was a limit to the virus.

Meanwhile, in the mage camp, Eli was also very happy. With the help of the mages, the construction of the spell model of the devouring power was rapidly progressing, and he was already one-third done. If he were to do it himself, it would take at least ten years.

This was the power of a group.

Speaking of collective power, after reading about combined magic, Eli had also created a new spell.

He had created a level 1 spell-shadow skeleton combination. This spell used skeletons as the main body and a large amount of Shadow Force as support. It was also combined with more than ten other small techniques to create a spell. The effect was to combine a large number of skeletons into a huge skeleton that could burst out with power.

Eli had yet to experiment with this spell, but according to his expectations, this spell’s explosive power had already exceeded a first-circle spell.

In short, everything was getting better.

…

Four years later.

As the battle went on, the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy was getting weaker and weaker, and the Alliance of ten thousand blood was ready to give a fatal blow.

But something unexpected happened again.

A group of self-proclaimed White Tower sorcerers suddenly appeared, and their leader was the former shadow lizard warlock Academy’s Chairman, second circle Limit warlock Marcus. The Deputy Chairmans were three second-circle warlocks, including Kratos, who they trusted very much.

The situation of the war changed again.

White Tower was nibbling away at the shadow lizard’s forces while dealing with the blood Alliance.

Things were at a standstill, until suddenly, the virus outbreak started to affect first-circle warlocks. The blood Alliance’s offensive instantly fell.

This made the people of the White Tower overjoyed.

…

At this moment, in a room in the middle of a plain.

A meeting was in progress.

“Kratos, your subordinate Herman has made a great contribution this time.” A white-haired man sitting on the main seat of the Round Table looked at Kratos and said with a smile.

“Uh, indeed.” Kratos nodded. Up until now, he still didn’t understand how Eli could develop a virus of this level. It seemed that he had underestimated him.

“That’s right. If we didn’t have the magic potion to solve the problem, this war would have been much more difficult. I don’t know how many people would have died.”

“That’s true. Herman is too powerful. This virus can even affect a first-circle Warlock. He has brought us too much time.”

The people present were all warlocks of the White Tower, and they were all discussing.

“Hey, I remember that Kratos has three people in charge of this, right? How are the other two?” Someone suddenly asked.

“Indeed, I think there are two more. I don’t remember their names, but one of them is raising monster hordes. However, the impact is just so-so, and it’s far from being comparable to a virus. The other one is manipulating public opinion. She is actually very good at her job, much more effective than the beast hordes.”

“Oh, let’s focus on Herman.” The person who asked the question lost interest after knowing the answer. The gap was too big.

“I heard that Herman is also a very powerful pharmacist.”

“Indeed, it seems like he was the one who modified the silent moon spring. The effect is very good.”

“Sigh, this guy has really made a great contribution this time. I’m so envious of Kratos for having such a subordinate.”

For a moment, the entire room was filled with discussions about Herman.

On the other hand, Kratos and his teacher looked at each other helplessly.

Good Lord, aren’t we going to discuss the follow-up battle today?

Why was it all about Herman?

Kratos was also very helpless. Suddenly, he sadly discovered that in the White Tower, Eli’s reputation was even greater than his.

What the hell is this?
