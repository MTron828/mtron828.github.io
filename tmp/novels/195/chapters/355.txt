356 Numbers

At night.

The crescent moon hung high in the sky, sprinkling down layers of silver frost.

In the airship, Eli ended his meditation as usual and went to the stands. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Looking at the scenery on both sides, Eli took out a map and estimated the distance between him and the Bloodline Tower.

They should be there in ten days.

Half a month had passed since the incident at Four Seasons Garden, and it had been a smooth half month.

However, Eli knew that this was only temporary.

From the way he had destroyed the Four Seasons Garden, the Manticore Clan would most likely make new moves.

However, he wasn’t too afraid, nor would he run away.

There were some things that couldn’t be avoided. If he wanted to establish a foothold in the Bloodline Tower in the Central Continent, then he wouldn’t be able to avoid the manticore. Unless Eli chose to establish his own force, that would be more troublesome. It might not be as easy as dealing with the manticore.

A stable environment was never obtained by hiding but by fighting.

“However, I have to consider my next path after I resolve this.”

Eli pondered.

At his current stage, he was already in the second half of the fourth circle. He should be thinking about the path he should take next. Therefore, he needed some information about the fifth ring. Even if he did not have specific details, he should know what the path ahead was!

However, there was no need to be too anxious about this. He was only at the Glorious Sun stage and was still very far from breaking through.

Moreover, he had many things to do next!

Hill needed an area to plant, and Hydra needed resources with the same attributes to upgrade, the merfolk’s belief system was too crude and needed to be dug up and studied, and also Doggo’s body…

“There’s still a long way to go.” Eli sighed.

Speaking of which, ever since he had landed, Doggo hadn’t looked for him. He had been in the secret dimension.

Thinking of this, Eli stepped into the secret realm.

The area that Eli walked into was Hill’s area. As soon as he entered, Hill lowered her green branches and stretched them toward Eli.

” We’re already at the central continent. You should be able to sense the rich elemental essence in the surroundings. When we reach the place, you can take root somewhere. ” Eli consoled.

Hill could have broken through long ago, but she had been restricted by the environment for more than a thousand years. The power accumulated in her body was even as much as that of a middle-stage third-circle mage, but her essence was at the peak of a first-circle mage. Only tree-type creatures had long lives. Otherwise, she would have been the first subordinate of Eli to be suffocated by the environment.

Hearing Eli’s comforting words, Hill stretched out her branches as usual. Every green leaf was like jade.

Not far away from Hill was Hydra, who was lying on the ground. He had been placed in the secret realm by Eli, and he was currently sleeping.

“My lord!”

At this moment, a shadow floated over from not far away. It was Nikola, who was also arranged to be in the secret realm.

“Yeah, I came in to see Dylan. Where did he go?” asked Eli.

“Dylan? He seemed to be not far away. The situation didn’t feel right. His Excellency might really have to take a look.” Nikola said.

“Oh?” Eli was confused.

What could be wrong with a mechanical creature?

Is it out of grease?

….

After a while, Eli saw Dylan.

Dylan was lying flat on the ground, feeling hopeless.

He kept muttering, “I can’t sense it, I can’t sense it.”

There seemed to be a problem…

Ely was a little surprised. After all, this stupid dog had been delayed by him for more than 1,000 years. Why was it that he had started to wither in the central continent?

“Dylan, what happened?” Eli walked over and asked.

Dylan turned around and said in a sobbing tone, “Eli, I can’t sense it. I can’t sense it. ”

“Can’t sense what?” asked Eli.

“I can’t sense my body!” Dylan stood up, his entire body trembling mechanically. He raised his head and said to Eli, ” I tried my best to sense my main body the moment we arrived at the central continent, but I couldn’t sense it at all. There was nothing at all. My main body must have been destroyed over time. ”

Dylan’s tone was mournful, and his blue mechanical eyes kept blinking.

Eli also had a strange expression on his face, but he still comforted her, ” Could it be that it’s too far away from you? And you’re too weak to sense it. ”

Dylan, “…”

However, after this explanation, Dylan seemed to have found some comfort. He suddenly stood up and looked at Eli. “What you said makes sense, Eli. That must be the case. ”

Eli smiled. He had encountered the same situation before, just like how he could not sense the central continent when he was on the west coast.

Dylan was too anxious.

After all, this was his only hope, and it affected him too much. Even if Eli gave him another reason, he would accept it without hesitation.

Dylan, who had been comforted, returned to his normal state and was in a good mood.

” Eli, don’t worry. When I find a body, I’ll definitely … ” Before Dylan could finish, Eli reached out his hand to signal him to be quiet.

“What’s wrong, Eli?” Dylan asked curiously.

“Enemies are coming.” Eli narrowed his eyes as if he had seen something fun.

“Enemies.” Dylan’s gaze immediately turned serious, and he left without looking back. As he ran, he shouted, “Good luck, Eli.”

...

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. Dylan had been with him for a long time, and he was getting more and more mischievous.

However, he sensed that there were four people outside. It would not be a problem for him to win, but there was still a 1% chance of getting injured. Moreover, they were on the airships. To prevent any damage to the airships, he could not go alone this time.

He flew out of the mystic realm and shouted at the same time,” Hydra, Nikola, prepare for battle. ”

Nikola immediately raised his head, and the sound of death lingered behind him. Hydra opened its four pairs of eyes, and the four colors emitted unique colors. The four elements around its body coiled around it. It raised its head and let out a cry.

Eli flew out first, followed by a Chimera and an Undead.

…

At this moment.

Under the moonlight.

The three airships stopped in mid-air, and in front of them was a huge, dream-like wall. The color of the wall was illusionary, and it was hundreds of meters tall, completely blocking the path of the airships.

With the help of the dim light from the high wall, four figures floated in front. Three men and one woman, one in front and three behind.

The leader was Wellington. He wore a black robe, his face was pale as snow, and his eyes were extremely cold, like the ice in winter.

...

One of the three people behind him was wearing yellow armor and was three meters tall. Another person wore a crown inlaid with gems and was dressed in gorgeous clothes like a king. His eyes were golden, and he looked like a lion. The last person was a woman wearing a light purple dress and had a pair of huge wings flapping behind her. The color of the wings was like a dream. It was purple, black, and blue. It was extremely strange, just like the high wall behind her.

The three of them were the three celestials that Wellington had invited. The two men were at the Star rank, while the female Warlock was at the Nebula rank. In order to invite the three of them, Wellington paid a huge price.

” Eli, I hope you won’t disappoint me. ” Wellington looked at the airship in front of him with a cruel smile.

The other three were also staring at the airship. No one spoke.

Before they came, their goal was already very clear, and that was to kill Eli.

As long as Eli appeared, he would be met with the attacks of the four of them.

The few of them stared at the airship and suddenly felt a celestial fluctuation flash past. Their eyes lit up, and they knew that the enemy had arrived.

However, in the next second, two more auras burst out.

It was also a celestial!

Their eyes widened at the same time!

Wait a minute!

Three auras?

Other than Eli, were there other celestial in the airship?

A few of them turned serious and stared at the airship.

Three figures flew out.
