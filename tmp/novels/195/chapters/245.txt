246 Eli’s arrival

In fact, they were overthinking it.

Sometimes, the difference in fighting strength could not be made up for by courage.

With the arrival of the two middle-stage third-circle warlocks, Vivika and Udo were at an absolute disadvantage in just three minutes.

“There’s no way!”

Udo’s expression was unsightly. At this moment, his face was covered with black-red cracks, like lava cracking open. At the same time, the bloodline power in his body had been activated to the extreme.

He looked around.

Vivika was standing beside him, also in a sorry state.

Not far away were the four people who had already activated their bloodlines. They were looking at them with a smile on their faces, exuding a powerful aura.

When he was at his peak, he might be able to take on one of the third circle warlocks, but if they joined forces, he would have no chance at all. He would die in a minute at most!

Hu!

Vivika sighed, her expression heavy.

Perhaps she should have listened to her teacher. At most, she would be asked to leave the bloodline tower. However, in order to have a chance to improve in the future, she still came. After all, not everyone had good qualifications.

The wind elemental elf bloodline was the most common among the third circle. There was almost no hope for her to advance to celestial, but if she could go to the headquarters, and the resources there might be a chance for her to advance!

She could only say that she had lost to fate this time!

However, there was still a chance. As long as the Holy tower could turn the tide, they would still have a chance. This would take some time, but fortunately, her teacher had given her that.

Thinking of this, she took out the wizard’s cane that her teacher had given her!

She had wanted to use it immediately, but seeing udo not far away, she shouted, “Udo, come here!”

Udo turned his head around, baffled.

But when he saw the staff, he blinked and ran over quickly. Could it be that Herman had left some powerful trump card for Vivica?

However, when Vivika’s mental power touched the staff, a large number of shadows poured out from the crystal at the tip of the staff and turned into a huge shadow ball that enveloped the two of them. Udo fell silent! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What is this?”

He looked at Vivika.

“A defensive technique!” Vivika only glanced at her, then sat on the ground and began to recover from her injuries!

Since the teacher said that it was enough to resist the attacks for three hours, it meant that she still had three hours. Once the time was up, if those forces still did not stop the counterattack, they would be dead!

Udo was speechless.

He thought it was some kind of attack, but it turned out to be a turtle shell!

However, so be it. At least, it could protect them for a while.

The other four looked at the sudden appearance of the black shield and frowned. The female Warlock waved her hands, and countless thorns rolled like mud Dragons towards the shadow shield.

In the blink of an eye, dozens of thorns struck the shield at the same time.

The woman was controlling the thorns, while Udo was also watching from behind the shield.

“It’s fine!”

Half a minute later, the thorns receded, and the shield was intact.

Udo heaved a sigh of relief. He was really worried that it would be broken in the next second.

On the other side, the warlock was a little embarrassed. After all, she had been attacking for a long time, but there was no change at all. She wanted to attack again but was stopped by someone beside her.

“I’ll do it!” A third-circle middle-stage warlock walked out with a smile and said confidently.

Ten minutes later.

He returned in silence.

“It didn’t break it!”

Seeing that the shield was completely unscathed after being attacked by a third-circle intermediate Warlock for more than ten minutes, Udo finally felt relieved. He sat down and began to recover from his injuries.

“there’s something wrong with this shield. It seems to be able to absorb energy to replenish itself. We have to attack it continuously!”

One of the third-circle sorcerers looked at them and said.

The few of them looked at each other. Since they had already reached this stage, they naturally could not let go.

Besides, Vivika and Udo were also important people.

One was the master of the bloodline tower, while the other was the student of the master of the Holy tower!

Just like that, a few of them took a deep breath and began to attack the shield. For a time, a myriad of attacks hit the shield at the same time, emitting a huge power.

Inside the shield, Vivika was calmly recovering from her injuries.

Udo, on the other hand, was trembling with fear.

..

“Is this the place?”

After a long and arduous journey, Eli finally arrived at his destination.

This place was located more than a hundred kilometers away from Silver moon town. It was backed by a mountain range, and in front of it was a winding river that flowed continuously.

“What a huge barrier!”

Eli looked up. Not far away, a huge enchantment that covered an area of seven to eight kilometers completely sealed off his vision. The elements that it emitted were like an inverted bowl.

“Vivika is inside!” He said.

...

Eli could sense Vivika’s presence, and his staff had been activated two and a half hours ago, and its energy seemed to be running out.

“My mission this time is to rescue Vivika and leave!”

Eli’s goal was clear-he would leave after saving her!

As for the rest, it was none of his business.

“But this barrier looks very hard!” Eli slowly walked to the barrier. With such a huge barrier, even a middle-stage third-circle warlock wouldn’t be able to break it.

But fortunately, this wasn’t difficult for Eli.

Eli placed his hand on the shield.

Suddenly, a shadow emerged from his hand and spread out. At the same time, a mysterious devouring power began to appear and absorb the barrier’s power.

It only took a few minutes.

A large hole was corroded in the barrier. Although it wasn’t big, it was enough for Eli to enter.

“It seems that the shadow that has fused with the devouring power is not bad!”

...

Looking at this scene, Eli smiled and quickly entered.

After determining the direction, he quickly moved forward.

..

“Vivika, it’s not too late for you to come out and surrender now. Otherwise, it won’t be so easy to deal with us when we come in!”

At this time, in an open space outside the ruins, a black shadow ball was in a deep pit, embedded in the ground for a full seven or eight meters, and the ruins were winding upward.

This was because the shield was too hard. It was actually struck seven or eight meters deep into the ground. At this time, the shadow shield was already very thin, as if it would shatter in the next second!

Four warlocks were standing around the deep pit, looking at the shield that was about to break.

“Five minutes at most!”

A Warlock’s expression was gloomy.

“Almost!” The sorceress agreed.

“But we have to hurry. Because of our absence, things aren’t going so well. Although a few of the enemy’s three-circle warlocks have died, the remaining ones are still strong. The people outside have also reacted and are rushing to this place!” The other third circle intermediate Warlock’s mouth twitched.

They had never thought that they would be held up for two hours by a shield.

The main thing was that this shield was too ridiculous. It could actually devour the surrounding elements to replenish itself.

“But fortunately, it’s ending soon!” He pursed his lips, and another attack flew toward the deep pit, making a huge roar, and the thin film weakened a little again.

“It’s finished!” Udo looked at the shield that was on the verge of collapsing and shouted, ” we’re done for!”

Once the shield was broken, they would not be able to run for long.

“Hey, udo, let’s split up and run later!” Vivika said to him.

She looked at the shield with a serious expression.

She had thought that the Holy tower would be able to quickly organize a counterattack, but it was clear that she had overestimated them. They could only rely on themselves, or they might really die here today.

Vivika sighed.

Where could she escape to? with her strength, she couldn’t break the barrier outside at all, so the outcome wouldn’t change at all. However, the only thing that made her feel fortunate was that he didn’t persuade her teacher to come along.

This time, dark heart had deployed three late-stage third-circle warlocks.

Even her teacher would not be a match for such power.

Bang! Bang!

Just as she was letting her imagination run wild, an attack arrived, and the thin film finally broke!

“It’s broken!”

Udo and Vivika looked at each other, then ran in two different directions.

However, it was obvious that their opponents were well-prepared. They split up, two on each side, and blocked them.

“Haha, you have nowhere to run!” The four warlocks surrounded the two of them, their faces ferocious.

Udo and Vivika’s expressions were ugly. Their escape had failed.

“This should be considered as me returning Herman’s favor, right?” Udo sighed. He didn’t save the person and even got himself into trouble.

“It’s over!”

Vivika, on the other hand, was calmer. She had already prepared herself mentally for a few hours.

Suddenly, the forest on the side began to move, as if they were moving at a fast speed.

Everyone stopped in their tracks and looked towards the forest.

“I’ve finally found it! This place is quite big!”

The bushes shook, and Eli walked out, shaking off the leaves on his clothes.
