534 Rewinding Time, Second Shock

“We won, but…”

After sighing, Luo Ye turned his head to look at the ground, and then he revealed a look of pity.

The Holy Sword City had long since disappeared, leaving only a few ruins. The distant mountains, valleys, and everything else in sight had been reduced to a blackish-red plain.

The black color was the mark left behind by the shadow ‘Drizzle’ on the ground, while the red color was the color of the blood of millions of Warlocks that had flowed into the ground and mixed with the soil.

In this battle, not to mention the deaths of many fifth-circle warlocks, the death rate of low-level warlocks was also extremely high.

99%!

That’s right, almost 100 percent of the Warlocks had died in this area. Although the Bloodline Towers only occupied less than 30 percent of the area, it was still a terrifying proportion!

As for the celestials, it was still alright. Other than a few unlucky ones, most of them survived.

“It’s really too tragic!” Luo Ye closed his eyes.

Most of these Warlocks belonged to the Holy Tower. Among them were his friends, his relatives, and juniors, as well as Warlocks, who trusted him wholeheartedly!

It was too painful!

The sadness gradually dispersed the joy, and he seemed to have returned to the day his teacher died.

It wasn’t just them. At this moment, many celestials shook their heads and sighed!

Clearly, this battle was extremely tragic in their eyes.

Especially the many celestials of the Warlock Alliance, they felt even more miserable. Not only did their ancestors die, but many of their descendants also died in this war!

A million Warlocks!

In the sky, Ely, who had finished dealing with the fifth circle warlocks, also looked down.

He naturally understood that in such a battle, at such a close distance, the low-level Warlocks had no chance of survival. Even if it was just a weak force, it was enough to kill them.

However, he still did not leave the battlefield. Naturally, he did not kill, but…

“I haven’t used this technique since I got it, and it hasn’t even been half an hour. It should be enough!” Eli lowered his head and looked at the ground. Then, a layer of the tree of laws in his body began to sway.

Whoosh!

It was like the autumn wind sweeping away the fallen leaves.

A translucent Leaf of Time drilled out of his body and slowly landed on the ground!

All the celestials looked up at this scene, looking at the leaves of time that filled the sky, at a loss.

” Wait, what’s that?!” Suddenly, a celestial screamed and pointed to the side.

There, a Leaf of Time fell to the ground like a drop of water. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A sudden change!

Layers of ripples appeared, and the charred ground gradually recovered. A touch of green appeared on the ground, and then a small mountain slowly appeared. This change was extremely obvious on the charred ground.

“Is the lord giving us a new environment?” he muttered.

“No, no!” Suddenly, a voice came from beside him. It was Luo Ye.

He stared at the land with his eyes wide open. “This isn’t a new one. This place used to be like that. I can’t be wrong!”

“What?!” Luo Ye’s words shocked all the celestials!

Was the time flowing back?

At this moment, many fallen leaves slowly fell to the ground.

The earth regained its color, the collapsed mountains stood up again, the rivers flowed again, the plants grew their branches again, and even Holy Sword City was recovering.

In the blink of an eye, the area within ten thousand miles seemed to have returned to its former state.

Countless celestials stared at this scene in shock.

But then, something even more shocking happened.

On the ground, countless traces of blood spiraled back, and bits of flesh began to grow. With a wail, everyone saw Warlocks standing on the ground again.

They weren’t wearing any clothes, but when they saw those familiar faces, all the celestials were stunned.

“Resurrected? Was this trick that a warlock could use?” Luo Ye looked at many familiar figures, and his throat moved slightly.

“Are you kidding me?”

“Isn’t this too unbecoming of a warlock?”

“Is this the power of time? Does Eli have such power?”

The celestials were all talking to each other. They were all stunned when they saw the figures that they had mourned for come back to life.

A Warlock looked at his own body in a daze and pinched it. It was indeed his own body.

“I’m alive!” He was extremely shocked.

He clearly remembered that he had died in the aftermath of the last wave, facing a shadow meteor. He should not have survived that attack, but now he was alive again.

“What happened? Could it be…” He shook his head.

The huge shadow dragon was still emitting a strong aura of time. Endless time leaves fell to the ground, and every time they fell, a large number of Warlocks would be resurrected.

“It’s Sir Eli!” He instantly understood the reason.

Looking at the figure in the sky, he directly knelt down.

“My lord!” Tears and snot flowed down his face. He was both happy that he had been saved by Eli, and he also admired Eli!

It was not just him. The Warlocks who had been resurrected also understood. They looked at the figure in the sky with admiration. Even the Warlocks of the Warlock Alliance were no exception. Of course, there were also many people who were filled with despair. It was fine if he was strong, but he could actually resurrect people. Was he even human?

Of course, it was not just these emotions. For example…

“Where are my clothes? And my equipment?”

“F * ck, it’s all gone. But it doesn’t matter. At least I’m still alive.”

“Ah, don’t look at me!”

After the shock, the Warlocks finally realized that they were naked. They covered their bodies in panic, and some of them were sad about their lost equipment. Of course, this was only a minority. Most of them were happy after surviving a disaster!

It was already a blessing that they were still alive!

Of course, when they saw the many fifth circle members of the Warlock Alliance who had died in the sky, they were shocked once again. This was because they had already died in the aftermath of the battle before the results were decided. Naturally, they did not know the results.

At this moment, when they saw the death of so many elders, all of their expressions turned ugly. They didn’t even care about the embarrassment of not wearing clothes because compared to their own embarrassment, they understood that after today, their families would face great embarrassment!

Of course, this had nothing to do with them for the time being.

Because no one thought that they could leave this place.

And all of this was because of Eli!

Therefore, when everyone looked at the huge shadow dragon in the sky, the reverence and fear in their hearts spread again.

The Shadow Dragon lowered its head to look at the ground. All the Warlocks felt a chill.

But in the next second, Eli’s voice entered everyone’s ears.

“Phoenix, Hydra, settle this place and return!”

After giving his instructions, everyone only saw the shadow dragon flap its wings, followed by a boom.

He disappeared before everyone’s eyes.
