Chapter 10: Testing

Translator: Lonelytree

On this day, the imperial library opened as usual, but it closed earlier than usual.

Some people who didn’t know the reason were confused at first, but after being told the reason, they all nodded in agreement and left.

There was an exam!

The Empire’s library was not just a library. It was also one of the places in Junlin city that nurtured talents. Every year, it would nurture some outstanding scholars.

Although their numbers could not be compared to that of the Empire’s Knight Academy and the Empire’s Mystic Academy, it could not be ignored that many of the Empire’s higher-ups had also walked out from here.

Every year in June and December, the selection of the librarian would be held here.

A librarian was the lowest level at the library.

From there, there were learners, scholars, and Grand scholars.

The head of the library was a Grand scholar and a Grand Knight. He was even one of the king’s aides and was considered one of the people with high status in the Empire.

After all, even the Knights, who despised ordinary people, had a different attitude toward scholars. It was reasonable to think about it. After all, a group of combat professionals would more or less be in awe of knowing things that they did not understand.

Thus, it was clear from here that the original host had actually left behind quite a lot of good things for Eli.

If it had not been for Saleen Metatrin’s twisted sense of humor, the host might have become a big Shot in the Empire one day.

It was a pity that all of this was left to the transmigrated Eli.

He was really a good person.

...

“Hey, long time no see, Eli.”

At the entrance of the library, he met Kart, who he hadn’t seen in a long time.

He was dressed in black pants and a black top with a gold armband of poor quality on his cuffs. It was obvious that he had dressed up well today.

“How is it? Are you ready? How are your preparations?” Kart saw Eli and asked ” concernedly, ” almost writing the words ” well prepared ” on his face.

Eli looked at Kart in front of him and felt his head hurt.

‘There are so many people here. Why do you keep targeting me?

‘It is very annoying.

‘Just because the original body was a ‘bad student’? Don’t bad students have human rights?’

In the face of Kart’s question, Eli could only smile and say, “It’s alright.”

“Oh, really? I didn’t prepare much. I only took a brief look at it. For example, I didn’t really look at the heraldry. I hope it doesn’t test too much, and...” it was obvious that Kart didn’t care about how much progress Eli was making. He just wanted to talk about his ” simple preparations ” in front of him.

In response, Eli cast a glance at Kart, casually gave an excuse, and immediately slipped into the library.

As he watched Eli leave, the worry on Kart’s face slowly faded. He straightened his body, and the corners of his mouth began to curve up, revealing a confident expression.

He patted the golden armband on his sleeve and strode into the library.

...

Kart’s incident was just a small interlude.

When Eli arrived at the library’s main hall, there were already twenty to thirty temporary librarians gathered there. They were all standing in twos and threes as if they were waiting for something.

Not many of these people were familiar to Eli, so he simply found a place to stand.

“I wonder if it’s enough?” Eli looked around at the people around him. Every one of them was his competitor.

He wondered if the mere 50 books he had memorized were enough!

In the past thirteen days, after work every day, Eli would spend his time reading books. On average, he could read three to four books by 12 p.m. every day after work. In other matters, he had read about 50 books.

Half of them were history and heraldry, followed by medicine and Botany. The rest were all miscellaneous subjects, and he did not delve too deeply into them.

After a while, the number of temporary wardens increased to 30. Kart walked in with his head held high as if victory was already in his hands.

Eli ignored him because someone was coming from the other entrance.

It was still the familiar black robe. Scholar Clement came in with a book. However, there were two young people behind him, also wearing the library uniform.

“Everyone, find a place to sit, but don’t sit together.” Scholar Clement said casually.

The tables in the library were a great place for exams.

Eli found a random spot and sat down.

Scholar Clement took out a stack of test papers from his black robe and handed them to the two people behind him. Then, the two of them handed out the test papers to everyone.

It was an exam in another world.

It was also a key event that would determine Eli’s fate for a period of time in the future.

He opened the test paper!

“I hope it won’t be too difficult,” Eli took a deep breath, then solemnly opened the test paper.

A few seconds later, Eli was stunned.

It was not because it was too difficult but because it was too easy.

“That’s easy!”

He looked at the exam paper in front of him. Most of the questions were simple history questions, as well as a lot of noble heraldry and some basic general knowledge. There were no thinking questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, or big questions.

Eli, “...”

This was different from what he had imagined!

He thought it would be difficult.

After flipping through it, Eli picked up the quill and began to write quickly. If he couldn’t finish this paper in twenty minutes, that would be because he was too weak. At the same time, Kart looked at the test paper in front of him, his throat moving.

‘Test this time is slightly more difficult than the previous ones!’

The Empire’s history exam was very abstract, and the coat of arms of the nobles was also very complicated. The common sense questions were also a little off-topic, some of which were even mixed together. It did not look simple at all.

This was several times more difficult than the previous test papers he had bought.

He picked up his pen and started to write, but he would frown after a few strokes and stop for a few seconds. It was obvious that the questions were very difficult.

‘it’s so difficult. But if even I think it’s difficult, the others must be suffering to death.’ Kart sighed with confidence. She raised her head and was ready to check on the others.

As expected, most of the people’s faces were ugly at this time, and they could not answer at all.

“I wonder how’s the one called... what’s that again? I think he’s called Eli.”

Kart only remembered his name after a long time. Although he would chat with him occasionally, it was only to show off. As for his name, he really had no memory of it.

In his heart, he still looked down on Eli. Not only that, but he also looked down on the other wardens who were worse than him. He had always thought that he was the best. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

When he looked at Eli, he saw a scene that was crazy. His quill was flying on the paper, and with a smooth stroke, he threw the pen into the pen holder with a bang.

Giving up?

Kart showed a gratified smile.

‘As expected, he probably doesn’t know anything. He has no idea where to start.’ Kart showed a happy smile.
