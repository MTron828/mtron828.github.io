178 The Dice of Fate

The White Tower was a mortal enemy of the Blood Alliance.

After all, the White Tower was born during the battle between the Blood Alliance and the shadow lizard Warlock Academy. Not only did it stab them in the back, but it also seized the fruits of their victory.

However, the White Tower had always been flourishing, and the higher-ups were getting stronger and stronger, which made them very annoyed.

As a matter of fact, the moment they heard that the White Tower’s top combatant, Marcus, had died, the Blood Alliance was tempted.

In a huge tent in the Blood Alliance.

The Alliance master, Pabulo, sat on the main seat and looked at the combat members on both sides. There were as many as 12 second-circle warlocks, which was also the foundation of the blood Alliance’s strength.

“Everyone, what do you think of Marcus’s death?” Pabulo asked as he looked at the crowd.

“What are you talking about? just start a war. How can the White Tower be our match now? ” An old man excitedly smashed a wine glass on the ground and said loudly.

“Sores, calm down. Your impulsive action fifty years ago caused us to lose a lot of people who were lying in ambush in the White Tower.” Pabulo frowned and said. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“but this is indeed a good opportunity for us. If not for the White Tower, our current power would be far greater than it is now. We would have become one of the major forces of the West Coast.” Sores started fighting and shouted to the surroundings.

“Indeed, if it weren’t for the White Tower, each of our clans would have expanded at least several times.”

“The White Tower can’t be left alive. This force is growing too fast.”

“It’s only been a few decades, and they’ve almost caught up. If it were to take another hundred or two hundred years, how terrible would that be? ”

The other people in the tent also started to discuss animatedly.

Pabulo also nodded and looked at the people below with a burning gaze. The White Tower and the Blood Alliance will definitely fight, but how to fight without damaging their foundation is the problem.

“I’ve already contacted the black Isotta Warlock Academy. They’re currently one of the largest Warlock forces in the South of the West Coast. They have the combat power of the third circle and are willing to help us.” Pabulo suddenly said.

Everyone was shocked, and then they were overjoyed. If they really had such a powerful ally, it would be a pleasant surprise for them.

“Uh, but the third circle warlocks won’t make a move. They’ll only send a portion of their people and some special methods. We still have to do the rest ourselves.” Pabulo spoke of his plans.

“Sure, I agree!” Sores was the first to agree. What he wanted to do now was to enter the White Tower and kill Herman. “Let’s see how you can dodge this time!” Sores gritted his teeth.

“Our two-circle warlocks are already stronger than them, so we’ll definitely win this time.”

After Pabulo finished explaining the plan, the others all agreed.

After all, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for black Isotta to help them.

“mm, then let’s set a time. The current time is three years later. After all, they and we both need time to prepare. This time, we have at least a 99% chance of turning the White Tower into history.” Pabulo said as he picked up his wine glass.

The others also raised their glasses, their eyes full of excitement.

After annexing the White Tower, they would have the chance to become as powerful as the black Isotta.

As for ten years!

Although there was a law of life consumption, ten years was still not a long time for warlocks.

Compared to mages, even a first-circle Warlock could live for four to five hundred years. Even if they were weakened by 1.5 times, they could live for more than three hundred years, which was a huge difference from mages.

Hence, ten years was nothing.

..

In the blink of an eye, it had been five years since Eli and the others had made their preparations.

The anticipated attack from the Blood Alliance did not come, but White Tower did not slack off. Everyone knew that the war was bound to happen sooner or later, and it would not be long.

Although he had not received any news from the blood alliance, there was good news from the mage camp.

“Master, I’ve broken through to two rings!”

Looking at the news that Tijie sent over, Eli was very surprised.

Compared to Eli, Tijie’s talent wasn’t that bad. The reason why Eli was able to surpass her was because of his extraordinary wisdom. He discovered the magical uses of the devouring power, and the power that was produced from it drove the rapid progress of a mage.

Since Tijie had broken through to the second circle, she would have had a better grasp of the mage camp. It was also possible that Eli would develop the second seal in advance.

“How’s the progress of the spell seal?” Eli asked directly.

“master, almost all the mages in the camp have joined the experiments and tried out your ideas. We’ve confirmed that some of them are impossible, and we’ve also suggested a few new paths.” Tijie replied.

“Well, then you guys continue to work hard. I still have a few ideas here.” Eli was very satisfied.

This was the reason why he took over the mage camp, and it was finally starting to take root.

However, this had to be kept strictly confidential. After all, his identity as a Mage could not be exposed. Once it was exposed, he might face all the Warlock forces. The threat that this would bring was too great, which was one of the reasons why he had to become stronger.

“Yes, sir, we will continue to work hard.” The short communication ended.

“war is imminent. I have to strengthen myself. I can make some disposable mage weapons.” Eli thought for a moment. He wasn’t lacking in ordinary resources, and it was a good choice to convert these resources into combat power.

He returned to the laboratory.

Two years later, a large number of powerful one-time-use items and defensive items were stored in Eli’s arcane realm.

..

Time always passed quickly.

In the blink of an eye, another two years had passed.

At this moment, the Blood Alliance had finally begun a small-scale probe. The battle had begun, and people died every day. However, the number was still under control. Meanwhile, Eli was hiding in the back and was in charge of the distribution of resources. This job also allowed him to obtain a lot of first-hand information on the battlefield.

He had basically gathered all the materials for the Dice of Fate and was ready to refine them. This extremely complicated mage tool took Eli two years to understand how to refine it.

During this time, the war between the two forces had completely erupted.

One of the White Tower’s second circle representatives had already died, but the blood alliance’s situation was not good either. Two of their second-circle warlocks had died, but their overall strength was still stronger than White Tower.

However, what was strange was that the Blood Alliance seemed to be adopting a defensive strategy as if they were brewing something. This made everyone wonder what they were up to.

But everything was going well.

Many people even thought that the war would end soon.

In such an environment.

Eli’s Dice of fate was finally completed.
