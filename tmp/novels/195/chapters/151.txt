152 In Danger

New calendar year 3610.

The blood Alliance suddenly invaded the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.

The war broke out.

In the same month, Eli also arrived at his destination.

The kerna mountain range was a large mountain range on the West Coast. The terrain was complicated and there were many magical beasts, but there were not many resources. It was an ownerless land on the West Coast.

!!

This was the campsite of the iris mages.

Eli took a look at the huge mountain range and felt the soul imprint that belonged to Tijie. After determining the direction, he set off in one direction.

…

At the same time.

A battle was about to take place in the mountains.

The iris campsite.

“Damn it, are these magical beasts crazy? A sudden attack on the camp.” Tijie stood on the tower with a staff in her right hand, her eyes fixed on the magical beasts in the distance.

She was currently at the highest point of the campsite, the top of a dark mage tower that was seven to eight meters tall.

She saw a large residential area below her. Most of the buildings were made of stone, and a few were directly watered with soil and then solidified with sorcery.

Further away was a stone wall carved with runes. On the wall stood more than 20 mage apprentices and an official mage. They were staring into the distance.

Further away, there were trees and primitive plants. They were growing freely, showing their strong vitality. However, Tijie and the Mages were not worried about them. They were worried about the magical beasts that were moving in their direction.

Most of them were from the zero circles, including the Silver Moon Frost Wolf, dark demonic bear, saw-toothed wild boar, and many other common beasts in the wild. There were also the first circle Silver Moon Frost Wolf King and Striped Tiger.

In short, Tijie estimated that there were at least five to six first-circle demonic beasts and even more zero Circle demonic beasts. There were hundreds of them. A demonic beast tide of this number was not something they could guard against.

“Vice battalion commander, I’ve already investigated the matter. It seems that there’s a three-circle magical beast deeper in the forest, so the nearby magical beasts are all trying to move outside. We’re just unlucky to be in one of the routes.” Suddenly, a first-circle apprentice appeared beside her and reported to her.

Tijie rubbed her temples. This was really an unexpected disaster!

However, it was impossible to escape. In such a beast tide, the chances of survival were even smaller if they fled. Instead of escaping, they might as well fight to the death. There was still a glimmer of hope.

“Summon all the apprentices and mages here. We have no other choice.” Tijie glanced at the apprentice and walked out of the Tower.

Then, she headed toward the city wall in the distance.

“Tijie, you’re here.” Another first-circle mage saw her and greeted her.

“Hae, where’s the battalion commander?” Hae was a middle-aged man. He was wearing a gray robe and also holding a staff.

“Over there.” Hae turned his head.

On the other side of the wall, an old man was standing. His body was thin, but his eyes were bright. Both his mental force and life force showed that he was a mage in his twilight years.

Tijie nodded, knowing that it was not the time to talk. At this moment, the beast tide also arrived.

The dark mass of magical beasts brought a huge sense of pressure. The low roars of the magical beasts made the apprentices’ hearts beat fast. As one of the three official Mages, Tijie pursed her lips when she sensed the number of magical beasts.

Damn it!

“They’re here!”

At that moment, the nearest magic beast was already close to the wall. A magic Wolf leaped four to five meters.

“Extreme frost ray!” Tijie waved her staff, and a blue-white light beam shot toward the demonic Wolf. It hit the wolf and froze it into an ice block, causing it to fall heavily to the ground.

This seemed to be just a prologue. With the death of the first magic Wolf, the other magic beasts also rushed to the camp, wanting to tear the humans inside into pieces.

The second batch of magical beasts also roared and shouted, wanting to charge at the camp.

All of the apprentices took a deep breath and activated the dozens of magical Models at the same time. At the same time, a mysterious connection was formed between all the mages, as if they were a group.

Combined spell-fire curtain.

A huge spell model circulated under his feet, and a flame curtain tens of meters long swept toward the magic beasts, instantly burning dozens of zero-circle magic stones into ashes.

After using this spell, everyone took a deep breath and began to adjust.

During this process, the three first-circle mages, Tijie, Hae, and the battalion commander, did not move at all because they had to deal with more troublesome creatures. Those first-circle magical beasts were also much more cunning.

The battle continued.

Waves after waves of magical beasts came like a tide. At first, the apprentices used joint sorcery, but later, they began to fight on their own. Even the first circle mages, including Tijie, began to fight.

Hae was fighting with a first-circle demonic bear. He was very fast. Every time he waved his staff, a cutting force would fly toward the demonic bear, leaving a wound.

On the other hand, Tijie was fighting the Silvermoon Wolf King. She was constantly controlling the wolf King’s advance with her ice rays. There were also a few apprentices who were assisting her in her attacks.

Of course, the most powerful of them all was still the battalion commander, who was at the peak of the first circle. As he waved his staff, bolts of lightning wrapped around his body, and he attacked a first-circle magical beast. This magical beast that had just entered the first circle had no way of resisting.

The situation seemed to be great. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, as time passed, the number of magical beasts in the first ring gradually increased.

Gradually, the number of first-circle demonic beasts that Tijie and the others had to face increased to two or three. There were even zero-circle demonic beasts that kept harassing them.

The situation on the battalion commander’s side was even worse. He had been attacked by a full circle of magical beasts, and even though he was at the limit of the first circle, he was still being suppressed, and there were more than ten wounds on his body.

If the first-circle mages were already in this state, then the apprentices were even worse. All the mages in the camp had come out, and about ten of them had died.

“Damn it. I can’t hold on much longer.” Tijie dodged the attack of the magical beast once again. She felt a little hopeless.

“Tijie, Hae, I definitely can’t leave. I’ll create an opportunity for you guys. Run!” Suddenly, the battalion commander in the distance shouted at the two of them.

At the same time, she could feel her battalion commander’s life force burning up rapidly. At the same time, a terrifying lightning bolt shot out in all directions. In an instant, dozens of zero-circle magical beasts were killed, while the first-circle magical beasts nearby were paralyzed and unable to move.

This was the final counterattack of the mage who was at the end of his life.

“Go!” After the lightning dissipated, the battalion commander’s body looked extremely weak. His eyes were not as bright as before, but he still shouted at them.

Tears flowed out of Tijie’s eyes.

She had grown up in the camp, and it was this old man who had raised her. How could she run away now?

“Let’s go, Tijie!” At that moment, Hae ran over and pulled Tijie away.

“No, we can’t leave. What will happen to the apprentices if we leave? ” Tijie gritted her teeth.

“Damn it, do you think you can protect everyone? If you stay here, we will all die. Don’t waste the chance that our battalion commander has given us.” Hae cursed.

“Alright,” Tijie gritted her teeth and prepared to leave.

However, just as she turned around and was about to leave, suddenly, the soul brand in her mind that had not made a sound for a few years flashed, and a message was sent.

“Where is your camp? Why can’t I find it?”

Tijie was stunned.

What did that mean? Is Roland here?

Wasn’t it courting death to come here at this time?

She immediately told Eli not to come here, but before she could say anything, another piece of news came.”Oh, I found it. My perception was wrong.”

Found it?

Tijie was stunned.

Hae was also confused by Tijie’s reaction. He wanted to pull her away when he saw a man in a Black wizard’s robe, holding a magic staff in the distant forest.

…

“A monster horde of the first and zero rings? ” Just as Eli walked out of the mountain forest, he saw the tragic scene before him.

He didn’t expect such a thing to happen as soon as he found her, but since he saw it, he might as well deal with it.

Eli shook his head and activated the spell model. He waved his right hand. As he advanced to the late stage of the first circle, his power also increased a lot. This was within his scope of control.

In an instant, white bones began to appear in the shadows of the forest.

A few thousand zero-circle skeletons and 60 first-circle skeletons stepped out from the shadows, their undead flames burning as they looked at the monster horde.

The mages in the camp were stunned by what they saw.

Even the beast tide was stunned. The roaring magical beasts also fell silent for a second.

…

“A Necromancer?”

The sudden arrival of Eli caught everyone off guard. Tijie’s mouth was wide open as she looked at Eli. Originally, she was already surprised enough that Roland suddenly came to find her, but now, looking at the thousands of undead, she only felt that she was too ignorant.

The Necromancer was really overbearing!

“Who is he?” Hae was also stunned, not understanding what had happened.

The battalion commander, who had already burned his life force, stood still in the distance. Although he did not know who this Mage who had suddenly appeared was, he seemed to be prepared to save them.

The apprentices were even happier. They had all been in despair, but they didn’t expect to see a ray of light at the end of the tunnel.

What happened next was simple.

Everyone watched as the White skeletons collided with the beast tide. Although the beast tide was large in number, they were not united. As a large number of magical beasts died, the rest of the magical beasts fled.

It was the same for the first-circle beasts. Even though one of them could take on a few zero-circle skeletons, there were simply too many of them. They all wanted to escape, but there was no way Eli would allow that. After all, he had to replenish his supply.

Therefore, the skeletons fought back at first, but in the end, they surrounded and killed the first-circle magic beasts in front of everyone in the camp.

An hour later, as the last magical beast died, everyone looked at Eli, who was walking over from a distance, stepping on the bones and corpses. Instead of feeling grateful, they felt a little afraid.

Even Hae was frozen on the spot, not daring to move. He had no idea what the mage was up to. The battalion commander was looking at Eli from a distance, ready to confront him.

However, someone was faster than her.

“Sir Roland, why are you here? ”

Ha?

Everyone was dumbfounded. Deputy battalion commander Tijie knew this powerful foreign Mage?!
