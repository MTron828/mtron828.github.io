79 Ten Years

“Long time no see, director!”

In a bar, Eli met with Seviro Mesa, who was also the current head of the library.

“It’s indeed been a long time!” Seviro poured himself a large cup of rum and gulped it down. The liquid flowed down his beard.

After meeting ten years ago, the two of them became good friends. They would occasionally drink together and talk about his progress in finding mages.

“Where did you go this time?” Eli looked at the head of the library. Compared to ten years ago, he had aged quite a bit. His face looked a little haggard, but his eyes were still bright.

Just like before, he would travel to various countries every three to five days in search of traces of mages, but he still found nothing.

“When I went to the kingdom of Holme this time. I heard that there’s a very mysterious area there where people often go missing for no reason. In the end, when I arrived, I only found a place that’s covered in the fog all year round, and there’s only one magical beast in it.” Seviro shook his head, a little disappointed.

‘He’s obviously much older than I was ten years ago, but his desire to find a mage is stronger, like a flame burning his old body.’

“But that’s normal. No one knows where the mages are.” Eli said regretfully. He really hoped that the director could help him find the mage camp, but unfortunately, he never got it.

“Director, I’m curious why you’re so insistent on becoming a mage. Isn’t it better for you to persist with your current life?” Eli asked.

“You don’t understand!” The chief shook his head, looked at Eli, and said, “I think you’re a good person to communicate with, but you don’t seem to understand me that well. I’ve been looking for evidence for 20 years. It’s like an obsession that I can’t let go of.”

Eli nodded, still not quite understanding.

“Alright, where do you plan to go next, director? Will you go further from the kingdom?” Eli asked again.

“No. I’ve spent four years on this trip. I might not be able to come back if I go any further.” The director shook his head. “this time, I plan to stay in the Empire. I want to go to the places that Saleen Metatrin had been to in history. I want to look for what he might have left behind. This might be more reliable!”

“Good luck!” encouraged Eli.

Perhaps it was because there was no one he could talk to about these things, Seviro Mesa told Eli everything he knew, including the name of the first emperor, the possibility that he was a mage, and the king’s death from the forced use of a mage tool!

This piqued Eli’s interest as there were many things he didn’t know.

After all, Seviro Mesa had been in the Empire’s upper echelons for decades, and the information he had gathered was not something that Eli could compare to.

Eli listened with great interest while Seviro Mesa treated him as a confidant.

“Yes, I’ll be posted within the Empire for the rest of my life. This might be my last hope. Where are these mages? ” Seviro slammed his hand on the table, causing the rum to fly out.

Opposite him, Eli pursed his lips.

“Perhaps mages don’t even exist!” Eli nodded in agreement.

“No, they definitely exist. They just might not be nearby. ” Seviro shook his head, denying Eli’s guess.

“Alright,” he said.

“Also, I’m going to resign from my position as head of the library and focus on this matter.” Suddenly, Seviro dropped a bomb.

“What?” Eli’s eyes widened.

“Yes, I’ve made up my mind. I’m already 60 years old, and I really don’t have much time left. Besides, I haven’t contributed much to the library over the years, so I think it’s time for me to give up my spot. You don’t have to persuade me.” Seviro Mesa said firmly.

What else could Eli say? He just sighed. After all, it wasn’t easy to find a chief who was so carefree.

Eli hoped that the next head wouldn’t be a troublesome one. However, his teacher might be able to become the head. However, the possibility wasn’t high. After all, scholar Clement was already 68 years old. He wasn’t young anymore.

“well, Bryne the seventh is different from his father. He has some opinions about the independence of the library. If I leave, he might take action. You must remind your teacher!” Seviro added. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright,” Eli nodded.

This was bad news. After all, if the library became the king’s vassal, ignoring everything else, at the very least, Eli would be very displeased. After all, he had worked here for 18 years, and he had some feelings for it.

“Yes, that’s all. I should leave.” After drinking, Severo bid farewell to Eli.

“Goodbye, director. I wish you success this time.”

“Goodbye, I will definitely succeed!” Seviro strode out of the room, his eyes determined.

He would definitely find the mages.

After a few drinks, Eli also turned around and left.

Outside the door, it was a noisy bar. a large number of men and women were dancing on the dance floor. if they saw the right person, they would directly enter the room at the back of the bar.

If it were anywhere else, this would definitely not be allowed. However, this bar was opened on Liuying Street.

That’s right. This was the place where the two became friends. Nine years ago, when Eli came out of this place, he met Seviro, who had just come out as well, and the two of them gradually became familiar with each other.

“Mr. Eli, you’re leaving!” Before Eli could walk out the door, a woman in gorgeous clothes greeted him. She was the Nightingale here, the woman in charge of the place.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

In the past ten years, the girls here had changed a few times, and he knew many of the Nightingales here. They used to be prostitutes, but they later retired and became Nightingales.

As for why they would take the initiative to greet Eli, the reason was simple. If you spent a few gold tarls here every year, they would treat you the same way.

“Then take care!” the woman smiled as she sent Eli out.

It was already late in the afternoon when they walked out of the place.

Eli took a look at the sun, turned around, and headed home.

‘It’s a little late to go to the library now, so I’ll skip work for a day.’

...

The next day.

It was raining, so he skipped another day of work.

On the third day.

Eli headed to the library.

Just as he reached the entrance of the library, he heard the guards chatting.

“You know what? Director Seviro resigned of his own accord, and so did one of the Vice Directors. Coincidentally, a son of a noble family was appointed as the Vice Director. Do you think the king is going to take over the library?” One of the guards said worriedly.

“Who knows?” the other guard shook his head and suddenly saw Eli from the corner of his eye.

“Hello, Mr. Eli!” The two guards immediately stopped their conversation and said respectfully.

As the Vice director’s students, they were familiar with Eli.

Eli nodded and walked into the room, but the guard’s words still lingered in his mind.

A noble had already taken over a vice director’s spot. This was probably the king’s doing.

It had only been a day, and the king had already made his move.

Eli shook his head and prepared to have a chat with his teacher.
