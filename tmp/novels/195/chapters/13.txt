Chapter 14: Wizard’s Hand

Translator: Lonelytree

However, although Eli’s goal was to learn all the spells, it was a long-term problem after all. What he wanted to do now was to first learn some decent spells, then slowly learn other things.

Therefore, he first chose a few spells as his main targets of study. They were self-detection, wizard’s hand, and wind wall shield.

Self-detection was used to check one’s physical condition and other data. It could also check the state of one’s spiritual force and its specific value. It was one of the basic spells of a mage.

The wizard’s hand was easier to understand. It was the use of a spell model and filling in a large number of elements, then creating an elemental hand that could be controlled. The Sorcerer could control it to fight and even do some other things.

This spell could even be said to be one of the necessary spells for apprentices to learn. Saleen’s notes also suggested learning this spell.

This was because the construction process was very classical, and its power was not ordinary. From Level-1 apprentices to Level-3 apprentices, it could be used by anyone. Even advanced Wizards had advanced versions of it.

More importantly, this spell could also have different effects depending on the elements you fill in. For example, the explosive power of the fire element and the gentleness of the water element. The proportion was completely controlled by the Sorcerer himself, and the requirements for the mage’s control over the elements were not low.

As such, mage’s hand was also one of the most classic apprentice spells.

The reason why Eli chose this spell was because of its balanced characteristics.

The third spell, wind wall shield, was a defensive spell. It could summon wind elements to build a wind wall, which could effectively block attacks such as swords and spears.

Its advantage was that it seemed to be very effective against physical attacks and was not difficult to learn. Its weakness was that its defense against elemental attacks was average.

As such, there were very few acolytes who would actually learn this spell.

However, it was different for Eli. He was currently in the Byrne Empire, where only Knights had extraordinary powers. They relied almost entirely on physical attacks. This sorcery that was not recommended for apprentices was very suitable here.

The three above were the three spells that Eli had carefully selected.

More importantly, these three spells did not require any casting materials, which greatly facilitated the process of Eli’s search for materials. After all, many of the materials were truly impossible to find.

For example, a thorn manipulation spell could only be cast after finding a thorn seed with extraordinary characteristics. Where could he find it?

That was why there was a downside to learning to be a wizard in the Knight Kingdom. It was that the materials were not easy to find.

...

Eli was prepared to learn the self-detection spell first.

He adjusted his body and took a deep breath.

In his mind, the spirit energy began to transform into runes, and then a self-detection model was constructed in his mind. As it was his first time constructing it, Eli was very careful.

However, due to a certain carelessness, the soul fluctuation became unstable, and the model collapsed instantly. The first attempt failed.

Even if it failed, Eli wasn’t discouraged. He recalled the mistake he had made and then began his second attempt. This time, it went smoothly. The model was completed in one go, and he actually succeeded in one try.

He lit up the model.

A ray of light flashed in Eli’s eyes, and an invisible spiritual force appeared.

His mental power extended out from his brain and began to scan his body like a net. From his skin to his internal organs, from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet, everything was transformed into specific data that was received by Eli.

Although it wasn’t particularly accurate, it was enough for Eli to understand his own situation.

His body was stronger than an ordinary person’s. If an ordinary person’s physical fitness was 1, then his current physical fitness should be 1.2 and his spirit 4.5.

This was all due to his previous advancement.

Was it high? Not high!

According to Saleen’s notes, a normal person with a wizard’s gift would have a mental strength of more than three points even if they had started meditating. An increase of one to two points would usually be considered normal.

A level 2 acolyte required 10 points of spiritual power, a level 3 acolyte required 20 points, and an official Magus required 30 points. These were all things that Eli was currently unable to achieve.

In that case, how much did Eli’s spiritual power increase in the past half a month? The cruel truth was 0.025 points. In other words, if he wanted to advance to a level 2 apprentice, he would probably need more than ten years.

‘I do have trash talent!’ Eli pouted.

The golden age to become a wizard was before 50 years old. After that, his spiritual power would start to decline, and it would be very difficult to advance. But according to the current speed of his growth, it would probably take another 50 years for him to reach 30 points of spiritual power.

As for why it was 50 years, it was because the increase of a wizard’s spiritual force was not constant. A level 1 acolyte’s spiritual force would definitely increase faster than a level 3 acolyte’s.

“Perhaps Saleen did not expect that his legacy would be obtained by an apprentice with such trashy talent,” Eli said in a self-deprecating manner, but there was not much melancholy in his tone.

So what if it would take a hundred years?

He had a lot of time and was very patient.

‘I wonder if the Empire will still exist by then?’ Eli thought with ill intentions.

“Let’s not think about this anymore. Let’s continue learning magic.” Casting these thoughts out of his head, Eli decided to start learning the wizard’s hand.

But this time, it wasn’t so smooth. The difficulty of the wizard’s hand was on a completely different level from self-examination. Elil tried for an entire afternoon, but he didn’t succeed.

...

Two days later, in a forest outside Jun Lin city, Eli took a deep breath, and the spirit runes in his mind quickly circulated. His spirit flowed like silk threads, and the wizard model of the wizard hand was quickly constructed.

After a few seconds, the spell model was formed.

Eli’s eyes lit up, and a large number of elements quickly gathered in front of him, and an elemental hand appeared in front of him.

“I’ve finally succeeded.” A smile appeared on Elie=’s face. It had been two whole days, and he had only succeeded for the first time. The difficulty of this spell was indeed much greater than quick memory and self-examination. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The next step is to test the effect.”

With a thought, the elemental hand grabbed a small tree in an instant. With a crack, the small tree as thick as a bucket was directly broken into two, but the elemental hand did not change.

“other than consuming a bit of spiritual energy, there’s no other problem.”

After controlling it for a while more, Eli rubbed his temples, which were starting to hurt.

The effect of this spell was not bad, but it consumed a little mental strength. For example, he could only cast the spell five or six times at most.

“The path of a wizard is a long and heavy one! It’s time to go back, ” Eli sighed, glanced in the direction of the city, and returned.

The three-day holiday was over, and it was time to go to work.
