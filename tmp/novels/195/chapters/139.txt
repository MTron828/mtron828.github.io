140 He is a Good Person

At this moment, Heinz and the others had half-transformed into bloodline Warriors. Their bodies were covered in black scales and shadows, and their eyes had cruel black vertical pupils.

“Attack!” Heinz ordered, and the remaining five people started attacking.

Bang!

Bang Bang!

The black flames and sharp claws touched the shields and created sparks. With a ferocious smile, Heinz shattered the shields one by one.

Necromancers had much weaker bodies than warlocks. As long as he went in hard, Eli would be dead.

Looking at Heinz and the others who were attacking him non-stop, Eli couldn’t just ignore them. He started casting spells one after another and attacked them.

The two first-circle sorcerers managed to block the attacks with their strong bodies, but the rest of the apprentices died quickly. Heinz did not care about this and continued to cut down the shield.

The powerful attacks hit the shield one after another. As Eli attacked, he kept an eye on the remaining two.

One of them was at the middle stage of One circle, while Heinz was at the late stage. They were at a higher level than Eli, but they were both exhausted, and their bloodline power was also weakening.

Unlike mages, warlocks’ training mainly relied on the power of their bloodlines. The first circle warlocks also focused on the compatibility of their bloodlines. Both of them had at least a 60% compatibility, which should be considered the later stages of the first circle.

30% and below would be in the early stage, 30%-60% middle stage, and 60%-90% late stage. The equivalent for mages would be elemental conversion. Of course, the upper limit was usually 90%. After all, they were humans, and it was almost impossible to completely transform into either an elemental or bloodline.

Judging from Eli’s power of the will, he was a mid-stage first circle mage, but he was a weak warlock. Eli was only 34% compatible with the shadow dragon.

There was nothing he could do about it. He had chosen the path of a mage. In fact, most living mages would have moved onto the path of the warlocks by this point. Eli preferred to focus on his studies.

Pressed by the warlocks, Eli couldn’t use any powerful spells either. He could only watch as his shield was destroyed bit by bit, but his original intention was to exhaust his enemies anyway.

As the shield slowly disappeared, Heinz and his friend looked tired. The power of their bloodlines had also decreased.

“Heinz, we can’t continue. We need to take a break.” the other Warlock said with a tired expression.

“Yes.” Heinz nodded. He turned to look at Eli and said fiercely, “Damn necromancer, we’ll go in and take your head off in a moment.”

“Hehe!”

“What are you laughing at? come out if you have the guts!” Heinz said furiously.

“Alright!”

Heinz was about to curse when he suddenly heard this. He was stunned and then saw Eli slowly walk out of the shield.

Eli looked at Heinz and the other warlock. Then, a large shadow appeared on his body. Dragon scales covered his body, and his dark eyes gradually turned into golden vertical pupils.

“Come, let me see the shadow lizard’s bloodline.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

Once his enemies were exhausted, it was naturally his turn to act.

“you’ve also fused with a bloodline? ”

Heinz’s eyes were wide open. ‘this mage has learned too many things. Necromancy, elemental spells, and bloodline spells. Can you even learn all of them?’

However, this was not the most important thing. What was important was that when he looked at Eli, he kept feeling a terrifying suppression. It was his bloodline telling him that he needed to be afraid.

Was there such a bloodline on the West Coast?

Heinz’s throat moved slightly. “This feeling … Could this be a Dragon bloodline warlock? A warlock who had merged with the bloodline of a giant dragon?” the shadow lizard also had a trace of the bloodline of a giant dragon.

“Heinz, something is wrong!” The other Warlock also felt the pressure.

At this moment, they, who had used up more than half of their energy, looked at Eli and felt great fear.

“What? I’m out of my shield. Why aren’t you guys attacking?” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

After spending a few hours, wasn’t it all for this moment?

“Come on!”

“Heinz, go!”

On the other side, Heinz looked at his friend and attacked at the same time.

At this point, there was no time for regret, and as they got closer to Eli, they could feel the suppression of their bloodline even more, which made their already weak physical strength drain even faster.

The battle began.

“Go to hell!” Heinz cursed as he controlled the shadows around him to attack Eli.

However, he was stunned in the next second. Although the shadow had appeared, it did not attack Eli. Instead, it pounced directly at the two of them, drowning them.

Compared to the shadow lizard, the shadow Dragon was naturally even more powerful.

In the shadows, Heinz’s mouth twitched. He never thought that things would turn out like this. In front of Eli, their ability to control shadows was almost stripped away. In the darkness, he could only resist the shadows that came at him from all directions.

“Damn it!” Heinz cursed.

Suddenly, he felt a gust of wind beside his ear. His eyes widened, and he immediately dodged to the side. However, a Dragon Claw had already swept past his ear and tore a gash on his face.

Heinz’s throat moved slightly as he regretted his decision. After missing his attack, he immediately returned to the shadows and waited for an opportunity.

Just like that, Heinz kept observing while Eli kept looking for an opportunity.

Finally, ten minutes later.

As Heinz tried his best to defend himself, a Dragon Claw pierced through his chest, broke through his hard scales, and crushed his heart.

Heinz was dead!

With Heinz’s death, the shadow gradually disappeared.

It revealed Eli, who was standing on the ground, the dead Heinz, and the other warlock. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The shadow area created by combining the shadow dragon’s bloodline with other spell models was still very useful, but it consumed a lot of energy and was a little difficult to control. This was a skill that he had developed when he was free, and it was not bad for his first showing.

Moreover, this was a spell with great potential, and it had the potential to be improved continuously.

“ah, I was almost injured. If there were dozens more of them, it might have been dangerous!” Eli shook his head and looked at the only wound on his arm. It was caused by Heinz in the shadows. “Thankfully, no one is around to see this.”

No, wait. Eli turned to look at the castle. At this moment, through a window in the castle, Ross was dumbfounded.

Was Grandpa Herman, who was protecting him, that powerful?

On the other hand, Eli sighed. He should have knocked Ross out earlier. But now he had to brand the boy.

…

Three hours later.

Outside the capital city of Corina, a figure was running wildly.

His entire body was covered in pitch-black scales, and his vertical pupils were filled with anger and anxiety. When he saw the capital city, his speed increased, and he headed straight for the palace.

“damn it, damn it, damn it!” Eiffel’s face was filled with anger.

He had been on duty outside when he suddenly received news that his family was under attack. Furthermore, the one who told him the news was his old nemesis’ family. This made him turn pale with fright, and he immediately ran over.

He entered the palace.

He smelled the blood, and his heart skipped a beat.

Blood and corpses were everywhere.

Eiffel gritted his teeth. He had gone to almost every place, but there was no one alive. There was almost nothing left in the family.

Everything he had, the family he had managed for his entire life, was gone just like that.

“It’s gone, it’s all gone,” said Eiffel miserably, tears flowing down his tough skin.

Other than a few external members of the family, none of the direct family members, other than him, were alive.

He was already 200 years old. In addition to the injuries he had suffered when he was young, he didn’t have many years left to live. Today, all of his relatives had left him, which made him feel a little pained.

All the pain turned into sorrow, and Eiffel took out a dagger.

He picked it up with one hand and placed it on his chest.

He closed his eyes.

“What are you doing, Sir Effiel?” Suddenly, a voice was heard.

Among the brambles of a large tree not far away, a large patch of brambles slowly spread out, revealing Eli and Ross, who were blinking at the side.

Eiffel opened his eyes, and their eyes met. The atmosphere was awkward.

Eiffel’s mouth twitched. He didn’t expect someone to be alive. He didn’t even sense it just now, but when he saw Ross beside him, his eyes widened.

He quickly ran over and picked Ross up, confirming that he was really his great-grandson.

“Sir Eiffel, someone attacked this place a few hours ago. I fused with the bramble tree demon bloodline, so I immediately hid here with Ross until Sir arrived. What’s going on? ” Eli said in horror as if he recalled the terrifying scene from before.

“Who did this?” Although he didn’t know when Herman had advanced to the first circle, he didn’t have the time to care about that.

“I don’t know.” Eli shook his head.

“Forget it. I’ll investigate it.” Originally, he was already prepared to die, but he suddenly found out that his family members were still alive, so he immediately pulled himself together.

“Thank you, Herman.” Said Effiel with a serious expression.

“It’s nothing. I just want to protect myself.” Eli shook his head and sighed.

“Sigh, it’s a pity that I have nothing now. My collection room and the magic stones in my family’s storage have all been ransacked. I can’t give you a reward.” Said Effiel with a sigh.

“It’s alright, Sir. I will still receive my reward for the mission.” A forced smile appeared on Eli’s face.

“I’m still sorry. Don’t worry. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely reward you. But right now, I’m bringing my grandson to the Academy. I have to ask for an explanation. Moreover, that place is also the safest place. Why don’t you return to the camp first? I heard that the situation is quite serious there.” Said Effiel apologetically.

“Yes, my lord.” Eli nodded.

The two of them chatted for a while more, and then Effiel left with Ross.

…

On the way, Eiffel brought Ross to the Academy. He glanced at Ross and said, “not only did Herman save you, but he didn’t ask for a reward. He’s a good man. Don’t forget him in the future.”

Ross blinked.

A good person?

…

On the other side.

Eli sensed that Ross’ soul was in a normal state, and then took a look at the Elena family’s inheritance in his secret realm, before quickly leaving the city.
