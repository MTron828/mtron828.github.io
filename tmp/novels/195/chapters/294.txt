295 Anderson’s Confusion

At the same time.

At the Hourglass!

In a three-story building, a Warlock hurriedly passed through many doors and stepped on a red carpet. His eyes were filled with panic as he came to a large door!

When he saw the door, he immediately knocked on it gently.

“Come in!”

A vigorous voice was heard, and the Warlock immediately walked in.

It was a wild-looking room. The floor was carpeted with magical beasts, and on the wall were the heads of magical beasts that had been made into specimens. In the center of the room, there was a long table, and a tall man was sitting behind it.

“What happened? why are you in such a panic? ” Anderson looked at the man who walked in and said unhappily.

Ever since Situ had failed and been locked up in prison, the radical faction had been unable to recover. He had also completely grasped the hourglass, so he could be said to be triumphant during this period.

“Milord, something big has happened!” The Warlock was Anderson’s trusted aide, so he did not explain and only quickly said, “My Lord, ten days ago, we suddenly discovered a huge creature near the Holy tower. We determined that the sky cloud whale was from the Holy tower headquarters.

“Moreover, those who are qualified to use such mounts are probably important figures in the Holy tower.”

“What?!”

Anderson stood up abruptly, his eyes filled with shock.

Holy tower headquarters!

Did the headquarters in the central continent notice this place?

Could it be that they noticed the Holy tower’s destruction and were preparing to deal with the bloodline tower?

After the shock, Anderson was overjoyed!

They didn’t want the bloodline tower to develop like this, but Herman was too powerful!

However, if the Holy tower headquarters intervened, it would be a different story.

Not to mention Herman, it was even possible for them to uproot the bloodline tower.

With this in mind, Anderson’s eyes lit up, but in the next second, he seemed to have noticed a word in the Warlock’s words.

Wait … Ten days ago?

Anderson frowned and said angrily, “Why did I only know about this now?”

“Milord, there is a reason for this!” The Warlock said hurriedly, “We discovered the sky cloud whale but no one knew which force it belonged to.

“We used ten days before we determined it was from the Holy tower.”

“What’s the situation now?”

Anderson nodded.

“Milord, this is the strange part!” The Warlock was at a loss. A few seconds later, he said, ” after the group of warlocks entered the Holy tower, they seemed to have been staying in one area. Our people have been waiting outside, but no one has come out.”

Anderson, “…”

What kind of situation was this?

The Holy tower forgave the bloodline tower for its actions.

They can’t be that generous, right?

This was different from his understanding of power!

Could this be the method of a great force?

Choose to forgive?

Anderson and the Warlock looked at each other in confusion!

“Well, let’s observe first.” Ten seconds later, Anderson spoke.

“Yes, my Lord.”

..

“What? you found it?”

Luo ye looked at Eli, his eyes were wide open.

“Yes, yes, I found it, Sir Luo ye. Sir Udo had sent hundreds of people to check the terrain of the west coast. After comparison, we finally confirmed the location on the map!” Eli nodded and said seriously.

“that’s great. Since you’ve found it, go and call the others. I can’t wait!”

Luo ye was very surprised. He didn’t expect this group of people to be so fast.

He had thought that it would take one or two months to find it, but they found it in ten days.

It seemed that the Holy tower’s branch here was still capable.

With that in mind, he looked at Eli and said, “Don’t worry. When the time comes, regardless of whether we have any gains or not, I will talk to the tower master and give you the rewards you deserve!”

“thank you, Sir. I’ll go and inform the other Lords first!” Eli could not help but laugh and silently lowered his head.

He had to leave quickly, he couldn’t hold it in any longer!

Soon, with Eli’s notice, more than thirty warlocks rushed over!

And it wasn’t just them. Udo had also rushed over.

In the Wizard Tower.

Luo ye told everyone about the fact that the ruins had been found, and everyone also showed a happy expression. After all, although this place was not bad, everyone still preferred the central continent!

In his speech, Luo ye also especially praised the Holy tower branch for their swift action and said that he would reward them when he returned. The group of people nodded.

...

Udo kept his head down and didn’t speak.

“Indeed, Herman is not bad, but he made me spend a lot of money!”

“Sigh, although the Holy tower doesn’t really manage the branch towers, the warlocks here are very kind to us, especially Herman.”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

One by one, the warlocks nodded in agreement, and many of them looked at Eli as if they were good friends.

The corner of Udo’s mouth twitched.

My Lord, what have you done?

“Tower Master Udo, what’s wrong with you?” At this moment, Hall looked at Udo.

“It’s nothing, it’s nothing. I’m just thinking about how to make arrangements!” Udo laughed, his face kind.

“That’s good!” Hall nodded.

“Then let’s set off in three days.” Luo ye said loudly.

...

The others naturally nodded in agreement with Luo ye’s arrangement.

One by one, they returned and began to make preparations.

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

The team formed by Luo ye and the others walked out of the Holy tower with Eli as the guide. The atmosphere was harmonious.

The hourglass spy guarding the door finally saw these people for the first time. He then transmigrated this happy situation back to the hourglass. For a moment, Anderson was even more confused!

He even gathered a dozen warlocks to discuss it, but no matter how hard they racked their brains, they still could not understand why the Holy tower would do this. Was a great force so kind?

Just as they were lost, an airship left the Holy tower area and arrived at the forest of death.

They got off the airship and looked at the scene below the ground.

“Is this the place?” Luo ye looked at the ground and asked Eli.

“Yes, my Lord. It’s at the bottom of this forest!” Eli said.

Luo ye nodded, but then he began to worry.

How should he excavate it?

They could just rely on bombarding, but they didn’t have any earth-element warlocks!

“My Lord, Lord Udo has prepared a wizard tool. I have brought it here.” As Eli spoke, he took out a staff.

He waved his staff, and the soil on the ground began to wriggle. Then, the soil and the tree began to move slowly, like a vortex of soil. Gradually, a pit of nearly 100 meters and 20 meters deep appeared. At the same time, a mysterious spatial fluctuation began to appear.

“Is it the secret realm?” Luo ye’s eyes lit up, and he looked at Eli.

“Herman, you’ve done me a great favor this time!”

“It’s what I should do!”

Eli retracted his staff. It was actually just an ordinary wooden stick, and he was using his spell.

“Since we’re already at this stage, let’s go in and explore. Diogo and Cole, you two guard the outside. Herman doesn’t need to go in.” Luo ye looked to his side and said to the two third-circle warlocks.

Although the two of them were not the strongest, they were close to their limits and could be trusted.

“Yes, my Lord!” The two of them nodded.

“Then, everyone, let’s go in!” Luo ye glanced at everyone, then flew toward the entrance of the secret realm like a fire Lotus with flames around him.

The others followed suit. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

That included Hall and the others.

As they watched everyone enter the secret realm one by one, the three people who were left behind looked at each other.

“Everyone, do you want to play some cards?” Eli looked at the two of them and took out a deck of cards.

The two’s eyes lit up.

Thus, the three of them put down a table beside the pit and began to play cards.

On the other hand, Eli was playing cards as he cast a glance at the entrance to the arcane realm.

He had a backup plan where he could see the situation in the secret realm, so he didn’t panic.

When the time came, he would enter!

He would let them scout the place first!
