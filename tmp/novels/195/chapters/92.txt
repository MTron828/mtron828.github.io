93 Grief

What difference did it make for eli to break through to a level 3 apprentice? In fact, there was no difference.

He still did what he was supposed to do.

The power of his spells had increased by at least three times. Whether it was the flow of his mental force or the speed of casting spells, they had all increased by more than two times.

Secondly, his physical body seemed to have improved a little, between that of a grand knight and an advanced knight.

Of course, compared to Knights, mages had many more ways to improve their physical bodies. Be it magic potions with special effects, flesh modification, or even bloodline integration, they were all pretty good.

However, it was a shame that Eli didn’t have the ingredients. The Empire was like a mage’s wasteland. There were no mages, and there were pitifully few magical beasts. Furthermore, their levels were very low. Eli was not interested in such low-level creatures.

The seed was also slowly growing, which made Eli very happy.

…

However, a year later.

As Eli finished teaching the first princess, he pushed away the teary little princess and left the palace ” heartlessly “, but he received bad news.

“Teacher suddenly fell seriously ill.” The 53-year-old Herman told him with tears in his eyes.

“What?” Eli’s eyes widened.

The last time he visited his teacher was seven days ago. Why did he suddenly fall ill?

“What’s going on?” Eli asked anxiously.

“Eli, calm down. Our teacher is already 86 years old.” Herman had never seen Eli so agitated before. His face was filled with anxiety as he tried to calm him down.

“I can’t calm down. I have to go and take a look immediately.” Eli said. If there was a hierarchy for Eli’s social circle, Scholar Clement was undoubtedly at the forefront of the first ladder.

To some extent, Clement was like Eli’s father.

It was really hard to calm down.

Perhaps hundreds or thousands of years later, he could calmly face death, but now he had only been in this world for 30 years, and he was not in such a calm mental state.

Ignoring Herman, Eli boarded a carriage on the side of the road.

“Take me to…” He told him the address.

“Sir, this is a private coach.” The coachman was also stunned by this Eli.

“Start the car!” Eli said and threw the money bag over, not caring how much was left in the bag.

“Sir, I’m sorry.” the coachman was about to refuse, but when he saw the money bag falling on the carriage and all the gold tarls rolling out, his eyes widened in shock.

“yes, yes, yes sir.” The man’s breathing quickened, and he even stuttered.

He immediately turned the carriage around and set off toward the place that Eli had mentioned.

What a joke. Although the carriage had already been booked, was that important? In the face of that bag of money, nothing else was important.

“Hurry up!”

the carriage sped all the way, and the usual twenty-minute journey was completed in ten minutes.

Eli got off the carriage.

In front of them was an apartment area where Clement lived.

He walked straight in. Following the path in his memory, he quickly found his teacher’s house.

He took out the key and walked in. This was the key that his teacher had given him. He remembered the exact words at the time, “keep this key. Your teacher doesn’t make money, so I have nothing good for you. When I die, I’ll leave this to you.”

At that time, Clement had even told him the proof of his property and where some of his inheritance was.

He entered the room.

Eli thought there was no one there, but he didn’t expect it to be surrounded by people. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His teacher was lying on a bed, showing his old age. His eyes were closed, and his body was not in good condition. Looking at his vitality, it was almost the same as seviro Mesa.

There were two men and two women surrounding his bed.

Eli had never seen them before.

“Who are you? How did you guys get in?” One of the women chided.

“I’m teacher’s student. Who are you?” Eli’s eyes narrowed slightly.

He didn’t know if his teacher had any relatives.

“I’m the mother of the husband of Clement’s sister’s daughter. I heard that Clement was in a bad state, so I came to visit him.” The woman explained when she heard that he was Clement’s student.

Eli understood. His teacher was dying, and suddenly, all his ‘relatives’ appeared. So ‘touching’!

“Get lost!” Eli’s language was simple as well, expressing his meaning.

“Little brother, what do you mean by this?” The man beside him glanced at Eli and said.

“No matter what, we’re still your teacher’s family.” The man scolded.

“Get lost!” As soon as he released his mental power, they broke out into cold sweats.

A few seconds later, as if they had seen something terrifying, they immediately ran out of the room as if they were running for their lives, leaving behind Eli and Clement.

This was a simple application of the bewilderment-type fear spell. Special mental power fluctuations would make the human brain produce specific hormones, causing fear and imagination.

As for what the few of them had seen, Eli had no idea.

A few of them left, and Eli silently closed the door.

He returned to the bed and looked at clement.

Suddenly, a series of coughs could be heard.

Clement opened his eyes and looked around. Then he looked at Eli in surprise. “What about those few people?”

“They left,” Eli replied.

“Eli, I’m really not going to make it this time. You’re really on your own from now on.” Looking at Eli, Clement smiled with a pale face.

There were a lot of things to say, but at this moment, even Eli couldn’t say anything.

“I know you can take care of yourself. I don’t have much money, so you can share it with Herman. Also, help me take care of Herman. He always makes people worry.” It seemed like Clement had to use all his strength to say a word.

“Teacher, he’s already 53.” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

“Hmph, in my eyes, you’re all still children!” Clement smiled.

Eli nodded.

“Yeah, and don’t be so sad. I’m not going to die today.” Clement said with difficulty.

“Teacher, you need to save your strength.” Eli held clement’s hand.

“I’ll rest for a while. You can go first. Call Herman over too.” Clement closed his eyes. He really had no strength left.

Eli silently put down Clement’s hand.

Soon, Herman arrived, and Clement said the same things to him.

…

Three days later.

On this day, Herman and Eli were sitting on the sofa in the teacher’s room.

He was silent.

Suddenly, Eli looked up and looked at the bedroom not far away.

Tears flowed down her face.

“Herman, we don’t have a teacher anymore!”

His teacher’s life force had completely disappeared.

This was the saddest day that Eli had ever experienced since he came to this world.

Year 337 of the bane calendar.

The Imperial Library’s Grand scholar Clement died.
