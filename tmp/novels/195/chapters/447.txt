448 The Reaction of All Sides

The next day!

Thank you readers!

In the Mage Tower, Eli met Liliana.

” Eli, you’re really surprising me more and more. ” Liliana looked at Eli and sighed.

Even though it had been half a day since she received the news this morning, she still could not believe what had happened yesterday!

The invading demons had actually ambushed eight Radiant Sun warlocks. If not for Eli’s timely arrival, the Western Regions would have lost at least a quarter of their population. The hundreds of millions of humans in the eastern region would have died to the demons, and the impact would have shaken the entire Midland.

!!

Of course, the most shocking person was still Eli. This was the first time she felt that she still did not know this man clearly!

He was ridiculously strong!

“Yes.” Eli smiled and nodded, then asked, “What happened to the war after that?”

“The demons who lost their peak combat strength were naturally no match for the Alliance. After three hours of fighting, the warlocks regained the territory occupied by the demons. The spatial rift was also discovered in the center of the city. However, when everyone arrived, they found that the spatial rift could not be destroyed!” Liliana was happy at first, but then her tone became serious!

“Unbreakable?”

“Yes, demons can still pass through that spatial rift. The highest level of demons that can pass through is the Radiant Moon demons. Several factions have already arranged for a large number of Warlocks to guard it!” Liliana continued. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Radiant Moon level? But weren’t there so many Radiant Sun demons before? What happened to them?” Eli asked curiously.

“I don’t know about that, but everyone is guessing that this might be because a large amount of spatial power was produced in the beginning. In that state, the crack was larger, but after the area stabilized, it might have shrunk to a certain extent!” Liliana explained.

Eli nodded, but he was thinking about the possible conspiracy.

However, there were too few clues.

“Alright!” Eli shook his head, but a sense of urgency arose in his heart!

It seemed that the exploration of the Giant King’s fragment had to speed up. He needed to become stronger!

…..

“What is it? Are you sure this is true?”

Conilla rubbed his ears, feeling as if he had just heard the most ridiculous thing in the world.

” Yes, my lord. That’s what happened. Eli came to the battlefield and killed all the high-level demons! ” Conilla ‘s trusted aide said.

” Alright, as expected of Eli. It seems that we have underestimated him. Fortunately, Sir has arrived. Otherwise, I’m afraid that the Western Regions will be in chaos in an instant, and our business will be greatly affected! ” Conilla sighed deeply.

No one had thought much of it before the war, but they had expected such a change to happen!

It was indeed ridiculous!

Fortunately, there was Sir Eli.

“Oh, right. Sir, there’s another very important matter.” Suddenly, the trusted aide spoke again.

“Oh?” Conilla looked over.

” Lord Conilla, Lord Jin Ji and the president have returned from the eastern region. They should be back in a month at most. Lord Jin Ji said that he hoped to meet Ely at that time. He hopes Lord Conilla can arrange it! ” the trusted aide said quickly.

“He is finally back!” Conilla’s eyes lit up when he heard that. He heaved a sigh of relief. After all, managing a faction was very tiring!

“Hey, didn’t they say that the ruins were related to Gray’s student? Did they find any clues?” Conilla asked curiously.

“Sir, I don’t know about this. You can ask Sir Jin Ji about this.” The trusted aide shook his head. Clearly, this was not something he should know.

“Alright then!” Conilla nodded. He was going to take stock of his work and hand it over to Jin Ji.

…

The City of Dawn!

The sun slowly rose, and the light was the first to illuminate a gray-black wizard tower that was 100 meters tall in the city.

At this moment, in a dimly lit room on the highest floor, Tuman was standing in front of a table with his head lowered. He seemed a little nervous!

After a few minutes, he raised his head and looked behind the table. There was a man in red sitting on a scarlet high-back chair. His skin was pale, and his eyes were dark. He looked like he was twenty years old, but his face was dark!

“My lord, the plan has failed!” Tuman said slowly.

“Do I need you to remind me?” The man raised his head and looked at Tuman coldly.

Tuman felt a chill run down his spine because the man in front of him was the ruler of the Heart of the Abyss, Nero Stark.

“Then what should we do next, sir?” Tuman asked again.

Nero did not answer. He stood up and stretched his body to the window. After looking at the scenery of the City of Dawn for a few minutes, he said, “Let’s act according to the plan. After all, it’s a normal process for the demons to be eliminated. No one expected a problem like Eli to appear, forcing the plan to be brought forward. How troublesome! ”

” Then, does my lord need to deal with Eli? ” Tuman asked.

“There’s no need. There’s no hurry. Take your time.” Nero shook his head and turned to Tumen. “Just follow the plan. Wait for the next few decades. Don’t let anyone find any flaws. You can go now! ”

“Yes, sir!” Tuman nodded and left.

After Tuman left, Nero looked at the City of Dawn again. His expression was still calm, but a few seconds later, it became distorted as if his defense had been broken.

“Damn Eli!”

….

Three months had passed!

As time passed, news of the war spread rapidly, and the Western Regions were shaken.

It wasn’t just the Western Regions. Some of the relevant information had also spread to the Central Region, and the higher-ups of many factions had also heard of this name.

The most direct evidence was Eli’s fourth Imprint of Faith had completely taken shape and was still slowly filling up!

Of course, at this time, the bodies of the eight demons were also sent to Eli. Other than one that was intended to be used as research material, Eli refined the rest into the undead and expanded them into the undead army. After all, these were top-notch materials.

Human Warlocks weren’t suitable in this aspect because once they died, their bloodline would disappear. Naturally, their dead bodies would only be considered ordinary. However, these foreign races possessed powerful physiques, so they made excellent materials.

Eli felt that with his ability, he would be able to create at least eight Radiant Moon undead. Of course, refining them would take time. Eli looked forward to the day when it could be used!

...

Apart from that, there was also the issue of how the Saka Family would be dealt with. The three families handed over the right to deal with the Saka Family to the Bloodline Tower.

Although the Saka Family’s territory had been destroyed, they were still a second-class force after all. They still had a lot of resources, which allowed the Bloodline Tower to obtain a lot of resources. Coincidentally, there was a super large wind element lode there, which was good for Nikola’s growth!

The spatial rift was currently under the joint watch of a few factions!

Eli also decided to go over and take a look.

He would see if he could deal with the rift when he was there.
