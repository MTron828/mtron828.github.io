158 The Eighth Representative, Herman

In front of him was a huge town.

There were Gothic-style buildings everywhere. One by one, the buildings rose from the ground. The sharp towers seemed to pierce the sky. There were no walls here, and there were no guards.

Of course, these were not the most eye-catching things. The most eye-catching thing was the Mage tower in the center of the building.

The tower was white in color and was a hundred meters tall. Its huge size was the largest building that Eli had ever seen in this world, and it was so eye-catching that he could even vaguely see it in the forest.

“It used to belong to the shadow lizard, and it was black in color. Later, the chairman felt that it didn’t fit the name of our force, so he changed it to white. It’s so funny,” Theron said with a smile.

“Hahaha!” Kratos couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that.

“Eli didn’t expect such a thing to happen, so this should be the territory of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy, and now it belonged to the White Tower.

Speaking of the shadow lizard, Eli didn’t forget about Rock’s son, Ross. He could sense that Ross was still alive. The interesting thing was that he was captured and imprisoned in the White Tower’s prison, and it didn’t seem to be in a good state. He would have to wait until the storm was over to get him out.

“Yes, let’s go in. I’ve already informed the others. We should be able to hold our first meeting soon.” Kratos said to Eli.

Following Kratos, they entered this place.

As expected of a force, the number of acolytes here was far from what the Warlock Academy of the past could compare to. Just by walking along the road, there were probably hundreds of people. There were also some in the first circle, but there was no one in the second circle other than the two beside him.

On the way, Eli felt helpless.

Due to the clamoring of the people behind him, the news of Herman’s return quickly spread.

Soon, a large group of apprentices surrounded both sides and looked at Eli.

“So this is Herman? He looks average!” Someone asked.

“He looks better than you.” A female apprentice cast a glance at him.

“Even now, I still have nightmares of those green fungi. It’s too scary.”

Soon, more and more people gathered around them. Kratos smiled helplessly. This guy, Eli, was really famous.

“Disperse, disperse!” Kratos dispersed loudly, and the surrounding people began to disperse.

After the crowd dispersed, Kratos brought Eli to a mage Tower.

“This Tower is for you. You can live here, and of course, you can go anywhere else.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In front of him was a mage Tower that was more than ten meters long. It was black all over, but there were many plants climbing on it, and there was a fence around it. It was a good place, and Eli was very satisfied.

“This place will do.” Eli nodded.

“Okay, you should unpack first. We’ll inform you of the meeting later. Oh, and this is your identification.” Kratos nodded and threw a new token to Eli.

This token was of a much higher grade than the previous ones. It was made of aske copper, a precious ore. There was a White Tower carved on the surface, which looked very exquisite.

“This is a representative’s identity card. I’ve kept it here for a long time, and it’s finally returned to its original owner.” Kratos answered with a smile.

“Thank you, sir.” Eli took the token. Returning to the faction was much smoother than he had expected.

“It’s okay. You deserve this. I’ll be leaving then,” Kratos smiled.

“I’m leaving too. I’ve finally met our poison master today.” Theron, who had been following them, also left with a smile. The others also gradually dispersed.

The crowd dispersed, and Eli also walked into the Tower.

There were four floors inside the tower. It didn’t look big from the outside, but the area wasn’t small at all. After a simple cleaning, Eli could start living there.

At night.

Lying on the bed, Eli looked around at the unfamiliar environment and took out the token that belonged to this place.

Looking at the White Tower on the token shimmering in the dark, Eli knew that from today onwards, his life would once again enter a new stage.

…

In the next few days, Eli didn’t go out either, he just stayed in the Tower.

Three days later, Eli received the news of a meeting being held the next day.

The next day.

After arranging his clothes in front of the mirror, he walked out of the Tower and headed towards the White Tower in the center.

The White Tower was in the middle of the town, and there were two guards at the door, both wearing the same uniform. They constantly checked the identity of the people who entered, and Eli went up and took out his token.

“Are you parliament member Herman? ” The guard held the token and asked in surprise.

Eli nodded.

“Please follow me, my Lord.” The guard handed the token to Eli respectfully, then walked into the White Tower.

After entering the White Tower, Eli finally realized how big the area was. Each floor was at least a few hundred square meters in size. The first floor was responsible for some basic daily work in the camp, so there were many people.

It was obvious that the meeting was not held here. The guard brought Eli upstairs.

Soon, after passing through the second floor, which was in charge of internal affairs, and the third floor, which was in charge of external affairs, Eli arrived on the fourth floor and was led into a meeting room by the guards.

It was a huge conference room.

There was a huge long table with a red cloth on it. A huge high-back chair was placed on the main seat, and fifteen smaller high-back chairs were placed on both sides.

Of course, what was strange to Eli was that other than the three chairs near the main seat, there were numbers on the back of the other chairs, from one to twelve.

There weren’t many people here at the moment, only about four or five. The ones in the second circle were Kratos and Theron, whom Eli was familiar with.

“Herman, your position is over there!” Seeing that Eli had arrived, Kratos pointed to a chair with the number eight behind it.

He nodded and sat down without talking to the others. Instead, the others looked at him curiously. It was their first time seeing him.

In the blink of an eye, another half an hour had passed.

At this moment, fifteen out of the sixteen seats had been filled. Only the central main seat was empty. Meanwhile, Eli looked around and realized that apart from the three Deputy Ministers who were second-circle, the others were all first-circle. This gave him a clearer understanding of the White Tower’s situation.

Time slowly passed.

After half an hour, the door slowly opened, and a man with white hair walked in. He looked at the crowd and then sat directly on the main seat.

It went without saying that he was the chairman of the White Tower, the second circle wizard Marcus.

“It’s a pleasure to see everyone.” Marcus sat down and smiled at the crowd. The atmosphere was peaceful.

He also looked at Eli and said, ” you’re Herman, right? Nice to meet you. Your virus played a big role in the war.”

“This is what I should do.” Eli nodded humbly.

The others also looked over curiously. It was their first time seeing Herman.

“Haha, no need to be humble.” Marcus laughed and looked around, ” “Since everyone is here, let’s begin. This is the first time the White Tower Council is being held, and I will be the chairman.

“The first item is the future development of the White Tower, the second item is the work distribution of the members, and the third item is to reward everyone for your outstanding contribution to the war. I hope no one has any objections.”

“No!” Everyone said.

“Well, very good. Then, I’ll start with the first item.

“the White Tower is a new force, so the first thing we should do is to develop internally, not expand. So, for the next period of time, our core will be developed so that we will have many measures in various aspects. I will explain this to everyone one by one.”

Marcus took out a document and started explaining everything one by one. After that, the councilmen would vote to decide. At this moment, Eli also knew what the numbers behind him were for.

It turned out that this was what determined the warlocks’ position in the Parliament. The leader had the right to veto and ten votes, while the Deputy Minister had five votes. After that, there were four votes from number 1 to 3, and three votes from number 4 to 6, and the votes decreased in turn.

So, Eli was number eight, with two votes. He could sit here entirely because of his great contribution to the war and Kratos’ influence.

The direction of development had been discussed for a long time, so naturally, there was nothing to say. Basically, everyone agreed.

Very quickly, the meeting moved on to the second topic, and everyone was assigned their duties.

“Theron, you’re in charge of all the warlocks in the organization. Kratos, you’re in charge of the distribution of resources. Jesse, you’re in charge of all the external forces.”

After the three Deputy Ministers were assigned their duties, it was the representative’s turn. Eli was also very curious about what duties he would be assigned.

After the Warlocks in front were assigned, it was soon Eli’s turn.

“Herman, since you were Kratos’s subordinate, you’ll take on the part of his responsibilities. From today on, you’ll be in charge of the dispatch of all the magical plants and potions in the organization.” Marcus said as he looked at Eli.

“Alright,” Eli nodded.

This was already quite a lucrative job. After all, although the White Tower was a new force, its scale was much larger than the previous camp, and the benefits were not small at all.

Soon, it was time to talk about the rewards. Basically, they were all the remains of the shadow lizard Academy, and when it came to Eli, the reward was 20000 magic stones, and the shadow lizard laboratory was given to him.

Eli was already very satisfied. After all, his laboratory had been set up decades ago, and much of the experimental equipment was very broken. Now that he had a better one, he felt much more relaxed.

After the rewards were given, the meeting was considered to have ended. Marcus said a few more words and left.

The others also left one after another.

Just as Eli was about to leave, he was stopped by Kratos.

“Herman, let’s have a chat.”

“Alright!” Eli nodded.
