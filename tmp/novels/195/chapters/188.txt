189 Nikola

The entrance of Eli and the girl immediately attracted the attention of many undead.

In the blink of an eye, another few dozen undead let out shrieks and charged toward Eli. On the other hand, Eli waved his hand gently, and countless shadows shot out in all directions.

Like torrential rain, the terrifying shadows instantly tore all the undead apart. The originally noisy sounds instantly fell into silence. Then, a vortex appeared, and all the undead fragments surged toward Eli, being absorbed by him.

“Burp!”

A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

At this moment, looking at the cleared area of a few hundred meters, the civilians in this area also stopped and looked at this scene in a daze. For a long time, they did not make a sound.

“This must be a miracle.”

The priest was the first to break the silence. He looked at Eli as if he was looking at a God.

For an ordinary Kingdom of Knights, they had never seen a mage in their entire lives. Eli’s actions were no different from a miracle.

“What kind of power is this?!” The Knights, on the other hand, were shocked. They had always been taught that Knights were the strongest, but at this moment, their faith was a little shattered.

The ordinary people were also shocked. They looked at Eli with gratitude in their eyes. The child found his mother and hugged her tightly. The wife and husband hugged each other and cried.

“Thank you, my Lord.”

Many people knelt on the ground and thanked him.

However, it was only for an instant because the undead from other places quickly approached as well, sensing the powerful essence of Eli’s soul.

A few hundred undead gathered together, forming one. Its aura had reached the second circle, and its size was over a hundred times larger than before. It looked at Eli and let out a terrifying undead shriek.

The terrifying cry caused the ears of ordinary people to bleed, and they knelt on the ground and wailed. On the other hand, Eli’s face was calm. His soul shield blocked everything.

The soul Shield’s power had already reached the second circle, and beside the model, there was another focused spell. It was a new spell that Eli had fused with when he advanced to the second circle.

“I haven’t used it for so long that I’ve almost forgotten that there’s such a spell.”

Looking at this, Eli pursed his lips. This situation was just right.

The next second, the model was activated.

Eli’s eyes began to change, and everything before his eyes seemed to be distorting. The sky was no longer blue, but lines formed from various colors, and humans were no longer humans but a collection of all sorts of complicated things. Even the undead turned into hundreds of undead that looked like a puzzle.

2nd-circle focused spell-eye of truth.

The 2nd-circle spell that he had solidified was a very special but also very practical spell.

“I found it.” In his eyes, a core could be clearly seen inside the giant spirit.

With a wave of his hand, a huge elemental hand appeared and grabbed the spirit core.

“Roar!”

The undead let out a sharp cry again. Their bodies struggled violently, but they couldn’t move at all. They also sensed a shadow flying over again. In the dazed state of the undead, the shadow directly stabbed into the core.

A sound that sounded like radio had short-circuited rang out. The second-circle revenant fell apart in an instant. Then, a gust of wind element blew up, and the Revenant surged into Eli’s arm, being absorbed by him.

“Cool!”

After swallowing the feast again, Eli felt his spiritual power growing again.

Beside him, Catarina held his hand and stared at him with her big eyes.

In her years of experience, she had never seen such a terrifying scene. And in the scream just now, a soul shield had protected her.

“It’s rare to have such a good opportunity.”

On the other hand, Eli was looking at the undead flying around the capital, his eyes shining.

They were all his.

..

At the same time.

In the main hall of the palace.

Nikola was sitting on a golden throne.

Below the throne, the king, Queen, and ministers knelt down. They were usually high and mighty, but now they did not dare to say a word. Not far away, the Grand Knight, who was also kneeling, had long forgotten the spirit of chivalry.

“You’re the king of this place, right?” Nikola looked at the man wearing a crown and gorgeous clothes.

“Yes, yes, yes.” The king quickly lowered his head, and the crown fell to the ground along his head, rolling to the throne.

“Truly lowly.” Nicholas shook his head. “I want you to immediately gather the people from the nearby cities here. There are still too few people here. I need more people.”

As long as he had enough undead, he would be able to get back to his third circle.

“Yes, yes, yes, my lord.” The king said hurriedly.

“Eh, something’s wrong.” Nikola’s eyes were looking outside. Just now, he had sensed the disappearance of a large number of spirits.

What was happening?

Nicholas flew up into the sky, passing through the Golden buildings, and arrived in the sky above the palace of the capital. He looked around.

But the next second, he was stunned!

“What the hell is that?”

Nikola was stunned. In his eyes, his undead army was not killing but fleeing. They were fleeing in large numbers as if they were fleeing from a disaster.

Behind the thousands of spirits, a small black dot, or rather, a human figure, was chasing them. The huge elemental hand would grab a bunch of spirits from time to time and devour them as if they were eating a buffet.

“A first circle Mage?”

Judging from the aura, it should be a first-circle mage.

...

Nicholas was angry. How dare you!

“Hiss!”

A shrill cry that echoed throughout the entire capital rang out, and Nikola rushed towards Eli.

These were resources for his advancement. How did this wizard dare to do this?

He was an undead at the peak of the second circle!

The people in the palace did not feel anything when they saw this scene. They only thought that Eli was dead for sure. As a Kingdom close to the mage World, they knew about the existence of mages and warlocks. There was also a first-circle Warlock in the palace, but he was killed by a soul attack from the undead.

This was also the reason why they were so respectful.

“Sigh, another one died.”

“So what if he’s a Warlock? He’s useless!”

The group of people knelt on the ground with peace of mind. Some of them took the opportunity to change their positions, feeling a little tired.

However, when someone looked over the next second, they were stunned.

In the sky, a giant hand made of shadows appeared and then hit Nikola’s big face.

Nikola was sent flying.

???

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Not only them but Nicola was also stunned. He felt the cold shadow on his face and felt extremely humiliated. Then he rushed over again.

Pa!

Another big slap.

Again.

Pa!

Again.

A few minutes later, Nicola, who had been slapped a dozen times, burst into tears!

It wasn’t that he wanted to cry but that the undead’s body would instinctively shed undead tears when it was stimulated too much. It was a rare material and very expensive.

More than a dozen slaps were too much damage to an adult undead.

He looked at Eli, and the look in his eyes had completely changed.

He was definitely not a first-circle warlock!

He was at least a second-circle warlock. Judging from the “battle” just now, the man in front of him was much stronger than him. Nikola was no match for him.

“Who are you?” Nicholas hung high in the sky, looking down at Eli, who was collecting the undead tears, and the corner of his mouth twitched.

“This is a precious material!”

After collecting all the tears, Eli looked at Nikola, who was high in the sky!

“You can call me Roland. That’s what everyone calls me.” Eli’s face was still the same as the one that went to the mage camp.

“Roland? ” Nicola had never heard of it before, and his eyes became serious. “However, you’re only at the limit of second-circle. It’s impossible for you to defeat me. Since I dared to show myself, it means that I have absolute confidence.”

Nikola opened his arms and screamed. All the spirits of the dead in the capital city seemed to be summoned and merged into his body, and his aura became stronger and stronger.

A few seconds later, his aura even reached the third circle.

Roar!

A huge undead aura was released, and the surrounding air seemed to be a few degrees colder. Nikola spread his arms and lowered his head to look at Eli, revealing a ferocious smile.

But to his surprise, Eli actually laughed.
