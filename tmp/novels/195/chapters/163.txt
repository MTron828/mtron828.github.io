164 The Unfortunate White Tower

The giant Eagle let out a long cry.

Three days later, Eli and the others arrived at their destination.

It was still the familiar Semi Highlands, but there were already quite a number of people stationed on the Highlands. Eli stood on the giant Eagle and looked down. At the center of the Highlands, there was an altar and an ancient door that was emitting a mysterious spatial aura. There was also a vortex at the center.

“This is it. It seems that the Blood Alliance has arrived in advance.” Kratos stood in the front and looked at a corner in the distance.

Dozens of earthly beasts were eating on the plateau in twos and threes. Not far away, there was a large tent. The tent was tall, and there was a symbol belonging to the blood Alliance on the outside, a blood-red Wolf head.

Eli also looked in that direction, but he did not see anything due to the distance. At this moment, the giant Eagle let out a long cry and slowly descended.

Landing on the ground, Kratos was the first to jump off the giant Eagle, followed by Eli and Rawls.

“My Lords, welcome.”

The one in charge of guarding this place was a first-circle White Tower Warlock. At this time, he came over with a flattering face.

“Well, let’s go to the tent,” Kratos said without any nonsense.

“Alright!” The first circle warlock smiled and led Kratos and the other two to the largest tent in the temporary camp while the others entertained the other first circle warlock and apprentices.

Soon, the three of them arrived at the tent, and all the important people were called there.

Kratos sat in the main seat while Rawls and Eli sat on both sides.

“Tell me about the situation in the secret realm and the situation with the blood Alliance,” Kratos asked.

“My Lord, this secret realm shouldn’t be considered a very dangerous secret realm, but there are many things left inside. I guess they were left behind when the mages evacuated.

“So far, the most powerful magical beast we’ve found should be in the center of the Academy. There’s a group of mutated monsters left behind there, and there’s one at the limit of the first circle. The others are just average, but there might be other magical beasts scattered in the secret plane.”

Someone immediately took out the record and began to tell Kratos.

“There’s also the Blood Alliance. This time, they should be sending a late-stage second circle Warlock, Dick, a kemoyin serpent Warlock. He’s also very strong in combat. He’s the only second-circle Warlock. There are also thirty-two first circle warlocks and about one hundred and ten apprentices.”

“It seems that the Blood Alliance still abides by the rules!

“Herman, Rawls, this time, second circle warlocks won’t be joining the battle. You’ll enter the secret plan to guide the expedition. Do you have any questions?” Kratos turned to look at the two of them.

“Well, do you have the name list of the Blood Alliance? I’d like to take a look.” Eli said. One could never be too cautious.

“Sir Herman, there is.”

Soon, an apprentice respectfully handed three documents to the three of them. Even though it was only for Herman, they had prepared three for each of them.

Eli began to flip through the pages.

The records in the document were relatively complete, and it also indicated some important targets to pay attention to.

Two of them required the most attention.

The first was Adams, who was at the limit of One circle. He was a Warlock from the giant kemoyin serpent. It was said that his bloodline was very dense, and he was able to activate his bloodline talent even though he was just a first-circle warlock. He was a genius of the kemoyin clan.

There was also Molin, who was at the limit of first-circle. Molin had the mystic butterfly bloodline, and many people had been fooled by it.

Eli and Rawls were also looking carefully. After all, a battle was about to happen, and he did not dare to be careless.

Moreover, from this document, it could be seen that the strength of blood Alliance was actually stronger than the White Tower. After all, they only had Rawls, who was at the limit of the first circle.

Of course, this was also related to the birth of the White Tower. According to the current ranking of the forces on the West Coast, they were generally divided into top forces, first-rate forces, second-rate forces, and third-rate forces.

As for how to differentiate the different levels of power, apart from the reference to first circle warlocks and territories, the main point was the combat power of the forces.

A third-rate force would have at least one two-circle warlocks, a second-rate force would have at least three or more two-circle warlocks, and a first-rate force would have at least ten or more two-circle warlocks.

Of course, this could only be used as a reference. After all, it was normal for some forces to hide a few higher-ranked warlocks. No force would expose all their hands.

The White Tower and the blood Alliance were second-rate forces, but the blood Alliance had eight second-circle warlocks, while the White Tower only had five. After all, the blood Alliance had been developing for a long time.

“Herman, don’t die!” After Rawls finished reading the file, he said to Eli with a complicated expression.

This time, the overall strength of the blood Alliance was much stronger than theirs, and their situation was not very good. If they didn’t get the blood soul Flower, they might lose their lives inside.

“You be careful too.” Eli glanced at him.

Rawls wasn’t actually a bad person. He seemed to be obsessed with defeating Eli. Otherwise, Eli wouldn’t have kept him alive until now.

“Yes, the situation is really bad!” After reading the document, Kratos also felt troubled.

The gap was really not small, and the two Warlocks at the limit of the first circle in the Blood Alliance were not bad. If they were allowed to take the lead, White Tower might even be defeated.

“Sigh, that’s the current situation.” The first circle warlock also sighed.

“Alright, Herman, you and Rawls should be careful. Prioritize your own life.” Kratos didn’t try to avoid the question and said it directly.

“Alright,” they said.

“The battle in the secret realm should be in two or three days. You should go and rest first.” Kratos waved his hand and dismissed the meeting.

Meanwhile, Eli was brought to a separate tent.

In the tent, Eli pursed his lips. To the others, he was only a first-circle warlock.

However, he was already a second-circle intermediate Warlock with his fourth-circle Shadow Dragon bloodline. Although impolite, Eli felt that he could beat Kratos up.

He just didn’t know how the Blood Alliance’s first-circle warlocks would feel when they found out that their opponent was a second-circle warlock.

“It’s not my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame Kratos. I didn’t want to come at first.

“What an unfortunate Blood Alliance!”

In the tent, Eli mourned for the blood Alliance.

…

“Sigh, this is too unfair.”

At this moment, in the largest tent in the Blood Alliance, two warlocks sat in the main seats.

One of them had a dark expression and was emitting a cold aura. He was the person in charge of the Blood Alliance of ten thousand blood this time, Dick. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Opposite him was a man with golden hair. He also had vertical pupils, but the color of his pupils was tainted with a hint of gold. In addition, he was very tall, appearing very confident and domineering. He was also the one who had just spoken.

“Unfair? You mustn’t forget how White Tower stabbed us in the back. They must pay the price.” Dick said coldly, revealing his white teeth.

“Indeed!” Adams nodded, and his eyes were wandering around a blood-red curse mark on his right arm.

“Don’t worry. This seal can completely cover up the fact that you’ve broken through to the second circle. When the time comes, you’ll only need a specific seal to return to your true power, and there won’t be any damage to your body.” Said Dick as he looked into Adams’s eyes.

“Yes.”

“Although you’ve just broken through to the second circle, it’s enough to deal with the group of warlocks from the White Tower. Just kill them. If they all die here, it’ll be a big loss for them, but they don’t dare to do anything.” Dick laughed coldly.

Blood Alliance was the one who suggested exploring the secret realm together, but their goal was not to explore the secret realm.

They had been unhappy with the White Tower for a long time already, and today was the prologue.

“I know. It’s just a group of first-circle warlocks. I alone am enough.” Adams stretched his body. He was confident and relaxed.

“Unfortunate White Tower.”
