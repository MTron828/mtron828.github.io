Chapter 44: The Potion

The war had ended, but the effects of the war continued to ferment.

The first to be affected were the nobles of the Empire. Because of this incident, King Bryne the sixth began to set up a special organization to investigate a large number of nobles. Among these nobles, there were indeed a few problems, and some of them were spies from the surrounding countries.

As for the outcome of these nobles, it was needless to say that they all died quite miserably.

Of course, that was not all. He also began to clean up various aspects of the Empire. The economy, politics, and military were of the utmost importance. He made bold and decisive reforms and tough measures. For a time, people were in a state of panic.

Those who were affected privately claimed that the king must have gone crazy, but only Eli knew that this was probably the king’s final preparation for the Prince to inherit the throne.

Change required time, and it would probably take a few years for the nation to change.

Throughout this process, eli was barely affected. Instead, the people around him were greatly affected.

Due to the economic reform, Roland’s Chamber of Commerce actually rose up. The strength of the Chamber of Commerce began to expand, and the scope of business also began to expand, showing a sense of prosperity.

And because the king had taken back part of the iron mine, the power of Alina’s family had shrunk. Of course, there had to be some sort of exchange of benefits, but Eli didn’t know and wasn’t too sure about that.

Herman’s father seemed to be involved in this as well. He was imprisoned, and his eldest son inherited the title of nobility. His other sons divided up the family business and left Herman a house in the suburbs of Jun Lin.

The sudden accident made Herman lose all hope of inheriting the title, but it made Scholar Clement very happy because he thought Herman could focus on his studies.

But reality told scholar Clement that it was hard to change a person’s personality.

…

“Herman, you’ve made another mistake!!

“It’s a good thing the learner test was canceled. If you passed by accident, it would simply lower the overall standard of the learners. Can’t you be more serious? ”

The study room was filled with the angry voice of scholar Clement. Eli was helping to analyze the materials while Herman was standing on the side, berated by Clement.

But this time, Herman just stood there quietly with his head lowered.

“I’m sorry!”

A low, sobbing voice was heard. Clement was originally cursing happily, but he was stunned.

“…Did something happen?” Scholar Clement knew Herman’s personality. Something must have happened.

“I received news this morning that my father died in prison,” Herman said in pain, and his tears fell to the ground.

Scholar Clement also fell silent.

Eli looked over as well. No wonder Herman was in a daze today.

“Well, it’s fine. actually, the food you made today was not bad.” scholar clement was stunned for a few seconds before saying, “Eli, take him out to play. He needs a break!” he said to eli beside him.

“Okay!” Eli stood up and led Herman out.

“Eli, don’t you think I’m stupid? why can’t I do anything right!” Herman walked down the corridor and looked at eli with tears on his face.

“of course not. Scholar Clement scolded you because he thought you still had hope of improving. If he really ignored you, that would mean that you’re really useless.” Eli consoled.

Even though Herman was his senior, he was about the same age as Eli. They were both 20 years old this year.

“Maybe,” Herman shook his head. “my father is also dead, so I’ll be moving into that house in the future. I’ll have to work hard in the future.” Suddenly, Herman raised his head, wiped his tears, and smiled.

“This is good! It’s a rare day of leisure. How about this? I’ll bring you around to have some fun.”

“Sure, where are we going?” Herman grinned and replied.

“We’ll go to moon alley and Liuying alley to play.”

“I’ve never been there. Have you been there?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“How could I have been there? I’m doing everything for you. If not for you, I wouldn’t have gone to that kind of place.” Said Eli, shaking his head.

“Thank you.” Herman smiled.

Time always passed quickly during the entertainment.

The process was very pleasant, and it made him feel as if he was rising into the clouds. It was the happiest day of his life.

However, when he returned home, he had some doubts.

‘Why did all the ladies in Liuying alley seem to know eli?

‘Besides, wasn’t Eli way too familiar with the place? It was as if he had returned home.’

…

Herman recovered very well. The next day, he worked even harder and made fewer mistakes.

This made scholar clement overjoyed. The only thing that made him feel bad was that no one was there for him to scold recently, which made him feel a little sullen.

Of course, Herman had to take on this mission regardless, so scholar Clement raised his standards. The days resumed, and Herman was still the one being scolded.

Thus, the teachers and students returned to their peaceful lives.

Eli was also getting closer and closer to successfully brewing the potion.

He should be able to succeed within a year.

However, three months later.

He seemed to have encountered a small accident in the middle of the experiment.

…

Three months later!

“experiment 1111th, the materials are purple irises and ghost head mushrooms. The specific ratio is 6:1…”

In front of the experiment table, Eli seriously took down the experimental data, then picked up the potion that had already been concocted.

He walked towards the corner of the laboratory. A huge transparent box was placed there. At this moment, many white mice were jumping around in it. They looked very active.

A live experiment!

He casually took out a white mouse.

Eli moved him to another box, then had it consume a few milliliters of the prepared solution.

The mice drank the liquid and walked over a dozen meters. There was no change at all. On the other hand, Eli waited patiently. He knew that it would take some time for the potion to take effect.

Another minute passed.

The mice finally changed.

His fur began to dry up quickly, but his body didn’t seem to be getting thinner. His nails fell off bit by bit, and his teeth loosened. He seemed to be dying.

But to Eli’s surprise, the black eyes of the mice were getting brighter and brighter, like a ray of light. This was a sign of an increase in mental power.

“I failed!” Eli shook his head.

Without a doubt, he had failed again.

He took out the mouse and threw it aside. There were already a few dead ones there, and he would clean them up after the experiment.

“This won’t do. The potion sacrifices one’s vitality to increase one’s spiritual power.” eli shook his head and prepared for the next experiment.

“Wait a minute…”

Suddenly, in the laboratory, Eli’s movements froze.

The experiment failed, but it didn’t seem to be a complete failure.
