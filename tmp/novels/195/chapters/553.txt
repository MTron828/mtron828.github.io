554 The Book of Amir

The nine attacks came out almost at the same time, and each aura seemed to be faintly above the previous attacks.

“How is that possible?”

At this moment, the Warlocks, who were coming from all directions, widened their eyes at the same time, and fear surged in their hearts.

Not far away, Saks and the others, who had yet to make a move, also felt their hearts skip a beat.

Nine?

How was this possible?

But in the next second, Eli waved his staff gently.

“No!”

The people around them shouted in their hearts, but nine rays of light burst out at the same time.

In the next second, the devouring of shadows, the ruthlessness of time, the extreme coldness of the wind element, and the endless light of the power of faith erupted together and enveloped the surrounding Warlocks.

Weng!

The shadow swept past, and the Warlocks wailed as they were devoured. As time passed, the few remaining life force of the Warlocks slowly drained away. As the faith spear swept past, the Warlocks were instantly pierced through. Under the storm, many Warlocks were torn into pieces.

Those Warlocks were easily penetrated like thin paper. The aftershocks of a few attacks flew toward Saks and the others. Even he had to enter a defensive state, and so did the others.

Amidst the violent power, everyone swayed left and right like a small boat on a stormy sea. However, they were all extremely shocked.

Now that they had come into contact with it, they finally felt how much law power was contained in these attacks.

Every attack was an attack that was almost at the limit of thousand flowers.

“Just how strong is he?” Saks felt the storm around him and asked a fatal question.

Didn’t Eli just enter the Thousand Flower Realm?

However, at this moment, he felt that Eli’s strength was definitely above his.

And far beyond!

Was he actually hiding his strength? The Lich Tower had deceived them!

Saks felt a burst of anger, but he understood that this was not the time to think about this. It was about how much they could still hold on.

And this lasted for a full three minutes.

Other than the shadows, there were countless blood mists and corpses in the space before him. The first wave of Warlocks who had participated in the siege had been completely annihilated, and the ones around him…

He turned around and saw that there were only 17 people left. Other than him, every one of them was at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm, but they were all heavily injured.

At this moment, the few of them looked at each other with fear in their eyes.

With one attack, dozens of fifth-circle warlocks died.

This was too exaggerated!

Was the difference of one level so exaggerated?

Moreover, how could Eli suddenly unleash nine attacks that almost exceeded his limit?

“Eli, how did you do it?” Saks raised his head and looked at Eli in the distance, asking bitterly.

Eli was still in the same spot, his gaze calm as if he had expected this.

The truth was that he had used all his strength to condense each of these nine attacks. He had spent almost ten years and then stored them in his wizard book.

As for the Sorcerer Book, it was the spoils of war from the past. It was a peak fifth-circle mage Tool, the Sorcerer Book of Amir. Its function was to store nine fifth-circle attacks. This was the first time he used it, and the effect was gratifying.

Didn’t he kill almost all the enemies in one go? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, after this attack, this book might not be able to be used for a hundred years. The consumption was too great.

As for Saks’s question, Eli naturally could not answer. He only looked at the remaining people and revealed a kind smile. He slowly waved the wizard staff in his hand.

Everyone’s eyes gradually widened.

Battle!

Countless elements exploded once again. In the Blood Spirit Body experience, Eli once again felt the power of a wizard, which was rare. Moreover, most of his luxurious wizard equipment had reached the fifth ring, and some were even sixth circle.

Even in the Warlock World, a fifth-circle warlock who owned one or two fifth-circle mage tools could be considered rich. However, compared to Eli, that was nothing.

The combat power of a mage Tool was quite terrifying, not to mention the Blood Spirit Body.

At this moment, even if a Mage came, he was not afraid at all.

As time passed, Thousand Leaves died one by one. Saks looked at the warlocks around him who were constantly being lost, and the fear in his eyes gradually increased. He looked at Eli with extreme fear.

Finally, when there were only seven of them left, Saks shouted, “Eli, I surrender. Please let me go. I promise I will never enter the Warlock World again!”

Seeing Saks begging for mercy, the others also started to beg for mercy.

“You’re magnanimous. Let us go.”

“We have been deceived by the Lich Tower!”

The group of people began to beg for mercy without any dignity. They had completely lost their initial high spirits.

On the contrary, they only feared death.

“I’m sorry, all of you will die here today. I need you!” However, Eli would not agree to it either. He could only feel that the Warlocks that he had just devoured were helping him understand the law, and he felt a little dizzy.

He wanted to use these people to break through to a higher level in one fell swoop!

Seeing that Eli had refused and was even attacking again, Saks’ entire body began to tremble, but he still cursed, “Eli, I’m telling you, I’m going to die with you today.”

Eli glanced at him with a hint of mockery in his eyes!

“Alright, let me see it!”

..

A few minutes later.

Saks kneeled on the ground and kowtowed.

At this moment, the rest of the Warlocks were already dead, and he was the only one left.

“Lord, spare my life, spare my life. I beg you, spare me.” He wailed, his head constantly rising and falling, his body trembling like a sieve.

Who would have thought that this was a hero warlock who had once caused a revolution in the mainland?

However, as time passed, he had lost all his ambition.

“This is the cruelty of time!” Eli sighed deeply.

Time could change everything.

However, he did not pity him. In the next second, he waved the staff in his hand.

Bang!

His head exploded, and his brain matter exploded like tofu pudding.

His body slowly fell down, and a shadow appeared on the ground and swallowed him.

“It feels good!”

At the moment of devouring, Eli sensed the power of laws from Saks. On the tree of laws, yellow flowers slowly began to condense.

Not only that, there were dozens of Flowers of Laws forming on the Tree of Law every second.

And all of this was thanks to these warlocks who had come to die.

” Thank you for the gift from the Lich Tower!”

Eli looked at the empty shadow space around him. His bloodline power and law Force gradually quieted down, and the Blood Spirit avatar slowly dissipated, revealing its true form.

He looked around again to make sure that he had not missed anything.

Stretching his body, the shadows around him gradually began to dissipate.

It was over!
