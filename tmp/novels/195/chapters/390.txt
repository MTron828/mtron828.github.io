391 Rising Bloodline Tower

On the other side.

After Ian left, he sent a message to Goldsilver City in the middle of the western region of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association.

The person overseeing this place was Jin Ji’s trusted aide, Conilla. He had just returned not long ago.

“Trade with a four-circle demonic plant? ” Conilla looked at the news in front of him and fell into deep thought.

!!

He looked at the list. Most of what Eli needed were low-level resources. There were many types, but it wasn’t difficult for the Golden Cicada Trade Union to find. However, the union would definitely make a lot of profit with the high-level magic plants. Conilla couldn’t understand Eli’s thoughts.

As for the potion formula, he didn’t hesitate much. They had collected quite a lot of it, but no one could use them.

It was only because their levels were high that they would collect them. However, to be honest, it did not mean much to Warlocks.

If Eli could produce the potions, it might be a good thing for them.

No matter what, magic potions were better than directly eating magic plants.

That’s right, most Warlocks were currently eating raw plants. The main reason was that there were very few Warlocks who could concoct potions, and most of them were of very low grades. Even so, the price was still high.

He felt that perhaps Eli could give them a surprise.

“Agreed.” Without hesitation, Conilla pressed a seal on it.

The document with the seal was quickly sent out.

“Lord Jin Ji said that he would follow the president and study for thirty years. The Western Regions will depend on me to manage.” Conilla stretched his body and stood up.

Just two days ago, Jin Ji sent a letter back. “I’ll leave you to manage everything for thirty years.”

“Thirty years is very fast.” Conilla pondered, but for some reason, he had a strange feeling.

The next time he came back, perhaps the one who would be shocked would not be him but Lord Jin Ji.

This strange feeling came from the prediction of his bloodline, and the golden cicada had a special reaction to money.

And the source of that strange feeling was Eli, the person that even the adults valued for some reason.

“Strange!”

Even Conilla couldn’t see Eli clearly.

“I’ll leave it to time.”

Conilla shook his head and went back to work.

A week later. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The resources of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce arrived.

Other than the resources from the dozens of large spatial rings, there were also the formulas and magic plants that Eli was most concerned about.

There were dozens of fourth-circle potion formulas, and several of them could increase Eli’s strength.

After choosing, Eli took out a potion that happened to be in the Dark Sun stage, the Dark Sun Potion.

The magic plants required for this formula were not very difficult to find, but several of the main ingredients needed to be above the fourth circle. It could be said to be the most difficult one among these potions. However, this was very simple for Eli. With Hill’s help, Eli could gather enough once every half a year. The time cost for Eli was really not high, except that it was a little life-threatening.

And in the ring, there were also other magical plants, but they were all only in the first circle.

Eli did not mind and planted them in the magic medicine field outside the tower. At the same time, he called Glen.

Glen also arrived very quickly.

“Sir, do you have any orders?” Glen asked curiously.

“I have a plan that requires your cooperation,” Eli said to Glen.

My cooperation?” Glen was somewhat confused.

“I’m going to carry out a round of comprehensive modifications to the Bloodline Tower, which requires your participation. ” Eli replied with a smile.

Although Glen was a little confused, he still said bitterly,” If you have any ideas, then go ahead. I might not be able to help you for that many years. ”

Glen had lost too much of his life force in the battle with Vya, and his lifespan was running out.

Listening to Glen’s words, Eli also remembered this. He then took out a potion bottle from his pocket. Inside was a green Life Source.

” This is the source of life. It can make up for the injury that caused you to lose your life force. So, make plans to continue working for me for the next hundred years. ” Eli smiled and handed the potion bottle to Glen.

Glen looked at the potion bottle that suddenly appeared in his hand, as well as the liquid that emitted a dense life force and was stunned.

A few seconds later, he said shakily, “Sir, this is too precious. I can’t take it!”

He was going to return the potion bottle to Eli. Ever since he was injured, he had never stopped looking for a way to save himself, but he had found nothing. That was why he knew that the Source of Life was precious. Its value was too high.

” Keep it. At least no one is more suitable for the position of Bloodline Tower Master than you in a short period of time. ”

Eli smiled and returned to the wizard tower. At this time, he had also finished planting the magic plants.

Just like that, Glen stared blankly as Eli left.

A few seconds later, tears streamed down his face.

“My lord!” Glen’s fingers gripped the potion bottle tightly, and he was completely convinced by Ely.

Previously, it was more or less because of Eli’s strength, but now, it was all because of his admiration for Eli.

He turned around and left the Grassi Land.

No matter what Eli wanted to do, he would be his firm backing.

After he left, he saw Alida again. The two of them hugged each other and cried, once again thanking Eli.

…

...

A month later.

Three new departments were established in the Bloodline Tower.

There was a Potion Department, a Machinery Alchemy Department, and a mysterious support department.

The Potions Department was responsible for the production of potions, the Machinery Alchemy Department was responsible for the production of spell formations, runes, and mechanical products, and the Mysterious Support Department was responsible for collecting everything related to mages and modifying their items to adapt to the Warlock World.

On the day of the announcement of the establishment of the three departments, all the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower were in an uproar.

Most of them were very puzzled because there were not many forces that still had such a strange department. The most important problem was that to establish such a department, one had to find someone who understood mage knowledge. And now, in the Warlock World, people who understood this were even rarer than the human-faced butterfly, a creature that was almost extinct.

Meanwhile, the people from the other forces who had gathered in the Bloodline Tower also quickly relayed the news to their own forces, and all of them burst into laughter.

No one thought that the Bloodline Tower would succeed.

What happened next made everyone’s eyes widen. The Bloodline Tower put an undead in charge of the potion department and a mechanical dog in charge of the mechanical alchemy department.

Everyone was dumbfounded and prepared to watch the fun.

However, when the Potions Department produced the first potion suitable for Apprentice Warlocks and the Machinery Alchemy Department produced the first mass-produced small-scale mage Tool, everyone fell silent.

...

The undead knew magic potions, but the mechanical dog really knew mechanical alchemy.

Besides the Bloodline Tower’s own use, the items produced were also traded with the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce.

For a time, the Bloodline Tower earned a lot of money.

On this day, the surrounding forces realized a problem.

The rise of the Bloodline Tower was unstoppable.
