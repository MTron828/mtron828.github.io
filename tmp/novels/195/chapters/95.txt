96 Returning to Jun Lin

He had returned to Junlin once again.

Eli didn’t make a big fuss but returned in secret.

The carriage arrived at the city wall that had a hint of history to it. The soldiers guarding it were no longer the ones he was familiar with. After a simple look at his identity, Eli was allowed to enter.

After passing through a few streets, Eli returned to his door.

The vines that had once been on the fence were now crawling all over the fence. They were green and lush. Seeing that it was Eli, they made a rustling sound and reached out their vines, trying to get close to him.

Eli smiled.

He didn’t take the plant with him. He didn’t expect it to still be alive.

He could also faintly feel that the plants were actually emitting magic.

It had actually reached the level of a lower-level zero circle.

“Not bad!” Eli smiled. This little fellow was actually beginning to have some consciousness.

He pushed open the door. There were no plants in the courtyard. What a joke. With such a plant, how could there be weeds? However, he seemed to see many corpses deep in the soil. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Needless to say, they must have wanted to break in and be killed by the vines instead.

It was such a pity.

As he continued forward, the door was covered in a layer of dust. When he opened it, a cloud of dust was raised, but it could not get close to Eli at all. As for the inside of the house, it was the same. With a wave of his hand, the dust was swept away by the wind.

“Nothing has changed!” Eli nodded.

Before he left, he had bought the house. The laboratory and other places were also cleaned up very well, and it seemed that no one had broken in.

“Let’s go and see our old friends!” After putting the items away, Eli felt like going to see how many of his friends were still alive.

He was already 66 years old. In this Empire where the average age of the commoners was less than 60 and the average age of the nobles was less than 80, he could be considered slightly older.

He hoped that his friends were still alive.

The next day, Eli visited everyone.

He didn’t expect that everyone was still alive. It seemed that Roland was the only one who hadn’t been in good health recently, but with the help of Eli’s potion, he had recovered.

Rias and Hila were just as beautiful as before, and while the beauty potions that Eli had concocted for the two of them could not prevent their lifespans from decreasing, they could still keep their appearances almost the same.

The few of them reminisced about the past.

Other than Rias and Hila, some of the others even had grandchildren, which was ridiculous.

In fact, Hila had never gotten married. Rias and Eli tried to change her mind, but once they got closer, they never mentioned it again.

In the castle.

“Long time no see!” Rias did not hold back in expressing her longing.

Eli gave her a hug.

According to his initial thoughts, he probably didn’t have any plans to have too much contact with women, but as time passed, Eli realized that it was quite impossible.

He was still a human.

He now preferred to let nature take its course. Ensuring his own safety was the first priority, but there was no need to suppress himself.

After Hila and Eli met, they looked at each other. It was just a simple hug, and everything was said without a word.

Alex had already relinquished his title of Marquis, and his son had inherited it.

It was the same for Roland. His body no longer allowed him to work, and his son had inherited the Chamber of Commerce.

Finally, Eli looked around and found that the only one who had died was Aria Kazan. He had died of an illness five years ago, leaving behind a son.

Of course, his son had also inherited the soul imprint and continued to work for Eli. Even until his death, Aria Kazan still hoped that his son would be able to survive until Eli’s death.

Poor Aria…

After visiting his old friend, Eli then walked around the entire Junlin.

Many places had changed greatly. For example, the place which used to be a big villa was now a theater. A shop was replaced by a stable, and so on. There were too many changes.

As he passed by the library, he glanced at it.

The library seemed to have been redecorated. It looked luxurious from the outside, and the guards were replaced by the private soldiers of the nobles.

Eli originally wanted to go in and take a look, but when he found out that the price of entering this place now was one silver Tarl, which used to be five copper tarls, he smiled and turned to leave.

The library was no longer the same as before.

After losing seviro Mesa and Clement, this place was meaningless to Eli. He had no intention of returning.

Perhaps it was because he was too familiar with it.

As Eli walked, he came to Liuying alley and moon alley.

This might be the only place that was more prosperous than before. The failure of the upper level made many people vent their frustration here. Eli simply strolled around and left.

Time had changed this place, and it had also changed him.

After half a day, Eli finally understood the various changes in Jun Lin clearly.

But he didn’t leave.

Instead, he walked towards the palace.

It was time to harvest the seeds that had been planted.

…

At this moment, in the palace.

Anna sat on the chair, frowning.

At the age of 23, she was slim and elegant. Her long black hair fell down, her blue eyes were like the ocean, and her skin was as white as milk.

At this moment, she was wearing a white dress. With her beautiful face, she was as beautiful as an angel.

This was the first princess of the bryne Empire, known as the Empire’s rare beauty that only appeared once every hundred years.

However, at this time, the beauty frowned and then sighed deeply.

“Your Highness.” Seeing the princess so depressed, the maid couldn’t help but ask, “Your Highness, is His Majesty really planning to let the second Prince inherit the throne? This is not in line with tradition. Princess, you’re also very outstanding.”

“Father does have this plan.” Anna shook her head and clenched the handle on the side tightly as if she was going to break it. As an Elite Knight, she had the power to do so.

Not only did Bryne the seventh have a poor political achievements, but he was also a misogynist.

It was fine when Anna was the only child, but with the birth of the second and third Prince, everything changed. Bryne the seventh put more energy into his two sons and gave Anna less attention.

At this time, Bryne the seventh actually wanted to directly give away the throne that should have been Anna’s to his son.

Anna was furious.

However, Bryne the seventh had already abdicated, but before Bryne the eighth inherited the throne, he was still the ruler of the Empire.

Anna lowered her head, unwilling to accept this.

Suddenly, someone came in from outside.

Your Highness, there’s a request for a meeting by the name of Eli.

Anna suddenly raised her head, and her eyes lit up.
