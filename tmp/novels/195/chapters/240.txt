“Thank you so much!”

In the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, Jin Huan held udo’s hand and thanked him.

“It doesn’t matter. After all, we’re also getting paid!” Udo nodded, but his eyes kept looking at Eli.

On the way back, Eli told the two of them to pretend that nothing had happened, and the duo who was saved naturally agreed quickly.

“Indeed, it’s easier than we thought,” Simona said awkwardly. If it wasn’t for Eli’s help, they might have been dead already.

“hahaha, but I still have to thank everyone. I’ll send the rewards to the two Lords, Udo and Simona, later. As for Lord Herman, you’ll have to wait a few days!” Jin Huan said to the two of them, then turned to face Eli.

“En, as long as you send it to me when the time comes!” Said Eli.

Since he had resolved the matter, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce would not breach the contract.

“Naturally!” Jin Huan was all smiles, but when he saw Udo looking at Eli from time to time, his thoughts changed. It seemed like something had happened on this journey that he did not know about!

“Then I’ll take my leave first.”

Having achieved his goal, Eli bid farewell immediately!

“Then I’ll be leaving too.” Simona glanced at Eli’s back and quickly left as well.

“Then I’ll take my leave too, store manager.” Udo also said to Jin Huan.

“Hey, Lord Udo, please wait a moment. I have something to ask you!” Suddenly, Jin Huan called out to Udo.

Udo was speechless.

“It’s like this, since you guys are fighting alongside Herman, can you sell me a copy of his information? We still don’t know anything about this person!” Jin Huan smiled. The information business was also part of their business.

“I’m sorry!”

“Five thousand!” Golden hoop said directly. In his opinion, this price was not low. After all, it was just the most basic information.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you anything about him!” Udo only glanced at him and left.

“What?”

Seeing how Udo did not hesitate at all, Jin Huan was stunned. Udo had worked with them many times, this was not how he would act!

It seemed that Herman was really not an ordinary person. He had to investigate.

“If I were you, I wouldn’t be thinking of checking him out. As an old friend, I suggest you don’t play any tricks!” Suddenly, Udo, who had just reached the door, turned to him with a serious expression.

Jin Huan was stunned!

This was because he had never seen such a serious expression on Udo’s face.

..

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.

Five days later.

Eli was in the hotel in the bloodline tower, receiving the potion formula from Jin Huan.

Eli felt the knowledge in the crystal ball that had just been delivered and then smiled.

The potion was called the kotez potion, a 3rd circle potion. It was used to help warlocks break through the early to middle stages of the 3rd circle. Other than this, there were other 3rd circle potions, and Jin Huan had given them all to him.

“He’s quite sensible!” Eli smiled, then walked out of the room and headed downstairs.

Just as he reached the door, he suddenly saw Vivika leaving with a group of people, followed by a few late-stage second-circle warlocks, as if they were going somewhere.

“Is the silver Moon conference about to start?”

Eli narrowed his eyes. Just yesterday, with the arrival of the last force, the helwall, all the forces in the central region of the West Coast had arrived. The basic conditions for the meeting were already prepared!

He had thought that it would take a few days to prepare, but it actually started today!

Were they in such a hurry?

Eli felt a little strange.

However, he didn’t think too much about it. After watching them leave, he left the place as well. He was about to go to a random store to buy something, but he thought of Jin ji last time. After some thought, he walked towards the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce.

Very quickly, he arrived at this place!

“Hey, my Lord!”

As soon as he entered, it was the same young man from the last time, Jin Ji, who came over.

“My Lord, long time no see. What do you need today?” Jin Ji said enthusiastically. The cicada bloodline had already arrived today, and he could receive it after work. All of this was thanks to this Lord.

“I need some potions!”

Eli thought about the recipe.

“yes, we have all of these, but some of them are not here. My Lord, you know that this is only a temporary place, and it will take about ten days for us to get them from the headquarters!” Jin Ji said.

“Sure!” Eli nodded. However, ten days would probably be the end of the meeting.

“Then what else does Milord need?” Jin Ji asked again.

“No more!” Eli shook his head.

This was his goal this time. He didn’t need anything else.

“Alright then, my Lord. This time, you want 10 sets of materials. The price should be 13000 magic stones. My Lord, you can pay 10000 magic stones!” Jin Ji calculated.

Unlike potion formulas, potions were much more expensive.

“Sure!”

Eli nodded, paid the money, and left.

...

However, when he left, he saw more and more black lines on Jin Ji’s fate, and there was even a trace of blood, which meant that he was in a life-and-death crisis.

Eli was stunned before he left.

It was time!

..

It was nighttime!

Jin Ji, who had finished his day’s work, was very excited. He had received the item he had ordered in advance from the steward.

“you have to take good care of this Golden cicada bloodline. I didn’t think you’ll get it so soon. Even though there’s only half of it here.”

The manager looked at Jin Ji and handed him a tube of golden blood.

“Hehe, I only managed to gather enough today because a Lord spent 10000 magic crystals!” Jin Ji looked at the Golden blood and his throat moved.

The Golden cicada bloodline!

The Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s most common and most powerful bloodline was a two-circle bloodline. However, it was said that it had a special ability, which was that the more wealth the golden cicada warlock had, the more powerful he would be. It was a strange bloodline. It was even said that the highest-ranking bloodline warlock in the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce was a five-circle warlock, and that was the first President of the Chamber of Commerce!

...

“If you successfully advance, you’ll have the opportunity to officially enter the Chamber of Commerce system. At that time, your future will be limitless!” The manager said with a smile.

Jin Ji came here from the central continent for some unknown reason, but this young man was hardworking, capable, and tenacious. He was indeed a good seedling.

“Yes, yes!”

Jin Ji couldn’t wait any longer and took the potion.

“Then you can leave first. I wish you all the best!” The manager smiled and sent Jin Ji off.

“Yes, yes!”

Just like that, Jin Ji was sent out of the house, his hand tightly holding the bloodline.

After leaving the Chamber of Commerce, Jin Ji quickly returned to his residence. After a while, he came to an alley, which was the only way back.

“once I become a first circle Warlock, everything will be different. One day, I’ll return to the central continent and change everything!” Jin Ji gritted his teeth with a determined expression. “Something’s wrong!”

After walking into the alley, he had only taken a few steps when he suddenly felt that something was wrong.

In the past, this place was filled with all sorts of rustling sounds, but today, there was no sound at all.

“There’s a problem!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He immediately realized that something was wrong and immediately turned to leave. However, a figure had already blocked the end of the alley. It was a tall man with a fierce-looking face, and he exuded the aura of a peak acolyte.

Seeing this, he immediately ran in the other direction.

However, two figures appeared on the other side. One was a skinny ultimate apprentice, and the other was a young man that he recognized.

The young man slowly walked out and looked at Jin Ji with a cold smile.

“Did you get the bloodline?”

“How about you give it to me?”
