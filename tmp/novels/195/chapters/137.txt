138 An Explosive Upgrade

A year passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli usually stayed in the castle and rarely went out.

As for Ross, Eli had a clear understanding of him now. It turned out that Ross was born two years before Rock was killed. Rock had sex with an apprentice, and Ross was sent back from the academy after he was born.

When Ross was first sent back, he was naturally very welcomed. After all, his father was already a first-circle Warlock and was about to advance to the second circle.

However, with Rock’s death, the situation suddenly changed. Ross’s status plummeted, and because Rock had offended too many people, Rock’s direct family was greatly affected. Ross was also discriminated against in the family.

The funny thing was that the world was really unpredictable. Last year, the royal family had tested the talent of every child in the family, and Ross was valued again. The results showed that he was extremely talented, even more so than Rock.

That was why Ross’s current status was not bad.

During the day, he would go to his grandfather, who was an official Warlock, to learn knowledge. He would only return to the castle at night. What Eli had to do was to ensure his safety during this time.

Of course, this task was not just limited to Eli alone. There were two other apprentices in this Castle who shared this task, so Eli was usually quite relaxed.

On the other hand, Eli finally received news from Tijie.

“Master, it’s been a month since we last gathered information. This time, we have a very deep understanding of this place. I estimate that we will definitely take action within a year!”

It was a message from Tijie.

As Eli’s eyes and ears, she kept sending him messages.

For a full year, she had reported information to him twice a month on average. This allowed him to learn a lot of information, such as where some of the resources in the camp were placed and how some of them were allocated. Of course, there were also some interesting things, such as battalion commander Kratos’ preference for fox girls, and Evena had been scolding Eli every day recently. It was only after he left that she realized that she had a lot more work to do.

All in all, this made Eli look at the camp from a different perspective, and it was very interesting.

However, it seemed that a battle was about to break out. He just didn’t know what would happen.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in.”

A small head suddenly popped out from the crack of the door. Its black eyes were spinning, and when it saw Eli, the eyes lit up.

Ross ran in with a smile and said, “Grandpa Herman, can I ask you a question about potioneering?”

Children were always full of innocence and spontaneity. Ever since he discovered that Eli’s potion was very powerful, he would often come to ask some questions. On the one hand, Eli was on a mission, and on the other hand, he had no reason to refuse a six or seven-year-old child, so he would often answer.

“Of course, you can.” Eli nodded.

“Thank you, Grandpa. I want to know why the Chris runes grass can’t be extracted.” His small head was filled with questions.

“That’s because the extraordinary characteristics of this flower, to a certain extent, are not the plant itself but the special material on the surface of its body.” He answered the question easily.

“I see. Thank you, Grandpa!” Ross nodded, not fully understanding, and then ran out.

“Ah, what an innocent child!” Looking at his back, Eli smiled, but he was a little suspicious. This question didn’t seem to be something Ross should be asking at this stage…

“I see!”

On the other side, an old man heard Ross’ answer and came to a sudden realization.

He looked very old, and his skin seemed to be stuck to his bones, but he exuded a strong bloodline power. He was the one-circle Shadow Bone lizard Warlock of the Corona family, Eiffel.

He had only recently found out that Herman was the Vice President of the potions Department. Coincidentally, he had been studying potions recently, so he had a lot of questions.

However, it would be too embarrassing to ask him directly, so he could only do this through his grandson.

“Grandpa, why don’t you ask him yourself?” At this time, Ross’ tender voice sounded.

“Don’t ask too much, kid. Don’t tell your mother about this.” Eiffel coughed twice. He couldn’t say that he was too embarrassed.

However, he couldn’t be blamed. It was mainly because Eli was too strong as a pharmacologist. He even felt that the second-circle pharmacologist he had seen in the Academy was far inferior to Eli, which surprised him.

“Alright, I’ll go look for my mother.” Ross chuckled, turned around, and ran out of the palace.

Although he had been given the cold shoulder, how could a child understand what had happened?

…

And Eli didn’t care much.

To him, this was just a long paid vacation.

On the other hand, as time passed, Eli gradually found out who was working against the warlock camp.

It was another Warlock force, the blood Alliance.

It was a force composed of more than a dozen bloodline Warlock clans, and its overall size was much larger than the shadow lizard warlock Academy. This time, it was the Frostwolf clan that was making a move.

“What is this? A test for the shadow lizard?” Eli frowned.

Eli didn’t know much about the Blood Alliance, and he wasn’t too clear about their goal.

But that wasn’t important as long as Eli didn’t get involved. As for the truth of the matter, he didn’t know for now, but it shouldn’t be a secret anymore in ten or twenty years.

Now, it all depended on when it would explode.

…

A year later.

The attack erupted.

The sudden attack stunned the entire camp.

The shadow lizard Warlock Academy’s subordinate camp was suddenly attacked by a large wave of unknown warlocks, and the entire camp suddenly fell into chaos.

In the camp.

Kratos was dumbfounded. Standing on the highest tower in the camp, he could feel the enemies that suddenly appeared around the camp. They were of great numbers and of high quality.

And they seemed to have a purpose, attacking the weak areas of the camp.

“Damn it, a bunch of trash.” Looking at the destroyed campsite, the corners of Kratos ‘mouth twitched, and a large shadow appeared outside his body. He pounced on a first-circle sorcerer who had just entered not far away.

In just an instant, he had already arrived around the first circle sorcerer, and a shadow instantly drowned him.

Just as he was about to attack the other warlocks, two figures appeared not far away. They were both wearing gray wizard robes with hoods.

Two two-ring warlocks?

Kratos sensed the aura and was stunned.

“Kratos, we want to talk to you.” One of them took off his mask, revealing the silver-gray wolf mask underneath.

“I have nothing to talk about with you.” Kratos exploded with anger, and his eyes were bloodshot.

“What if it’s with your sister?”

Hearing the calm voice, Kratos’s face changed instantly.

“My sister?” Kratos was stunned. If there was one regret in his life, it would be his sister whom he once loved. Unfortunately, they were separated by accident, and he was the only one left.

“That’s impossible. I saw her fall into the whirlpool in the endless sea with my own eyes,” Kratos shook his head in disbelief.

The endless sea was the sea next to the West Coast. There were many extraordinary monsters and dangers everywhere. They had separated during an island exploration.

“She’s still alive, and we have evidence that we know where she is.” The man spoke again.

“Really?” Kratos suddenly became a little uncertain. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, we know that you were once a student of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy’s Dean. We would like to talk to you about this Academy.”

“Alright, I hope you guys aren’t lying to me.” Kratos frowned and said while gritting his teeth.

Thus, the three of them began to fight. However, the more they fought, the further they went and left the camp.

As for the camp, people were left to their own devices.

Suddenly, a loud bang came from somewhere in the camp. All the warlocks were stunned, but then there were more explosions. This caught them a little unprepared, and the situation became even more chaotic.

The killing continued, and countless warlocks died in this battle.

…

On the other side, Eli also sighed after receiving the news.

Fortunately, he had left the camp. Otherwise, it would have been quite troublesome if he had really gotten involved in the chaotic battle.

According to Tijie, a lot of apprentices died. Even five or six first-circle warlocks had died.

It was too dangerous.

The surprise attack only lasted for four hours.

Four hours later, Kratos returned and led the people in the camp to organize a counterattack. They quickly ended the riot and foiled the conspiracy of the unknown forces.

As for what happened in the few hours when Kratos disappeared, no one knew.

However, although the raid had ended, the pursuit of the escapees and the management of the camp had become major problems. Therefore, the camp was even more chaotic than during the raid.

However, under Kratos’ leadership, everything was getting better.

…

There were many things to be done in the camp, but Eli did not return to the camp.

The main thing was that he was still in the middle of a mission, so this was more or less inappropriate. Moreover, he wanted to wait until everything was stable before going back.

The attack on the camp was much bigger than what Eli had imagined, and the shadow warlock Academy was immediately enraged. After all, this was a direct taunt, and no force could tolerate it.

As such, they sent out a large number of warlocks to investigate the matter, and even Effiel of the Corina family was transferred away to participate in the investigation. No one knew how many people would be in trouble.

However, Kratos, one of the central figures in this matter, wasn’t affected much.

This made Eli very curious about this guy’s background. Such a big thing had happened, yet he was completely fine.

Just as Eli thought that everything would end smoothly …

It was the fifth day of the shadow lizard Warlock Academy’s investigation.

At night.

In the palace, Eli suddenly opened his eyes.

“Someone’s coming.” Eli frowned. The dozens of eyes he had set up in advance told him that a mysterious force had entered the palace, and there were quite a number of people.

The target was the palace.
