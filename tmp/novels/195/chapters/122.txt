123 Rock

He would head to the transcendent world.

The power of shadow appeared outside of his body. Her figure flickered, but every time he appeared, he would be dozens of meters away. There were shadows everywhere. She appeared as if she was jumping in the shadows, heading east.

This was shadow leap, a movement skill that Eli had developed based on the shadow Dragon’s abilities. It was very fast, but it had to be used in a shadowy place, and it was best to use it at night.

Speaking of bloodlines …

The integration of the shadow Dragon bloodline not only made Eli’s physical body outrageous, but it also allowed him to gain initial control over shadows, concealment, and transformation. It was just as Nick had said. It was a bloodline that was very suitable for Eli.

When the time came, with the shadow Dragon’s ability to imitate, the mask, and the mage’s abilities, it would be impossible for even a celestial sorcerer to see through him.

“sigh, I might really not come back after leaving.”

In the evening, Eli took one last look at Jun Lin, then turned and left without looking back.

There was nothing left for him to miss there.

…

Half a year later.

After a long and arduous journey, Eli finally arrived at the kingdom of Corina.

This was a place with one side by the sea and the other side by another mountain range. It was about 20 or so countries away from the Bryne Empire. Of course, they were all small countries, but it was still very far.

“The zither Moon Mountain range.”

Eli remembered Vivika’s words very clearly.

After asking around for the zither Moon Mountain range’s location, Eli continued on his way. However, he was no longer in a hurry. Eli changed his face and concealed his weapon. His aura gradually dropped to that of a level 3 acolyte, and then he leisurely walked onto the main road.

This was the main road to the zither Moon Mountain range.

It should still be 50 to 60 kilometers away from there.

“What is the Mage world, no, the Warlock world like?” Eli was really curious.

Other than his three apprentices, he had not seen any other mages or warlocks.

…

“Are you also going to the zither Moon Mountain’s Warlock’s camp?”

Eli was walking on the main road when he suddenly heard other sounds.

Eli turned his head and saw a carriage coming towards him. The carriage was very gorgeous, and there were many guards around the carriage, with people in front and behind.

However, it was not the guards who called out to him but the person in the carriage.

A man by the window extended his hand and greeted him.

“Level 3 acolyte!”

Eli was stunned. The man looked to be in his twenties, and he had a smile on his face. However, judging from his aura, he was actually a level 3 acolyte.

How could things be so ridiculous?

A level 3 apprentice at the age of twenty. When Eli was twenty, he was only a level 1 acolyte.

“Yes, I am!” Eli didn’t deny it either. From what the man said, he should be heading there too. If possible, Eli might be able to get more information about the camp from him. At least, he wouldn’t be too caught off guard when the time came.

Besides, this was only a level 3 apprentice with a few Knights and Grand Knights as guards. If he were exposed, he could just kill them all. However, that should not happen.

“Oh, you’re going to the camp too!” The man’s eyes lit up when he heard what Eli said, and he immediately got off the carriage. “I’m going there too. Let’s go together.” The man was wearing a simple mage robe.

“Alright,” Eli nodded. The man in front of him was too enthusiastic.

It wasn’t dangerous anyway.

Just like that, Eli followed the man into the carriage.

“Hello, I’m Rock, the third Prince of the kingdom of Corina.” The man was very enthusiastic as soon as they got on the carriage.

“Hello, I’m… Herman.” After hesitating for a moment, Eli changed his name.

“I saw that you’re a level 3 apprentice, so I pulled you along. Looking at you, you should be going to the moon zither Warlock’s camp for the gathering, right?” Rock asked with a smile.

“Gathering?” Eli asked.

“Aren’t you going to join the shadow lizard Warlock Academy?” Rock was also surprised when he heard the question.

He looked at the level 3 acolyte in front of him. He seemed to be around 30 years old. He might not be very talented, but he should be on the same path as him.

“No.” Eli shook his head.

“Oh, I see.” The man seemed to be very disappointed to hear this, and his enthusiasm reduced a lot. However, it was only a few seconds before he asked again, “Then, brother Herman, are you going to live in the camp, find someone, or buy something?”

“uh, I came from another kingdom and had been learning from my teacher. My teacher didn’t tell me anything. Some time ago, my teacher died, so I left that place. I heard that there was a Warlock’s camp near the zither Moon Mountain Plains, so I wanted to take a look,” Eli said.

He was not lying when he said that. Saleen was indeed his teacher to a certain extent. He had been following his notes and learning. After being trapped for five to six hundred years, he had come out to take a look.

“I see!” Rock nodded.

“I don’t quite understand what you’re saying. Can you explain it to me?” Eli asked with a studious look as if he was an apprentice who had never seen the world.

“Alright,” he said. Rock looked at Eli’s appearance and couldn’t help but feel pity for him, saying, “Do you want to hear about the camp or something else?”

“Everything. Is that okay?”

“Of course.”

Rock nodded and said, ” “How about this? I’ll tell you about the zither moon camp first. This should be a medium-sized camp among the nearby Warlock forces. It’s a camp within the shadow lizard Warlock Academy’s territory.”

Shadow lizard warlocks!

Eli clearly remembered that it was the faction that Saleen metatrin had provoked back then. He did not expect it to be here. Perhaps there was a wizard faction here as well.

“Yes, so you’re going this time because…” Eli asked.

“of course, I’m going to join the shadow lizard Warlock camp. The upper limit of the shadow lizard is the second circle. In the entire East Coast, it’s considered an upper-middle Warlock Academy.” Rock replied.

Eli blinked but did not say anything.

“Oh, then what’s the gathering for?” Eli asked again.

“The shadow lizard bloodline Academy will invite new students to join the Academy every once in a while. If they have the chance, they can even get a bloodline reward and become a powerful shadow lizard bloodline Warlock.” Rock raised his hand and said expectantly.

This time, he had come to join the Academy.

“I see. If I’m not wrong, you should be a level 3 acolyte. Are the requirements of the Academy so high now? ”

“Of course not. It’s just that some of my family members are also from the Academy. He’s in charge of the Kingdom of Corina, so I’ve been learning from him at home. But I’ve come out this time to become a real warlock. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“After all, you know that if we don’t merge our bloodlines, we’ll just meditate, learn some bloodline knowledge, and do some experiments. There won’t be much power, and I’m not interested in those zero-circle spells.”

It seemed like it was just as Nick had said. Warlocks had once abandoned the knowledge of mages and focused on bloodlines. The situation had only worsened over the years.

But this was even better. If a mage’s items were not valued, then Eli could get more things.

Meeting Rock this time was also a great opportunity, so Eli tried his best to ask for as much information as he could.

“Well, I also want to ask, are there any rules in the camp?”

“Rules. I’ve already said that this is an open camp. There won’t be any inspections unless you want to join. However, the inspections won’t be very strict, as long as you follow the rules.

“However, warlocks are affected by their bloodline, and many of them have very bad tempers!” Rock explained some common sense to Eli and joked, “it seems like your teacher isn’t very responsible, brother Herman. Why don’t you come with me to the shadow lizard Warlock Academy? you don’t have anywhere else to go anyway, so you might be able to find further development if you join the Academy.” Rock invited.

In fact, this was what he had planned when he met Eli just now.

Although he had a senior in the first ring, he had not been in the Academy for a long time, so he did not know many people. The royal family’s influence allowed him to know more people to expand his power. If he could recruit a level 3 apprentice in advance, it would naturally be a very good thing.

“The Warlock Academy?” Eli thought for a moment.

The Warlock Academy was indeed a good place, but it was definitely not something that Eli should be concerned about right now. He knew nothing about the Warlock world, so it would be better for him to loiter around the camp for a few decades before joining any faction.

“I’m sorry. I just wanted to take a look at the camp.” Eli declined tactfully.

“Alright, that’s a real pity.” Rock shook his head. “It’s alright. You can stay in the camp for now. If you need anything in the future, just come to me. After all, you’re the first apprentice I’ve met outside.” Rock was good with his words.

“Alright,” Eli nodded. No one could say for sure what would happen in the future. Perhaps one day, he would really ask Rock for help.

“Your Highness, we need to stop here.”

As the two of them chatted, the coachman’s voice suddenly came from outside.

??

Eli looked at Rock.

“Relax. It’s just that the camp doesn’t allow apprentices to bring more than two servants, so we’ll have to walk on our own for the rest of the journey.” Rock explained, afraid that Eli would overthink.

“I see!” Eli nodded. He had thought that something had happened.

The two of them got out of the car. They were already far away from the main road. Eli looked ahead, and there was an area covered in fog. It was another mist-sealing spell formation.

“Let’s go,” he said. The two Grand Knights behind Rock carried two large boxes and followed them.

Meanwhile, Rock cast a glance at Eli and shook his head. What a pitiful apprentice. He was too poor and did not even have supplies with him.

The other Coachmen and Knights left while Rock and Eli walked side by side.

The two of them walked into the fog.

The mist had almost no effect on apprentices, it only prevented ordinary people from entering.

Ten minutes later.

They arrived at the camp.
