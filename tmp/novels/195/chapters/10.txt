Chapter 11: The End

Translator: Lonelytree

Eli and the others sat in an area of the library, while scholar Clement patrolled left and right. The two young men he had brought along stood on either side, looking like they were invigilators.

Out of the 30 people, three of them were invigilators. This also showed how much importance they attached to the test.

Therefore, the way he stopped was particularly eye-catching, and scholar Clement was the first to notice him.

“Are you giving up?” Scholar Clement and Kart had the same thought.

After all, it had only been twenty minutes. Most people had only answered a quarter of the questions, and the faster ones had only answered a third. However, Eli had put down his pen. It was no wonder they thought that he had given up.

“What a pity!” Clement still remembered this hardworking child.

He shook his head as if he had not expected that Eli would actually do something like this. In the past half a month, he had been able to see Eli stay until the end of every day, and this made him admire the young man in front of him.

But he didn’t expect him to give up, which made Clement feel a little regretful.

When he passed by Eli, he subconsciously glanced at his test paper.

‘Oh, what was written all over it? The papers are all written!’

The next second, Scholar Clement’s pupils shook.

He stood behind Eli and looked at the test paper.

The first question was correct.

The first part was all correct.

The second part was also correct.

...

Scholar Clement dared to swear on his head that the contents of these papers were absolutely confidential. Even he had only seen all the test questions this morning, and the difficulty was also extremely great.

This was especially true for history and heraldry. He could find many strange angles to link several things together, which was also very difficult.

Even a learner would not dare to say that they could answer 100% correctly. And a learner referred to a person who had relatively extensive knowledge in specific fields.

Even in the library, there weren’t many people like him.

Even if he were to answer this paper, he wouldn’t dare to say that he could answer every point accurately. After all, there were already many things that he didn’t remember.

But Eli actually answered all of them correctly.

It was ridiculous.

How much memory was needed to achieve this level?

Clement was a little shocked as if he had returned to half a month ago when he had noticed this kid.

Clement pursed his lips and continued to patrol in silence, thinking about other things.

...

The test was over.

Once the two hours were up, Clement ignored the wails of most of the temporary librarians, put away the test papers, and left with the two young men.

As there were only about 30 papers, they only needed to wait for an hour before the ranking would be out. It would also determine who would stay and who would leave.

“sigh, I’m done for. It’s too difficult!”

“That’s right. There’s no way this time.”

“It’s on a completely different level of difficulty compared to previous years!”

As soon as Clement left, everyone immediately wailed and complained about the difficulty of the test.

“Is it very difficult? Aren’t they all historical events?” Eli blinked. Only now did he realize the power of Quick memory.

Although this was only a basic wizard spell, it could even be said to be a demonic ability for ordinary people. This was an ability that the Knights did not have at all.

“Eli, how’s your exam? It’s so difficult this time. I’m really done for. I’m definitely going to be eliminated.” A familiar voice sounded, and even Eli was a little speechless.

“Do you have nothing else to do?” The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched when he saw Kart’s worried expression.

This guy was a little disgusting.

At this moment, a man beside him saw that it was Kart and asked, ” Kart, how did you answer the last question? It was so hard!”

“Uh, it’s really difficult. I don’t know how to answer it.” Kart shook her head helplessly, but after “hesitating,” she said, ” “I wrote it randomly. I... first and then... I don’t know if it’s right.”

“Oh, I see!” The man revealed a look of realization.

“Wrong!” Suddenly, an untimely voice sounded.

Kart immediately looked over and realized that it was actually Eli who had spoken.

“Wrong? That’s impossible! That’s definitely the right answer!” This time, Kart looked a little flustered as she looked at Eli in surprise.

“Wrong.” Without explaining, Eli left.

This was the effect he wanted. It was time to make this guy suffer.

And he wasn’t wrong. Kart did get the last question wrong.

Eli was happy, but Kart was upset. He was thinking about the last question crazily in his heart, and his original confidence was wavering a little. He seemed to vaguely feel that there was indeed a problem, and he immediately began to feel upset.

...

On the other side, Clement entered his office, with Herman and Kurt following behind him.

The two of them had been studying under Clement for many years, and they were here to help Clement score the test.

“Kurt and Herman, find the test paper of one of them named Eli Lucifer.” As soon as he sat down, Clement said directly.

“Oh? Is there a problem with this person?” Kurt asked curiously.

“Uh, you’ll know when you see his test paper.” Clement didn’t answer but said.

Clement’s words also aroused the curiosity of the two. They had not seen such a reaction from their teacher in a long time. Thus, they began to flip through the test paper, wanting to see what this Eli Lucifer had done.

There were a total of 30 test papers, and the two of them quickly found the test papers.

After they finished reading the papers, the two of them fell silent.

“Teacher, I’m afraid that this guy’s current level of knowledge is no weaker than mine. Which scholar’s disciple is he? Or is he a member of some great noble?” Kurt took a deep breath and said.

He had studied under his teacher for almost ten years and was already a qualified learner.

“Indeed, it’s very impressive,” Herman added. He had only been under scholar Clement for less than a year, so he was still learning.

“He’s just a poor man!” Clement looked up at the two of them and said, ” you should understand what I’m saying. He must have put in a lot of effort to reach this level.”

“Poor people?” Kurt looked confused, and he didn’t seem to believe it. Herman was also in disbelief.

“You should learn from him. To achieve this level, you need at least a few years of memorizing and studying. How long has it been since you’ve worked so hard? ” Clement used Eli to educate the two of them, and then he told them about how Eli studied until midnight every day.

Herman and Kurt were stunned, and they both lowered their heads in shame.

Although they worked hard, they were not as hardworking as Eli.

“Then how does teacher plan to deal with him?” Kurt asked curiously.

Clement smiled and said, “I want to take him in as a student.”

...

The candle flame burned slowly in the dark environment, and wisps of smoke floated in the air.

Everyone was waiting in the library, each and every one of them anxiously moving left and right, waiting for the final result.

For some of them, the library was a very precious opportunity. If it was gone, it was really gone. Therefore, most people cherished it.

Eli was sitting in a corner, waiting and thinking about something.

Of course, it wasn’t about the test. He was very confident in the test paper. Although he might not be able to get a full score, 99 was not a problem. After all, he was just regurgitating what he had memorized.

After becoming an apprentice, not only did he strengthen his sense of the elements, but his brain’s ability to think also improved.

What he was really thinking about was that after the test, he should be able to become an official librarian, and moving was necessary. What should he do next?

Soon, Eli decided on what he was going to do for the time being.

That was to meditate and learn zero-circle spells.

Now that he had found a stable environment, it was time for him to start his magic studies.

He had been meaning to learn magic for a long time.

He had only learned quick memory so far, but he could already feel the huge changes that he had undergone. However, Eli felt that it wasn’t enough. After all, quick memory was still considered normal, but it didn’t have the feeling of being truly extraordinary.

It was just like the object that appeared in the light beam that was in Eli’s body.

That was what he yearned for.

After all, as a mage, he should at least know how to cast a fireball, right?

After provoking Eli, Kart had been sitting on the other side, waiting for the results as well. He looked calm on the surface, but he was very anxious on the inside. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Compared to Eli’s idle thoughts, his dream was to truly restore the glory of the nobles.

He did not have the talent to become a knight, so it was difficult for him to make any achievements. He could only choose to walk the path of literature. However, it was obviously impossible for other Academies to train him because they only took in students since they were young. Thus, he came to the library, hoping to use the channels there to achieve a breakthrough.

And becoming the librarian here was the first step.

Just as he was looking at the entrance of the corridor with enthusiasm, three familiar figures slowly walked out.

The sound of someone stepping on the carpet rang out. Everyone instantly looked over and understood that the final moment had finally come.

Clement walked out, looked at the crowd, and said, “Rias and Eli, stay behind. The rest of you can go to the finance department and get a silver Tarl. You don’t have to come tomorrow.”

Eli also smiled. He finally passed.

Half a month’s effort had not been in vain!

But Rias? Eli looked not far away. In the crowd, there was a young girl. She had long brown hair and purple eyes. Her looks were rather ordinary, but she looked very kind.

There was indeed such a person in Eli’s memory. He didn’t know her identity, but he heard that she had an extraordinary background. It was just that she was usually too low-key, so few people noticed her.

However, he didn’t expect her to be so powerful. In the test, she directly surpassed Kart.

In contrast to the two of them, the rest of the people looked as if they were deflated, revealing disappointed expressions. Some of them knew that it was not often for them to get a silver tars, so they went to the finance department to get silver tars. The others followed.

The crowd dispersed.

However, there was still one person who stood there in a daze. His confident smile gradually disappeared, and the light in his eyes also gradually disappeared. His mouth was wide open as if he could not believe it.

It was Kart.
