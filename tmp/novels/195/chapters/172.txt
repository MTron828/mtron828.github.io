173 Dick’s Defeat

The hunt began.

In the next few hours, the White Tower warlocks had a great time. They began to join forces to kill the warlocks of the blood Alliance and snatch their resources.

At first, the blood Alliance had wanted to resist, but because Molin and Adams weren’t around and a lot of their combat power had been exhausted in the town, they were no match for the White Tower at all. It was a one-sided battle.

On the other hand, Eli didn’t join in on the hunt. Since people were working for him, there was no need for him to do it himself. He began to explore the mage Town, collecting a large number of resources.

“Damn it, damn it, these damn White Tower warlocks.” A late-stage one-circle sorcerer was fleeing in the forest, and behind him were three late-stage one-circle White Tower warlocks.

“Stop, you can’t run. Hand over all your loot.” A Warlock looked at him and shouted.

“Get lost!

“I’m telling you. When Lord Molin and Lord Adams come, you’ll be in big trouble!” He shouted loudly, but he was a little hesitant in his heart.

Because at this point, even he was no longer confident. He had deep doubts in his heart.

Why haven’t the two lords shown themselves yet?

They had been bullied by the White Tower, and the two had not shown up.

Could it be that the two have already met with mishaps? But how was that possible? Could it be that there was someone in this secret realm who could kill the two of them? It was almost impossible.

However, there seemed to be traces of mutated monsters in the second circle. Could it be that the two of them had already entered the town and then …

The Warlock’s eyes were wide open, and he could not believe his own guess.

“Damn it, damn it, it’s impossible.” He shook his head.

Just as he was lost in his thoughts, two warlocks suddenly appeared in front of him. He looked again and saw that they were the warlocks of the White Tower.

“I’m done for!” The Warlock’s face was filled with despair.

..

In the blink of an eye, another three hours had passed.

There were only three minutes left before the end of the expedition.

Eli stood on top of a tower in the Town and looked around.

Compared to a few hours ago, the secret realm was quiet at this time because most of the people in the secret realm were the White Tower’s warlocks. The warlocks of the Blood Alliance were either in hiding or dead.

As for Molin and Adams, they had yet to show up. This made the warlocks of the Blood Alliance realize something.

Their Lords might have already died.

“Hey, it’s almost time.” He looked at the time again. There was still one minute left.

..

On the altar outside the secret realm.

A large group of people had already gathered, with Dick and Kratos standing at the front.

“Kratos, I hope that I won’t see a single Warlock from the White Tower later. That would be interesting.” Dick’s lips curled up as he laughed.

“You should worry about your people.” Kratos retorted, but his eyebrows were tightly knitted.

Half a day ago, he had received news that Adams, who had been at the limit of One Circle in the Blood Alliance, had disappeared for a period of time before the event. No one knew what had happened.

Kratos felt that there might be a problem.

“What’s wrong? you say you’re not worried, but that’s not what your expression says.” Looking at Kratos’s worried expression, Dick said smugly.

In his opinion, there was no chance of an accident this time.

Adams, who was in the second circle, was going to fight against the apprentices in the first circle. Wasn’t that like a Wolf entering a pack of wolves?

Of course, it was also possible that the White Tower did not follow the rules, but from what they knew, the few late-stage first-circle warlocks of the White Tower were very inexperienced. Even Rawls, who had reached his limit, had only broken through not long ago, so it was impossible for him to be a second-circle sorcerer. Otherwise, he would not be so confident.

“The expedition has ended!”

Suddenly, someone pointed at the secret realm and shouted.

Dick and Kratos turned their heads to look at the gate of the secret plane, and a huge vortex appeared again.

Dick had a confident smile on his face as he waited for the warlocks from the Blood Alliance to come out.

Very quickly, the first person came out.

“Eh, we’re out?

“damn it, I almost snatched the resources from the Blood Alliance warlocks. What bad luck.”

A Warlock of the White Tower walked out and cursed.

The first one to come out was the White Tower’s Warlock.

Kratos knew this first circle sorcerer, and he asked in surprise, “Hugo, what’s the situation inside?”

“We were just chasing a Warlock from the Blood Alliance. We were about to kill him, but we were suddenly teleported out.” The Warlock sighed.

Kratos was stunned. The situation seemed to be a little different from what he had imagined!

Dick was speechless.

The Warlock didn’t hide his voice, so he could hear it clearly. This made him a little confused.

“What’s going on? Didn’t Adams kill these first-circle White Tower warlocks? ” He whispered doubtfully, “It should be an accident. Everything should be normal after that.”

“What’s the current situation inside?” Kratos asked.

“One-sided!” The apprentice replied.

“It’s one-sided!” Dick’s eyes brightened. It seemed like nothing major had happened.

Kratos, on the other hand, shook his head and sighed. It seemed that the situation was not good this time.

“What’s wrong, my Lord? this time, we’re the ones suppressing the Blood Alliance!” The Warlock was puzzled. Did he not make it clear?

White Tower was suppressing the Alliance of ten thousand blood?!

Everyone was stunned. How was this possible?

“Yeah. Master Herman saved a lot of our lives in the wizard Town, including mine. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be in this state.” The Warlock added.

“Herman?” Kratos blinked his eyes.

Not far away, Dick’s eyes were wide open. He couldn’t accept this. How was this possible?

With Adams, how could this have happened? Then, the Warlock named Hugo told them everything about their experience, how Herman saved them, and how the warlocks from the Blood Alliance were hunted down.

During this process, Kratos was gasping for air while Dick was in disbelief. He waited for the people from the Blood Alliance to come out and tell him what exactly happened inside.

After a few seconds, another person came out. It was also from the White Tower, an apprentice.

After some understanding, it was similar to what the first Warlock had said.

Dick was obviously a little flustered, but Kratos slowly smiled.

When the tenth person to come out was still the White Tower Warlock, Dick was already covered in a cold sweat. Kratos, on the other hand, laughed and mocked Dick loudly.

At this moment, Kratos was extremely pleased.

Dick didn’t say a word and continued to wait for the Warlocks from the Blood Alliance.

Half an hour later, more than twenty warlocks from the White Tower came out. Finally, a blood Alliance Warlock who was at the late stage of the first circle appeared.

The Warlock was covered in blood, and his bloodline power was weak, but there was a sense of surprise and joy in his eyes. He looked at the blue and white sky and said, “I’m finally out.”

“Justin, it’s you. Tell me what happened inside.” Before he could react, his shoulder was already grabbed. He raised his head and saw Dick with bloodshot eyes.

“My Lord,” The Warlock was also shocked.

“Quickly tell me what happened inside. Where’s Molin and Adams?” Dick asked loudly, his tone urgent.

“my Lord, our people are almost all killed inside. Master Molin and master Adams didn’t even show up. I suspect that they might be dead. Traces of second-circle mutated chimeras have been found in the mage Town.” The Warlock quickly organized his words.

Dick was stunned, dumbfounded.

He might be dead?!

He was a second-circle Warlock! How could he die in a secret plane like this? Moreover, Adams was a second-circle genius from the same clan as him.

“Impossible, impossible.” Dick broke out in a cold sweat and his face twitched.

At this time, the people in the secret realm had basically come out. The White Tower’s side had more than eighty people, while the blood Alliance only had a dozen.

Finally, Eli walked out and joined the White Tower. The secret plane slowly closed, but Molin and Adams still hadn’t come out.

“We’re finished!” Seeing that the secret realm was closed and the two still didn’t come out, Dick became desperate.

This secret plane was very special. If there were no energy, it would automatically teleport people out. Molin and Adams hadn’t come out yet, which meant that they were probably dead.

However, just because he was aware of it didn’t mean that he could accept it. A two-circle warlock had died in a medium-grade secret realm. This was too ridiculous. How could this be possible?

“No, no, there’s definitely something wrong with the White Tower people.”

He straightened his body and looked sharply at Eli, who was leading the group, and Rawls, who was still unconscious and said, ” there’s definitely something wrong with all of you. I’m going to check every single one of you.”

His sharp gaze was fixed on them, and many warlocks tensed up. On the other hand, Eli’s gaze was calm, and he was confident.

“Go to hell. White Tower people are not something you can investigate as you please!” Sure enough, Kratos stood between the two parties and said domineeringly.

“If you want to fight, just say it!” Kratos’s eyes were also sharp, and he emitted a powerful aura.

In terms of combat power, he was stronger than Dick.

Dick exploded in anger again, but he didn’t say anything.

He had no choice, he really couldn’t win.
