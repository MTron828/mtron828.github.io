328 Tsunami

The catastrophe had come to an end, and Eli had entered a new period of rest.

On the one hand, he was deepening his knowledge. On the other hand, he was also studying and trying to create a fourth-circle spell that was suitable for him.

There was a world of difference between a 4th-circle spell and a spell below that. Once a spell reached the 4th-circle, it would involve the laws of nature, and the difficulty and power of the spell would naturally increase.

This issue was like learning mathematics. One was to learn the basic knowledge and deduce it, while the other was to solve the problem directly with a formula. A 4th-circle spell was the latter.

But even so, the number of 4th-circle spells was much less than 3rd-circle spells.

Even creating it was not an easy task.

Of course, this was just an attempt by Eli, and he was prepared to start experimenting with the most basic elemental sorcery. Wind elemental sorcery was also the one he used the most, and he had started using it when he was an apprentice.

It might take a long time, but Eli was willing to spend the time.

In any case, he wasn’t going to the central continent for now.

..

Five years passed in the blink of an eye.

From some information, Eli had deduced the necessary structures for some celestial-level spells and made his first attempt, but without a doubt, his first attempt had failed gloriously.

But Eli wasn’t discouraged.

After all, it was just the beginning.

And although he was not very confident in other aspects, when it came to learning and creating spells, Eli’s talent was definitely top-notch. This was something that even the usually humble Eli could not deny.

Take it slow.

..

Another five years passed.

The first attempt of the spell was a success.

4th-circle spell-tornado creates a huge tornado to attack the enemy. It’s a single-element attack, powerful, and has a large area of effect. It’s also the first 4th-circle spell that Eli created.

However, since he had created the spell, he had to experiment with it.

But he didn’t know where to go.

On this day, he was also thinking about this problem. Suddenly, he seemed to feel something in his heart, and he suddenly flew out of the wizard Tower until he was more than a thousand meters high in the air.

The silvery-white eye was activated automatically. His sight looked at the endless sea in the distance. More accurately, he looked at the depths of the endless sea.

He could vaguely feel that something had happened in the deep area of the endless sea.

Moreover, this change had spread through who knew how many kilometers and affected this place.

At this time, the water elements above the endless sea had completely gone berserk.

In his field of vision, above the endless blue sea, the water elements were trembling slightly. Under the surface of the water, the turbulent sea water was rolling, and the Marine creatures were also running around wildly.

If Eli’s guess was right, there would be a huge tsunami coming up!

“It seems that something big has happened in the deep area of the endless sea,” Eli’s gaze was complicated.

The endless sea was still too mysterious for Eli, and this ocean that occupied nearly a quarter of the warlock world, whether it was creatures or other things, was full of mysteries.

He hoped that it would not affect him too much.

Eli shook his head, returned to the wizard Tower, and called for Aisha.

“Grandmaster, is there something you need from me?” Aisha asked.

She was in the third circle so that she couldn’t sense the minute changes in the depths of the endless sea. The ocean wasn’t under their jurisdiction.

“There will be a huge tsunami on the West Coast. You need to be prepared!” Eli said.

“Tsunami?” Aisha blinked her eyes in confusion.

Why would there be a tsunami?

“It’s a tsunami. You don’t have much time left. I estimate that in at most three hours, the tsunami will come!” Eli looked at her and said.

“Yes!” Although she was puzzled, Aisha knew that it was not the time to discuss this. It was only three hours. It would be a life-and-death situation.

Soon, news spread out from the bloodline tower.

The coastal cities immediately began an emergency evacuation.

The priority was to evacuate the people, followed by the resources.

Of course, during this process, there were some people who were unwilling to cooperate and chose to stay in the city. They felt that they were doing well. Moreover, there had not been a tsunami on the West Coast for nearly a thousand years. How could there be a tsunami?

Facing these people, Aisha’s choice was to let them be.

She didn’t have much choice.

Regarding this, Eli was also supportive.

There weren’t that many coastal cities, and there weren’t as many people as he had imagined. Moreover, they were all adults, and they should be responsible for their own thoughts. If they weren’t even willing to do this, they would be dead.

Thanks to the good construction of the bloodline tower over the years, the retreat went smoothly.

However, there was an accident.

“Teacher, there’s a city built on the ocean-gazing cliff. It’s on the northern coast of the West Coast and is quite far from us. When they received the news, nearly two hours had passed.

“Moreover, that city was the only coastal city previously ruled by the hourglass. When the war broke out, many of their people went there to avoid danger.

“The nearest city is 40 to 50 kilometers away, so there’s no time to retreat. Moreover, the nearby terrain is flat, and there are no tall mountains for the citizens to take refuge in,” Aisha anxiously reported to Eli.

Time was still too tight.

...

“What do you plan to do?” Eli glanced at her.

“Grandmaster…” Aisha lowered her head.

“Alright, I know. I will go.” Eli laughed.

He naturally knew what Aisha was thinking. She was here to ask for help.

Moreover, this was not a big danger to him. After all, it was just a tsunami. If the entire city was drowned by the tsunami, even Eli would not be able to bear it. Most importantly, he needed to test his new spell.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, Grandmaster.” Aisha’s eyes lit up.

During this time, she had also sent out warlocks for an emergency investigation, and they had indeed found that there was something wrong with the endless sea.

“Yes.”

Eli nodded.

Soon, Aisha left.

Eli put on his wizard robe and left the wizard Tower.

...

His body turned into a bloody light, and he headed north.

..

50 minutes later.

Roya city.

At this moment, countless warlocks were standing on high ground, looking at the endless sea in the distance. All of them had serious expressions.

It was only half an hour ago that everyone learned of the impending tsunami.

However, the time was too short, and they were too close to the sea. Except for some warlocks who were a first circle and above, the rest of the ordinary people and even the apprentices could not escape in time.

Hence, at this time, there were more than 100000 nervous people gathered in Roya city.

On the city wall, many people were looking at the sea.

“Do you really think there will be a tsunami?” An apprentice asked the one beside him.

“Since the bloodline tower has notified us, it can’t be fake, right? ”

“That’s true. But if the tsunami comes, I don’t know how many of us can survive.”

“eh, why did they inform us so late? we didn’t have time to run at all!”

The crowd all had different expressions and dejected tones.

In the face of a natural disaster like a tsunami, even a first-circle Warlock could get into an accident if they were not careful, not to mention ordinary people and apprentices like them. When the tsunami came, at least half of the people in this city died.

“It’s coming!”

Suddenly, someone pointed at the sea in the distance and shouted.

Everyone looked over.

At the border of the sea, a white wave was rolling and getting higher and higher. At first, it was only a dozen meters high, but when it reached the coastline, it was as high as two hundred meters. The area of the tsunami was so large that it almost covered the coast for dozens of miles.

The tsunami covered the sky and the sun, and the shadow it cast made everyone feel a burst of fear.

Everyone looked at the tsunami that was getting closer and closer, and they couldn’t help but despair.

“A tsunami that’s almost 200 meters tall? you must be joking. An apprentice collapsed on the high wall. Their city wall was only tens of meters high!”

“We’re finished!”

The others were also in despair.

The tsunami was getting closer and closer. When it was less than 300 meters away from the shore, everyone could even feel the abundant water element in the air and hear the sound of the tsunami moving.

By now, no one had any hope.

One by one, they frantically ran into the buildings. After all, a tsunami of this scale was probably enough to kill an ordinary acolyte with a single crash. The power of a natural disaster should not be underestimated.

But suddenly, everyone only heard a gust of wind.

Everyone looked up.

In the sky, a ray of blood-red light streaked across, flying toward the tsunami.

When it was a few hundred meters away from the tsunami, the blood light stopped and a figure appeared.

He held a magic staff in his hand, and in the blink of an eye, endless gales instantly swept up. Everyone could only see the biting cold storm and shrieks in the sky.

In the sky, a huge tornado appeared in front of the man.

The tornado was about a hundred meters tall, not much smaller than the tsunami. Then, under everyone’s gaze, it crashed straight into the tsunami.

Bang! Bang!

When the tsunami hit the tornado, everyone saw that the tsunami was torn apart. The tsunami in this area of the city was sucked in by the tornado, which was equivalent to a section of the tsunami that was more than ten miles long being cut off.

After the tsunami was neutralized, the tornado also slowly disappeared.

The tsunamis in other areas also reached the West Coast. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, it was no longer important to the residents of Roya city.

Because they were saved.

People ran out of their houses and cheered for their new lease on life.

At this time, someone recognized Eli’s appearance and shouted Herman’s name. Only then did they know that the one who saved them was actually the celestial of the bloodline tower, Warlock Herman!

Everyone was shocked.

Even at this moment, the people who originally didn’t have a strong loyalty to the bloodline tower were grateful to Herman. They were grateful to the bloodline tower for saving their lives.

After all, this was a celestial!

He had actually come all the way here to save some ordinary people like them!

He had completely bought over the hearts of these people after saving them once.

One could imagine that after this incident was over, there would definitely be many people kneeling in front of Eli’s statue, and it would last for a long time.

After the crisis was resolved, in the sky, Eli kept his staff, glanced at the sea that was beginning to calm down, and then turned around.

At this time, Roya city had fallen into a carnival. Countless people expressed the joy of surviving the disaster and even shouted Herman’s name.

Looking at this scene, Eli’s mood was lifted for once.

He had saved the city and even tested his spell!

He didn’t make a wasted trip!

He looked at the ocean a few more times. His body was once again wrapped in blood-red light as he streaked across the sky.

He left.
