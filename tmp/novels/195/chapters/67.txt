68 Two Months

As time was tight, they would leave once the negotiations were over.

So, Eli even stopped his daily meditation and went straight into studying. He rested seven hours a day and spent the rest of his time working.

This made Clement dumbfounded. Why was his student so diligent?

On the other hand, because of Eli’s fanatical work, it also made Ake and the other two accept the two of them. And to their surprise, it seemed that with Eli’s participation, their progress actually seemed to have improved a little.

Ten days later, when Eli took out the complete chain of evidence to prove that the ruins of the Empire definitely existed, the entire project team went crazy.

Originally, their progress was still confirming whether the remains really existed. In fact, although everyone had always believed that the remains of the Empire existed, to be honest, there had been no real evidence found, which was also an important reason why the Queen gave up.

“Oh my God, Eli, you’re a god. I have to report to the Queen. You’re amazing.” Ake held the complete piece of evidence in his hand, unable to believe it.

Arthur and Vera were also looking at him in disbelief. They were fanatical, so their love for this project was beyond anyone’s imagination.

However, when a project team member progressed faster than they had in years after joining the project team for ten days, the two of them were a little dumbfounded.

“I suggest that we don’t report this to the Queen. We should wait until we have more discoveries. Otherwise, if we can’t find any more evidence, the whole project might be removed.” Eli said calmly.

“Yes, yes, yes, you’re right.” Ake nodded, and the other two agreed.

At this moment, although Ake was still the person in charge, the actual central figure had become Eli.

This was also because the three of them really wanted to find the remains, and the project team was very small, so no one knew about their situation.

Beside him, scholar Clement put down his pen and fell silent.

Weren’t they here to participate? How did things end up like this?

By the way, scholar Clement had actually contributed a lot to this project. He had helped Eli analyze all the materials, and Eli had found all the connections and obtained evidence.

Actually, it wasn’t that Eli couldn’t complete it on his own, but the workload was too huge, and they didn’t have much time. Eli had to use part of his talent.

The project team had a new leader, and Eli began to assign work to a few people who followed his orders obediently.

It was hard to imagine that ten days ago, he and scholar Clement had just arrived. In the blink of an eye, their status had changed greatly.

It was also the first time that Eli had completely immersed himself in work. It was only twenty days later, when he received the news that Aria had completely taken over the business of the Chamber of Commerce that he suddenly realized that another twenty days had passed.

They’d been progressing very quickly recently. Eli could always find the clues in the discoveries and then eliminate the wrong answers.

It could be said that the current efficiency made Ake feel that they were much more efficient than when they had hundreds of people back then.

On the other side, Queen Cynthia was indeed Queen Cynthia. She completely displayed her unyielding attitude at the negotiation table. The two countries were locked in a heated argument over the exchange of benefits, but no one was willing to take a step back.

This was because every step she took would result in a huge loss. At this moment, Queen Cynthia definitely wouldn’t give in just because she was in a good mood. This was a major country-wide transaction, and the only thing that could be decided right now was profit.

Everyone was spinning like a wheel. Everyone was very nervous.

...

The project team for the ruins of the Empire was undergoing some visible changes.

Because of the busy work, the environment there was even worse. There were piles of documents and garbage everywhere. The alley at the entrance was even worse since no one cleaned it.

In the end, it was still eli who couldn’t stand it anymore and hired someone to clean it up.

However, when the cleaners entered the ruin and saw the unkempt Ake, Arthur, Vera, and a few others who seemed to have gone crazy, they quickly did the cleaning and ran out of the place.

It was like a mental hospital.

...

Another ten days passed.

“Is the location of the ruins confirmed in this large area?”

The progress of the project had taken a big step forward again.

After ten days of deduction, they confirmed that the ruins should be in an area near the northern mountain range of the Lorraine Kingdom. However, it was very large, and they still needed time to confirm it.

At that moment, Ake felt dizzy.

How could progress be so fast?

It was as if everything had changed ever since Eli and Clement joined, and it was self-evident how much Eli played a role in it. This made Ake even admire him.

Arthur and Vera looked at Eli as if they were looking at a god.

As for Clement, he was a little relieved. It seemed like his student was quite talented.

The tense atmosphere filled the diplomatic teams of the two countries. Until now, no one was willing to take a step back, which kept their progress at the same level as a month ago.

Marquis Alina felt his head throb, but he could do nothing about it.

The others provided many suggestions, but they were all useless.

For a moment, he thought of the young man, Eli, who had saved his life before. He wanted to ask him if he had a way, but he couldn’t find him at all. He only knew that Eli had been in the second library here for five days and hadn’t come out. They couldn’t see him at all.

Marquis Alina sighed and gave up. Why would he think Eli would have any solutions?

Three days later, Eli returned from the library.

“I’ve found it!”

Everyone was shocked by his words.

Ake’s mouth was agape, and he couldn’t close it. Arthur, Vera, and scholar Clement all looked up in disbelief.

“I’ve found the place where the ruins were once buried. It’s called the southernmost protruding corner of the hordes mountain range, but it seems that there was an earthquake more than 50 years ago, so the terrain has changed greatly. What we need to do now is to find its current location.” Eli finished in one breath.

After going through the analysis and verification of a large amount of information in the library, Eli made some progress. Fortunately, there was still some information left behind from before, which finally allowed him to find the place.

“Alright, we’ll go find it now!” As a map scholar, Vera immediately nodded.

The others also helped out. Scholar Clement looked at Eli, feeling that his student had really matured. He was a mature scholar, although he wasn’t even a learner yet.

Seeing that the others had started to get busy, a smile appeared on Eli’s face.

The rest of the work was not difficult, so he left it to them.

As for him, of course, he was going to sleep.

Even with his mental energy, he was very tired after staying in the library for five days without sleeping.

Looking at Eli, who was lying on the bed, the others didn’t have any objections. Instead, they felt that this was what he deserved.

Another three days passed.

On this day, Vera, who was buried in the map, looked up with an excited expression and shouted, “I’ve found it, I’ve found it.

“We’ve found the Empire’s secret treasure!”
