212 Test

Very quickly.

Eli and Nikola came to a small lake not far from the forest. Nikola had a serious expression on his face. He took a deep breath and stood aside, while Eli stood dozens of meters away.

“For now, increase your strength to the third circle. It’s better this way.” Eli said to Nikola.

He was afraid that he would accidentally kill Nikola if he was in the second circle.

“Yes, my lord.” Nikola nodded and immediately began to summon the undead.

After a short while, an overwhelming number of undead flew from the forest as if it was the end of the world and then poured into Nikola’s body. His aura also rapidly rose to the level of a third circle early stage.

Nikola’s aura was much stronger than that of a second-circle mage. An apprentice could not withstand the power of his mind control.

“Are you ready?”

“I’m ready!”

Nikola’s face was serious, his aura was at its peak, and he stared at Eli.

He wanted to see how much his master’s strength had improved this time.

Eli nodded too.

The spell model began to activate. A small fireball began to appear in front of him, and in the blink of an eye, it had expanded to the size of a basketball, emitting light and heat in all directions.

“It’s just the beginning,” Nikola stood in front of the lake with a nervous expression. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As a former third-circle mage, he knew that this was only the beginning.

After constructing the basic spell model, Eli immediately used elemental communication.

In an instant, Eli felt the elements in the surrounding air rush toward him. More accurately, they were rushing toward the fireball. The fireball quickly turned from the size of a basketball to the size of a stone mill.

“It’s not the limit yet.”

Eli narrowed his eyes. Since he was going to test it, he might as well go straight to his limits.

His mental force was instantly activated to the extreme, and like a storm, the elements within a few hundred meters instantly surged toward Eli, creating a void zone in the blink of an eye.

In the blink of an eye, the terrifying fireball expanded from the size of a millstone to a fireball with a radius of five to six meters. The light and heat it emitted could be felt even from hundreds of meters away. Even the color of the flame had changed to a terrifying blue.

This was a spell enhanced by fifteen times the natural elements.

Sensing the terrifying power within, Eli had already vaguely felt that Nikola might not be able to withstand a shot from this fireball, so Eli wanted to withdraw it. However, the fireball was too difficult to control, and it flew out!

The huge fireball streaked across the sky, its speed not slower than when it was small. It was like a terrifying sun smashing into the ground as if it was going to destroy the world.

“F * ck, f * ck, f * ck!”

On the other side, Nikola felt that something was wrong when he saw the fireball expand to such a big size. After all, he was a fake third-circle mage and could not be compared to a real one.

He wouldn’t be able to withstand this fireball, but he didn’t think Eli would release it.

But he was wrong. When he saw the huge fireball flying towards him with a terrifying aura, Nikola was almost scared out of his wits. His huge soul power instantly began to burn and took him away from this area.

His mental force was exhausted. He ran out, but he was almost hit. He could feel the power within the fireball.

It was too big and too strong!

He would die if he took it head-on.

Nikola calmed down his fear and collected the undead creatures that had been produced due to his stimulation. He then turned to look at the other side. He wanted to see how powerful the fireball was.

The fireball did not hit Nikola, so it flew toward the lake not far away.

Tens of meters of distance were covered in the blink of an eye. Nicholas saw the fireball explode, and a layer of fire cloud exploded. The surrounding air emitted a translucent air shield due to the high temperature, and then amazing light and heat spread in all directions.

Finally, there was a terrifying bang.

However, this was not the scariest part. The fireball instantly created a vacuum at the spot where the lake had hit. The water within a thirty-meter radius had disappeared, and a large area of the lake water had turned into steam, spreading in all directions.

This process lasted for more than ten seconds. After that, everything disappeared.

The water level had even dropped by more than a meter. As for the bottom of the lake, Nikola could clearly see a huge hole that was still emitting heat waves, burning the water nearby as if it was boiling.

“This …” Nikola’s mouth twitched, and he turned to look at Eli with a bitter expression.

If it hit him, he would be killed immediately.

However, this also made him confirm that Eli was a genius. This fireball had at least been enhanced with more than ten times the natural elements. Otherwise, it couldn’t be so terrifying. This level of power could only be achieved by a third-circle mage in the middle or late stages. However, Eli had just broken through and could already erupt with such a powerful force. It was simply ridiculous!

He was simply the reincarnation of celestial.

Watching Nikola run out, Eli pursed his lips.

He didn’t expect to lose control!

However, this power was truly terrifying!

Eli looked at the lake. The power just now was at least twenty times stronger than when he was at the second circle. Was this really just the third circle? He suddenly understood why the number of third-circle mages had suddenly decreased. The gap between them and the second-circle mages was simply too great!

A 1st-circle mage might be able to fight a 2nd-circle mage. But the second-circle mage would have no chance against a third-circle mage.

However, this time, almost killing Nikola made him realize his own shortcomings. He had just broken through, and the control of his power was still too poor. He was still not familiar with many methods, so he needed some time to adapt.

“Nikola, stabilize this place for a while,” Eli said to the still-shaken Nikola.

“Yes, my lord.” Nikola nodded and said with lingering fear.

As long as he was not asked to be more test subjects, he would do anything.

Soon, Eli returned to the mage Tower and began to learn new spells, as well as strengthen his control over his power. Nikola guarded the forest and even dealt with some spirits. Some news could not be exposed.

..

At the same time.

...

In a mage tower, a dozen warlocks were gathered around a table.

Most of them were at the peak of the second circle, and their identities were not ordinary. Most of them were the leaders of various Warlock forces, and most of them were close to the bloodline tower and black Isotta. There were also a few from the South of the West Coast, but they all had a common identity, which was that they belonged to the bloodline tower. However, these people all had their own thoughts at this time.

“I think there’s no hope for the bloodline tower. I’ll quit and join the black Isotta.” A black-robed Warlock said.

“I think so too.”

“Indeed, the bloodline tower has been completely suppressed. Mason just reached the third circle. We can’t defeat them!” A Warlock had a negative expression.

The others also sighed. The bloodline tower’s situation had been getting worse and worse recently, and it was difficult for them to form an alliance. At first, they had only joined because they saw the bloodline tower’s power, but they didn’t expect the situation to change so quickly.

“I regret it so much!”

The warlocks spoke one after another, and they quickly came to a conclusion. Basically, the factions here all chose to leave the bloodline tower and join the black Isotta faction. Of course, there were a few who didn’t choose this and continued to stay. The reason wasn’t loyalty but simply that they were too close to the bloodline tower and couldn’t escape even if they wanted to.

“Hey, what’s White Tower thinking? Speaker Ross hasn’t said a word since he arrived,” Suddenly, someone spoke.

The others also turned their eyes to the table. A man was sitting there in silence. It was Ross.

However, compared to the past, he had been the chairman for many years now. His expression had matured a lot, and his gaze was more determined. He said with a certain expression, ” I’m sorry, everyone. White Tower will be standing on the bloodline tower’s side!”

...

There was no other way. They had a long history of hatred for black Isotta and had no hope of surrendering. This was also Herman’s will, and he couldn’t go against it.

“Yes, yes.” The others nodded, not surprised at all, but they looked at Ross with a hint of pity.

‘You’ve provoked the black Isotta for being so ostentatious.’

Of course, no one would say it out loud. They only glanced at Ross, intentionally or unintentionally, with ridicule in their eyes. All these years, the White Tower had been monopolizing a region. White Tower had developed quite well and was the biggest among them. But this time, White Tower was going to be out of luck.

Ross did not say a word. He believed in Herman’s decision.

Soon, the meeting was over.

“Today’s meeting is confidential. I think everyone will follow the rules, so I won’t emphasize it any further. Walk out of this door today and pretend nothing happened.” A Warlock stood up and said.

“Of course.”

“Naturally!”

The group of people nodded in agreement.

“Speaker Ross, I don’t think you’ll spread the news.” The Warlock looked at Ross, who was in the corner.

Most of the factions here had chosen to leave the bloodline tower, but the White Tower was a little special. They had no choice, and some of the warlocks even regretted inviting the White Tower.

“White Tower is very rule-abiding,” Ross said calmly and then left.

Looking at Ross’s back, everyone laughed.

After the bloodline tower was destroyed, White Tower would be next. They were on the wrong team.

Just like that, the group of people also left.

This was a secret meeting, but the contents of the meeting would affect the war between the black Isotta and the bloodline tower.
