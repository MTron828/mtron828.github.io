69 The Ruins of the Empire

The next day, the news that the ruins of the Empire had been found instantly blew up in Duoling!

No matter if they were nobles or scholars, everyone was shocked and dumbfounded when they heard the news.

No one really thought that this “rumor” that had been circulating for more than a decade was actually true.

Everyone also knew that the discoverer of this incident was the team behind this project.

But everyone knew that it was impossible to have this discovery with just the original three-man team. Then, they found out that all this had happened after the two people named clement and eli had joined the team.

Clement and Eli had become famous all of a sudden, at least in the circles of the Lorraine Kingdom.

Countless scholars and Grand scholars of the Lorraine Kingdom wanted to know how they had found it and where the true location of the ruins was.

Of course, there were also people who suspected that this was a scam. Many people felt that it was completely unreasonable for them to find something that had not been found for decades. They were all waiting to see the diplomatic team of the Bryne Empire made a fool of themselves.

Marquis Alina, who had just finished a failed negotiation, had also heard this news.

While they were still in shock, they decided to look for Eli and Clement immediately. However, when they arrived, they realized that Eli had not gone to the library this time but had already been summoned by the Queen.

The others, whether it was Grand scholar Colt, other scholars, Grand Knights, or others, were all completely shocked.

There were also many people who regretted not befriending them before.

They all had their own thoughts.

...

Just as the others were guessing, eli and the others were indeed summoned.

The group of five was escorted into the palace and met the famous Queen in the main hall.

It was still the same Hall. Queen Cynthia sat high up on her throne, calmly looking down at the entire Hall. Beside her was the female knight.

“Are you sure you’ve found it?” Queen Cynthia asked.

Even she was in a state of shock.

More than a decade ago, this project team was established with her support. At that time, the Empire was still in a difficult situation and urgently needed a sum of money to fill the gap. Later, because other aspects were developing well, the gap was filled, so she didn’t spend more effort on it.

However, even she could not deny that if the ruins were real, the wealth inside could not be completely ignored even by the current Empire. After all, the strength of the Olisen Empire at that time was not inferior to the current Bryne Empire.

The Bryne Empire had once been very strong, but it had weakened a lot in recent years.

“Yes, Your Majesty. We’ve searched through historical documents and found the original location of the ruins. We also found out about the terrain that was changed by the earthquake fifty years ago. It took us a long time to determine the current location.” Ake respectfully said, unable to conceal his excitement.

Queen Cynthia nodded.

As for whether it was true or not, she only needed to confirm it when the time came.

“I’m a little curious. How did this suddenly happen when your progress has been very slow in the past ten years? ” Queen Cynthia asked.

“Your Majesty, this was all thanks to the help of scholar Clement and his student, Eli. They were the main force, and I even gave the full command to Eli later on.” Ake was a little embarrassed.

“Oh?”

Queen Cynthia was a little surprised. She looked at the two people beside Ake, one old and one young. Needless to say, the old one was scholar Clement, and the young one was Eli.

” Your majesty, I’m clement, and this is my student, eli! ”

Scholar Clement was also a little stunned. This was the first time he had met someone of such high status.

“Not bad. If it’s true, I won’t mistreat you. You can take any three items from the ruins.” Queen Cynthia nodded and said.

Everyone was overjoyed. As for the three items, they were the Empire’s relics. Who knew how many valuable items there were? The most valuable ones could easily reach several hundred gold tarls.

“Mm, since Eli is the main participant, then, Eli, tell me the details of your discovery.” Queen Cynthia revealed a smile. Her troubles from the unsuccessful negotiations had been alleviated significantly, and she found Eli rather pleasing to the eye.

“Your Majesty, this is the process. First, we read through thirty-two books, and then we confirmed the authenticity of the ruins and relics. Then, we read through a large amount of information again.” Eli gave a simple description.

“Tell me in detail.” Queen Cynthia said again.

“Alright, Your Majesty. But it will take a little time.” Eli nodded.

The Knight beside Queen Cynthia pursed her lips when she heard this. How much information could there possibly be?

However, after five minutes of listening to Eli, the corners of the female Knight’s mouth twitched, and she thought to herself that it was better to be a Knight, without having to use her brain.

Beside her, Queen Cynthia’s expression was the same as usual, as if nothing had changed. However, her slightly trembling eyelashes still showed that she was not calm.

Only after Eli finished speaking did Queen Cynthia heave a sigh of relief. Then, she forced out a sentence, “You’ve all worked hard!”

It was indeed too hard, and it sounded more tiring than her thinking about national affairs. It mainly referred to logic, thinking, and numbers. Were all the scholars in Bryne so strong?

“You’re not bad. The people I sent out tonight should be back soon. you’ll know the results when the time comes.” Queen Cynthia had received the message last night and summoned Eli and the others today.

At this moment, someone suddenly walked into the hall. It was a Knight.

“Your Majesty, we’ve checked the area and confirmed that there’s something underground. We’ve detected a large amount of gold. It should be the ruins!” The Knight said as he knelt on the ground with one leg.

“It seems to be true.” Upon hearing this, Queen Cynthia’s eyes lit up.

At the same time, Eli and the others also heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, they had found it on paper, and no one knew the exact situation.

“Eli, you’re very talented. If you’re willing, you can come to the Lorraine Kingdom, and I can even reward you with a noble title.” Queen Cynthia was overjoyed.

“Your majesty, I just want to study. I’m very satisfied with the current situation!” Eli declined politely.

In the future, he might go to other countries, but it was still early. Everything of his was still in Bryne, and he was in no hurry to leave.

“Alright, the door of the Lorraine Kingdom will always be open for you. Of course, scholar Clement is welcome too!” Queen Cynthia nodded and didn’t say anything else.

“Since we’ve proven it, and the place isn’t far from Turin, let’s go there tomorrow and dig it out.” Queen Cynthia’s interest seemed to have been piqued as she spoke directly.

The group of people looked at each other. The Queen was also an impatient person!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
