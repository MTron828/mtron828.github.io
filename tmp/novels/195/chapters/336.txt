337 Is Eli a Good Person?

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

The merfolk had finally settled down on the West Coast. Eli had arranged for them to stay at a place not very close to the West Coast. First, it was convenient for them to live, and second, it was to reduce trouble. After all, they were merfolk, and it was impossible for them to get along with humans completely.

And the marine observation department, Eli, had also spoken to them, so this matter was settled just like that.

In that month, Eli learned about the story of the mermaid Queen and the others. He realized that the sixth circle great figure who died 500 years ago was actually from the mermaid race, and that person’s death had directly led to the miserable situation the mermaids were in right now. Even the Queen had no choice but to leave.

They would not be able to return to the deep sea in a short period of time unless their King could solve everything.

On the other hand, Eli felt that the possibility was low. After all, what was obtained through force would also be lost due to the loss of force.

However, this had little to do with Eli. He was more concerned about the faith and knowledge of the merfolk.

A few hundred years ago, he had obtained a mermaid’s sacrificial statue from the ocean, but until now, he had not found anything.

He didn’t expect that the mermaids would come to him.

It felt good.

Just yesterday, the mermaid Queen had already arranged everything and given it to Eli.

“Let me see.” Eli lowered his head and took out an Azure gemstone. This was an inheritance item of the merfolk.

His consciousness seeped into it, and a large amount of information instantly entered Eli’s brain. It was also mixed with a large amount of merfolk history and other things.

The study lasted for an entire afternoon.

In the Tower, Eli opened her eyes, which were filled with surprise.

“So it’s like this!”

Eli finally had a basic understanding of the system.

Unlike his current knowledge, faith was mainly related to spiritual power. It was mainly to establish a connection between one’s body and an object and then connect one’s body through it.

This was also the reason why the mermaids used sacrificial statues.

“But what can I contact?”

Eli fell into deep thought, but then his eyes lit up.

He remembered.

Weren’t the statues in the West Coast City the best connection?

Moreover, there might be a lot of faith placed in them.

“I’ll learn it first and then try it out.”

A smile appeared on Eli’s face as he immediately returned to his room. He was about to activate his learning mode.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

In a room, Eli sat on the ground, his consciousness starting to spread out.

“First, I have to contact the statues!” Eli sensed it and tried to contact his own statues.

This was difficult. After all, he had not established a connection with the statues before. Fortunately, some kind of mysticism connection still existed.

Eli’s consciousness gradually sank into nothingness, and he was surrounded by endless darkness.

Time slowly passed. Suddenly, an extremely bright light appeared in the darkness.

“I can sense it.” in the darkness, Eli was overjoyed.

Then, lights appeared one after another. It looked familiar to Eli. This was the distribution of the West Coast cities because every city had a statue of him.

Some of the spots of light overlapped because there might be several statues in a city.

“The next step is to try to attract them.” Eli’s eyes were closed as he tried to attract the light to himself.

A few hours later, the first spot of light trembled slightly, as if it was attracted by something, and flew towards Eli, followed by even more spots of light.

It was getting closer and closer to Eli.

Eli closed his eyes.

…

What Eli didn’t know was …

While he was trying to improve his faith knowledge, the West Coast was in a state of chaos.

Just as Eli made contact with the first statue …

Roya city.

This was a city on the Edge of the West Coast. A statue that was more than ten meters tall was built in the center. It was built when Eli saved them hundreds of years ago.

But suddenly, someone stopped and looked at the statue.

At this moment, the statue was emitting a gentle light that enveloped the entire statue, making it look like a god.

“What is this?” A mortal knelt on the ground and looked at this scene in a daze.

The others also knelt down.

The warlocks watched this scene cautiously, not understanding what had happened.

This was because it was challenging their mindset as warlocks.

Warlocks could not do such a thing.

Could it be a miracle?

All of them were so stunned that they didn’t know what to do.

...

Of course, there were some smart ones who immediately reported it, but they didn’t know that the entire West Coast was the same.

Every city looked at the glowing statue of Herman in a daze, not knowing what to do.

No one dared to move. After all, it was a statue of a celestial.

They thought that the light would only last for a while, but they soon realized that they were wrong.

Half an hour later, starting from Roya city, light spots appeared on the statue and flew out of the City.

A Warlock immediately followed.

Soon, he realized that the light spots were gathering toward the ocean. He turned around and saw that in the sky above the West Coast, hundreds of light spots were gathering toward him. They turned into a huge stream of light spots, like the Milky Way in the sky.

“What is this?”

At this time, there were already many people on the shore, and they were all looking at each other.

“Eh? I think the lights are moving to Mercury Island, and it seems that master Herman lives there!” Someone suddenly said.

The others’ eyes lit up as well.

...

If it were Sir Herman who did it, it would make a lot more sense.

After all, this was Sir Herman. It wouldn’t be strange for him to do anything.

However, this scene still shocked everyone. After all, this was indeed beyond their knowledge.

In short.

This wasn’t a Warlock.

…

“Is it Sir Herman? That’s fine.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the bloodline tower, the new tower master Hein put down the report and heaved a sigh of relief.

He was worried that something had happened, but since it was Sir Herman, he could rest assured.

Not far away, Kriman, the four-circle celestial, was also looking at the light spots flying away in the distance.

He didn’t understand what this was.

…

On the West Coast.

In the new merfolk territory.

In the newly built mermaid Palace, the mermaid Queen and eval looked at each other in surprise.

The power of faith had really been controlled by that human.

“that human is more intelligent than I thought, and he has a lot of worshipers.” The mermaid Queen gritted her teeth.

Looking at the torrent of faith in the sky, what was this person to have so many people place their faith in him?

Could it be that all the humans on the West Coast believed in him?

“I don’t know if this is a good thing. Even in the mage era, we’ve kept the faith system to ourselves,” The mermaid Queen sighed.

The merfolk used to be members of the mage Council.

“my queen, although the faith system has been spread since so many people believe in him, he shouldn’t be a bad person.” Eval consoled her.

“That’s true!” The mermaid Queen’s eyes flashed with inexplicable light.

That treacherous human was actually a good person?

It was ridiculous!
