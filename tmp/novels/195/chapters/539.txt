540 Access, Surveillance

In her eyes, Dylan was Gray’s direct student, and since Eli had the key, he was naturally legit. As for trespassing, it was naturally illegal and needed to be stopped!

In an instant, Eli saw the hundreds of thousands of screens lit up one after another, and images appeared on them, showing the current situation of the mage tower.

A few seconds later, a screen moved in front of them.

On the screen, many Warlocks were fighting against a large number of mechanical creations. They were the Warlock Alliance.

Seeing this scene, Samuel’s expression changed. She looked a little flustered and walked left and right. “Ah, what should we do? What should we do? Someone actually invaded.”

Her words were hurried as she looked at Dylan. “Little Dylan, you have to help us stop them. If they get the final authority, then you’ll be in trouble!”

“Of course!” Dylan nodded and said, “In fact, our main objective this time is to stop them. That’s why I came to you. Apart from monitoring them, I also want to obtain the authority of the other departments. I know you can contact every Mage Spirit. Samuel, we need your help!”

“This…” Samuel hesitated.

At this moment, Dylan pushed Eli out and said to him, “The owner of the key has a rank 2 authority. As the only Mage here, according to regulation 361, he will automatically obtain the authority of all rank 2 departments.”

Hearing Dylan’s words, Samuel hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Alright then.”

In the next second, a ray of light lit up in Samuel’s eyes. She scanned Eli from top to bottom, especially the key, for a few minutes.

Eli also remained calm.

At this moment, Eli finally understood Dylan’s purpose. He was indeed a native!

Soon, Samuel gradually recovered. A stream of data flowed out of her body and slowly flew toward Eli. Eli sensed that there was no danger and accepted it directly.

A few seconds later, Eli finished receiving the message.

“How is it, my lord?” Dylan chuckled as if he knew what was going on.

Just a moment ago, he had obtained a lot of authority in this wizard tower, including but not limited to all surveillance rights in the tower, control rights of robots around the core area, various authorities, and so on.

Of course, most of the authority was only outside the core area or the central tower. However, this was enough. Of course, he also knew more about the situation within the tower, such as the large number of evil creatures in the core area and the periphery, as well as contaminated mechanical products. These were not under his control.

Of course, what Eli cared about were the corrupted mechanical creations and evil creatures.

“Looks like we’ll have to rely on the Warlock Alliance!”

Eli leaned back, and a liquid flowed out of the wall. The screen suddenly enlarged, showing the Warlock Alliance.

Beside them, Samuel and Dylan were looking at the screen.

“Let them conserve some of their combat strength. They will have to deal with more troubles inside the main tower. Moreover, these strange shadow creatures are quite interesting. Lead one over for me to observe first.” Eli smiled and gave two orders.

Dylan felt pity for the Warlocks!

At this moment, they still did not know what kind of situation they would fall into!

Competing with the mage in authority?

Poor Warlock Alliance!

Forget about that. When they passed through all kinds of dangers and entered the final core area, they would realize that they were being used to scout the way!
