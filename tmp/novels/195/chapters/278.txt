279 Hydra’s attack, Eli’s instructions

Kada kada kada!

Hundreds of meters above the sky, a shadow flitted across the sky like an arrow. Countless birds flew away as if they had encountered something terrifying.

The Hydra quickly passed through a large area of the West Coast and entered the bloodline tower’s area in the North.

..

!!

The bloodline tower!

“Everyone, the Holy tower’s soul slaves are a big problem. Do you have any good ideas? Otherwise, it’s not a good idea for us to keep on fighting.”

Vivika sat in the main seat, looking calmly at the dozen people sitting below.

After hundreds of years, she had firmly grasped this power. She was still at the peak of her control of power, and no one dared to disobey her or even oppose her.

“Milord, I think we should choose another path. The mountain range is indeed difficult for us to break through!” At this moment, Rodin raised his head and said.

Back then, he had been captured by Sergei with Vivika and the others, but before he could kill them, Sergei was killed by Eli. And after so many years of fighting, he was still alive.

“We can’t do that.” As soon as Rodin’s words fell, someone objected.

“This mountain range is the last line of defense between us and the Holy tower. If we want to cross it, we can only go along the coastline, but the sea is much more dangerous than land!” The Warlock said.

“Indeed!” Vivika nodded.

There were too many troubles in the sea.

“Alright,” he said. Rodin sighed and stopped talking.

The others were also silent. They didn’t have many good ideas.

Bang bang bang!

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

“Eh?” Vivika looked at the door in the distance and felt a little strange.

This was a meeting room. Who would come at this time?

Did something big happen at the front line?

“Come in!” Said Vivika.

The guards in the distance immediately opened the door and saw a Warlock running in. He came to Vivika’s side and said, ” tower master, a powerful aura is approaching from the South of the bloodline tower. It’s even stronger than Sergei!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What?” Vivika slammed the table and stood up, her face full of anger!

It was even more powerful than Sergei’s!

Although Sergei had been dead for a long time, no one had forgotten the powerful Warlock. He was the top Warlock in the third circle, and no one could rival him even in the two forces.

“Sergei? How is it exaggerated?”

“The South?”

“Why did it come at this time? Is it a plot of the Holy tower? ”

The warlocks discussed animatedly, but their expressions were grave. After all, no one knew what the purpose of this unfamiliar force was, and they could not ignore it!

Vivika had just thought of a plan and was ready to talk about it.

However, the next second, Vivika’s eyes suddenly went blank for a few seconds, and her body did not move. Everyone was a little confused by her sudden action and looked at her.

A few seconds later, her eyes returned to calmness. She waved her hand and said, ” ignore that aura. Let’s continue the meeting.”

“Ah!”

Everyone looked at each other, not understanding what she meant.

Vivika sat down and looked at everyone. “let’s talk about how we’re going to carry out the next round of attack and how we’re going to attack the Holy tower headquarters after breaking through the mountain range!”

Everyone was speechless.

Did you hear what you just said?

The warlocks were confused, but Vivika’s serious expression didn’t seem to be joking!

Could the new arrival be their reinforcement?

..

“we’ve already reached the boundary of the bloodline tower!!”

In the sky, through the Hydra’s eyes, Eli observed his surroundings.

The journey through the main bloodline tower was very smooth, and there were no obstructions along the way. Hydra also quickly arrived at the boundary between the bloodline tower and the mountain range, the soya mountain range!

Looking at the continuous mountain range in front of him, even though he had yet to enter, be it the roars of beasts that came from time to time or the fluctuating auras of magical beasts made Eli realize that he could not be too careless after this.

“The next step is to kill those core magical beasts!” Eli pondered.

However, he wasn’t worried about how to find it.

“Sneak in, Hydra! kill! Eli ordered again.

Gada!

Hydra’s figure slowly shrank until it was almost the size of an ordinary small snake. The other two heads also slowly disappeared. Then, it slowly landed on the ground, looked at the surrounding environment, and then entered the mountain range along the fallen leaves.

Not long after.

They had encountered their first magical beast.

It was a huge mountain demonic bear with gray-yellow eyes. Its aura was around the second circle, and its body was covered in yellow rocks. It was almost four meters long.

At this moment, the Hydra was hiding in a large tree, observing the demonic earth bear.

...

At this moment, the demonic earth bear was leaning against a large tree and curled up together. Most of its eyes were closed, leaving only a thin line. However, a large amount of earth elements was gathering outside its body. This meant that even if it was resting, it was still very alert!

“Very smart!” Eli laughed when he saw it.

However, even though it was smart, it was still useless in the face of Hydra’s strength.

It just so happened that they also needed this demonic bear to locate the core of the soul slaves.

“Hydra, kill it!” ordered Eli.

The Hydra’s small body was hidden in the grass, and it quickly approached the demonic bear. Its small eyes lit up, as this was also an interesting process for it.

After all, from the time he was born, the only battles he had fought were the ones that Eli had allowed in the secret plane!

Slowly approaching the earth demonic bear, Hydra’s body also slowly expanded. With him as the center, countless shadows also gradually spread out and approached the earth demonic bear.

In just a few seconds, the shadows had already surrounded the entire area.

At this moment, the Hydra’s body had also expanded to nearly 1.20 meters, and it was only two to three meters away from the demonic earth bear. It raised its head, looked at the demonic earth bear, and opened its mouth.

However, at this moment, the earth demonic bear seemed to have sensed something as well. Its closed eyes suddenly opened, and it saw a huge mouth that was like a black hole in its eyes.

...

The demonic earth bear was stunned!

It wanted to move, but its body couldn’t move no matter what. When it looked down, it found that its body had been entangled by a thick shadow!

Roar … Wuwuwu!

This time, even his mouth was sealed!

Then, the demonic bear saw the Hydra’s huge mouth, and it gradually fell into darkness.

Gada!

Sensing that the Hydra had swallowed the earth demon bear and that its aura had a slight increase, Eli didn’t say anything!

As the demonic bear devoured it, the devouring rune in the Hydra’s core also slowly took effect. The body of the demonic bear disintegrated bit by bit until some trace of blood remained.

The trace was the connection to the core soul slaves that controlled the demonic bear.

“This is enough!” Eli took a deep breath, and he wrapped his mind around the wisp of blood.

At the same time, a faint connection was sensed by the man and the snake.

“Hydra, go on a killing spree and then return.” Eli silently ordered Hydra.

At the same time, the remaining wisp of mental energy slowly dissipated.

Eli had completed his mission. Next, it was up to the Hydra!
