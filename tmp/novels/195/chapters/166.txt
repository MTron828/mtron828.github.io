“Well, there are still some magic plants. How can they let them go? ”

After knocking out Klee, Eli continued to head toward the magical plant garden. When he realized that there were still a few magical plants that the Blood Alliance warlocks had not harvested, he cursed at the wasted material, and his right hand gradually turned.

The sharp claws collided with the elemental Shield, producing a loud bang. Then, the elemental Shield cracked like glass and disappeared.

The fact that this kind of barrier could be broken by a first-circle Warlock did not mean that it was of low quality. If anything, this also had to do with the lack of energy. After all, thousands of years had passed. It was already very impressive that it could be maintained until now.

So, Eli’s choice was just to dig the device away.

That’s right. There was a pillar-like thing in the center of every magic herb field. Complex alchemy runes were carved on the surface, and they kept absorbing the surrounding elements. This was the source of the barrier, and the absorbed elements could also promote the growth of magic plants.

It could only be said that this group of warlocks didn’t know good treasures and actually let these go.

Of course, Eli wouldn’t do the same thing, so he dug out the pillars one by one and threw them into his secret realm, which was just nice for his magic herb field.

There was nothing left after he took all of that away, so Eli was prepared to leave. On the way out, he very considerately threw Kree into the unconscious crowd.

“Sigh, I’m really a good person!” Eli turned and left.

In his eyes, these first-circle warlocks were nothing, so he only knocked them out for a game.

But before he could take a few steps, he suddenly stopped.

He turned around and saw that there was a fence with runes carved on it outside the magical plant garden. There were some runes on it that even Eli didn’t know about.

“I can’t waste it!”

Eli turned around and went back, tearing down all the fences and throwing them into the arcane realm.

It wasn’t until half an hour later, when Eli looked at the magical plant garden that had almost been flattened, that he finally stopped.

“It’s time to go!” Eli turned around and left, instantly removing the spell formation.

…

Outside the spell formation.

Rawls held the map in his hand and looked ahead with a confused expression. Behind him were five to six first-circle Warlocks and more than a dozen apprentices. They were all the allies he had gathered during the time he was inside the secret plane.

“That shouldn’t be the case. This should be the place that Milord was talking about!” Ross rubbed his eyes and looked at the map again to confirm that this was the place that Kratos had mentioned.

But what about the magical plant garden?

Where did it go?

Rawls started to doubt his life. However, all of a sudden, a thin film in the air was broken while another scene appeared in his eyes.

The magical plant garden had appeared!

But something didn’t seem right!

Had the demonic plant garden been razed to the ground? Why was there nothing left? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Rawls took a deep breath.

“My Lord, what do you think is over there?” Suddenly, a Warlock shouted in surprise. Everyone looked over and saw dozens of warlocks piled up in an open space in the distance.

“People of the Blood Alliance?”

The group of people looked at each other and subconsciously took out their weapons.

The magic plant garden was gone, but they were given something else in exchange. The warlocks of Blood Alliance were all points to be harvested on this expedition.

“Kill them.” Rawls also said seriously.

Let’s put the matter of the magical plant aside and kill the enemies first.

…

On the other side, Eli walked and tore down everything along the way. Occasionally, he would encounter apprentices. If they were the White Tower, then he’d just walk away. If they were from Blood Alliance, then he’d bludgeon them.

Eli hadn’t done much, but he still managed to gather many things. The only thing he regretted was that he had yet to find any elemental crystals.

After all, his main goal this time was still the elemental crystals and mage knowledge.

Elemental crystals could allow him to quickly increase his elemental essence conversion, while knowledge was the foundation of his strength.

By relying on his bloodline, he might be able to obtain temporary power, but he was still on the path of a mage. His goal was the pursuit of truth. By grasping the truth, power would naturally follow. Just like that, Eli wandered around the secret realm like he was in a game.

Half an hour later, after turning a corner, Eli’s eyes lit up.

About three hundred meters away, there was a tall building. It was about three stories high, but it took up a lot of space. The shape was like a mage’s Handbook, and in the center was a plaque with the words ” library ” on it.

The library!

Eli pursed his lips. He was tempted.

The lack of wizard knowledge had always been a problem for Eli. Now that there was a complete library in front of him, how could he not be tempted?

However, even though it was a library, it still had its own defensive measures. At this time, on the flat ground in front of the library, seven or eight first circle alchemy dolls were surrounding and attacking a person, and this person was dancing like a butterfly among the attacks, constantly dodging the attacks and constantly looking for opportunities to break through the puppets, but he had not succeeded.

Molin!

Eli had seen this person before. He was one of the leading first circle warlocks in the Blood Alliance, a first circle peak warlock who had fused with the blood of the illusionary butterfly.

Unfortunately, the charm was useless against the alchemy doll, so he was in an awkward situation. He couldn’t attack, nor could he retreat.

But it just so happened that Molin was holding the dolls back for Eli so he could go over directly.

“Ah, he sacrificed himself for others. He’s a good Warlock,” Eli pursed his lips, then headed in the direction of the library.

…

“Damn it, I shouldn’t have come here!”

Molin once again dodged the alchemy doll’s attack and gritted his teeth.

If there had been six first-circle warlocks in front of him, he might have killed them all or left, but these were alchemy dolls. The power of charm was useless in stopping them.

“No, I can’t continue wasting time like this.” Molin pursed his lips and looked around, trying to find a way to escape.

However, he didn’t find any escape. Instead, he saw a person from the corner of his eye.

Molin was stunned. He then saw an unfamiliar man pass by the place where he was fighting the alchemy puppets and then walk toward the library.

“damn it! Stop right there!” Even Molin, who had always been calm, shouted angrily.

He had worked so hard to fight against the alchemy dolls, and this man was picking the fruits of his labor.

But Eli just glanced at him and continued walking, not taking his words to heart at all.

Molin gritted his teeth and dodged another attack. A pair of illusionary wings instantly extended from his back, and a spiritual attack instantly attacked Eli.

He wanted to control this person and then use him as a sacrifice.

But the next second, he was stunned. He saw the man wave his right hand, and then an even larger wave directly blew away Molin’s attack.

“That’s impolite!”

The man turned around and launched a mental attack at him.

The mental attack wasn’t strong, but he was in the middle of the puppet’s attack. This messed up his rhythm, and the puppet’s attacks came from several directions.

“D*mn, don’t hit my bottom.”

“F*ck, it hurts!”

For a moment, Molin was in a dangerous situation, and his body was injured. What made him even more uncomfortable was that the man had already come to the broken door of the library.

He turned around and waved at him, then strode in.

“Damn you!” Molin roared in anger.

However, the puppets didn’t stop attacking, and he had to deal with them.

The grief and indignation in his heart had nowhere to vent.

…

“Is this the library?” he asked.

On the other hand, Eli had already arrived on the first floor of the library.

This was a huge Hall, unlike the Imperial Library of Bryne, where bookshelves were placed. However, something had happened here, and most of the bookshelves had fallen or broken. Most of the bookshelves were empty, and there was a layer of dust.

“Nothing? A wasted trip?” Eli looked at the current state of the library in front of him and raised an eyebrow.

It shouldn’t be…
