221 Spell Formation

“Did he catch up?”

Feeling the hot breath behind her, Vivika breathed a sigh of relief.

She had come here without any prior communication. The risk was actually very great. If Kloss did not catch up, the natural plan would fail, and she might even die faster.

Now that he was here, she didn’t need to worry about this problem anymore. Instead, she had to start thinking about another problem.

!!

“Nikola, I hope you’re really ready!”

Vivika walked through the entrance of the valley and looked at the towering cliffs on both sides. There was no doubt that this was definitely a huge sealed area. Once she entered, there was no chance of regret.

She could already imagine what would happen to her if something went wrong with Nikola.

There was no way out. This was a huge gamble.

If they won, the bloodline tower would turn everything around and continue to stand on this land. If they lost, the bloodline tower would lose everything, and she would lose her life.

“We’re here!”

Suddenly, Vivika looked up and saw that they were not far from the inside of the canyon.

“Vivika, where can you escape to?”

At this time, a cold voice was heard. Feeling the heat behind her, Vivika turned to look. Kloss had turned into a flame behind her and was approaching her.

“Hmph, catch up to me first, then.”

The wings on Vivika’s back suddenly bloomed, increasing her speed. She quickly entered the valley and disappeared from Kloss’ sight.

“Hehe!”

Kloss smiled and also passed through the entrance, entering the valley.

Vivika passed through the entrance and entered the valley.

As soon as she entered the valley, she saw a giant spirit floating in the middle of the valley, looking at her.

“Nikola, don’t tell me you’re alone.”

The green wings carried a large number of elements, and Vivika’s speed slowly decreased. She stopped in front of Nikola, but at this time, her face was extremely serious.

She felt that she might have been deceived.

She looked around, but there was nothing, and she did not see anyone, only Nikola.

“Tower master Vivika, don’t be nervous. Everything has been arranged. My Lord has already set up an ambush. He will make his move at the right time.” Nikola looked at Vivika again and smiled.

This was what Eli had told him. As for when he would come out, he really wasn’t sure.

“Is that so?” Vivika nodded and stood side by side with Nikola.

What he said should be true. She did not believe that Nicholas would joke with his life.

‘But his master shouldn’t be that strong. He shouldn’t be on the same level as Kloss’s third-circle mid-late stage. Otherwise, he could have just fought directly. Why would he need to ambush?’

“You’re acting mysterious!” Vivika gritted her teeth.

It had been so long, but she still hadn’t seen this person. This really made her unhappy. However, he had come to help her. Although she was unhappy, she was still very grateful.

“He’s here!”

Nikola suddenly spoke, and Vivika looked up at the other side of the valley. A fiery red figure had arrived.

“This is a good place!”

Kloss flew in and looked around. The place he had come from was the only entrance, and the rest was blocked-in. This was a good battlefield.

As he got closer, he gradually saw Vivika and the people beside her.

Nikola?

Kloss’ eyes were filled with surprise at first, but then they slowly turned sharp. He looked at the undead in front of him. It was the same person he had seen in Mason’s soul aura.

What was he doing here?

Moreover, from his aura, he was a third-circle mage.

He had walked into a trap!

Was he ambushed?

Kloss suddenly seemed to understand something, but he still couldn’t figure it out. When did these two forces get together? Moreover, Nikola had come here without a sound.

But … So what?

His surprise slowly disappeared, and an even more powerful aura spread out. The flames around him slowly changed from orange to blue, and his eyes were filled with disdain. He looked at Nikola and asked, “Where did you take Mason?”

Vivika was floating on the side, and Nikola was also waiting. Hearing this, he showed an exaggerated smile and said jokingly, “I killed Mason, of course. Can’t you tell? ”

“It really is him?”

Hearing this conversation, Vivika raised her eyebrows. Mason had really been killed by them. Although she had seen the imprint, she had not seen Mason’s body in person. But now, Kloss’ words proved that there was really something wrong with the Earth Dragon Warlock, Mason.

“Ha!”

Kloss didn’t say anything and only snorted softly.

Nikola was speechless.

Did he look down on him that much?

“Since you’re not willing to tell me, I’ll personally break your soul and excavate it.” Kloss stretched out his hand, and dozens of flame Spears formed in front of him, flying toward Nikola in an instant. At the same time, Kloss’ figure approached Vivika, his eyes cold.

“I’ll settle the two of you together today.”

Arrogant!

...

He was too arrogant!

It was as if Kloss didn’t care about the two of them at all, which made Nikola and Vivika’s lips twitch, but they didn’t dare to relax.

Countless dead souls gushed out of Nikola’s body and turned into skulls with gray soul power. They let out sharp sounds and flew toward the flaming spear.

“I’d like to see how big the gap is!”

Nikola watched this scene, but then his mouth opened wide.

The undead skeletons were completely unable to block the flames. The dozen or so flaming spears quickly combined into an even larger spear. The other Spears followed closely behind and directly pierced through. After passing through, only the flames weakened a little, but they still flew toward him at high speed.

“F * ck, f * ck!”

Nikola was about to jump up and shout.

Kloss was much stronger than he had imagined. However, looking at the flames in front of him, he quickly took a deep breath and gritted his teeth. A pure soul power appeared and transformed into a shield.

“Damn it!” Nikola was a little nervous, and he even began to miss the days when he was a mage. Although the dead had advantages, their disadvantages were also obvious.

...

At this moment, the flame spear had already arrived, and it struck the shield with a loud bang. The huge pressure caused the shield to collapse almost. Nikola immediately increased the output of his soul power to stabilize it.

“Damn it. It has only been one attack, but he had already used up one-fifth of my soul power.”

What the hell?

“Vivika’s condition isn’t too good either!” After blocking the attack, he looked in the direction of Vivika.

At this moment, the two of them were fighting at close range. Flames and wind blades were flying everywhere, and the surrounding environment was changing at a rapid speed. One of the wind blades even almost hit Lord Eli’s location.

But it was clear that Vivika was at a complete disadvantage and was no match for him.

“Damn it, Nikola, come help!” Vivika said to Nikola.

“Coming!” Nikola did not hesitate and flew over to aid Vivika.

“Hahaha, weaklings!” Kloss only laughed and attacked.

With Nicolay’s participation, Vivika felt a little more relaxed, but as time passed, they found that they were once again at a disadvantage.

Two against one, they still couldn’t win.

Vivika gritted her teeth and shouted to Nikola, ” use whatever methods you have. We can’t hold on for long.”

In fact, she was using this method to tell the person in hiding to make a move.

But obviously, Nikola had misunderstood it. He nodded, then solemnly took out a blue crystal from his body, and then directly crushed it. The crystal fragments scattered in all directions, shining with a strange color under the sun.

The core of the spell formation in the valley.

Seeing this, more flames appeared around Kloss’ body. He entered a state of alert and looked around vigilantly.

As the crystal shattered, the valley also changed.

Kloss could see that within the entire valley, the walls of the valley were covered in blue runes. Dewdrops appeared in the valley, and spell formations slowly appeared. Kloss could feel that the fire elements in the area were starting to weaken, and even the flames around him had shrunk.

“Almost thirty spell formations?”

Vivika felt the change in the environment and was also stunned.

“How is it? not bad, right?” Nikola shouted at Vivika, who was not far away.

“Uh … It’s not bad.” Vivika was speechless, but she had to admit that it was indeed useful.

At the very least, in an environment filled with water elements, the power of Kloss’ flames was reduced by 30%, which was indeed a significant boost to them.

But… where was Nikola’s master? Why hadn’t he made a move yet?

“Hahahaha!”

Suddenly, a burst of laughter rang out.

The two of them looked over and saw that in the flames, Kloss was holding his stomach and laughing loudly. He only recovered after more than ten seconds. Then, he looked at the two of them with a faint smile and said, “Just this?”

As his smile gradually disappeared, Kloss looked at the two of them. The flames around him started to burn, and a large amount of water vapor rose. In this environment, his aura started to rise again. In the blink of an eye, it had exceeded the level just now and was even 30% stronger than before.

“If that’s all your trump card!”

Kloss raised his head again, but his eyes were cold.

“Then you can die in peace.”
