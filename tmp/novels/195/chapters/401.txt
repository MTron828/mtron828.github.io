402 Eli’s Harvest

A week later, in the Grassi Land.

“Sir, this interspatial ring contains the Mandala Flower that Sir needs!” Glen respectfully presented a ring to Eli.

“Yes.” Eli took the ring and sensed it.

There were many flowers in the ring. They looked like roses, but the petals were colorful and emitted a unique aura. They happened to be the Mandala Flowers that Eli needed.

With this, Eli could advance. Of course, Eli needed to nurture the flowers to the fourth circle. This was very simple.

” Sir, we’ve already set off towards the Akasha family. It’s estimated that we’ll be able to occupy the Akasha family’s territory in half a month. What do you think, sir? ” Glen said respectfully to Eli.

“You can decide on these matters.” Eli shook his head. After solving a problem, he could have some peace for a while.

“Alright, then I’ll take my leave!”

Glen nodded and left the Grassi Land.

Meanwhile, Ely headed to another part of the Grassi Land and quickly arrived at Hill.

“Hill, help me convert 500 years of life force! ” Eli said to Hill.

“Okay, Daddy!” Hill’s tender voice rang out, and at the same time, a tree branch stretched out towards Eli.

Eli skillfully grabbed the branch, and a green light burst out. Eli felt his life force rapidly draining away, and his skin even wrinkled slightly. However, at the other end of the branch, a green Life Source had already condensed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Eli let go of his hand, and the life force he had lost in his body was quickly replenished.

“Thanks, Hill!”

Eli took out a bottle, and the green Life Source immediately turned into a long line and flew inside. When it was all in, he closed the bottle.

“This is what Hill should do!” Hill’s joyful voice sounded as if she was very happy to help Eli.

Eli touched the tree trunk and walked towards the magic herb field in the distance. He planted a large number of Mandala Flowers and poured the Life Essence on one of them. Immediately, the Mandala Flower broke through the zero circle and entered the first ring. Moreover, it continued to grow.

“Another ten days will be enough!”

Eli left with a smile. The next thing to do was wait.

….

Golden Cicada Merchant Association.

At this moment, Conilla silently listened to the Warlock’s description and covered his face.

“Sir, this is what happened!” The Warlock said to Domo.

” You’re saying that Eli first blew up fifteen celestials, including Pavao, and then killed the Radiant Sun Warlock Ma mu while protecting a city? ” After a few seconds, Conilla put down his hand and looked at the Warlock.

“Yes, my lord.” The Warlock nodded.

Hiss!

Conilla gasped.

He had never thought that the war would end in such a way.

This was too ridiculous!

That was fifteen celestials, and there was a peak Radiant Moon and four Radiant Moons!

Isn’t Eli too strong?

” Alright, I underestimated Eli. ” Conilla shook his head. ” Oh, right. I’ll raise the cooperation with the Bloodline Tower to the highest level. From the performance of the Bloodline Tower this time, it appears that they have even greater potential! ”

“Yes, sir!”

The Warlock nodded and left.

“Oh, one more thing. What happened to the head of the Akasha family?” Conilla suddenly asked.

“In the end, he was beaten to death by so many celestials!” The Warlock seemed to have thought of something disgusting and shrugged.

“Alright then!” Conilla also smiled.

It was really interesting that the head of a third-grade force died just like that!

…..

Charm Mansion!

Lobelia and Liliana had an in-depth conversation.

” Anna, your relationship with Eli isn’t bad, right? This is crucial for the communication between our two forces! ” said Lobelia.

“Yes, I understand, Teacher.” Liliana nodded.

She had only recently learned of the victory of the war.

However, when she finished reading the message, she almost thought that it was a mistake. The main thing was that it was too ridiculous.

Eli had actually defeated the Akasha Family by himself. What kind of strength was this?!

” Oh, right, Anna, you gave the information to Eli for free this time. It’s not a bad thing. I have to praise you. ” Lobelia suddenly said.

Liliana nodded again. She felt lucky.

She would only be praised if Eli won. If she lost, she would have to bear the consequences. In fact, she shouldn’t have given the Bloodline Tower information of that level, but she still gave it to them without hesitation.

She was already prepared to accept her punishment, but who would have thought that things would turn out like this?

” I understand what you’re thinking, but it’s good this way. I’ve also reported it to my superiors. In the future, you’ll be responsible for Eli. Also, forget about the matter of you using your resources to get me to help Eli. After this, you should be able to save enough resources for your breakthrough. ” Lobelia suddenly said.

“Ah! Thank you, teacher.” Liliana exclaimed. There were too many surprises this time.

“Hmph, you better remember to rope in your lover. If you don’t work hard, I’ll have to intervene personally!” said Lobelia teasingly.

...

“Teacher!”

…

Swamps of Gloom!

In the castle!

“The Akasha Family is gone? Ma Mu is dead too?” Jerre silently put down the letter and took a deep breath.

In the next second, an intense aura suddenly erupted. The table in front of him instantly split into four or five pieces. Everything in the surroundings flew in all directions and smashed heavily into the wall before shattering into pieces.

“Eli!”

Jerre shouted out the name angrily.

This was the second time he had heard this name. Every time, this Warlock would always bring him great trouble.

The last time, Eli had crushed the plans of the Manticore Family with the help of the Amina Family. This time, he had shattered their plans, causing them to lose a powerful subsidiary force and the death of a Radiant Sun-level combat force.

“No. Maybe Eli decimated the Manticore Family alone too.” Jesse suddenly realized this problem.

...

That’s right!

Why would the Amina Family participate in their matters for no reason? It was definitely because of Eli!

Too sinister!

A Radiant Sun Warlock was pretending to be a Radiant Moon Warlock. How could he?

” Maybe he was the one who sold the information about our Bloodline cultivation Land too.

“It looks like I’ll have to do this myself.” Jesse gritted his teeth.

Ma Mu was equivalent to the Radiant Sun, who had just advanced.

However, the Eight-Armed Naga was the strongest second-class force and had four Radiant Suns. Even if one died, there would still be three.

Jesse felt the powerful bloodline of the Radiant Sun in his body and felt much more at ease.

Eli, he would definitely kill this guy.

” But before that, I have to deal with the Holy Tower and a few other second-class forces first. It seems that I have to question the Heart of Abyss. It was because I listened to their plan that everything became like this! ”

Jesse gritted his teeth and seemed to be very unhappy!
