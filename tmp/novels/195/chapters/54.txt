55 On The Way

There was a carriage at the rear of the group.

When the coachman heard the order, he also directed the horse to move forward, and a slight bump was transmitted into the carriage.

“Eli, this is a tour or an exchange. When we reach the Lorraine kingdom, you have to be careful. We’re representing the library. ” In the carriage, Clement sat on one side of the carriage and spoke to the person opposite him.

The carriage wasn’t big, but there weren’t many people in it either. There were only two people, eli and scholar clement.

Considering that the journey would take a long time, there were not many people in each carriage. As the representation from the library, the two of them occupied one carriage.

“I understand!” Eli nodded and couldn’t help but look at clement, who was opposite him.

At this time, scholar Clement was dressed in his best attire. Not only had he changed into a new scholar’s uniform, but his beard had also been carefully trimmed. He was in good condition.

“Teacher, I’ve never seen you so formal before.” Eli laughed and teased.

” hmph, what do you know? This is the empire’s recognition of me, so I naturally have to be more serious. ” Clement cast a glance at Eli in annoyance.

Eli nodded, not bearing to expose the truth of the matter.

The two of them chatted.

“Oh, right, I saw scholar Hila coming to the library the day before yesterday. Do you know what she was there for? ” Clement suddenly asked, as if he had thought of something.

“Hila? I don’t know.” Eli shook his head.

That day, he had only seen a Pretty Woman who was a little stupid, but he had not seen Hila.

“Oh!”

Clement also asked casually, but there was no answer, so the two fell silent again.

Eli wouldn’t try to start a conversation, so he looked out of the car.

The small window of the carriage shone on Jun Lin, but at this moment, the city was getting smaller and smaller in Eli’s eyes. This meant that they were getting further and further away from the city.

It had been eight years, but he was still in the same city. This was the first time he had left this place.

“This world is really peaceful!” The sadness only lasted for a moment before he turned his attention to other aspects.

As the carriage advanced, the trees on both sides gradually increased. In the midst of the lush greenery, Eli could even see the wild beasts that were spying on them from the forest.

If it weren’t for the fact that there were soldiers and Knights on both sides of the convoy, Eli seriously suspected that a wild beast would have charged straight at them.

Traveling far was never a simple matter, especially a long-distance trip across countries.

In fact, most of the people in the empire would probably live and die wherever they were born. Very few people would choose to leave the safety of their neighborhood.

Therefore, the host must have some ability to be able to escape to Jun Lin from some other places. Otherwise, he would have died on the way.

The convoy continued on until nighttime and finally stopped at a large patch of grass.

The coachmen had the horses gnaw on the grass on the ground.

Meanwhile, Eli and his teacher came down from the carriage to stretch their muscles.

“Comfortable!” Eli spread his arms and stretched them out.

Although he could even lie down and sleep in the carriage, Eli still preferred the feeling of nature.

Looking at the surrounding jungle, Eli decided to take a look around and broaden his understanding of this world.

“Eli, there’s a chef in the convoy cooking. if you’re hungry, you can go over and have some. I’ll go visit grand scholar colt. ” Clement said to Eli. ” oh, and don’t stray too far from the convoy. It’s dangerous outside. ”

Other than clement, there were naturally other people in the library, and grand scholar colt was the highest-ranking person.

“I understand!” eli nodded.

But when he saw that scholar Clement had gone in the other direction, he immediately went to the forest.

Understanding the advice was one thing, but whether or not he would listen was another.

“Don’t get too far away from the convoy. The jungle is very dangerous. ” Eli met a patrolling team of knights, and one of them reminded him.

“Yes, I won’t be too far away.” eli nodded as well, accepting his kindness.

“Hey, are you Eli?”

The patrolling team was made up of three people. Someone suddenly said.

“And you are?” eli looked at the knight who spoke, but because he was wearing a helmet, he could not recognize him.

As he spoke, the knight took off his helmet, revealing a red-haired man with a determined face. Eli blinked and remembered. ‘wasn’t this the man who tried to tame the horse five years ago?

‘What is his name again?’

“I’m Andre!” After more than five years, the man had obviously matured a lot, and his body also exuded the aura of an intermediate Knight.

“Of course, Andre. I remember you from five years ago, ” Eli greeted him with a smile.

“Hey, you’re Eli!” At this moment, the two knights beside Andre also said curiously.

???

‘Do I know that many knights?’

“Heh, Eli, you’re very famous in the knight academy. Five years ago, because of you, we added many more horsemanship classes, and the price was that we lost a day of rest every week. This made you very famous among the students. ” Andre couldn’t help but laugh.

Eli, “...” No wonder so many knights knew him. There must be a lot of people secretly scolding him.

“That’s right. Back then, I was scolding Eli and Andre while I was in class. But fortunately, we were one year away from graduation, so I felt fine. Those who had been in school for two or three years were the ones who really felt terrible.” One of the Knights chuckled.

Eli could only smile in agreement.

He really didn’t know that there was such a thing. Poor Knights in training.

“But the most miserable one is still Andre. He’s been ambushed and hazed quite a few times!” Another Knight added.

“Hey, don’t tell anyone about this!” Hearing this, Andre’s eyes widened. This was his dark history.

It was reasonable to think about it this way. as the person who lost to Eli, Andre must have had an unforgettable year in the academy.

“Okay, let’s talk next time. We still have to patrol.” Andre hurriedly pulled a few of them away. He didn’t want his shameless history to be exposed.

Looking at their backs as they left, Eli thought to himself that if he were to meet any students from the Knight Academy in the future, he would just use Herman’s name.

There was a risk of being beaten if he used his name.

“Eh? This is a seven-petaled flower, right? ”

After Andre and the others left, Eli continued walking toward the forest.

Suddenly, eli saw a small beige flower swaying in the wind in the grass.

The seven-petaled flower was a precious supplementary ingredient for potions. As it was considered a useless plant in the empire, it was very difficult to find. Even eli only had a few.

But today, he actually encountered one just as he wandered about.

“The seven-petaled flower usually grows in large patches. There must be more around here. ” something came to his mind, and his eyes lit up. He passed through the grass and entered the woods. In an open space not far away, a pile of beige flowers grew.

“Not bad!” Eli’s eyes lit up. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

With these seven-petaled flowers, the trip was already worth it.

This might be a good sign too.
