Chapter 2: Test

Translator: Lonelytree

Immortality?

It sounded ridiculous.

Since ancient times, countless kings and even the people from Earth tirelessly pursued a longer life, using all sorts of methods.

But in the end, Eli achieved this goal so easily.

Many thoughts flashed through Eli’s mind.

Now that he had just transmigrated, his understanding of this world was limited to the memories of his original host. However, just from those, he already knew that this world was completely different from Earth.

Whether it was social rules or social systems, they were all quite cruel to commoners. Knights were above ordinary people, and nobles were above most people.

There was danger everywhere.

Since that was the case, he might as well follow the original host’s life path and work in the library first, understanding this world while trying to master the book’s extraordinary powers.

This should be the safest plan.

‘I didn’t want to be so laid-back, but this is what I have to do to survive in this world.’ He sighed.

“I’ve made up my mind. I’ll slowly develop in the library for a few decades before I leave it.”

Eli took a deep breath and immediately made a decision.

Although the period of development was a little long, he was immortal!

A few decades would pass by quickly.

Suddenly, a blinding ray of sunlight shone into Eli’s eyes.

Eli turned his head and saw a glimmer of light outside the window, and the sun was already peeking out slightly.

It was dawn.

...

Eli walked out of the house.

The piercing sunlight made him cover his eyes. It was only a few seconds later that he regained his sight.

After confirming the direction, Eli walked towards the library in his memory while observing his surroundings.

He appeared to be in the slums. Most of the buildings were made of stone and wood, looking very dilapidated and low. The roads were also very worn out, and disgusting things could often be seen.

The pedestrians on both sides of the road were also wearing rough linen clothes. Most of them had blue or black eyes, which were the main eye colors of the Byrne Empire. Most of their hair was brown, black, and gold.

On the other hand, Eli was wearing a coarse Linen short-sleeved shirt and shoes. The original host has no property. Fortunately, he had found a job as a librarian. Otherwise, even if Eli had transmigrated, he wouldn’t know how to survive.

Coming from a bustling modern city to a backward and extraordinary medieval world, not many people could adapt quickly, not even Eli. This was also why he chose to continue working at the library.

Of course, there was another more important reason, and that was poverty.

Money was just as important in this world. It was the guarantee of survival.

After passing through the slums, Eli entered the urban area.

As soon as he entered the city, the scenery suddenly changed.

Whether it was the buildings or the pedestrians, there was a huge difference between this area and the slums. It could even be said that it was two different worlds.

Soon, Eli, who had passed through a few streets, arrived at his destination.

He looked up.

In front of him was a tall building.

The pure white stone reflected the sun and emitted a soft light. The oval dome was raised, and the outer wall was carefully carved with beautiful sculptures, looking very magnificent.

This was the Imperial Library.

Eli took a deep breath, then entered through a small door on the side.

After passing through a long corridor, Eli came to a small room. He changed into a dark red waistcoat that looked like a waiter’s, as well as a pair of black pants. It was the work uniform of the library.

Walking out of the room, Eli walked into the library.

Eli looked up. There was a huge glass window on the top floor. At this moment, the faint sunlight shone in, reflecting all kinds of beautiful colors. All kinds of epic scenes were depicted around it.

There were three levels below, and they were made of a very precious kind of wood in the Empire. The bookshelves were filled with all kinds of books.

“This will be my workplace from now on!”

Eli looked at the library. It was still closed, so he needed to sort out the books first.

Eli had been trained before, so he was very familiar with the process.

As he organized his books, Eli was also thinking about the future.

Naturally, he had to be patient.

However, how to be patient was another problem.

After all, this was a magical world. Although he had the power of immortality, he did not have the power to protect it. Even a trainee knight or a stronger ordinary person could easily kill him.

“So, I need a certain amount of power.” Eli put a book on the shelf and thought about how to obtain power.

At present, the Empire was promoting the knights.

Cultivating to be a Knight was a good choice.

However, Eli was not a knight. Knight’s law was usually passed down from generation to generation among the nobles. This meant that knights were generally passed down through generations too. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He could either make a contribution to the nobles or receive the reward of practicing the Knight’s law, or he could join an organization like the Army. They might provide Knight’s law, but these were not suitable for the current Eli.

Therefore, Eli rejected this path, and the only path left was to become a mage.

According to the title page, the author of the book seemed to look down on knights, calling them low-level, weak, and ignorant. Did that mean that mages were stronger than knights?

Well, Eli wasn’t really given a choice.

In fact, compared to the Knight’s training which required a large number of herbs and even money, it seemed that the mage’s method, which only required meditation at the beginning, was more suitable for him.

However, the book warned that he would need a lot of money later in his training.

After all, how could a mage’s consumption be lower than a knight’s?

“Eli, what are you thinking about!!”

Suddenly, a voice was heard. Eli turned around and saw Kart, who was also wearing a vest.

He had a head of golden hair, and his eyes were the common blue. In his memory, he was also one of the librarians.

It was said that his grandfather was once a Baron, but he committed a crime and his family was stripped of their noble status. After that, he came here.

“I’m fine. It’s just that I’m a little depressed when I think about how there are so many books here, but I haven’t read many of them.” Eli wasn’t very familiar with Kart, so he decided to blow him off.

Kart ran his fingers through her golden hair, and his gaze stopped on the bookshelf for a few seconds. Then, he turned to Elie and nodded in agreement. “Indeed, I haven’t read many books either.”

Just as Elie was about to reply, she heard Kate suddenly pause, then say, “I’ve only read a few hundred books!”

Eli was speechless.

He was prepared to reply with a casual sentence, but Kart followed it up with that. How was Eli supposed to respond?

Although there didn’t seem to be a problem with what Kart said, Eli still felt dwarfed.

However, in his memory, Kart was always like this. He always had a sense of superiority. It wasn’t that he looked down on others, but he was simply arrogant. He was like the valedictorian on Earth.

“Kart, I suggest you don’t talk like that.” In the end, Eli couldn’t help but advise him.

“What do you mean?” Kart sounded doubtful as if he didn’t understand what Eli meant.

“What I mean is, you should speak properly!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

“How is the way I speak not proper?” Kart was confused.

He looked at Eli as if he thought of something and continued, “How are your preparations for the test three months from now? I heard that only two of the new librarians could stay for the test this time. The rest will have to leave.”

Test?

What test?

Upon hearing this, Eli was a little stunned.
