Chapter 47: She Loves Me

Herman’s love story started a month ago.

He ended a busy day of work and seemed to feel a little bored, so he went to the bar alone to drink some wine. It was there that he met the ” lady of his destiny, ” Windsor.

In Herman’s description, Windsor was a beautiful girl with long, maroon hair, a slim and graceful body, and liked to wear sexy clothes. Her eyes were always filled with love for Herman.

Of course, the last message was based on Herman’s own feelings.

The two of them met in a tavern and hit it off. That night, Herman had a sweet night, and they promised each other that they would have a good time in the future.

Over the next month, Herman and the girl would meet every few days, and Herman would always be generous with Windsor and spend all kinds of money.

During this process, Herman also gradually learned the girl’s identity.

According to Windsor, she was from a neighboring country. Because of the war between the feudal lords, she fled her hometown. Due to an accident, she and her brother were separated from their family, and the two of them had wandered all the way here.

Then, she met Herman, the man she could trust with everything she had.

His money had been spent during this period.

“Eli, maybe this is what love is.” After saying that, Herman looked at Eli with a sweet expression.

“Are you sure she really loves you?” eli asked with a strange expression.

Why did he smell a strong sense of suspicion in this story?

He met his true love at the bar, a beautiful woman, fell in love at first sight, promised a lifetime of love, and had a sappy background.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he was embarrassed, even Eli felt like he would be clapping. What a beautiful love story!

He had spent twenty to thirty gold tars a month.

According to the purchasing power of this world, Herman spent about a million dollars a month on less than ten dates.

“I think you might have met a scammer!” Eli said directly. He felt that it was better to remind Herman as soon as possible.

“A scammer? How is that possible?” hearing what eli said, Herman immediately jumped up and said in a loud voice, ” it’s true love between us. How could a beautiful girl like Windsor lie to me?

“you haven’t experienced it, but I’m sure that this is true love, a beautiful love. Eli, although you’re my best friend, I won’t allow you to slander Windsor like this. She’s a good girl.” Herman huffed and said quickly.

“No, no, no, calm down first.” Eli didn’t expect Herman to have such a huge reaction.

However, thinking about it, it made sense. This kid was only 24 years old and had never been in a relationship.

“Hmph!” Herman was panting heavily. Then he said, ” “If she didn’t really love me, why would she spend time with me? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“If she didn’t really love me, why would she say ‘dear’ to me?

“If she didn’t really love me, why would she go to the concert with me?”

Eli blinked his eyes. ‘Does someone have to be in true love with you just because they have done these things?

‘Herman, you’re too naive.’

“Alright, I’ll lend you some money, but I have a request.” Knowing that he couldn’t persuade him, Eli said.

“Okay, go ahead,” Herman replied.

“I can lend you some money, but since you’ve decided to live together with her in the future, I think teacher and I should at least meet her,” Eli said helplessly.

As Herman’s junior, Eli felt that he had to show some concern for his senior.

If it was really a scam, then he could be prepared in advance. Although Herman’s money was gone, his father had left him a house worth almost a hundred gold tars.

“uh, but Windsor said that she doesn’t want to see anyone until our relationship reaches a certain level.” Herman was conflicted.

“if she’s really that determined to be with you, shouldn’t she meet your friends and mentor? What’s there to be conflicted about? I think teacher will be very happy too.” Eli asked.

As if convinced by Eli, Herman nodded and said, “alright, I’ll go and ask.”

“yes.” eli nodded, then took out a money bag from his pocket and gave three gold tars to Herman.

“Thanks, eli.” after receiving the money, Herman finally smiled and said, ” don’t worry, Eli. I’ll definitely talk to Windsor about this.

“Also, don’t be so flustered all the time. I’m very smart, How could I be deceived? Besides, Windsor is so gentle and sweet.”

“Go, go, go. Work hard.”

Seeing that Herman still had the urge to continue, Eli left immediately.

…

After work in the afternoon, Eli didn’t leave right away. Instead, he went to the second floor, ready to talk to the teacher about Herman’s problem.

Eli knocked.

“Come in!” A voice came from inside the door.

Eli walked in. at this time, Scholar Clement was still working.

“Oh, Eli, what’s the matter? I don’t usually see you after work, so why did you come to me today?” compared to the changes in Eli and Herman, scholar clement didn’t change much. The only obvious change was that there were more wrinkles on his face, and his hair had turned white.

” uh, teacher, it’s like this, Herman…” Eli said directly.

After hearing this, scholar clement also put down his pen, and his expression became serious.

As expected, the teacher also felt that something was wrong!

Seeing scholar clement’s reaction, Eli nodded. This meant that he was an old man and had some experience.

“You’re right. There’s something wrong with this matter.” scholar clement stood up.

” Teacher, do you also think that Herman was tricked? ” eli said directly, but before he could finish, he heard clement say, “something’s not right. If Windsor is really that beautiful, why would she like Herman?

“Something’s very wrong.”

Eli, ‘teacher, is this what you think?’

“teacher, I’m saying, is it possible that Windsor is a scammer? ” Eli said, speechless.

“Scammer?” Clement frowned as if he had never thought about this.

” Well, I’ve arranged to meet them. We’ll talk about it when the time comes. After all, Herman’s a little silly, so it’s better to confirm it. ” Eli added.

“That makes sense. That’s what I was actually thinking just now.” Clement nodded in agreement. “Well, that’s it then. We’ll just have to meet them when the time comes.”

“Alright, I’ll take my leave then, teacher.” eli left immediately.

He had worked overtime for more than ten minutes for Herman.

He was such a good junior.

…

At the same time, at the wooden barrel bar.

In a single room.

“Windsor, I think we’re pretty stable in our relationship. I’d like to arrange for you to meet my teacher and junior so that we can have a chat.” Herman was sitting by the bed, holding a woman’s hand.

The woman had maroon hair and was wearing thin clothes. She looked very sexy. She was snuggling in Herman’s arms like a delicate little bird.

However, when she heard Herman’s words, she was obviously stunned. She thought for a moment and said in a flirtatious way, “Sure, as long as you like it, I’m fine with anything.”

“Hehe, Windsor, you’re the best.” Herman could feel the softness of Windsor’s body, and he couldn’t help but snicker. He held Windsor in his arms and seemed ready to do something.

“Don’t be like this. I’m not feeling well today.” Windsor sensed Herman’s intentions, so she quietly let go of Herman’s hand and said.

“Well, alright then.” Herman was also stunned, but he nodded.

“I want to have a good rest today. You should go first. It’ll be too late if you don’t.” Windsor continued to act coquettishly.

“Alright. Oh, right, this is the perfume you wanted!” Herman stood up and took out the perfume he had bought in advance.

“Wow, I love you the most.” Upon seeing the perfume, Windsor’s eyes lit up, and she gave Herman a big hug.

“Hehe, it’s what I should do. I’ll take my leave first. ” Herman chuckled.

After the hug, Herman left.

As soon as Herman left, Windsor’s smile disappeared.

She walked to the wall and knocked on the wooden wall.

A few seconds later, the door opened, and a man walked in.

He was very tall and strong. Even though he was only wearing a long robe with long sleeves, one could feel the explosive muscles under his clothes.

Upon seeing the man enter, Windsor immediately walked over and hugged the man’s arm. “David, this silly boy is in so deep. We can leave once we sell the proof of his house. But there’s one more thing, his teacher wants to see me. ”

“Yes, that’s normal. When the time comes, if you act well, there shouldn’t be any problems. Don’t worry, even if something happens, with my strength as a high-level Knight. I can solve everything.” the man named David said, a fierce light flashing in his eyes.

“Yes.” Windsor caressed David’s chest and said charmingly, ” Oh, right, you’re my big brother now. I shouldn’t be calling you by your name. “then, brother, do you want to take good care of your sister?”

Windsor raised her head and looked at David.

There was no response.

However, an arm had already picked up Windsor and walked towards the bed.

…

At the same time, outside the tavern.

Herman looked at the tavern behind him and left in satisfaction.

She was worried that he would be home too late.

As expected, Windsor loved her.
