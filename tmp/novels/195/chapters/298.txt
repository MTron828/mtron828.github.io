299 Luo Ye Leaves

On the battlefield.

Luo ye took the lead and fought dozens of mechanical figures alone. Each of these dolls had the power of a late-stage third-circle warlock.

Another round of attacks came, and Luo ye repelled the puppets again.

“This won’t do!”

He looked around with a frown. They were being suppressed.

Since that was the case, he had to use other means.

Thinking of this, Luo ye took a deep breath and then said loudly, “Everyone, retreat immediately. Leave this to me!”

His eyes were determined, and a bright red mark slowly appeared on his forehead. The moment it appeared, everyone felt a burning aura.

Luo ye was going to use a powerful spell!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s eyes widened. Regardless of whether they were injured or not, they quickly retreated from the area. The mechanical dolls did not chase after them but just looked at Luo ye.

“Sigh, the bloodline imprint that teacher gave me requires not only a large amount of bloodline power but also requires some blood to use. It’s a bit of a waste!”

Luo ye took a deep breath as he watched everyone retreat.

A layer of dark purple flames gradually wrapped around his body.

His body also gradually rose into the air. Although runes appeared around him, the flames emitted by Luo ye were too strong. In just a few hits, the runes were shattered one by one.

He flew into the sky.

“If that’s the case, then let’s end this!” Luo ye’s aura had completely surpassed his third circle level.

He looked down calmly. With a point of his finger, a flame appeared. Like a drop of water, it dripped onto the ground!

It was like raindrops falling on the surface of the water.

A layer of flaming carpet appeared in an instant, and it was dark purple in color. It spread in all directions, and in the blink of an eye, it swept past many mechanical objects, the Mage tower, and the surrounding forest!

It covered a total of seven to eight kilometers.

The flame looked soft and weak, but when it passed through everything, everything rapidly changed and disappeared in this gentleness.

The mechanical creations turned into molten iron and all kinds of precious liquids, while the plants disappeared as calmly. There were even a few companions who didn’t manage to escape in time and disappeared before they could make a sound.

This process only lasted for a few seconds.

Everything returned to normal.

The area within seven to eight kilometers had been turned into scorched land.

Luo ye also spat out a mouthful of blood, and the mark on his forehead gradually faded until it disappeared!

He had used up a precious trump card and was also injured quite badly.

It was still too early for him to use the power of the celestial!

But it was worth it.

He looked at the wizard Tower in the distance. The flames swept past, but the Tower was not affected.

“This time, I might really have some rewards!” He took a deep breath.

The fact that he didn’t melt in the flames of a celestial already showed that he was extraordinary.

He slowly flew towards the Tower and landed.

When he arrived in front of the Mage Tower, a smooth magic door opened.

Luo ye smiled and walked in.

Especially when he saw the box on the ground, he burst out laughing like never before.

“I found it!”

..

“Is this the power of a celestial?”

At the entrance of the secret realm, Eli sighed as he watched the flames disappear.

This was also the reason why he had not taken the initiative to attack Luo ye.

How could a genius not have any means of protection?

He probably couldn’t stop this kind of flame.

“However, I’m taking the item!” Eli sensed the box in his ring and smiled.

He looked at the secret realm and walked out.

..

Three days later.

As the cloud whale in the sky let out a cry, the clouds and mist in the sky began to disperse.

The huge creature had already left the castle with Luo ye and the others.

On the ground, Eli saw this scene and turned around to return to the city of the Holy tower. Udo followed closely behind him.

“My Lord, it’s over?” Udo was extremely shocked.

“Right, it’s over!” Eli smiled.

Ever since Luo ye returned, he had been looking for an expert in mechanics. However, after being told that there was no one here, he immediately decided to leave and return to the central continent.

As for what happened to Hall, they didn’t find out in the end.

...

Because the evidence had completely disappeared under Luo ye’s flames, it had become an unsolved case.

As for Eli, he couldn’t wait to activate the mechanical head!

However, it was quite interesting.

Eli turned his head to look at the cloud whale that was leaving in the sky, thinking about the story just now.

Luo ye took his hand and gave him a token.

He told Eli to come to find him when he comes to the central continent in the future.

He seemed to be very grateful to Eli. Of course, this might have something to do with Eli solving the curse problem for them after Luo ye came out. Luo ye was very happy, and he was almost going to become sworn brothers with Eli!

“I look forward to our next meeting.”

Eli shook his head. He did not know when they would meet again.

It could be five hundred years or even a thousand years later.

“I hope he can wait.”

..

Then, he calmed down again.

Eli was preparing to try to activate the mechanical head.

He wanted to see what this thing was.

With this in mind, Eli sped up and headed back to the Tower.

Behind him, Udo had a face full of admiration.

In the distance, the spy who belonged to the hourglass of time transmitted what he had heard back to Sir Anderson.

‘I hope Sir can make sense of this. This is too confusing.’

..

“Herman, you’ll always be my good friend.

“In the future, as long as you come to the Holy tower, I will give you the best treatment.

“Remember, this is the promise of me, Luo Ye, the future celestial of the Holy tower!”

In the room, the cup in Anderson’s hand fell to the ground, making a crisp sound.

At this moment, his face was dazed. He couldn’t imagine it at all.

What had happened?

Why was it like this?

Wasn’t the Holy tower destroyed by Herman?

Not only did Luo ye, the absolute direct descendant of the Holy tower, not say anything, but he was also so friendly to Herman. This was completely different from what he had expected!

Anderson sighed, knowing that their hopes for the Holy tower headquarters to destroy Herman had failed.

He sighed, but suddenly, a crystal ball in the distance suddenly shook!

The crystal ball was in the corner of the table as if it had not been used for many years. However, it was suddenly emitting a weak light, which meant that there was news.

Anderson’s eyes widened, and his body began to tremble as if he could not believe it.

He then found out who was on the other end of the crystal ball!

Could it be …

He quickly went to the crystal ball and sensed it.

A piece of information was transmitted into his mind.

“Prepare a large amount of blood!”

Anderson took a deep breath and was immediately overjoyed.

His lord was awake!

..

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

In the mage Tower.

A mechanical head was placed on a mahogany table, and in front of it was Eli.

However, he was currently holding various tools in his hands as he repaired the mechanical head!

As Eli gently repaired the final part of the mechanical head …

The ordinary mechanical head on the table suddenly emitted an inexplicable force field, sending all the metal parts around it flying in all directions.

Eli watched this scene calmly.

He ignored the destroyed environment around him and focused on the mechanical head!

A blue light began to glow in the mechanical head’s eyes.

He was awake!
