272 Spell Formation

The war started earlier than Eli had expected, but the general timing was not too far off.

Naturally, the bloodline tower had anticipated the war. As a result, when the war arrived, the various departments of the bloodline tower worked like gears to play their roles.

The logistics and war reserves were all ready.

Soon, the first round of the two forces’ clash was at the Silver Moon Valley, the border between the bloodline tower and the Holy tower, and the first round of war broke out.

The result of the war was a tie.

The Holy tower, which had been weakened several times, didn’t show a higher combat power than the bloodline tower, while the rapidly expanding bloodline tower showed an extremely high fighting spirit.

The war in Silvermoon Valley happened every day, and both sides lost warlocks. However, no one backed down because everyone knew that no matter which side it was, there was no chance of backing down.

But in fact, the Holy tower was at a disadvantage in this situation.

As Silvermoon Valley was closer to the bloodline tower, the Holy tower’s resources and manpower were dispatched much faster than the bloodline tower’s. The Holy tower’s losses were much greater than the bloodline tower.

And there was one that was disadvantageous to the Holy tower.

That was Nikola.

War was not a good thing for warlocks, but for Nikola, it was a feast. After only a year on the battlefield, his strength had reached the limit of the third circle, and he had a large number of spirits under his command.

The Holy tower was very troubled. Warlocks were good at physical attacks, but not every Warlock had the ability to resist the undead, which made their losses even more severe.

As time passed, the bloodline tower actually began to gain the upper hand slowly!

However, everyone knew that the hourglass of time behind the Holy tower would not allow this.

The hourglass of time, which contained a large number of relics from the mage world, would definitely make new moves. At that time, the situation on the battlefield would be hard to say.

Eli understood that too, but he was no longer in the mood to care about that.

He had returned to the irises’ encampment.

There were two reasons.

One was that from the warlock’s mouth, Eli knew how powerful the time hourglass was. He felt that he needed some time to develop.

Secondly, his spiritual power was about to reach the standard to break through to the late stage of the third circle.

..

Among the iris flowers.

After giving Nina some simple instructions, Eli began a new round of seclusion.

Two years later.

With a loud boom, a huge elemental fluctuation flashed.

All the Warlocks raised their heads and looked in one direction. They were all shocked.

Such a powerful aura, much stronger than an ordinary third-circle warlock. They actually had such a powerful sorcerer in the iris flowers?

Half a day later, Eli walked out of the Tower.

“I’ve finally broken through!”

Standing in front of the Tower, Eli took a deep breath.

Compared to before, his current state had undergone a huge change.

His magic power was more abundant, and his bloodline burst was more powerful. His initial estimation was that he could absorb about a hundred times the number of elements in his body, which completely surpassed that of an ordinary third-circle warlock!

And he had just broken through to the late stage!

Eli was looking forward to what level he would be able to reach the limit of the third ring!

“No, there’s still a half-step celestial in the hourglass. I still need to develop!” Eli shook his head.

The Warlock from last time seemed to be a core member of Situ, so he knew a lot of things. Not long ago, he had gone to a place to collect a dead Soul Flower for Situ, so he also knew about Situ’s trump card, Klay!

A third-circle warlock who failed to reach the celestial realm!

Eli took out his die and asked, “Do I have the ability to suppress this half-step celestial?”

His life force was disappearing bit by bit, and in the blink of an eye, he had disappeared for about a hundred years. This was the time when Eli’s prophecy had consumed the most life force. It seemed like this person was indeed very strong!

The die slowly turned and only stopped after a few minutes.

“Hiss, so strong!” Eli took a deep breath.

There was a fundamental difference between the third-circle warlock and a celestial.

Since he had failed to break through, it meant that he still was in the third circle. At most, he would only be able to strengthen his third circle a little or perhaps gain a special ability. It was impossible for him to reach the celestial level truly.

He only had a 12-point winning rate!

“it’s too dangerous. It’s too dangerous. I need to develop for a few more decades!” Eli shook his head.

Fighting at the same level was already not in line with his principles. If there was still a possibility of failure, there was no need to fight. After all, time was on his side.

Wait until he reaches the limit of the third circle!

“I’ll take it slow, but I don’t know how Vivika is doing now!”

As Eli was thinking, a person had already appeared in her line of sight.

“My Lord, you’ve broken through?” Nina looked at Eli and asked curiously.

Eli nodded. Nina was the daughter of Catarina’s grandson. She was now a second circle mage and was in charge of the iris flower faction!

“My lord is really too strong!” Nina sighed.

...

She was the only one in the entire irises’ campsite who knew of her Lord’s identity!

You knew that Eli could defeat Sergei, who was at the limit of the third circle before he broke through.

Now that he had broken through again, he didn’t know how strong he was!

“Oh, right. How’s the situation with the Holy tower and the bloodline tower? ” Eli asked.

As the largest Mage camp on the West Coast, the irises’ influence was spread throughout most of the West Coast. Although they were in the dark, they still had their own channels of information.

“Everything is normal in the war!” Nina said, then added, “However, it seems that a large number of airships from the North have entered the North of the Holy tower. They seem to be transporting a lot of things, but I don’t know what they are!”

“Airships? Transport?” Eli frowned.

The hourglass of time had inherited many things from the wizard era. Perhaps there really was something that could change this situation, but Eli was not in a hurry.

Just wait!

Sooner or later, he would find out what they were transporting!

There were no secrets before time!

...

After asking a few more questions, Eli returned to the Wizard Tower.

..

In the blink of an eye, a year had passed!

Eli also knew what the hourglass was transporting!

A spell formation!

A large number of spell formations!

It was a very common thing in war in the past. By drawing on the mental strength of the mages, and then working together, they would burst out with more powerful energy.

Although it was a relic of the Mage era, and although it could draw on the mental force, it was still a significant boost to the warlocks of the Holy tower. This allowed them to gradually gain the upper hand on the battlefield!

After understanding the situation, Eli returned to the Tower in silence. He was speechless that the warlocks were using the mages’ spell formation.

If that was the case, he might as well create some spell formations that could activate a Warlock’s bloodline.

Did they really think that there were no more mages in this world?

It was time to let this group of warlocks see the truth!

Even if he didn’t go, it didn’t mean that he couldn’t do anything. In the past, when the White Tower defeated the Alliance of ten thousand blood, he became a representative just by relying on the virus!

As for whether or not someone would come to retrieve the spell formation he had created, Eli was not worried.

Vivika will come for him!

In at most three years, Vivika would definitely come to find him.

..

Two years later.

Nina knocked on Eli’s door.

“My Lord, lady Vivika has come to visit!”

The door opened, and an interspatial ring was thrown out. At the same time, Eli’s voice rang out, “Give this to Vivika!”
