573 The Battle of the Three Great Sea Race Sovereigns

Southern Region!

The Central Continent was the most prosperous region in the Central Region because it had vast land, precious bloodline resources, and, most importantly, it was adjacent to the Endless Sea!

In the past, the Endless Sea had brought a lot of resources to the Warlocks here. Therefore, two top bloodline families were born here, the Sea Shark Family and the Sea Dragon Family.

However, at this moment, the two family heads could not help but look worried.

They were at the edge of the coast. Looking down, they could see a defensive line that was hundreds of meters tall and tens of thousands of kilometers long. There were millions of Warlocks.

Below the defense line were countless white bones and scarlet red. It was dozens of meters deep, proving that an extremely tragic battle had taken place there.

Further out was a pitch-black ocean.

Of course, it was not because the ocean was black but because there were too many sea creatures gathered in it. They could not see the end of the sea, and they had already filled up the seawater, which was why it was black.

“I’m afraid there are hundreds of millions.” The Sea Dragon Clan’s head had an ugly expression.

“Not only that but there are also three Sea Race Sovereigns. In the past year, they have only attacked twice. I’m afraid they were only probing us.” Patriarch Sea Shark sighed.

“I hope Lord David and Lord Kyle can hold them off.”

The Sea Dragon Clan’s head frowned, but his gaze could not help but look forward.

There was an area on the city wall where all the higher-ups who had arrived this time were gathered. Alida, Nikola, Luo Ye, and so on. There were more than a hundred people.

However, there were only three at the front.

The first was the Bloodline Tower’s Tower Master, Alida. The second was Eli’s student, Lich David, who was a lich of the fifth circle. The third was an old man with white hair and a determined expression. He was a hidden human expert, the peak fifth circle warlock, Kyle.

If it were not for the latter two participating in the battle, their line of defense would have been broken long ago.

“I wonder who is stronger, Lord Eli or Kyle?” The head of the Sea Dragon Clan pursed his lips and muttered softly.

“Naturally, it’s Lord Kyle.” At this moment, a voice sounded.

The Sea Dragon Clan’s head raised his head and looked over. It was one of the hundreds of warlocks. It was an old woman who was wearing a gray warlock robe and had no teeth.

The Sea Dragon Clan’s head remembered her. She was also a hidden human expert called Nora Tyson. She was here to provide support.

At this moment, she said with a smile on her face.

“Indeed, of course, it’s Lord Kyle.”

“Although Eli is strong, Lord Kyle is a peak fifth-circle warlock!”

As soon as she said this, the people around her agreed. They were human powerhouses who had come to support her. They were not interested in Eli.

Hearing their words, the surrounding people looked at them with anger on their faces. A few of them were so excited that they said, “Hmph, how do you know how powerful Sir Eli is? Whether it was the Lich War or the Warlock Alliance’s destruction, our lord had always fought alone against many!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s right, don’t be too arrogant!”

In an instant, the Warlocks on the scene were divided into two groups, and they were about to start a fight. One group was the human powerhouses who were supporting them. They were few in number but strong individually. On the other side were the Warlocks from the Bloodline Alliance. They had many people and were not weak either!

The noise also attracted the attention of the three people at the front.

Alida frowned and turned to the white-haired old man beside her. “Kyle, I think you need to manage these Warlocks. This is not proper!”

“It’s indeed outrageous!”

David nodded. When he heard the people behind him discussing how weak Eli was, his Soul Flame flickered.

Their words reached the ears of the old man, Kyle. He only shook his head gently and said with a deep gaze, “They aren’t my subordinates, so I can’t do anything about it. It’s up to you, Alida!”

Alida frowned.

Kyle said this, but she knew that Kyle had been secretly contacting these people recently.

Also, Kyle probably had some plans for appearing so suddenly during this war.

However, this was also where she was helpless. Her master was not around, and her strength was not enough to suppress this person. Even with David around, it was not enough. If it were not for this person, the defensive line would have been broken long ago!

Thinking of this, she couldn’t help but sigh in her heart.

When Kyle saw this scene, he smiled.

This girl was still too inexperienced to fight with him.

As for Eli, he wasn’t afraid. They were both peak fifth-circle warlocks. He didn’t think that this person could easily defeat him. Moreover, he had helped him protect his faction. Would he dare to attack him?

Of course, his plan was not just that. He had to tear off a piece of meat no matter what.

‘You have ulterior motives!’ David glanced at Kyle, feeling wary.

The three of them had their own thoughts, but at this moment, everyone was awakened by an exclamation.

“Tsunami, the tsunami is coming!” A sharp sound pierced through the sky.

Everyone stopped and then suddenly looked towards the sea. At this time, the sea in the distance was rising. A thousand-meter high tsunami surged towards the defense line. After the waves, three figures slowly approached.

On the left was a 10,000-meter-tall giant turtle. Its greenish-black shell was like a continent. In the center was a whale-like figure, but it was tens of thousands of meters long. Its skin was dark purple. On the right was a 10,000-meter-tall giant. Its feet were in the sea, but only up to its ankles.
