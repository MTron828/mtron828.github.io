553 The Book of Amir

“I want you dead!”

Saks’s words were like a switch, directly opening the prologue of the battle!

In an instant, boundless bloodline power emanated from his body. Armor-like armor grew out of his flesh and blood. His hands turned into sharp claws, and his eyes gradually turned black.

Sixth circle Bloodline-Ocean Black Turtle!

He wasn’t the only one. Behind him, the fifth circle warlocks also unleashed their bloodlines and activated their bloodline avatars. Some of their avatars were thousands of meters tall.

In less than three seconds, the sky within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles darkened. Dozens of behemoths and some half-bloodline Warlocks lowered their heads to look at Eli, who was as small as an ant. They did not hide their killing intent at all.

This scene was like a god judging a mortal.

Half of the people on the continent could see the terrifying scene as long as they raised their heads to look at the sky.

“It’s starting!”

Many Liches watched the scene.

But in the next moment, a shadow covered the scene.

“It seems that Eli has pulled that area into the shadows.” the Lich said slowly.

” Then let’s wait for the results.” The Bone Dragon Lich nodded and subconsciously looked up at the Lich King. At this moment, he seemed to be still hesitating.

“We’re going in!”

At this moment, the Warlocks of the Bloodline Towers, including the Sea Dragon and Sea Shark Family, were looking at the sky.

At this moment, a thick ink-like shadow enveloped the entire sky, covering the sky and the sun. The continent, within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles, fell into darkness.

In that instant, Eli had pulled all the Warlocks into the shadow space.

“We can only depend on you, sir!”

Jin Ji gritted his teeth.

Could his lord really defeat so many Warlocks?

All the Warlocks on the continent looked up at the shadow, their eyes fixed on it.

..

The fifth circle warlocks looked at the shadows around them and relaxed when they realized that they were only trapped.

“Eli, you’re very brave!” Saks looked at Eli and smiled.

The shadow trapped them and also trapped Eli.

Did he want to stall them alone?

How was this possible?

“Of course, it’s only for the convenience of battle.” Eli shook his head, but his eyes gradually turned cold as he looked at these people.

He took a deep breath, and at the same time, a blood-red dot was emitted from behind him. Then, he exhaled, and the blood-red dot gradually grew larger as he exhaled.

A blood-colored figure slowly rose up as if it was about to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the sky.

It had a human-like elemental body, but its body seemed to be covered with a layer of dragon scales. It held a magic staff made of elements and a wizard book in its hand, and its dragon-like eyes were looking at them.

Blood Spirit Body!

Ever since he advanced to the fifth circle, Eli had not used it for a long time.

However, today, the Blood Spirit Body appeared in this world again.

The moment he appeared, the shadows around him seemed to respond. Countless shadows rolled like waves, and Eli slowly merged with the Blood Spirit Body and looked at the people in front of him.

He waved the staff in his hand, and a booming sound resounded in the sky.

“Come!”

Eli’s voice resounded in everyone’s ears, but at this moment, everyone was silent. They just stared blankly at the figure in the sky, a little stunned.

What was this?

Everyone asked the question in their hearts.

Although they didn’t leave their hideouts often, they didn’t hear that the bloodline avatar technique had changed!

What was this thing that looked like a bloodline avatar but was not a bloodline avatar?

However, this was not the time to discuss this.

No matter what it was, it was impossible to defeat so many of them.

“Everyone, let’s go!” Saks shouted, and everyone nodded.

In the next moment, dozens of Warlocks, including a dozen Thousand Leaves, flew toward Eli. Their huge figures caused the shadow space to ripple like waves.

“Eli, die!”

Looking at the dozens of figures around him, Eli remained calm.

The magic staff in his hand was connected to the Eli Magic Staff, and the mysterious power of time spread throughout his body. In just an instant, a thousand-meter-long shadow mouth slowly appeared in front of him, and countless tentacles squirmed like teeth!

In the next second, the shadow’s mouth flew toward everyone.

“So fast!”

These people were stunned when they saw Eli’s speed!

However, at this moment, the huge shadow mouth had already arrived in front of several thousand leaves. It opened its monstrous mouth. At the same time, countless shadow laws were instantly activated, and a majestic devouring power erupted like a black hole.

“No!”

The seven or eight Warlocks widened their eyes, but they found that they could not move at all. Their bodies fell straight into the middle, and then they were smashed into pieces by the devouring power.

All of this happened in less than a second.

The rest of the attackers were stunned as if they did not expect Eli’s methods to be so powerful.

But at this moment, a Warlock shouted, “Everyone, don’t panic. It’s impossible for him to use this kind of attack multiple times in a short period of time.”

That’s right!

Everyone’s eyes lit up. How could such an attack be used several times in a short period of time?

Everyone sped up again and attacked.

However, in the next second, everyone saw the wizard book in Eli’s hand suddenly open page after page. Runes were emitted from it, and nine auras slowly appeared in the surroundings. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were three shadowy mouths like before. Two thousand-meter-long wind blades caused cracks to appear in the surrounding space. Two time storms that seemed to have condensed emitted a majestic time aura, and a spear condensed from the power of faith lit up the space.
