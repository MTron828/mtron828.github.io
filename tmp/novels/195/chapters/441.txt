442 You Call That Very Strong?

Boom!

The huge figure was like a demonic god that could destroy the world. Its figure walked in the black fog, stirring the flow of the black fog. With every step it took, everyone could hear a buzzing sound that was like a sharp whistle. At the same time, they could feel the ground trembling slightly!

” A Radiant Sun giant. I wonder which stage he is at! ” Gade looked at the giant and muttered.

“Corona!”

Suddenly, he heard a voice. He turned around and saw that it was Eli. Eli was looking at the giant with pursed lips.

“Coronal level?” Gade didn’t doubt it, but he frowned. Stacy, Karel, and Clessie also became serious. Other than the first two who were Corona celestials, the other two were only Dark Suns!

If the giant was at the Corona level, then it was not good news for them. Moreover, the creatures here basically killed their enemies at all costs. This was even more troublesome for them.

“In that case, it’s best if we don’t provoke him. After all, our goal is resources.” Gade said softly.

“No need. Prepare for battle!” Only Eli stretched his body and chuckled softly.

“Eh? There’s no need for that. Our goal is resources.” Gade frowned even more. Although you’re strong, you can’t do this!

“No, we have been discovered!” Eli pointed to the other side, indicating for them to look over.

A few of them were dumbfounded. They looked in the direction that Eli pointed and saw that in front of the giant from before, and there were two other giants, one on the left and one on the right. They were both 400 meters tall, and their auras were slightly weaker than the giant from before, but they were also at the level of the Brilliant Sun and Dark Sun. What was even more terrifying was that one of them was currently looking down at them, its pitch-black eyes flickering with abyss-like darkness.

Three!

Gulp!

Who would have thought that they would encounter three enemies of the Radiant Sun level as soon as they entered the Giant Mountain Range?

Gade broke out in a cold sweat. He realized that he had underestimated the strength of the first echelon of the mage World. He thought he understood the Mage World of the past, but the Mage World of the past was so powerful that it enslaved several major worlds.

“Run!”

Gade was also very straightforward. However, when he turned around, he realized that the giant at the front had already stood behind them and blocked their way. In fact, they had already been discovered when they entered this place!

His body instantly froze, and his gaze was a little dull. The other three did not know what to do either.

“Let’s get ready for battle!” Eli patted Gade’s shoulder and said in a relaxed tone.

“Good!” Gade’s smile was extremely bitter, and the other three didn’t look any better.

” How about this? Let’s deal with the two Dark Sun-ranked ones. Two people will fight one, and I’ll deal with the Corona Level one behind me! ”

Seeing that Gade seemed to be in a daze, Eli took over the work.

“Alright!” Everyone finally reacted.

At this moment, with a loud boom, the three giants also passed through the black fog and appeared in front of everyone.

Eli looked at the giant in front of him and raised his eyebrows. It was so smelly!

The giant in front of him no longer looked like a mountain giant. Its huge body, which should have been made of rock, was now wrapped in a layer of black liquid. The black liquid flowed down with every step it took, and then the ground was corroded into holes one after another. As for the soul aura, there was no trace at all.

These celestial giants seemed to be in a worse situation than the low-level ones. They were completely unconscious.

Of course, this was not the time to think about this. He had to pull this giant away and then leave space for the other four to fight!

Thinking of this, Eli’s mental power moved, and a ball of flames with a radius of dozens of meters suddenly flew toward the giant.

Bang!

The giant let out a sorrowful cry, and the black liquid in front of its chest instantly evaporated, revealing its green-black stone body.

Meanwhile, Eli had already arrived at the other side. He flew towards the plains.

The giant hesitated for a moment, then followed. He ran with large strides, and more black liquid flowed out of his body!

On the other side, Gade and the others were relieved when they saw the Corona Giant being led away. They looked at the three of them and said, “Karel and I will deal with the one on the left. Stacy and Clessie will deal with the one on the right.”

After saying that, he flew towards the giant. At the same time, a 200-meter-tall tree demon appeared in the sky. There were pupils on its body, and silver optical fibers were released, binding the giant and moving to the side.

The Holy Pegasus Warlock Karel let out a cry and turned into a pure white pegasus with wings on its back. Then, it flew towards the giant.

The other two looked at each other. Stacy turned into a hundred-meter-long spider with a starry back. Eight sharp swords flashed as they attacked the other giant. At the same time, the giant was controlled by the huge spider web. Clessie also turned into a hundred-meter-long blood-red wolf and pounced at the giant!

Boom!

The two sides began to fight at the same time. The black fog in the surroundings was instantly dispersed, and even space itself trembled. This was because this was a world fragment and not a stable world.

While fighting, Gedo shouted in another direction,” Everyone, hurry up. Eli is facing the Corona Giant alone. We have to destroy the giant as soon as possible and help Eli! ”

“Good!”

Everyone nodded in unison and increased their attacks!

However, everyone soon realized that they still had a wrong perception of the giants’ strength. Although they were in the Dark Sun stage, with the strong physical fitness of the giants and the enhancement of the black fog, the strength of the two giants was comparable to the Corona level.

This made the battle more intense, and Gade began to worry about Eli.

“Eli, hold on!”

…..

“Hmm, interesting!”

Eli blinked and slapped away the tentacles that were about to reach out. Then, he lowered his head to look.

At this moment, he was flying at an altitude of seven to eight meters above the ground. Less than a meter away from him, a huge mountain giant lay on the ground. Shadows tied the giant to the ground like octopus tentacles. The giant roared, but it was useless.

The black liquid tentacles tried to attack from time to time but were easily stopped by Eli.

Eli landed, and his right hand turned into a wind blade. He then began to analyze the Mountain Giant.

“The black liquid attached to the celestial seems to be a higher form of the black fog. It seems to have a weak consciousness. The giant’s body had completely lost its vitality. Is this black liquid working? However, was the giant moving out of instinct or was it controlled by the black liquid? “Eli removed the black liquid and dissected the giant’s corpse!

Ignoring the giant’s roar, Eli dissected the body while thinking. He also used other methods to investigate from time to time!

...

“Eh? I wonder if the purification rune will work!” Eli suddenly blinked as if he had thought of something!

A mysterious rune appeared in Eli’s hand, and a sun-like mark appeared in the center of his hand.

In the next second, a pure white light instantly appeared and flew towards the giant’s body under his feet.

The sound of corrosion and the giant’s painful roar sounded at the same time. Eli felt the giant under his feet tremble violently as if it had met its natural enemy. What made Eli dumbfounded was that the black liquid was rapidly dissolving under the illumination of the white light.

This feeling was like water meeting fire. The two could not coexist!

Eli’s eyes narrowed instantly. He had not expected this to happen.

After all, if this thing could really suppress the black liquid, this purification rune would definitely not be so unknown. It would have even played a huge role during the war back then. It definitely could not be just this, so there must be other problems.

” Maybe it has something to do with the law that killed the black liquid!” Eli guessed!

Although the black liquid was fully functional, it had actually been completely wiped out from a higher level of power.

At the very least, the Absolute Purification Rune could not have such a powerful effect. Otherwise, the mages would not have left. Of course, it was possible that the Black Fog was just an insignificant part of that civilization.

It seemed that Eli would have to dig deeper into this purification rune in the future. Perhaps it would be of great use in the future!

...

Shaking his head, Eli continued to study the giant. He was thinking about how to kill the giant that did not have a living consciousness. Soon, he came to the conclusion that as long as he shattered half of the body, the black liquid would lose its effect and turn into a black fog of even lower concentration!

After breaking it, it was more convenient for Eli to observe. He also collected a lot of samples, as if he was in his own laboratory.

Three hours passed in the blink of an eye!

“Eli!”

At this moment, a loud sound suddenly came from the black fog in the distance. Four anxious figures tore through the black fog. They were the four people who had defeated the giant with difficulty. Moreover, the four people’s bodies also had a varying number of injuries. It was obvious that everyone had paid the price in order to end the battle as soon as possible.

When the four of them came out and saw the scene before them, their mouths twitched.

“You must be joking!” Gade’s mouth twitched as he looked at Eli kneeling on the ground in the distance, carefully harvesting the giant’s heart!

At this moment, the giant was lying on the ground. Only half of his body was left. The other side had turned into countless fragments, and Eli was not even stained with a speck of dust!

” At this rate, the giant must have been dead for a long time, but it didn’t cause any trouble for Eli! ” The corners of Stacy’s mouth twitched. At this moment, most of her clothes were torn, and she looked a little miserable!

“This is ridiculous!”

The other two also sucked in a breath of cold air, feeling deeply shocked!

“Eh, you guys are done? Give me a few minutes. The materials will be gathered here soon.” Eli sensed them coming out and waved at them!

They looked at each other.

At this moment, they understood that Eli’s strength was on a completely different level from theirs.

His relaxed posture made everyone feel that Eli was only half relaxed, as if he was on an outing!

Very soon, Eli was done with his work. He stood up and walked towards the few of them. He smiled and said, “This giant is very strong!”

Stacy was speechless.

Karel was speechless.

Clessie was speechless.

Even Gade was silent. He looked up at the black sky, his eyes showing a hint of melancholy!

Listen to what you’re saying. Is there any credibility to your words?

Eli smiled. There was nothing wrong with it. It was a Radiant Sun giant. Was it not strong?

Soon, everyone regained their composure and walked toward the entrance of the mountain range again. However, this time, everyone was under the command of Eli!

However, when Eli reached the entrance of the mountain range, he suddenly stopped and closed his eyes. He only recovered after a full three seconds. The others also stopped and found it strange.

“Did something happen?” Gade asked.

” I’m fine. ” Eli shook his head, but he couldn’t help but look at the sky.

It was still calm in the world fragment, but a storm had already swept up back into the warlock world!

” Let’s continue. This continent isn’t small. We’re here to collect resources, so it’ll take at least three months to a few years to finish exploring. So, we have to be careful! ” said Eli.

“Okay!” Although the four of them were a little confused, they still nodded.

Thus, under the leadership of Eli, everyone continued to set off!
