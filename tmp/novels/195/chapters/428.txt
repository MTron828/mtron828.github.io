429 Spatial Teleportation

Grassi Land!

Thousands of branches fell under the warm sunlight and swayed gently in the wind from outside the valley.

Eli stretched his body. A large number of items were piled up in front of him like a small mountain. Among them were high-level magic crystals, precious materials, rare magic plants, high-level bloodlines, and even the most ridiculous thing was that there was an instrument that was nearly ten meters tall beside him!

“Alright, there’s really quite a lot. Let’s do it one by one!” Eli gasped.

!!

He had asked Nikola to help it sort out some things that might be useful, but he realized that he seemed to have underestimated the gains this time.

Thinking of this, Eli looked at Nikola, who was standing not far away, but Nikola just shrugged and said, “Sir, I have already simplified it as much as possible.”

” Alright. ” Eli nodded. It seemed that the Eight-Armed Naga was indeed a powerful force.

However, it would take him a few days to sort it out!

“How annoying!” Eli smiled and started working.

Three days later!

Eli pulled himself out of the pile of resources and stretched his old waist!

There were too many resources. It took him three whole days to organize them. Fortunately, he had organized most of the resources.

After the inventory check, all the items were reduced from hundreds to three.

This was very reasonable. After all, even though he had taken down a rank two force this time, he was already a Radiant Sun Mage, a peak Mage among the fourth circle Magi. At this level, the number of items that could be useful to him could be counted on one’s fingers. Even three was more than what he had expected!

First was a mage Tool.

It was a four-circle top-grade magic weapon. It was a belt, dark purple in color, about one meter long, and engraved with tightly arranged runes. Both sides of the belt were covered with a layer of silver substance, shining with a unique color. The most eye-catching thing was that in the center of the belt, there was a crystal, and in the crystal was flowing blood that seemed to be liquid.

This Tool was called the Bonari Belt. It was a Tool for Warlocks and had two uses.

Firstly, as long as it was worn on the body, it could temper the host’s bloodline and continuously make the bloodline purer!

Secondly, it could summon a huge magic snake of the Radiant Sun level for ten minutes!

This was worn by the first Warlock, who died on the battlefield that day. He probably died before he could use it.

“Back then, when I advanced to the celestial level, my mage Power increased rapidly and my bloodline was always a little weak. I feel much better now.” Eli took out this Tool, erased the imprint on it, and put it on himself!

As soon as he put it on, Eli immediately released a magical power from the belt and it began to invade his body. At the same time, the blood in his body flowed a little faster. However, during this process, his blood became purer and purer, but the speed was very slow!

However, even though it was very slow if he wore it for a long time, he could save at least 30% of Eli’s effort!

“That’s great!” Eli looked at the second item!

The second item was a ball of Wind Elemental Source, a high-level elemental formation!

It was green in color on the outside and spiraled in layers, while the inside was emitting a sharp wind element. If Eli’s judgment was correct, this thing should be an elemental source born in the highly concentrated wind element domain. It was a very rare item.

On the other hand, Eli planned to extract the Elements from it, then combine them with the feathers and furs he had obtained during the fight with Four Seasons Garden to craft a four-circle boot-type movement Tool. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The third item was more special. It was a five-meter-wide stone slab. The stone slab was completely black, and there were scratches on it. The only interesting thing was that there was a huge spell formation that looked like a hexagram in the center of the stone slab.

“Interesting!” Eli lowered his head and looked at the huge spell formation. He had found it in the secret vault of the Eight-Armed Naga family.

According to the interrogation of the Eight-Armed Naga Family’s captives, this spell formation was obtained from a ruin. At the same time, they obtained the Space Token that Jesse and the others used to teleport. They guessed that this should be a space-type spell formation!

“You guessed right!”

Eli looked down and saw the huge stone slab in front of him.

The ancient and dilapidated stone slabs should have been directly taken from the ground, but it was obvious that Jesse and the others lacked the ability to study or explore these runes, so they were stored in the secret warehouse.

According to Eli’s research on runology, many of these runes should be related to space, so Eli guessed that this should be a space-type spell formation, the kind that could enable teleportation across regions!

“Good stuff!” Eli sighed.

If there was anything that troubled him the most during this period of time, it would be the unknown situation of the Heart of the Abyss, followed by the Green Field!

Although the Green Field and the Bloodline Tower complemented each other, bringing the elves to the human world would definitely bring a lot of trouble. Moreover, the possibility of Eli’s identity being exposed would also increase, so he had been thinking about how to establish a stable communication channel between the two.

If he could digest this teleportation spell formation and then set up some teleportation spell formations in the two regions, wouldn’t all the trouble be resolved?
