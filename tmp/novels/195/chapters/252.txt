253 The Power of One Attack

“Fifty?”

Outside the valley, Nikola’s mouth was wide open in shock.

As a former mage, he had his own special senses. He had been paying attention ever since Eli broke through a day ago, but in just one day, the change in Eli’s aura had simply left him dumbfounded.

He had only advanced a small rank, and his growth rate had increased from 30 times to 50 times. One had to know that when he had broken through back then, his growth rate had only increased by 12 times. To go from 18 to 30 was already considered genius.

“As expected of Milord!”

Nikola was once again convinced by Eli.

In the future, he would be a fool if he doubted Eli again.

Nikola took a deep breath and prepared to leave.

However, at this moment, he suddenly sensed something and looked ahead.

Under the blazing sun.

A venom Wyvern streaked across the sky and flew in their direction.

This was nothing, but what made him nervous was that there was another person standing on the venom Wyvern!

“Enemy!”

Nikola was stunned. He sensed for a moment and realized that his aura had actually reached the late-stage of the third circle.

He was shocked.

..

In the sky.

Under Noah’s control, the venom Wyvern’s speed slowly decreased, and it slowly came to a stop.

He also saw Nikola!

“Undead?”

Noah was puzzled.

Half an hour ago, he had arrived at the home of the tower bloodline’s area. To avoid some trouble, he had chosen to enter from the back, and this valley was the only path he had to take.

However, as soon as he got close, he found that the elements within a few hundred meters had disappeared and were surging toward the valley. He naturally thought that there was something good.

That was why he flew straight in this direction.

But now, a third-circle undead appeared in front of them?!

Bloodline tower?

‘A three-ring early-stage undead, but he should be from the bloodline tower, right? Maybe he knew something?’

Thinking of this, Noah’s gaze became sharp.

Sensing Noah’s sharp gaze, Nikola’s soul felt cold.

However, Eli had just broken through and would definitely need some time to consolidate.

Nikola took a deep breath, looked at the man in front of him, and asked, “Who are you? What are you doing here?”

“I’m Noah, a third circle intermediate warlock from the heart of the darkness, ” Noah said with a smile. as for my purpose, I’m here to investigate whether the incident in the secret ruins has anything to do with you.

“?” Nikola was a little confused, as he really didn’t know.

“I’m sorry, my Lord is in front, you can’t pass!” Although he didn’t understand, he still stopped him.

“Hmph!” Noah looked at Nikola with a contemptuous smile and said, “Are you going to stop me?”

His body slowly changed as his bloodline was activated. The night demonic Wolf bloodline was gradually activated, and the aura of a late-stage third-circle warlock also gradually burst out.

Nikola found it hard to breathe.

“Who are you?”

Suddenly, a voice came from afar.

Noah looked over and saw that the wind element behind Vivika stirred and flew over.

Noah’s eyes lit up. This wind elemental warlock must be Vivika, the master of the bloodline tower.

The Lord the undead should be referring to Vivika.

His eyes scanned Vivika’s body from head to toe. She had a good figure and a high-status temperament, which made him purse his lips.

“Vivika?” There was greed in Noah’s eyes.

“And you are?”

Vivika stopped and frowned at the man in front of her.

“Heart of darkness, Noah!” Noah said again.

“he just said that his purpose was to investigate the mystery at the ruins. I don’t quite understand what he’s talking about!” Nikola added.

“The ruins?” Vivika frowned. Was she exposed?

“yes, tower master Vivika. If you cooperate and tell me what happened in the ruins, and stay with me for a few days, I’ll pretend nothing happened. You’d better not resist, or I’ll make a move!” Noah’s body slowly separated from the venom Wyvern, and he looked at Vivika with a fake smile.

“Cooperate?”

Hearing Noah’s insulting words, Vivika’s chest heaved up and down, clearly a little angry.

However, when she sensed Noah’s undisguised third circle late-stage aura, her expression turned unsightly.

“Nikola, let’s attack together!” She shouted at Nikola.

...

“Alright!”

The two of them attacked at the same time. Countless spirits of the dead flew out of Nikola’s body and turned into a huge skeleton. It flew towards Noah, exuding a cold aura.

Wind elements also gathered in front of Vivika, and then a wind blade formed. It flew towards Noah with a whooshing sound.

The two of them stared at Noah, waiting to see how he would respond.

“Hehe, just like that?”

Noah laughed in disdain.

The silver moonlight around them surged like waves. Although it was daytime, the two of them felt as cold as if they were at night!

“Moonlight tide!”

Noah pushed his hand forward, and the moonlight swept past. The wind blade and the skeleton melted into the moonlight in the blink of an eye, but the tide did not stop and flew directly toward the two.

It directly wrapped around the two of them.

“Damn it!” Vivika could feel the moonlight that bound them.

...

She knew that there was a gap, but she never thought that the gap would be so big.

Nikola’s face was also ugly. Under the moonlight, his aura was rapidly decreasing.

He could only place his hopes on Eli. The person in front of them was not someone they could defeat.

“Too weak, too weak!” Noah looked at the two trapped people and shook his head.

He flew towards Vivika, and the light in his eyes gradually lit up.

“What a rare beauty!”

The master of a tower, just thinking about it made him excited!

He reached out to Vivika, completely ignoring her trembling body. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Bastard!” Vivika’s power had been completely bound by the moonlight, and she was completely unable to resist.

“This makes me even more excited!” Noah’s lips curled up at sight.

“Hey!”

Suddenly, he heard a voice behind him.

He turned her head and saw an unfamiliar man.

“What are you doing in someone else’s territory?” Eli looked at Noah, a little impatient.

“And you are?”

Noah’s expression gradually turned serious. He actually did not sense this person’s appearance at all. Something was wrong!

At the same time, a large shadow emerged from the void and slowly devoured the moonlight. The card and Nikola quickly broke free and flew toward Eli.

Noah didn’t stop them. He just looked at Eli, still puzzled.

Who was this person?

He didn’t seem weak. He could actually melt his moonlight so easily. Interesting!

However, he wasn’t afraid. As a third-circle soul master, he didn’t think that anyone here could defeat him. Even if he couldn’t win, he still had a chance to escape!

“And you are?” Noah asked.

“The person you’re looking for!” Eli replied.

“???”Noah was dumbfounded, but in the next second, he revealed an interested smile.

“It’s you!” Noah smiled and looked at Vivika behind him. He said, “It looks like I’ll be able to gain a lot this time! Not only did I find the culprit, but I’ll also get a beauty!”

“Oh!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. “You’re too confident.”

“the chit-chat is over. It seems like my mission is about to end!” Noah took a deep breath, and a huge moonlight appeared behind him. It was twenty meters tall!

“Moonlight tide!”

Eli chuckled, and more shadows appeared behind him. In the blink of an eye, a fifty-meter-tall wave of shadows appeared, and countless tentacles stretched out from it, like the tentacles of a demon.

Twenty meters against fifty meters!

Noah’s smile instantly froze!

He looked at the fifty-meter shadow wave in front of him, and his lips trembled.

It seemed like … The situation didn’t seem right!

At this moment, the moonlight tide had already collided with the shadow tide. Without a doubt, in just an instant, the pure white moonlight was swallowed by the shadow without much effect. Then, it surged toward Noah.

Noah didn’t even have time to run.

Poor Noah did not even have time to react before the wave came crashing down!

“No!” Noah let out an angry roar of despair. The next second, the shadow swallowed him and wrapped him tightly!

A shadow sphere with a diameter of more than ten meters slowly appeared in the sky. Standing outside, Eli could see the moonlight penetrating the shadows from time to time, but this process only lasted for three minutes, and there was no more moonlight!

A veteran late-stage third circle master had just died so mysteriously!

Eli turned his head.

At this time, Vivika and Nikola looked at him in surprise.
