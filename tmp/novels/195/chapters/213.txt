214 Nikola’s Battle

“Nikola, come out!”

Outside the Forest of Death, a figure stood on a Hill and shouted.

His eyes were cold, and his strong body was like a wall. He was 2.1 meters tall and wore khaki-colored leather armor. In his right hand, he held a large hammer that was covered in dark green patterns.

He was Mason, the third circle warlock in black Isotta, with the bloodline of the Earth Dragon.

…

“I think we should destroy the bloodline tower with all our might, then clean up the South!” Mason recalled what had happened a few days ago and was still a little upset.

That day’s meeting was to formulate black Isotta’s plans for the future. During the meeting, he suggested concentrating their forces to deal with the bloodline tower first, but it was rejected by Kloss. He was told to come to the South to deal with the forces first, as he was enough to win the war with the south.

After all, he was a third-circle Warlock. Kloss didn’t give him any face at that time, which made him very embarrassed, so he decided to vent his anger on the South.

According to the order, he first went to The House of the Dead, ready to deal with Nikola first.

Although Nikola was a second-circle spirit, he was able to reach the third-circle level with the help of a large number of spirits, which made him the strongest in the South of the West Coast.

But he didn’t care. They had investigated Nikola a long time ago. Although he could temporarily reach the third circle, his combat power was far from that of a normal three-ring cultivator. He was strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

“He’s here!” Standing on the hill, Mason suddenly felt the air around him become cold. He looked up and saw a large number of spirits flying toward him, surrounded by Nikola.

There were so many spirits that they covered the sky as if it was dark. Although Nikola had not arrived yet, many spirits were already flying toward him as if they wanted to tear him apart.

“You’re brave!” Mason grinned. Nikola dared to take the initiative to fight him. He had underestimated him.

However, just these undead weren’t enough.

In an instant, Mason began to transform, and his eyes began to change. His yellow vertical pupils exuded a cold aura, and his body was covered with uneven skin. His teeth became sharp, and a powerful aura was released.

He stood on the slope and took a deep breath.

Roar!

In the next second, a terrifying Dragon’s might was released and suppressed Nikola. The undead along the way was basically wiped out, and many of the weaker ones directly turned into the soul power and dissipated.

“He’s so strong!”

Nikola was also affected. Under this suppression, even his soul was somewhat unstable.

This made him certain that he was no match for Mason. Nikola was just a second-circle mage. It was a trick he used to ascend to third circle. It could be broken down. Eli had done something like this before.

“But …” Nikola looked back at the Tower.

‘With master here, there definitely wouldn’t be a problem. Master might already be ready to attack at any time, so I don’t need to be afraid.’ With this thought, his courage was once again boosted.

“Who are you? The house of the undead shouldn’t have provoked you, right?” Nikola was in the air, confronting Mason.

“Hehe, you’ve already forgotten that you’ve occupied part of our territory. Remember my name, Mason!” Mason said coldly. He didn’t show any mercy. He swung the giant hammer and jumped toward Mason.

The giant hammer exuded a powerful aura as it swung, making a series of air-piercing sounds.

Nikola quickly dodged.

Mason’s figure flew past and smashed into the ground. The trees along the way burst into pieces like bubbles, and Mason’s body was smashed into the forest. With a bang, a huge pit appeared.

“Hiss!”

Seeing this scene, Nikola secretly cursed, “so strong!”

He finally understood Mason’s identity. He was indeed from the black Isotta. What was this guy doing here instead of fighting the bloodline tower?

And he seemed to be very emotional. Nikola didn’t remember provoking this person!

“Yo, you’re pretty fast!” As the dust settled, Mason’s figure slowly appeared. The bloodthirsty look in his eyes grew stronger and stronger, and his will to fight rose.

As a Warlock, as their bloodline was deeply integrated, the influence of their bloodline would become more and more severe. An Earth Dragon was a kind of violent earth element mixed with a Dragon bloodline.

Actually, this was the same with Eli, but the shadow dragon’s bloodline was more inclined towards darkness, shadow, and death, so the influence on Eli was to make his emotions more stable. Occasionally, some violent thoughts would appear in his mind, but they would be neutralized by his training as a mage.

Mason looked at Nikola. The earth elements in the surroundings combined, and rock pillars flew toward Nikola like a sea of arrows. Nikola summoned a huge wall, blocking all the rock pillars.

However, it was clear that he was struggling. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“So strong!” Nikola struggled to resist. Mason was much stronger than he had thought.

After blocking it, he immediately let out a terrifying shriek, the sound of the undead.

The sharp voice made Mason feel dizzy and even a little dispirited. However, in the next second, an earthy yellow light covered his body. Mason’s bloodline power was in effect.

In just a few seconds, he recovered and looked at Nikola, gritting his teeth, “Not bad, little undead. Watch how I tear you apart!”

Mason shot up into the sky and attacked Nikola. Nikola dodged with all his might and was almost attacked several times.

In fact, he really didn’t want to fight with such a terrifying opponent!

If not for his master, he would have turned around and run. He really couldn’t beat Mason.

Soon, Nikola was completely at a disadvantage.

Under Mason’s violent attacks, it was getting harder and harder for him to hold on. He had no chance to fight back at all. Because of the close distance, escape was even more impossible. If he was distracted for even a second, he might be shattered into pieces by Mason.

And what made him most uneasy was that his soul power was getting weaker and weaker, and he almost couldn’t maintain this state. Once the spirits dispersed, Mason would definitely tear him apart.

“However, Master is still here!” To him, Eli’s existence was his only hope.

He was just wondering why Eli wasn’t making a move yet.

He was probably observing.

As time passed, Nikola’s situation became more and more difficult. His huge soul body began to shrink, and the spirits of the dead jumped out of his body one by one, then were torn to pieces by the aftermath.

“Hahaha!” Mason’s smile became more and more arrogant.

Finally, after five minutes, Nikola’s aura gradually dropped to the limit of the second circle.

...

“What’s wrong? Can’t hold on anymore?” Mason laughed and licked his sharp teeth, making a cruel smile.

He did not tear Nicholas apart immediately but began to torture him as if he was playing with him. After all, Nikola was no longer a threat to him.

After another five minutes, Mason was a little tired of playing.

“It’s time for you to die!” Mason looked at Nikola and gathered a huge amount of elemental power on his hammer, then attacked Nikola.

Nikola looked at the scene in front of him in despair.

Why hasn’t master made a move yet?!

Bang! Bang!

A loud sound rang out, and a huge elemental power spread in all directions. To Nikola’s surprise, a shadow wrapped around him, and the giant hammer could not move a step forward.

“My Lord!” Nikola heaved a sigh of relief. At the crucial moment, His master had finally arrived.

Mason looked at the shadow in front of him, dumbfounded.

He turned around and saw a man at the top of a big tree not far away, looking at him with a smile.

...

“Herman?”

Mason exclaimed in surprise.
