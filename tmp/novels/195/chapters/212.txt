213 Mason

The bloodline tower.

In a room.

Vivika sat on the sofa with her eyes closed. Although it was nighttime, she didn’t turn on the lights. She just let herself be in the dark for a simple reason: she was tired.

She was really tired.

Since the death of the original owner of the tower, the third-circle warlock Natasha, she had been immersed in the battle with black Isotta every day and was surrounded by all kinds of bad news.

Compared to black Isotta, the bloodline tower was much weaker. The pressure of two third-circle warlocks was like a mountain. If she hadn’t sought help from a few Warlock forces, she might not have been able to hold on until now.

However, it didn’t make a difference. The bloodline tower couldn’t hold on for much longer.

“sigh, if it wasn’t for the accident in the central continent, things wouldn’t have ended up like this!” Vivika shook her head. It was also Natasha who told her about this.

At most, five years. She felt that she could only hold on for another five years.

“I really miss the days of Bryne!” Vivika hugged her body and curled up, just like how scared she had been when her father had sent her away.

Ever since her teacher had disappeared, they had left Bryne, and David had been separated from her. Since then, battles and competition had filled her life. Other than the occasional break, she spent most of her time being involved in various matters.

“Teacher!” Vivika pursed her lips and sent her consciousness into it. She sighed when she saw the soul imprint that had been dark for decades. If her teacher was here, he would probably help her solve this problem.

“How is that possible? what am I thinking?” Suddenly, Vivika laughed. Her teacher was only an apprentice back then, and there was a high chance that he was dead. Only she would fantasize about it from time to time.

If the outside world knew that she was like this, they might not be able to hold back their laughter.

Soon, Vivika was once again immersed in her memories. Suddenly, a crystal ball on the table beside her flashed, as if there was some news.

Vivika was stunned. She waved her finger and the crystal ball flew over. What news could there be at this time?

Her consciousness entered, and as the information was transmitted, her eyes grew wider and wider, and her body began to tremble in anger. The information said that the forces that were relatively close to the bloodline tower, with the exception of the White Tower, had all joined the black Isotta.

“Damn it!” Vivika gritted her teeth. “These guys only knew how to hit someone when they were down.”

This made her feel even more desperate. With the departure of these forces, the bloodline tower would probably die out even faster. She understood these forces very well. If it were her, she would probably make the same choice. However, this still made her feel a sense of desolation. However, White Tower’s loyalty touched her.

Ding ding ding!

To her surprise, the crystal ball flickered again.

Vivika had a strange look on her face. She tried to sense it again, but her mood became even worse.

“The third circle Earth Dragon Warlock, Mason, has left black Isotta and is heading to the South of the West Coast. His goal is to get rid of the forces in the South. He is expected to reach the house of undead’s territory in three days!”

“Are they not even taking us seriously anymore?” Vivika closed her eyes. The black Isotta must have thought that they had the upper hand and decided to send one of them to deal with the South.

“Then come. Even if I die, I won’t let you have an easy life, Kloss.”

Vivika stood up. As the master of the bloodline tower, it was not the time to be sad. It was time to reignite her fighting spirit and fight.

At most, she would die!

Since black Isotta looked down on them, they might as well take the initiative.

She was making a final struggle.

..

Whoosh!

A large number of elements gathered in the mage Tower. Eli took a deep breath and ended his meditation for the day.

In two days, he had a clearer understanding of his own body. Whether it was his strength or other aspects, he had made significant progress. At least, he would not make a mistake like before.

“This triple rate of life force consumption is indeed too terrifying for ordinary Mages!” Eli sighed as he sensed that his life force was being depleted at three times the normal rate.

An ordinary third-circle mage could only live for about 2000 years. It was a big difference to suddenly reduce it to a few hundred years. Warlocks were still fine. Ordinary bloodlines could allow warlocks to live for 3000 to 4000 years, or at least another 1000 years, which was better than mages.

No wonder the mages had to run away. They would lose three days of their lives in one day. Thankfully, Eli was immortal or he would think of a way to leave too!

This was too terrifying. The more he meditated, the shorter his life was!

“But on the bright side, it’s easier for me to get mage resources in this world.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face. This was the worst era for mages, but it was the best for him.

However, he still had to be cautious. After all, the Warlocks had the upper hand.

He had to hide well. Once he was discovered, he might really stand on the opposite side of everyone almost immediately. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As Eli was thinking, there was a sudden knock on the door.

“Come in!” He couldn’t think of it being anyone else other than Nikola!

“My Lord!” The door opened, and it was Nikola!

“Sir, there’s something I need to report. yesterday, the war between the bloodline tower and black Isotta suddenly broke out completely. I don’t think they can hold on for long. The other forces have also thrown themselves into the arms of black Isotta. What do we need to do, my Lord? ” Nikola asked with a worried expression.

Had the situation changed so quickly?

Eli was a little surprised.

“It’s fine. The black Isotta won’t care about us for the time being. Even if it’s a decisive battle, it’ll probably take at least a few months. Let me improve myself first,” Eli replied.

He was just an early stage third-circle mage, and Kloss was also a mid-stage third-circle warlock who had been in this state for decades. However, black isotta had a second third-circle warlock so he had to be careful.

He would first observe and give up his current forces if he couldn’t win.

At most, he could slowly develop new forces in the future!

“Yes.” Nikola nodded. His master was extremely cautious!

“Sir, you can rest assured. I’ve been having the house of dead pull back.

“And as long as we don’t provoke black Isotta, he shouldn’t come here. After all, there are no resources here.”

Nikola solemnly promised.

...

“Nikola, come out!”

But the next second, a voice came from outside the forest. It seemed to have a third-circle aura.

Nikola was speechless.

What a slap in the face. He had just said that no one would come looking for him!

“A 3rd Circle Warlock?” Eli looked up outside the Tower. It couldn’t be Kloss, could it?

“My Lord, what should we do?” Nikola was also a little afraid. After all, he could only reach third circle temporarily, but fortunately, his master was there.

“Go outside and take a look first. See who is it.” Eli told Nikola after a few seconds of silence.

“My Lord, the person seems to be a third-circle Warlock.”

“it’s alright. I’ll be watching from behind. Don’t worry! don’t worry.” Eli gave Nikola an affirmative look, telling him not to worry.

“Alright!” Nikola let out a sigh of relief. With the Lord’s support, then everything would be fine. The Lord’s strength was comparable to a third-circle middle-stage mage. As for the possibility of Nikola beating the warlock outside.

“Sir, I’ll be going then.” Nikola nodded and left the Tower, flying out of the forest.

...

At the same time, he was surrounded by countless spirits of the dead along the way. Some of them entered his body, allowing him to temporarily reach the level of third-circle. Like a natural disaster, he flew out of the forest.

As for Eli, he took a glance and started packing his things. If the situation went awry, he would be ready to escape!

The quality of life force at the third circle was higher, so the blood-burning secret technique would definitely be stronger and faster. As for Nikola, if the opponent was really strong, he would not care about him.

At this moment, Nikola, who was flying far away, turned his head around and looked at Eli through the window.

“I’ll always be here!” Eli hurriedly gave him a look of affirmation.

“Yes, ” Nikola nodded and then sped up.

With the adults around, what did he have to panic about?

Eli packed everything up and left the tower. He moved a few kilometers in the opposite direction and then stopped.

At this distance, even a third-circle warlock could forget about catching up to him.
