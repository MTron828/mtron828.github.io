“Sancher is dead. The soul slaves are gone. The line of defense has been broken!”

In a room in the Holy tower headquarters far away.

The room wasn’t big, and the windows and doors were closed. The windows were covered, and the alchemy lamp was turned off, making the room very dark. In this dark room, a man was sitting on the sofa in a daze.

His eyes were dazed as he looked ahead without moving, and there was a scattered document beside his hand!

“It’s done for!” Situ just kept muttering.

It lasted for a full ten minutes before his gaze slowly recovered, but he was still sad.

He could not understand how this could happen.

“tens of thousands of magical beasts were scattered and didn’t react in time, but dozens of third-circle magical beasts and even the warlocks were all killed. They didn’t even have time to escape!” At this moment, Situ was on the verge of a mental breakdown!

As one of the more radical factions in the hourglass of time, he had spent a lot of effort to finally get out of it. Then, he worked hard to seize the big cake of the West Coast!

It had been almost a hundred years.

But what did he gain?

The Holy tower’s territory was getting smaller and smaller, and it still had to fail again and again.

So, where did all this start?

It was probably the first time he heard of Herman’s name or after he met the bloodline tower!

They were a small force, but they were able to defeat larger forces one after another. In just a few hundred years, they had gone from a low-level force with only one or two third-circle warlocks to a force that could suppress them.

This time, he took out what little he had in his inventory, but it still failed.

His right-hand man, Sancher, had also died in it.

Situ heaved a long sigh.

However, he couldn’t let go!

He had paid too much, and he no longer had the chance to stop!

If he really gave up everything and went back to the hourglass, it would not be the same as before. Those conservative parties who were already dissatisfied with him would not let him go.

He only had one choice, and that was to continue fighting.

Moreover, he was not without a trump card.

He still had one last trump card, master Klay, a half-step celestial.

“However, I need to wait for an opportunity, and that is to wait for them to all show up and then finish them off in one go!” Situ slowly stood up, recovering his fighting spirit!

“What more can I lose?” He gritted his teeth.

At this moment, he remembered the wealth he had accumulated and the resources and connections he had built up in the hourglass of time. He might not need master Klay.

This time, he was going to stake it all on one throw!

Only success was allowed, no failure was allowed.

..

“Well done!”

In the secret realm, Hydra rubbed against Eli’s hand as if he was acting coquettishly!

Eli, on the other hand, smiled.

Hydra’s work was more outstanding than he had expected. Moreover, in terms of combat power, Hydra was really not bad. He had accidentally created an amazing chimera!

After patting the Hydra’s head, Eli walked towards the laboratory.

The next step was up to Vivika.

He was not strong enough!

Watching Eli leave, Hydra opened his eyes wide and immediately followed!

..

A year passed in the blink of an eye.

In the past year, the bloodline tower, under Vivika’s leadership, quickly cleaned up the remaining forces of the Holy tower in the sofia mountains and sent a large number of people to guard the place.

After stabilizing herself, Vivika did not immediately launch an attack.

Instead, she chose to hold the ground and continue to stabilize this battle line.

..

The year 3784.

This stabilization lasted for three years.

This year, the bloodline tower crossed the sofia mountain range and arrived at the Holy tower’s area.

A new war had broken out!

At the exit of the mountain range, the bloodline tower encountered an unprecedented obstruction.

The Holy tower’s attack was much stronger than everyone had imagined. Not only did the bloodline tower not gain the upper hand in the first round of attacks, but they were also completely at a disadvantage.

In the end, the bloodline tower retreated.

This was all thanks to Vivika’s decision to remain stable for a few years. Otherwise, the Holy tower might even counterattack in this battle and occupy the sofia mountains. By then, it would not be as simple as retreating.

The battle on this front line lasted longer than anyone could have imagined.

..

...

Twenty years later!

The exit of the mountain!

“Kill!”

The Warlock from the bloodline tower roared and looked at the defense line in front of him.

In the distance, a high wall had already been formed. At this time, thousands of Holy tower warlocks were launching attacks on it, trying to stop their attack, just like they had done in the past twenty years.

No one had expected that this battle would last for twenty years.

Although a battle might only break out once every few months, it was still too long!

“Ah, but this time, lady Vivika said that there will be reinforcements!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As the Warlock pondered, he suddenly felt a shadow cover him.

He turned his head to look.

Just a few dozen meters away from him, there was a huge figure.

...

It was nearly a hundred meters long, and its body was shrouded in shadows. Three huge snakeheads were raised high, calmly looking at the Holy tower’s defense line in front of it. The aura it gave off was even more powerful!

“Who is that?” The Warlock was stunned.

Could it be that they were the reinforcements?

However, before he could react, he saw the three heads of the huge snake shoot out three waves. There were shadows, Fire, and Ice, and then the snake rushed toward the high wall.

With unstoppable momentum, the three-headed snake crashed into the high wall.

Then, the high wall broke!

The Warlock’s eyes were dull.

Looking at the giant snake that had already rushed forward and the three tens of meters long attack marks, his head buzzed. He seemed to have seen this scene before.

It was twenty years ago in the Holy tower camp.

Was this giant snake the reinforcement?

The Warlock’s eyes flashed with confusion, but it was no longer important.

The important thing was that they had finally broken through this line of defense.

..

The year 3804.

Eli sent out Hydra, and the bloodline tower broke through the Holy tower’s line of defense.

The bloodline tower had also finally advanced into the core area of the Holy tower.

A new war began.

The sudden breakthrough also left the Holy tower dumbfounded, but they quickly organized a new counterattack, and a tug-of-war began on the new battlefield.

Everyone was well aware that this war would be very long.

This was because this battle would determine the fate of the two forces.

To the Holy tower, if they failed, they would lose everything. However, there might still be a glimmer of hope.

As for the bloodline tower, if they failed, they would lose a great opportunity. If they won, they would become the only major force in the central and Southern parts of the West Coast.

Eli was also paying attention to the battle.

At this point, his spiritual power had reached 365. The winning rate of the fate dice against Klay had also reached 15 points.

..

Time slowly passed.

The two forces chose to waste time. Situ also used many means, but he couldn’t stop the Holy tower from declining. He could only watch the situation get worse.

Just like that, twenty years later.

The bloodline tower had finally arrived before the Holy tower.

The Holy tower had nowhere to retreat.

Both sides were waiting.

The next battle would be the final one.

The final battle was about to begin!
