312 Celestial

At this moment, although he didn’t seem to have changed much, his essence had already changed.

“A celestial?”

Eli felt the power in his body. It was at least ten times stronger than before. At this moment, he also understood how big the difference between the four and third circles was.

This was like heaven and earth.

!!

However, he needed to find a place to test it.

There was no suitable place around.

Of course, he had to leave first.

Eli had already sensed that there were thousands of warlocks gathered within a radius of a few hundred miles. The central region might not have had enough time, but most of the people from the South were probably here. After all, there were not many people in the South, to begin with.

It seemed that he had caused quite a stir!

Moreover, he could sense that Hydra and Nikola were confronting a group of people.

..

At this moment, outside the abandoned Warlock camp.

Nikola calmly looked at the dozens of third-circle warlocks and thousands of spells.

“Are you going to let us pass or not!” The leader was a Warlock with a long face and a high nose. He was looking at Nikola with a dark expression, but there was a trace of fear in his eyes.

The strange situation here had been going on for more than a day. They had originally planned to come here to pick up some scraps, but they were stopped by undead and a group of skeletons. There was also some infighting. After all, they were not on the same side.

“No. No one is allowed to enter this place today!” Nikola shook his head.

Nikola was in charge of the outer perimeter, while Hydra was in charge of the small town inside.

“Detestable!”

“Boss, why don’t we just force our way in?”

“That’s right!”

Several warlocks said to him.

The Warlock leader was hesitant because the undead and skeletons in front of him were not to be trifled with.

But suddenly, he raised his head and saw that the elemental clouds had started to gather towards the town. In the blink of an eye, the elemental clouds that covered dozens of kilometers had disappeared.

“Motherf * cker, let’s do it!” The leader of the warlocks gritted his teeth, realizing that something must have changed.

“It’s over!”

seeing the elements in the sky disappear, Nikola let out a sigh of relief.

He knew that these elements were meant to replenish the power of the celestial. It seemed that his master had already advanced to the true celestial realm, so these people didn’t matter anymore.

If it weren’t for the fact that he was afraid of disturbing Eli, he would have already made a move.

For a moment, the gazes of both sides changed.

But just as Nikola was about to make a move, he suddenly felt something on his shoulder.

He turned his head to look, and his eyes were immediately filled with surprise.”My Lord!”

Eli nodded.

The people on the other side were also stunned. They didn’t even sense anything, and this person suddenly appeared, which made them feel uneasy.

“Who are you?” The Warlock in the lead looked at Eli and said cautiously.

But Eli didn’t seem to have any intention of paying him any attention. He said to Nikola, ” the breakthrough is over. Collect the undead. It’s time to go!”

“Yes.” Nikola nodded and looked at the people in front of him, asking, “Then what about these people? How to solve it? Do we need to kill them?”

“No need!”

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. ‘In your heart, do I like killing so much?’

However, some of the onlookers had malicious intentions.

“Yes!” Nikola understood, and the spirits behind him flew toward him. As for the skeletons on the ground, they disappeared into the shadows.

Seeing that the two of them were about to leave, the warlocks became anxious.

“Do you even have us in your eyes? You’re leaving just like that!”

“What’s inside?”

“Don’t leave!”

The warlocks’ eyes were wide open, but in the next second, they saw Eli turn his head around and look at every one.

With just one look, everyone felt their hands and feet turn cold. At the same time, an aura burst out from Eli’s body.

This aura was like a mountain covering the sky and the sun. The terrifying aura made everyone’s eyes widen, and they all felt like they were facing a terrifying existence.

The apprentice and the first circle warlocks fell unconscious immediately. The second circle warlocks barely managed to stay awake, but they could not even lift a finger. The third circle warlocks fell from the sky and crashed to the ground, each of them looking at Eli in shock.

What was this?

Just the suppression of their biological instincts was enough to make them almost unable to move.

What was this?

The leading Warlock was actually a wandering peak three-circle warlock. He only had one thought in his mind.

Celestial!

This was definitely a f * cking celestial! If it were a half-step celestial, he would definitely not be able to suppress them like this. They were already creatures of two different dimensions.

...

That meant that the transformation just now was not a treasure but a celestial’s advancement.

The warlocks trembled as they realized that they had offended someone they should not have.

Fortunately, the person didn’t have any intention of killing them. He just turned around and flew away with the undead.

After Eli had flown far away, the group of third circle warlocks stood up. They had been able to get up with great difficulty, but lying on the ground gave them a greater sense of security.

“Boss, what’s that?”

One of his underlings came to the peak of the three-circle warlock and asked.

“A celestial!” He took a deep breath before spitting out these words.

Although the other warlocks had already guessed it, they were still shocked.

No one had expected that they would encounter such a figure in the South of the West Coast, the region with the least resources. It was simply ridiculous.

“Celestial? Can a celestial be so f * cking arrogant?”

“He didn’t stay. Otherwise, I would have let him know how powerful I am!”

...

A late-stage third circle warlock cursed.

Just now, he had hit the ground head-first, so he was in a sorry state. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Bale, don’t say anymore. Be careful, or he will sense it!” The Warlock at the peak of the third circle frowned and said.

He didn’t know what abilities a celestial had, but if they were really heard, they might be finished.

“Hmph, he has already escaped!” The Warlock was an old man. He said disdainfully, and his voice was even louder! “Kill me in the next second if you dare!”

Everyone kept their distance from the Warlock. This Warlock was a little brainless.

“Bale, stop!” The third circle warlock tried to comfort him.

Everyone looked at the Warlock, and suddenly, they felt a wave of energy.

A ray of black light descended, and the Warlock was instantly reduced to dust. There was even a large pit that was tens of meters wide on the ground. Everyone was dumbfounded as they looked up.

In the sky, a three-headed snake spat out a shadow and flew into the distance.

“What is this?!” The group of people immediately lowered their heads and fell.

Could this be another celestial?

It was not until more than ten minutes later that everyone got up.

Many warlocks looked at the huge pit and felt lucky.

It was a good thing they didn’t curse.

“Could it be that the world is going to change again?” The Warlock at the peak of the third circle looked at the sky and sighed.

One celestial was enough to completely change this land.

..

On the other side.

On the other hand, Eli, who was flying in the sky with Nikola, suddenly frowned.

He seemed to have forgotten something.

Looking back, the Hydra was flying towards them. It was only then that Eli remembered he had forgotten to wait for Hydra.

He would wait.

After a short while, Hydra arrived beside Eli, and its eyes looked as if it had been wronged.

Eli smiled and touched Hydra’s head.

“What? You killed someone?! ”

After finding out from Hydra that it had just killed a person who insulted Eli, he was extremely shocked.

Then, Eli laughed heartily.

“It’s time to go!”

Hydra shrunk and landed on Eli’s shoulder. Then, one man, one undead, and one Chimera set off towards the North, returning to the bloodline tower.
