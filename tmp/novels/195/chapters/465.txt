466 The World Will, Tuman Arrives

Three months later!

Thank you readers!

The impact of the Green Field Giant Dragon’s invasion gradually dissipated.

Although it had caused quite a bit of impact, it had only happened in the vicinity of the Bloodline Tower. Moreover, it had not caused too much damage, so people quickly forgot about it!

Grassi Land!

Giovanni and Ortiz were resting in a corner of the valley. One was tall, and the other was low, like two small mountains!

!!

Not far away from the two of them was Eli, who was observing the two dragons.

Staring at the two dragons, Eli muttered to himself, “Ever since the half-step five-ring Giovanni joined the experiment, the speed of the experiment has been progressing rapidly. I might be able to find the key point in less than five years. During this time, I have also studied Giovanni in depth and have a deeper understanding of the strength of the half-step five-ring. It’s not as terrifying as I thought!”

To be honest, Giovanni’s arrival was really a timely rain. It allowed Eli to carry out everything smoothly and had a deeper evaluation of the Heart of the Abyss!

He felt that he could have a great battle with the Heart of Abyss now, and there was even a high chance of victory.

Of course, it was just a joke. Even if he really wanted to fight, he had to wait until the celestial-Bloodline Body was developed!

Shaking his head, Eli was about to leave when another figure suddenly appeared from the corner of his eye.

Seeing the figure, Eli smiled and turned to look. “Vivika, what brings you here?”

Not far behind him, Vivika, who was wearing a pure white Warlock robe, walked over. Compared to the past, she seemed even more intelligent now!

“We don’t have enough experimental equipment. I’ll take some living materials!” Vivika said.

“Alright then!”

Eli smiled.

He didn’t expose Giovanni’s existence to the public, so Vivika would often come to get some materials. Of course, it was also convenient for him to experiment with the dragon here. After all, the Grassi Land was his main experiment site.

“Go ahead, but they seem to be sleeping. You’d better wake them up first! “Eli, move sideways and give Vivika some space.

“Yes!”

“There’s no need. I’m already awake!” Suddenly, an even more vigorous voice sounded.

He turned around and saw that Giovanni, who had been lying on the ground, had opened his eyes. His eyes were red.

However, if anyone saw it, they would definitely be shocked. At this moment, the dragon skillfully extended an arm in front of Vivika. Even the scales were slightly unfolded, revealing the delicate skin and visible blood vessels inside!

This was the Dragon King. Who would dare to believe him?

Vivika was not used to this. She took out the tools and began to draw blood!

During this process, Giovanni did not pay attention to them. He looked at Eli and asked, “Eli, I’ve been participating in your experiments for the past three months. I realized that you’re not only studying the bloodline itself but also the knowledge left behind by the wizards. What are you trying to do?”

“An experiment.” Eli looked at the dragon and replied.

Giovanni blinked when he heard Eli’s perfunctory words. Then, as if he had thought of something funny, he said, “Don’t tell me you’re trying to improve the Warlock system through the means of Mages!”

“Barely!”

Elo smiled. His goal was to merge and not improve, which was much more difficult and subversive!

“Hahaha, that won’t be easy. However, if you succeed, you might even be able to attract the world’s will!” Giovanni chuckled, but his tone was a little teasing!

“World Will?”

Eli was also a little dazed when he heard this word.

A world’s will, as its name implied, was the will of a world. It was a product that transcended the world but relied on the world. Only after the world had been born for a long time would it slowly appear. It could be said to represent the world itself!

The world’s will would not usually react. Generally speaking, it would only react when the world encountered a major danger and other worlds invaded. However, there was also a rumor that said that the world will would also appear when there were major changes to the main race system in the world.

Although Eli had never encountered it before, almost all the famous big shots in the Mages World had undoubtedly encountered it. It was even said that those with the seventh circle and above had something to do with it!

“Maybe!”

Eli shook his head.

He didn’t think so. It shouldn’t be!

However, this piqued his curiosity. He looked at Giovanni and asked, “You’ve lived for so long, so you should have encountered the world’s will, right?”

Giovanni turned around and was about to speak.

Hiss!

“Sorry, I need to take a scale!” He lowered his head and saw that Vivika was plucking his scales!

“I’m fine.” Giovanni’s mouth twitched, then he looked at Eli and continued, “I was born about five hundred years ago in the new calendar. I saw it a few times in the Mages World, but then the Great Calamity came.”

Giovanni shrugged as if to say, ” Look, you warlocks are so lame!”

Eli nodded in agreement. He agreed!

Seeing that Eli had nodded, he was also stunned for a moment. He seemed to be a little surprised, but he still said, “However, I might have overlooked it. A thousand years ago, I woke up once. According to my people, there was a World Will descending, but it was in the northern part of the warlock World. It seemed to be an extremely cold place!”

“An extremely cold place!”

Eli looked at the dragon. What he said reminded him of the Lich Tower, a topic that was now banned in the central continent!

Was it related to them?

Maybe!

However, it had nothing to do with him.

Eli shook his head and stopped thinking. At this time, Vivika had also finished gathering the materials and stood up.

“Do your best. If you need anything, you can tell Alida or me.” Eli encouraged.

“Alright, I won’t let Brother Eli down!” Vivika stood up and nodded.

Although she had only studied it for a few decades, she had also discovered that she was very talented in bloodline research.

She was really happy that she could help Eli!

…..

A year later!

After the initial stage of the experiment, the progress of the experiment had already exceeded 40%.

Even Eli was stunned because he did not expect it to be so smooth. He could only guess that it might have something to do with his half-fused state of mages and warlocks. Of course, it also had something to do with the help of Vivica, Giovanni, and Ortiz!

During this year, the Bloodline Tower’s development progressed steadily. In the past year, more than a dozen forces had joined the Bloodline Tower, becoming a well-deserved top force in the Western Region. Its sphere of influence covered the northern and eastern regions, and it was almost on par with the Abyss’ Heart.

As for the Heart of the Abyss, it had surprisingly not made any movements this year, as if it could not be bothered at all!

Eli was very cautious about this!

Although the Heart of Abyss looked honest, only he knew how ” dishonest ” it was.

Eli was doing a blood test on Giovanni, slowly drawing out a little bit of his blood that was rich in fire’s law. Giovanni looked like he was already used to it.

But suddenly, he saw that Eli’s movements suddenly stopped, and a relaxed expression appeared on his face!

“Eli, what happened?” Giovanni asked.

“There’s a guest. Follow me out!” Eli smiled and said to the Dragon King beside him.

Two people, two half-step fifth-circle warlocks.

The two of them were not a big deal. He could completely deal with them. Moreover, they were finally here, which made him feel relieved!

“Good!” Giovanni nodded in confusion.

Eli walked towards the back of the valley, and he quickly followed.

Of course, Eli didn’t forget to test the Dice of Fate. With his home-field advantage and Giovanni around, it showed 20!

It was settled!

In the distance, Ortiz watched the two of them leave and ignored them. He just went to sleep in another direction!

The other Grassi Land creatures didn’t think much of it either. They just thought that Eli and the dragon king were going out for a trip!
