116 Inside the Secret Plane

And then, Eli saw the three children.

One was dressed in tattered clothes, but his eyes were bright. One was wearing a small white dress, looking pitiful. The last one was always hunched over, looking sneaky.

These were the three people with the mage’s talent that Eli had chosen.

“From today onwards, the three of you will be my students. You will inherit a part of my legacy and explore a ruin for me.” Eli was very clear. “Oh right, let me introduce myself. I’m Layton, a level 3 acolyte.” Eli added.

At first, Eli wanted to say that he was a mage, but after some thought, he decided to be more cautious. After all, he was not facing Knights, but future wizard apprentices.

“Alright, teacher!”

Before they came, someone had already explained the situation to them. Eli thought he would encounter trouble, but he didn’t expect the three of them to agree so easily.

…

Three years passed in the blink of an eye.

Within three years, the three children had all become Level 1 apprentices, and Eli had also taught them some zero-circle spells.

Among them, David’s progress was the fastest. David was the child from the slums, and his mental strength was already at 5.6. It seemed that his mental strength was quite high, so the effect of meditation was very good. He was a good seedling.

Vivika, in her little white dress, was slightly slower and followed closely behind. She did not seem to have much interest in witchcraft, but she was very interested in bloodlines. At the age of fifteen, she was already acting as Eli’s assistant, which reduced a lot of his work.

As for the third child, he was called Rob. He liked to play tricks. Eli was speechless too so he just let him be. At this moment, he suddenly felt the pain that his teacher had once felt.

The three acolytes had long since been planted with the upgraded version of the soul brand by Eli. Soul enslavement, a 1st circle spell, had a much stronger binding force than the soul brand.

And for safety reasons, Eli had used two years to modify this spell, making it one-way. Other than having strict requirements, the enslaved were not allowed to reveal any information about Eli by any means. They could not even sense any of Eli’s condition.

In the original spell, the servant could sense if the master was still alive, but Eli had modified it into a completely one-way thing. Only Eli could contact them and not the other way around.

Even if they were to remove the spell in the future, it would have no effect on Eli.

This was very important. He could not let anyone know his specific condition.

Only Anna knew a bit about it. These students didn’t.

“come on, Vivika. I’ll teach you how to modify your body today.” In the laboratory, Eli called Vivika over. She was already a beautiful lady by now, and her smile was always sweet. As for her disgusting Viscount father, Eli helped to get rid of him.

“Thank you, teacher.” Vivika smiled.

At that moment, David, who was working seriously not far away, and Rob, who was slacking off, glanced at them and then lowered their heads again.

One was working while the other was slacking off.

Eli was waiting for them to become Level 2 acolytes before they went to check out the secret plane.

…

Year 403 of the bryne calendar.

On this day.

The 22-year-old Vivika tidied up her clothes and prepared to go to the laboratory as usual. She liked her current life very much.

Compared to the abnormal life in her house as the stepdaughter, this was heaven. She could eat anything she wanted, and the conditions were excellent.

As for the soul bind, Vivika didn’t mind.

It was Mr. Layton who gave her everything and saved her from her past life.

On the way, she met David and Rob.

David was now 1.9 meters tall, tall, and handsome. His mental power level was the highest among the three of them, reaching 11.2. It had been a year since he became a level 2 apprentice. Vivika made her breakthrough last month. Only Rob’s mental power was only 8.0 at the moment. The difference between him and the other two was huge. He was completely lazy.

“Vivika, what do you think the teacher called us for?” David asked curiously when he saw Vivika.

“I don’t know!” Vivika shook her head.

They had nothing to do today, but they were suddenly called over.

“what could it be? It is probably work. I was at Liu Ying alley today, but I was suddenly called back.” Rob didn’t care.

Vivika and David looked at each other helplessly.

Rob’s talent might be the highest among the three, but his spiritual power was the lowest.

Soon, they met their teacher.

“Teacher!” The three of them bowed.

“No need. How long has it been since I accepted you as my student?” Eli asked as he cast a glance at them.

“It’s been ten years.” Vivika was the first to answer.

“Well, it’s about time. I need you to help me with something today.” Eli ordered calmly.

“I’ll do as you say, teacher.”

At this time, the three of them felt that something big had happened.

“very good. I need you to help me check out a secret realm!” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

It had been ten years, and it was time to reap the rewards.

Level 2 acolytes were more or less ready to enter the plane. As for Rob, who had not broken through, it was not up to Eli. After all, Eli was not a philanthropist. Rob had to blame himself for not working hard.

“A secret realm?”

The three of them were puzzled again.

…

Ten years had passed by the time Eli returned to the valley.

“Teacher, is this the secret plane you were talking about?” Vivika stood behind her and asked.

Eli nodded.

The bronze gate was still the same, but ten years had passed.

“Just activate your mental power and you can go in. I’ll plant a spiritual power seed in your minds.” Eli said calmly.

The spiritual power seed allowed him to see images when the three of them were inside.

“Alright,” he said. The three of them nodded. Rob was a little unwilling, but he had no choice.

“Then let’s go in.” Eli didn’t waste any time. At this point, he no longer had any reason to hide.

David and Vivika had complete trust in Him, so they walked over and placed their hands on the bronze door. With a flash of magic, they disappeared in front of the bronze door.

Rob, on the other hand, stared at the bronze door, not daring to move forward for a long time.

“Go!” Eli pushed him over.

To his surprise, Rob also activated his mental power and disappeared before Eli’s eyes.

…

“cough, cough, cough!”

“Where is this place?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the previous second, David was still in the valley, but in the next second, he appeared in a garden.

David shook his head and looked around.

It was a garden, but it seemed to be in ruins. There was dust everywhere, and there were also withered flowers. Not far away were a few small paths and a flower bed, leading to who knew where.

“What should I do?” David was a little confused.

He subconsciously wanted to look around, and then he found that there was really nothing here. However, there was a cloth doll in a flower bed not far away. It was a bear, and it only had one eye, which looked a little scary.

“Forget it, let’s just ignore it.” David shook his head, then walked towards a small path.

“Hehe!”

What David didn’t notice was that right after he left …

The gray rag doll’s remaining eyes lit up, and a translucent body slowly squeezed out of the eyes and followed them into the path.

…

On the other side.

Vivika shook her head and looked around.

The area she was in now was like a prison. It was very large and had many levels, just like an upside-down tower. She was at the bottom level, and not far away was a huge prison.

“Forget it. I should just leave.” Vivika glanced at it but didn’t seem to see anything, so she turned around and walked up the stairs not far away.

Walking on both sides, Vivika was also observing the surroundings.

She realized that this place was supposed to be a prison, or rather, a prison for magical beasts.

In the cells on both sides, one could clearly see white bones. Most of them were large, and from the remains of the white bones, most of them were at least one circle.

And they seemed to have died inside the cells.

Vivika walked up the stairs.

Vivika kept going up.

At this moment, in the lowest cell.

This was a completely dark prison. Because it was at the bottom, there was no light at all. At this time, a large shadow gathered, and a pair of vertical pupils appeared in the shadow.

“A mage apprentice?”

“Has this place been discovered?” The owner seemed to be a little surprised, but he could not hide the strong excitement in his eyes.

It was finally here.

Damn it, the celestial had been dead for thousands of years, and he had been trapped here for thousands of years.

He used to be a four-circle Master of the World, but now his aura had dropped to two-circle. He had to constantly consume his own power to survive. What he had was only his noble bloodline and knowledge.

For some reason, he didn’t even dare to break through this prison.

But now, someone had finally come.

“There’s hope when there’s someone.” Its eyes slowly sank into the shadows. This was the happiest day it had had in thousands of years.

…

Rob looked at the tall magic plants around him, and his throat moved slightly.

Where was this place?

The Botanical Garden?

It was like the jungle, and Layton didn’t give him any hints.

‘What a trashy teacher.’ If he hadn’t been dragged out of prison, he wouldn’t have acknowledged Eli as his teacher. He had no choice back then, and he had always hated this teacher.

He yearned for a free life, not some Bullsh*t truth.

“Forget it. Let’s go.” Rob really didn’t want to come in. He sighed and decided to leave this place first. After all, this place didn’t look like a good place.

Suddenly, there was a buzzing sound. Rob was stunned. A shield appeared beside him, and then he looked around.

There was nothing.

Where was it?

Suddenly, Rob seemed to have realized something and lowered his head to look.

A vine had already climbed onto his leg.

Gulp!

He broke out in a cold sweat.
