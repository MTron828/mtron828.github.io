536 Change in the Situation Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

New Calendar Year 4932.

The Warlock Alliance was forced to open up multiple battlefields and fought against the Lich Tower and the Warlock Alliance. They split into two groups, each with five Thousand Leaves leaders. However, they encountered Eli and were completely annihilated.

At the same time, the Lich King sacrificed millions of lives and broke through the Northern Region, forcing the Warlock Alliance into the Central Region. At this time, the Bloodline Alliance and the Lich Tower were constantly devouring the Warlock Alliance’s territory. This was an unprecedented predicament for the Warlock Alliance.

..

A year later!

Winter had arrived, and everything was covered in a layer of silver frost. However, the grassi land was different. It was still like spring, with grass and flowers.

Eli was sitting on a recliner with desserts and drinks on a small table. He was enjoying himself.

“It feels good!”

Eli sat up slightly and took a sip of his tea.

The past year had been the most relaxing year in Eli’s history.

“Since the Bloodline Alliance entered the Central Region a year ago, one-third of the Western Region has been under our control. The Bloodline Chamber of Commerce has also been established under Jin Ji’s command and is currently making great strides towards becoming the number one Chamber of Commerce.” Eli pondered.

In the past year, he had it easy, but the Warlock Union had not.

In just a year, their forces had shrunk to one-third of what they used to be. The remaining two-thirds were occupied by them, and the remaining half was taken in by the Lich Tower!

Of course, the situation had stabilized.

Therefore, the current situation was a three-pronged confrontation.

“The three of us stand together, but how long can this fragile balance last?” Eli stretched out his hand, and a leaf fell into his hand.

“It seems that the Warlock Alliance is temporarily safe, but both the Bloodline Alliance and the Lich Tower have not made a move because everyone needs time to digest the harvest. After a few years, the situation will naturally change.

“That’s why I still need to be stronger!”

Eli slowly sat up. His interspatial ring flickered, and a translucent gem was taken out.

The gemstone was about the size of a palm. It was surrounded by a layer of bubble-like crystal walls, while the inside was filled with a dream-like aura.

This was a Time Gem, and it was also the most valuable item the Alliance had looted this time!

“With the help of this and the Law of Shadow, it’s enough for me to break through!” Eli’s gaze was calm.

He was already at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm previously. In the past year, he had been holed up in the Time World Fragment. Other than recovering from his injuries, his Law Force had also been reorganized by him and improved to a higher level.

At this moment, he already had the qualifications to break through.

And this time, the gem was the last step.

“Even though we moved fast, most of the precious resources had already been collected by the Warlock Alliance. Other than this, most of them were useless gains, as well as a large amount of faith power!” Eli shook his head.

This war had a great impact, but the harvest was not much.

There was very little loot that was useful to him.

As for the power of faith, it really exploded once again. From 18 petals to 27 petals, the number had increased a lot. It was even enough for Eli to almost cross the ocean from there and connect to the deep sea.

However, what was the use of that? The power of faith that had shone brilliantly at the fourth ring back then was indeed limited. Most of the time, it was only used to show off.

Of course, Eli was also looking for ways to improve, but he had no ideas at the moment.

“This is life!” Eli sighed.

This was not the first time he had experienced this. The long years had allowed him to be fearless of the cost of time, so the things he had learned were really many and complicated.

Therefore, Eli was also very cavalier with the power of faith. If he could use it, he would use it. If he couldn’t use it, he would give up. This was nothing.

“Forget it, I don’t want to think about it anymore. The future situation is uncertain. I’d better breakthrough first.”

Eli decided to put this matter aside and focus on breaking through.

Breakthrough was always the most important thing!

He got off the recliner and walked towards the wizard tower.

He entered the secret realm.

200 times the time flow!

He closed his eyes and began meditating!

..

A month later!

In the time fragment, Eli suddenly opened his eyes.

After more than ten years of polishing, the power of laws was almost perfect at this time. There was no way to advance. Other than breaking through, there was no other way.

“Then let’s start breaking through!”

Without hesitation, Eli took out the time fragment and a part of the shadow law that was wrapped in black fog.

At the same time, the tree of laws in his body began to shake violently. The 2,000 leaves of the tree of laws began to shake violently. A large amount of power of laws intertwined and more power of laws began to emerge from the tree of laws.

Some new changes were gradually taking place.

Eli swallowed the Time Gem and bit the Shadow Law. Then, the Law Force became even more violent, and a bud began to appear between the leaves.

Eli was also slowly immersed in it, and his presence gradually decreased.

..

Three years later in the time world fragment.

In the secret realm, the originally calm time world fragment suddenly became chaotic. Countless timeline lightning bolts struck down crazily, and the entire secret realm was instantly illuminated.

At this moment, Eli opened his eyes.

“It’s over!”

He took a deep breath. At this moment, he had already broken through to the fourth stage of the fifth circle, the Thousand Flowers Mage.

Thinking of this, Eli couldn’t help but enter the space of consciousness again to observe the Tree of Law.

The current tree of laws was even taller than before. The leaves of laws from before were also growing on it, emitting a faint power of laws. In addition, there was a ” flower ” growing at the top of each side.

The flower on the left was formed by the laws of shadow. It looked like a rose, but every skateboard was formed by the power of shadow. There was some dark wind, and the flower on the right looked like a rose. The petals were translucent and had a unique beauty.

“Flower of Laws, the difference between Thousand Leaves and Thousand Flowers!” Eli pursed his lips.

He could feel that the power of laws contained in each of the two flowers was more than a hundred times that of the leaf of laws. Moreover, due to their existence, the power of laws could be fully mobilized. Once it erupted, its power was far from what Thousand Leaves could compare to.

The increase in this level was the condensation of the law flower.

The name of the Thousand Flower Wizard also represented the way to break through to the next level. It was to condense 10,000 flowers of laws. It was simply terrifying.

“10,000 flowers. I have two branches, so I’m afraid it’ll cost 20,000!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

The only fortunate thing was that this advancement did not require all of the Laws of Shadow and Time. It was possible to condense a large number of other Laws. This seemed to be related to the nature of the sixth circle. The keyword of the sixth circle was the world.

“Moreover, I have the Devouring Power!” Eli suddenly smiled and began to make her way back to the city.

That’s right, so what if it needed more? He had the devouring power!

Other than half of the shadow laws, there was also this time world fragment. As for the other laws, just like in the second circle, devouring others would be fine. Although there would be some losses, it would greatly shorten the process!

“There are still a few 5-circle Warlocks in the Grassi Land. Let’s go and experiment!”

With a smile on his face, Eli took a step forward and returned to the mage Tower.

However, as soon as he opened the door, an unexpected warlock appeared in front of him.
