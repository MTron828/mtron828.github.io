361 Bloodline Tower’s Main Tower

In the dark night.

A giant snake was wandering in the moonlight in the sky. Countless shadows were winding around them to hide their tracks. A person was lying on top of it.

Alida carefully came to the side of the giant snake and looked at the ground. At this moment, they were flying on a plain.

” After crossing the plains and passing through the surrounding forest, we will reach the Bloodline City of the Bloodline Tower. Sir, go straight ahead. ” Alida carefully commanded Hydra.

The Hydra beneath him let out a neigh and increased its speed.

“We’re finally here.” Alida was also very excited. She had been away from home for almost two years.

Suddenly, she looked ahead. In the darkness of the night, there seemed to be small black dots. Alida looked at them seriously and saw that they were large gray birds circling above the forest.

Alida’s expression changed when she saw the giant bird. She had seen this kind of bird before. It was a creature used by the manticore family for reconnaissance.

Since this bird had appeared in the forest, it meant that this place had been surrounded by the manticore clan.

Perhaps there were people in the forest below.

She lowered her head to look. In the dense forest, although she could not see anything clearly, she could vaguely see the flames. There were only a few of them, and she was the only one who could see them from such a high altitude. Following the flames, she saw a large number of warlocks. Although she could not see clearly, she was sure that they were the warlocks of the manticore family.

Alida’s eyes widened. Was the manticore ready to attack?

She seemed to have returned a little late, mainly because the West Coast was too far away.

” Damn it, Grandpa, you must be fine. ” Alida gritted her teeth.

In fact, she hadn’t finished telling her story when the Four Seasons Garden attacked. The reason she had come to the West Coast wasn’t that she had run into trouble but because she had been forced to go there. She had another identity, and that was that the only Celestial Warlock in the Bloodline Tower was her grandfather.

Her parents had passed away when she was young, and her grandfather had been taking care of her since she was young. Then, as soon as this attack happened, she was sent on a mission to the West Coast to find a sub-tower, to find a sub-tower that might not even exist.

The purpose of this was to send her away from the core of chaos.

She actually understood it, but she could not accept it.

But in the end, she was still sent to the West Coast. Who would have thought that she would encounter that ridiculous branch?

” With Sir Eli here, there’s still hope. ” Alida took a deep breath and pulled herself together.

“Milord, stop for a moment,” she said to Hydra.

One of the Hydra heads turned around and looked at Alida in confusion as if asking what was going on.

“Milord, there seems to be an encirclement in the sky ahead. “Alida reminded.

Hydra also looked forward after hearing that. It also saw those birds and rolled its eyes.

Although Hydra was a chimera, its intelligence was not low. It turned its head and nodded at Alida.

“What do you mean?”

Alida blinked. The next second, Hydra suddenly opened its mouth, and endless shadows surged toward Alida.

“Ah!” Alida let out a cry of surprise before being swallowed by Hydra. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hydra, who had swallowed Alida, blinked its eyes and then rapidly descended, its body shrinking.

When it landed on the ground, it was only a dozen centimeters long, and its aura was close to zero. It blinked its eyes and then crawled toward the forest in the distance.

Soon, Hydra entered the forest. Just as Alida had observed, there were already many Warlocks gathered in the forest. They were hidden in the forest and were fully armed.

Meanwhile, Hydra crawled inside like a normal snake, and no one paid attention to it along the way.

Half an hour later, Hydra finally passed through the forest.

As soon as they left the forest, they saw a large mountain range not far away. However, in front of the mountain range was a huge city.

The city was built on the mountain range, and it was scattered from top to bottom. The interior was filled with spires, and there were high walls that divided the interior. The outermost layer was a tall grayish-white wall that was a hundred meters tall. Outside the outer wall was a large plain.

On the plains, there were countless low buildings, and there were also some magic plant fields in between.

This was the main city of the Bloodline Tower.

Of course, this wasn’t all. The mountains behind the city were also the Bloodline Towers ‘territory, and the Grassi Land had been discovered there.

Of course, Hydra couldn’t see it yet. However, when it reached this point, its mouth slowly opened. As it squirmed, a person was spat out.

“Huff huff!”

As soon as she came out, she lay on the ground and took a few deep breaths. Her heart was beating fast.

When she was suddenly devoured by the Hydra, she felt herself melting into the darkness. Countless shadows crawled around her, and the power contained within could easily kill her. She did not even dare to breathe easily, and she held her breath for the entire journey.

She looked up to see where she was.

“Bloodline City!” She looked up, and her jaw dropped.

Had they already passed through the forest?

She had wronged Hydra!

When she turned around, she saw Hydra climbing up her pants and entering the inner pocket of her Warlock robe. It closed its eyes and fell into a deep sleep as if its mission had been completed.

“Thank you, sir.”

Alida took a deep breath, stood up, and looked at Bloodline City in the distance.

“I’m finally back.”

She quickly ran towards the city in the distance, but she was stopped after taking a few steps.

Three Warlocks on patrol stopped her. In fact, the entire Bloodline Tower was on full alert.

“Who are you?” The patrolling Warlock stopped Alida and asked cautiously. At this time, the Bloodline Tower had already banned outsiders from leaving, so it was rare for outsiders to appear.

“Take me to see Glen Clinton.” Alida did not have any fright and directly said to the Warlock.

...

“You want to see our lord?” The Warlock frowned. Glen Clinton was the only celestial of the Bloodline Tower.

“Are you Miss Alida?” At this moment, the Warlock at the side seemed to have recognized Alida and was shocked.

“Alida?” The other Warlock also widened his eyes. They had heard of this name before. She was the only descendant of Lord Glen.

“This is my identification!” Alida took out a token. When they saw the token, they no longer had any doubts.

“Milord, I’ll go report it now.” A Warlock immediately ran towards the city.

As for Alida, she followed the other two and walked toward Bloodline City.

Soon, they arrived at the city gate.

A female warlock was already waiting. She wore a gray warlock leather armor and carried a greatsword on her back. She looked heroic. However, when she saw Alida return, she only sighed deeply and said, “Alida, you shouldn’t have come back.”

“Long time no see, Margot.” Alida smiled. The person who came was her grandfather’s student. “I brought back reinforcements this time.”
