434 The Statue of Faith Was Completed

Whoosh!

Winter arrived silently, and light snow fell from the sky.

Eli stood in the Mage Tower of the Grassi Lands and looked out the window. The Grassi Lands were still lush with greenery. In the distance, Hill waved her branches, and countless birds surrounded her. Below the ground, Hydra was sleeping heartlessly. However, as time passed, he also advanced to the Radiant Moon rank last month. Further away was Nikola, who was sitting cross-legged. Thanks to the battle with the Eight-Armed Naga, his strength had soared again.

It had been a month since he had accidentally entered the outer layer of the warlock World. During this month, it was winter in this world.

!!

Of course, this was nothing to him. After all, he had already lived through more than 2,000 winters!

“Time really flies!” Eli pursed his lips.

” Brother Eli, the statue you ordered to be built has been completed! ” Suddenly, a voice came from behind.

Eli turned around and saw Vivika in a black dress.

“It’s faster than I thought!” Eli nodded.

From the moment he returned, he had gotten Glen to start building the giant statue of faith.

“Then let’s go out and take a look!” Eli walked out of the door with a smile, followed by Vivika!

He walked out of the main gate and left the Grassi Lands, arriving at the familiar Bloodline City!

As soon as they entered Bloodline City, Eli saw a huge statue standing outside the city, just like the one of the Amina Family. It was a statue of a warlock wearing a layered warlock robe. His hands were placed behind his waist, and his head was raised, looking into the distance with determination.

The statue was also a hundred meters tall, and its entire body emitted a special spiritual fluctuation!

To build this statue, the Bloodline Tower had spent nearly two million Magic Stones, which was almost a third of the harvest from the war!

” But it’s all worth it. With this, my clone can go even further and can even directly descend in a certain area. This greatly increases my mobility. Most importantly, as long as I’m in this area, I can even mobilize the power of faith in the area, increasing my combat strength. I can even mobilize faith to go directly to the green fields. The power that my clone can bear will also be stronger! ” Eli took a deep breath!

Although the cost was huge, it was worth it!

He still valued his own safety very much. With this, his safety in his own territory would be even higher!

After all, the Heart of the Abyss and they seemed to be doing fine at the moment, but Eli felt that there was something wrong with this faction!

His strength needed time to increase, but he could also use other resources. These were all very good supplements, and the power of faith was naturally the same.

“I just want to develop in peace. However, the Heart of Abyss has been stable for so long and has maintained a good image. It shouldn’t affect my life much!” This was what Eli thought!

He hoped that the Heart of Abyss would be more sensible!

” Brother Eli, what a huge statue! ” Vivika exclaimed when she saw the statue.

“Sigh, it was Glen who insisted on building it. ” Eli explained with a smile.

“Yes!”

After checking for a few more seconds and confirming that there were no problems, Eli returned to the Grassi Land!

However, just as he reached the entrance of Grassi Land, he found Alida waiting for him in a purple dress. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Alida, what happened?” Eli asked curiously.

” Sir, a Radiant Sun warlock from the Heart of the Abyss has come to visit. There’s also a young tower master from the Holy Tower, Luo Ye! ” Alida reported.

“Heart of Abyss? Luo Ye?” There was a strange glint in Eli’s eyes.

He was still thinking about the Heart of the Abyss just now, but he actually came looking for him. Moreover, he even heard an unexpected name.

Luo Ye? Wasn’t this the little guy who helped him explore the ruins more than a thousand years ago?

“Then arrange a meeting.” Eli smiled.

“Alright, who would you like to see first?” Alida asked.

” Luo Ye, let’s have that Warlock from the Heart of the Abyss wait for a while! ” Eli replied.

Alida was a little surprised. She didn’t expect Eli not to see the Heart of the Abyss first. That was a first-class force, and it was a visit from the Radiant Sun!

However, she naturally did not dare to disobey. She nodded and said, “Then follow me, Your Excellency. The two of them are already waiting.”

“Alright, Vivika, you go back first.” Eli turned around and left with Alida.

Vivika also looked at the two figures who left side by side and had an inexplicable thought.

She felt as if something was awakening in her body.

She had been quite idle before, but suddenly, she felt that she had to improve a little!

“Strange!” Even Vivika felt that it was a little strange, but in the end, it was all due to her own imagination!

However, she still felt that she had to do something!

….

On the other side.

In a room, Luo Ye was sitting on the sofa anxiously. There was someone standing behind him.

” Luo Ye, calm down. I heard that the Heart of the Abyss is also here. Eli will definitely come after meeting them! ” The Warlock behind him looked old, but his aura had reached the peak of Radiant Moon.

“Yes, Mr. Leeds!” Luo Ye nodded. He didn’t know why he was so anxious. He had a feeling that he couldn’t put into words just by walking here. He didn’t know why.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened. The two of them looked over at the same time and saw a handsome Warlock walking in under the leadership of a beautiful Warlock.

“Eli!” Luo Ye and Leeds were both shocked. They didn’t expect that Eli would come to see them first!

” Well then, friends of the Holy Tower, I am the Bloodline Tower, Eli! ” Eli smiled and nodded. He was not surprised that the two recognized him. After all, his portraits were everywhere.

However, he took a few more glances at Luo Ye. After more than a thousand years, the third circle Warlock from back then had grown to become a Radiant Moon Warlock. He might even have the chance to take over a second-class force in the future, the Holy Tower!

” Respected Lord, hello. I am the young tower master of the Holy Tower, Luo Ye. ” Luo Ye lowered his head and greeted him. The Warlock behind him also lowered his head. The two of them did not dare to overstep their boundaries. After all, this was a powerful Warlock who had killed dozens of celestials, including three radiant Suns!

“It’s nice to meet you. Let’s sit down and talk. We’re neighbors!” Eli smiled as he sat on the sofa. The two of them looked up again.

...

The following conversation went relatively smoothly. The content was also very normal. It was about the relationship between the two factions and some possible cooperation. In the end, the two of them also verbally signed some friendly contracts and some cooperation.

During this process, Luo Ye also mentioned Herman’s matter, and the atmosphere became even more heated. Of course, that was all!

Luo Ye only felt lost after Eli left.

He turned to look at Leeds behind him and sighed. “Mr. Leeds, I thought it would be interesting to meet Herman’s student, but now that I’ve met him, I realize that everything is not much different. But, of course, he’s different from Herman. ”

” Of course, Luo Ye. After all, he’s Eli, not Herman. He’s much stronger than the Herman you mentioned! ” Leeds said with a smile.

“That’s true.” Luo Ye smiled and nodded.

Many things were like this. When they were not completed, they looked forward to it, but when they were completed, it was just like that!

Fortunately, they were still very friendly this time. At least this neighbor did not have any plans to expand. Their goal had been achieved.

The only thing he regretted was that Eli was not Herman. Otherwise, the story might have been different!

On the other side.

Eli left the room and walked towards another wizard tower, feeling a little emotional.

...

He did not reunite with Luo Ye. After all, he had only interacted briefly with him in his previous identity. They were not that close.

He was an immortal, so it was inevitable for him to know many people. It seemed that he had experienced one story after another and met one person after another. It sounded like he should not lack friends, but only he knew his own situation.

He had always been alone, and he would always be alone.

At this moment, Eli suddenly felt that he had a deeper understanding of time. Time was always merciless!

In the face of time, everything was just an ant!

However, this emotion only lasted for a few seconds before he returned to normal.

What a joke, it was just a small flaw On the other hand, one couldn’t imagine the happiness of an immortal!

Behind him, Alida saw Eli’s rising emotions and felt a little strange. Wasn’t it just meeting Luo Ye? Why was her lord’s mood fluctuating so much? There couldn’t be any accident, right?

Pah!

She quickly threw this thought into the trash can. Who was she to worry about her lord’s private business?
