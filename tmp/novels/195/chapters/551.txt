552 The Human Race’s Prodigy

Bloodline City!

In the central mage tower.

Alida and Jin Ji sat on both sides, discussing.

” Tower Master, the preliminary investigation on the establishment of a branch of the Chamber of Commerce in remote areas and the relevant departments has been completed. The Bloodline Chamber of Commerce will soon send the first batch of people to the Horn of Despair, the Endless Wilderness, the West Coast, and so on…” Jin Ji said with a smile.

“Alright, I’ll leave it to you!” Alida nodded as she held the gold pendant.

This friend of hers was quite capable. In just a few decades, the economic department of the Bloodline Tower, also known as the Bloodline Chamber of Commerce, had expanded by dozens of times. He himself had also advanced to the fifth circle and became one of the top combat forces of the Bloodline Tower.

“Alright, then I’ll take my leave.” Jin Ji got up and prepared to leave.

Alida also stood up and was about to send him off.

However, just as the two of them got up, they felt a prickling sensation on their backs. They were instantly shocked.

They looked at each other and flew out of the window at the same time.

In the blue sky, hundreds of blood-red lights flew toward them like meteors. The blood-red light dyed half the sky red.

Gulp!

The two of them gulped at the same time, panic flashing in their eyes.

“What exactly happened?” Alida was a little confused.

Beside him, Jin Ji’s expression was also ugly.

He had never seen so many fifth-circle warlocks before. Moreover, each of those figures had an aura that surpassed his.

Just as the two of them were panicking, rays of light flew towards them from not far away. Then, the light dissipated, revealing the figures among them. They were the fifth circle warlocks that had come to support them.

As for why they were so fast, it was naturally because of the teleportation array.

Ever since the Bloodline Tower unified the land, each region was connected by a Teleportation Formation. The distance between each region was compressed to a very small distance.

“Everyone is here!”

Seeing these people, Alida heaved a sigh of relief. Although she was not sure what the situation was, it was obvious that everyone had realized the problem and rushed over.

“Where’s the lord?” The Sea Shark Family asked with a serious faces.

“I haven’t informed him yet!” Even though she didn’t understand the situation, she still spoke quickly.

“Good!”

Alida replied.

The battlefield was not suitable for the fourth circle. Although she could usually command these people, no one would pay attention to her at this time.

He was being polite, but he spoke directly.

“Hurry up. The Warlocks are invading. You can’t afford to waste time!”

Alida’s heart twitched, but she understood that it was true, so she flew toward the back of Bloodline City.

As they watched her leave, the people from the Fifth Ring looked at each other and looked up at the sky. There were a total of 24 people from the Fifth Circle, including Jin Ji.

Among them, there were one Thousand Leaves, one Divine Tree, and seventeen Germinal Warlocks.

The Thousand Leaves Warlock was an old man named Kyle. He belonged to a Warlock family in the Northern Region. After the Lich Tower annexed him, he escaped and joined the Bloodline Tower. The other three families in the other two regions were Divine Trees, and the other three were free Warlocks.

At this moment, Kyle was looking at the sky with a serious expression. His brows were wrinkled like the bark of an old tree, and his only clear eyes flashed with a trace of panic.

“Everyone, I’ve taken a look. There are at least 30 to 40 people in the sky, and there’s one person who is extra powerful.

“We might die here today!” He pursed his dry lips and said.

Everyone narrowed their eyes, but they did not refute it.

The people in the sky did not hide. They could naturally sense the auras of those people. They were all far superior to them.

After the alliance was established, they had all signed a contract. There was no way for them to escape. Otherwise, they would not be here at this moment. Even the Wind God clan head, who did not think highly of the Bloodline Alliance, had no choice but to come!

“Damn it, if it wasn’t for the war with the Lich Tower and the Warlock Alliance, how could we only have this much power?” A fifth circle warlock gritted his teeth and said unwillingly.

When everyone heard this, they all agreed.

The internal strife had consumed a lot of their battle energy. Otherwise, they would not have only this little battle power.

Everyone was stammering. Jin Ji, who was among them, frowned when he saw this scene. Suddenly, Kyle, who was at the front, said, “Don’t think about these meaningless things. They are already here!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone suddenly reacted.

In the sky, the hundreds of people were only a few hundred kilometers away from them. The Thousand Flowers was at the front, and the others were behind them, flying towards them.

This distance was already very close.

Five seconds later, everyone looked at the team of Warlocks in front of them, and their throats moved.

At the front was a Warlock who looked like a dead tree. His skin was wrinkled like tree bark, his eyes were extremely turbid, and he was dressed in ordinary clothes.

The Warlocks at the back were either old men or old women. Each of them looked older than the other, and most of them were almost at the end of their lives.

Old men and old women?

Seeing this, the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower were stunned, but no one dared to say anything. This was because the bloodlines of these people were stronger than theirs. Even the weakest one was stronger than the average Germinal Warlock.

“Who are you?” Kyle looked at the person at the front and said.

The old man only glanced at him and said calmly, “Saks!”

Saks?

“Saks!”

The group of people did not think of anything at first, but after a few seconds, their mouths were wide open. Jin Ji also frowned.

Saks!

This name was a legendary figure from more than 2,000 years ago. More than 1,000 years ago, it was during the reign of the Warlock Alliance. The oppression was extremely severe. The entire Warlock Alliance had existed for a long time. At this time, a person stood up.

He was hailed as a rare genius in a thousand years. He was born in poverty, but he accidentally obtained a sixth circle bloodline, joined the Warlock Alliance, and advanced all the way to the five-ringed Thousand Leaves.

Just when everyone thought that he would continue like this…

One day, the Warlock Alliance’s treasure vault was robbed. At the same time, a Warlock Alliance called the Defiance Blood Alliance was established. They set off a massive rebellion against the Warlock Alliance, organized by Saks!

That turmoil lasted for thirty years, and the Warlock Alliance suffered a great loss. Saks disappeared, and the Warlock Alliance later announced that they had killed Saks.

However, he had actually appeared here today and stood on the opposite side of them. Moreover, he seemed to be stronger than before.

He wasn’t the only one. At this moment, everyone was also trying to identify the person on the other side. As the names resounded throughout the central continent, everyone’s cold sweat gradually drenched their clothes.

These people in front of him were at least once famous on the continent.

“What do you want?” Kyle looked at these people and felt a lot of pressure.

Saks raised his head and looked at them coldly. The aura of a thousand flowers instantly erupted from his body. “After today, the Bloodline Alliance will become history. I will give you a chance to seek refuge with me. Otherwise, you will all die here today!”

Die!

The cold words lingered in everyone’s ears. The powerful bloodline suppression made everyone feel as if a mountain was pressing down on their bodies. Their expressions immediately became extremely ugly.

Compared to Saks, they were much weaker.

The fifth circle warlock behind Saks raised their heads and smiled.

Times were changing, but they were still strong.

“When you’re old enough, you should be cremated or put in a coffin. Don’t go around scaring people!”

At this moment, a calm voice entered everyone’s ears.

Saks’ expression changed, and the expressions of the people behind him also turned ugly.

They turned around and saw a figure slowly stepping out of the space not far away.

His blood-red sorcerer robe fluttered in the wind. He had a mage book in one hand and a staff in the other. His face was extremely young as if he was just a young man, showing his vitality, forming a sharp contrast with them.

Behind him was an undead and a giant snake.

“You are Eli?!” Looking at the clothes, Saks already knew who it was.

“Is this Eli? He was just a child. Wasn’t he just lucky to be able to reach this stage? Which one of us present hadn’t once dominated the world!”

“How dare he say that about me? I want to kill him!”

“You’re dead!”

The Warlocks behind Saks looked at Eli viciously as if he had touched their sore spot.

“Hehe, the once proud children of heaven, leaders, and clan heads of the human race have now become the lackeys of the liches. It seems that time has tempered your bloodline and weakened your will.”

Eli looked at these people calmly and reached out his hand. “Come, let me see if you old fellows can kill me!”

Anger!

Endless anger was ignited. As many as 103 rings looked at Eli with only killing intent in their eyes. Even Saks, the former leader of the human rebellion, looked at Eli and gritted his teeth.

“Eli, I want you dead!”
