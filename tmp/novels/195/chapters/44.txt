Chapter 45: Advancing to a level 2 apprentice

It was as if a bolt of lightning had struck Eli’s brain, causing him to wake up quite a bit.

“It can’t be?!” Eli turned his head to look not far away. The seemingly withered mouse was still lying in the pile of mice.

As Eli made the potion, the potion seemed to have changed a little.

Eli was an eternal being, so of course, he had done some experiments on himself this year. The clearest perception he had was that he could live forever. The most direct expression was that his life force would not be exhausted.

If the magic potion in front of him could really increase spiritual power by consuming vitality …

He could then announce that the experiment was a success.

Eli took a deep breath, then immediately remade the potion. Today might be a sleepless night.

…

Three days later!

In the laboratory.

“It’s really a success!” eli held a bottle of newly concocted solution in his hand, an excited expression on his face.

After some experiments, he finally verified the effect of the potion. It really consumed life force to increase spiritual power. He also found that the most important thing was the purple irises. The more he added, the more spiritual power he could increase.

Eli had even verified a specific amount that could improve the potion to a level comparable to the original.

“I’m a genius!” a smile appeared on Eli’s face.

This was an accident, but he had somehow created a potion that was so suitable for him.

However, Saleen Metatrin could not be blamed for this. Saleen Metatrin’s notes only recorded very proper magic medicines. How could he have recorded magic medicines that consumed the life force of an apprentice to increase mental power? That would simply be harmful.

“I’m finally on the right path.” Eli pursed his lips, feeling as if a strange path had opened up.

The next step was to do more experiments.

…

Three months later!

At home.

“It’s almost time!” after three months of verification, eli could already confirm that the potion had no other flaws other than consuming life force.

Today was the day he was going to take it.

His spiritual power was currently at 6.3.

After recording his stats, eli took out the medicine and consumed it directly.

The moment he consumed it, Eli felt as if something was flowing away, and his spiritual power began to grow slowly. All of this happened very quickly, yet very slowly.

If someone were to look at Eli right now, they would notice that he was in a very strange state. For example, his hair was turning white bit by bit, and wrinkles were gradually increasing on his face. But every time it happened, his hair would turn black again, and the wrinkles would disappear.

It was only half an hour later that the change gradually disappeared.

Eli examined himself again.

His spiritual energy had become 6.5.

It was an increase of 0.2 in one go, which wasn’t a lot, but for safety reasons, Eli only used the normal version and didn’t use the enhanced version.

At this rate, he would be able to advance to a level 2 apprentice in a year and a half.

However, taking into account the problem of drug resistance and the production period, it will take a little longer. It should be done in about two years. ” … ” eli fell into deep thought.

‘Please don’t let anything happen for the next two years.’

…

The passage of time was always fast and slow for eli.

Time was slow, but whenever he looked back, it felt like time had passed quickly.

When he felt the same feeling again, he realized that two years had passed.

And he was finally about to become a level 2 apprentice.

On this day, Eli specially applied for leave.

In the basement.

Eli felt his own state. His mental strength was 9.99, and on his right hand was a bottle of khorium No. 1 potion that he had just made. That was the name he had given the potion.

After all, although this originated from the dark blue potion, it had nothing to do with the dark blue potion in the end. Because of its life-force consumption effect, he named it khorium No. 1.

Eli immediately opened the bottle and drank it in one gulp.

The familiar feeling once again made Eli feel refreshed, but the increase in his spiritual power also made him happy.

Very quickly, his spiritual energy broke through 10 points mark and finally stopped at 10.1.

There were no accidents or bottlenecks. Of course, if he faced a problem now, then his talent would be worse than trash.

“I feel good.” After absorbing the potion, Eli felt the changes in himself.

As he advanced to a level 2 apprentice, he could feel more elements, and his ability to communicate with the elements in his body was also greatly enhanced.

Of course, this was only the main change. Eli’s physique also became stronger. Of course, this would take some time, but even so, Eli could already clearly feel that he was stronger.

As for how much stronger he was, he would only know after testing.

Immediately after a simple packing, Eli headed straight for the secret valley outside the arena.

In the valley, Eli focused his spirit and began to draw spirit runes, and in an instant, a huge fireball appeared before him.

The fireball was twice as big as when he was a level 1 apprentice. He could also feel that the temperature was much higher, and the power contained in it was much stronger.

The fireball instantly smashed into the stone wall not far away. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Boom!

A huge explosion was heard. The fireball on the stone wall exploded instantly. The flames spread out, and the power of the explosion directly smashed a big hole in the stone wall. Gravel flew in all directions like rain.

A wall of wind appeared and blocked these attacks.

Within the wind wall, a smile appeared on Eli’s face.

This was at least two times more powerful than when he was a level 1 apprentice. With other abilities, his combat power would soar immediately. There was also the staff, which could also increase part of his strength.

“My current strength should be much higher than a normal knight.” Although he had never fought a knight before, Eli had his own judgment.

After testing the fireball spell, Eli tested other spells. After getting the specific data, he left.

On the way out, eli saw that there seemed to be a lot more people in the nearby forest than usual.

“What happened?”

“What’s going on? ” Eli asked a man who was walking.

“We just heard some noise from this side, so we came to take a look. ”

The man was a little surprised to be suddenly called, but he still answered.

“Oh.” Eli nodded and left.

He should have set up a soundproof magic circle for the valley. The sound of the fireball explosion was indeed a little too loud. Of course, he did not have to worry about anything. Although there was no soundproofing, the place was well hidden. There were other ways to hide. Even an elite knight would not be able to find out anything.

There were many people along the way. Eli even saw a team of Knights from Jun Lin City, but they only cast a glance at him and ignored him.

After all, Eli was just an ordinary person.
