207 Fruits in Hand

“Oh, a murloc at the limit of the second-circle!”

Eli wasn’t surprised at all by the murloc’s appearance.

A long time ago, he had discovered that there was a murloc at the peak of the second ring. After all, this was the most important resource for murlocs, so it was reasonable for a powerful murloc to guard it.

However, one second-circle limit murloc wasn’t enough!

!!

Eli only glanced at him, and his gaze once again shifted to the water elemental fruit. The translucent water elemental fruit exuded a unique aura. It looked like an apple on the outside, and there seemed to be water flowing inside. It was quite peculiar.

The old murloc looked at Eli, his fish face twitching.

He had never been so speechless in his entire life. I warned you so seriously, but you didn’t even react. You’re looking down on murlocs.

“I’m warning you, human. This is not a place you should be.” The murlocs of the second circle continued to warn.

If the tribe had not been attacked, he would have immediately gathered the other murlocs. But now that the tribe had been invaded, he could only hope to drive away the human who had come.

What made him dumbfounded was that after the warning, the human ignored him. This made him very angry.

“Go to hell!” The murloc let out a furious roar, and a stream of water elements gathered in its hand. A giant underwater Python appeared in an instant, then rushed towards Eli.

It was as if Eli didn’t notice it at all. He simply extended his hand, and an elemental fluctuation flashed past his fingertips. Then, a small water ball streaked across the sea and flew towards the giant python.

“That’s all?” The murloc was disdainful. This little water ball was not even as big as one of the giant Python’s teeth!

However, the next moment, something that made him dumbfounded happened. He saw the water ball cross the water and directly pass through a part of the python. The next second, the huge python shattered with a loud bang.

The water element surged, and the giant python disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“This …”

The murloc’s eyes widened. How was this possible?

The human in front of him had actually destroyed his python with just a little water element. How was this possible? how deep was his understanding of the elements and observation skills?

“Who the hell are you?!” The murloc roared with all its might, looking at Eli with increasing fear.

But what made him speechless was that it was as if Eli didn’t even pay attention to him. At this moment, he had already walked to the side of the water elemental fruit and was ready to pick it!

The second-circle murloc, “…”

Are you blind? can’t you see me?

The old murloc’s eyes widened, and his body trembled. He felt insulted. “Don’t look down on the old murloc!”

His power gathered once again. The murloc roared in anger and moved quickly toward Eli. He swung his right fist, and the sound of water breaking through the air was heard as he smashed it toward Eli.

“Go to hell!” The murloc revealed its sharp teeth, its eyes filled with anger.

The fist that was like a bone came crashing down, and then, he saw Eli’s left hand block it. His body didn’t even move an inch. His full-powered strike didn’t cause any damage.

“Run!”

At this point, the murloc realized that it was no match for Eli and immediately turned to escape.

But in the next second, a suction force seemed to appear. He felt as if there was a huge suction force coming from behind him. Although he tried his best to run in the opposite direction, he was pulled closer and closer to Eli.

“What is this?” The murloc had a look of horror on his face as he looked behind him. At that moment, a Black Vortex was appearing in Eli’s palm, and the suction force was coming from it.

The murloc was dumbfounded, then watched helplessly as he got closer and closer to Eli.

A few seconds later, his head was pinched in Eli’s hand, and their eyes met.

“I’m sorry, I might have been a little loud just now!” The old murloc forced a smile and said as politely as he could.

“It’s fine!” Eli shook his head and crushed the old murloc’s head. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The murlocs at his current level did not pose much of a threat to him. As for the vortex just now, it was an application of the devouring rune, the devouring gravity.

He could rely on the devouring power to interfere with the other party’s actions.

water elemental fruit!

Without the murlocs’ interference, Eli could finally harvest the huge water elemental fruit.

Eli took out a box.

There was a jelly-like liquid inside at the moment. It had a strange color in the water. This was prepared by Eli in advance to store the water elemental fruits.

The water element fruit was different from ordinary materials. Once it was out of the water, it would lose all its function within three minutes and had to be specially preserved.

Soon, Eli had collected all the water elemental fruits.

After he was done collecting the fruits, Eli continued his search. He quickly collected all the precious magical plants there. These were all precious marine plants that were rarely seen on land, so he naturally had to collect more on this trip.

Five minutes later, Eli looked at the empty underwater magical herb garden and prepared to leave.

However, he returned after taking a few steps.

“I almost forgot about you!” Eli raised his head and looked at the water element fruit tree, then began to dig.

A few minutes later, Eli left the place after he finished digging up the fruit tree. However, he did not leave immediately. Instead, he transformed again and swam towards the murloc tribe.

He wanted to see how the battle between the two races was going.

Soon, he arrived at the edge of the battle and stopped at a nearby reef. He could observe from there and also ensure that he could escape if he was discovered.

After hiding himself well, Eli began to observe the battle.

At this time, the murlocs were in a terrible situation on the battlefield. They were at a disadvantage.

Hu Wei was fighting a strong murloc at the peak of the second circle. Not far away, there was another murloc priest harassing him. The other places were also in a chaotic battle.

“The devil whales are indeed very strong!”

Eli looked at Hu Wei and sighed.

...

The innate advantages of different races were too great. With the help of its huge body, Hu Wei was far superior to the murloc in terms of strength and explosive power. Although the two of them were at the same level, the murloc had no hope of winning at all.

This was one of the cruelties of the world.

Your fate had already been decided when you were born. This couldn’t be changed and wouldn’t be changed.

Thinking about it this way, Eli was quite lucky. He was still a human after all.

Following Hu Wei’s attack, streams of water lashed out at the murlocs. The murloc in the second circle were in a precarious situation and were almost caught several times.

As for the other areas, the murlocs also suffered heavy casualties.

It seemed like the murlocs’ defeat was only a matter of time.

That was what Eli thought as well, but in the next second, something unexpected happened. He saw the murloc priest take out a statue from somewhere.

This statue was very strange. It also had the appearance of a murloc, but it was not of the same race as this murloc. Instead, it was a closer bloodline of the murlocs, which was a mermaid.

It was a Mermaid statue that looked very broken. It emitted a gentle light in the water, and interestingly, Eli could sense that it seemed to be attached with a magical power.

Hu Wei was originally attacking, but when he saw the statue, he was shocked as well. It was as if this thing shouldn’t have appeared here.

...

Huala Huala …

The priest chanted a mysterious incantation, and the statue began to emit a mysterious aura. At the same time, a white light began to shine from it, and a huge mermaid holding a Trident slowly appeared. His appearance was exactly the appearance of the statue.

“A merman!” When Hu Wei saw this scene, he was shocked and shouted, ” damn it, this is actually the territory of the merfolk. Damn it, we were one step too slow!!”

Seeing the figure, Hu Wei immediately fled.

“You’re too late!” The merman slowly raised his Trident and pointed it at the second-circle murloc. His aura instantly rose to the level of a third circle. The statue also slowly fell to the ground.

The murloc shouted, and his aura instantly soared. A powerful aura wrapped around his body, and the waves rolled. After a loud roar, he chased after Hu Wei.

His speed was very fast, and in the blink of an eye, he had already arrived not far from Hu Wei.

He held the bone spear in his hand and waved it gently. Water elements began to gather, and an underwater tornado appeared. With a terrifying power, it violently smashed toward Hu Wei.

Bang! Bang!

One attack, just one attack. Hu Wei was hit, and his tail fin was instantly annihilated. A large amount of blood flowed out, but Hu Wei didn’t care at all. Instead, he took out a green stone. The stone instantly turned into an arc of light and took him away.

Roar!

At this time, the murloc that had temporarily leveled up to the third circle let out an angry roar. Knowing that it could not catch up, it returned to the murloc camp and looked at the remaining intruders with a powerful aura.

The battle began.

Half an hour later, the murloc had returned to the second circle. By then, the enemies had all been dealt with. He walked toward the priest and said, “High priest.”

“Yes.” The priest nodded and sighed, “The statue has been drained even further. What a pity.”

“Yes.” The leader of the murloc nodded. That was true.

The priest was a little depressed. He turned around and was about to put away the statue, but he saw that the water in front of him was empty. There was no statue.

The priest blinked his eyes in confusion.

Where’s my statue?

“The statue has been stolen!” The priest looked anxious. The statue was one of their most important things. They could not lose it!

The leader of the murlocs seemed to have understood something as well, and he also helped in the search.

Ten minutes later, the two murlocs looked at each other. They had to admit that the statue really seemed to be gone.

“Sir, something has happened.”

Suddenly, another murloc swam over from not far away with an anxious look.

“What’s wrong? Calm down.” The murloc priest asked. The statue was gone, so he didn’t think there was anything else that could be worse.

The murloc nodded. The priest was indeed a priest. A few seconds later, he slowly said, ” Lord priest, the magical herb garden has been wiped out, and the water element fruit tree has been dug away!”

A cry of alarm rang out, and the priest felt dizzy. What did he hear? The demonic plant garden was gone!

The priest felt his blood surge, and then his vision went black, and he fainted.

“High Priest!”

For a moment, the entire camp was in chaos.

No one knew who the hell did these wicked things.
