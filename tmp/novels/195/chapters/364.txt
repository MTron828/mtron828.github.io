365 The End (2)

” Sigh. Since you’re so stubborn, I’ll give you another surprise. ” Vya shook her head and let out a roar.

Bang!

A loud explosion rang in Glen’s ears. He ignored it, but a series of explosions followed.

“What happened?”

Glen couldn’t help but glance at the ground, but this glance almost made him faint.

At this moment, the entire Bloodline City was filled with smoke. There was even a crack in the city wall, and smoke was billowing from it.

“Your sub-towers don’t seem to be very reliable. Quite a few of them have joined us, especially those three most powerful ones.” At this moment, Vya also stopped and smiled at Glen. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Glen gritted his teeth, tears almost flowing out of his eyes.

Was the Bloodline Tower really going to fall in his hands? Besides, Alida was also on the city wall.

Seeing that Glen was in a bad mood, Vya instantly attacked. Glen was caught off guard, and a 30-meter-long wound appeared on his chest. Large amounts of green blood flowed out and dripped down.

“Hahahaha!” Vya laughed and attacked again, not giving Glen any chance to catch his breath.

Glen was barely holding on, and the situation quickly worsened.

…

Cough, cough, cough!

Alida crawled out of the pile of rocks with much difficulty. Her clothes were torn, and her entire body was covered in dust.

The area where she was just now was the area of the explosion. She had relied on her late-stage second circle power to avoid the explosion, but she had also suffered a certain amount of injuries.

When she stood up and looked at the cracked city wall and the broken limbs of the Warlocks, she felt a sense of sadness.

“Isn’t this Miss Alida?”

Suddenly, a voice came from afar.

Alida stood up and looked up. A few figures were walking towards them. The one leading them was the shifty-eyed Warlock from earlier.

However, he looked at Alida coldly.

“Are you the traitor?” Alida said angrily.

“It’s just for survival.” The Warlock shook his head and glanced at Alida. “I thought that Miss had already left. I didn’t expect her to be here still. What a pleasant surprise. ”

“Don’t tell me you’re interested in this woman.” A tall Warlock beside him frowned. He was the Warlock from the other tower that day.

“Of course not.”

” Then hurry up and kill her. We still have other things to do. ” Another Warlock said.

“Alright.” The shifty-eyed Warlock nodded and approached Alida. He shrugged and said,” What a pity. If this were any other place, I would have tortured you to death. Unfortunately, I’m very busy today, so I can only ask you to die quickly. ”

The Warlock got closer and closer, and the aura he gave off became stronger and stronger until he was at the half-step celestial level.

Alida’s face darkened. She patted her pocket, but there was no reaction. In fact, ever since Jalin appeared, Hydra had been like a dead person. It did not react at all. Hydra didn’t even protect her during the explosion just now. It was completely different from before.

She felt that this was Hydra’s way of protecting itself.

The Warlock walked over in large strides. Alida still wanted to resist, but she was easily knocked down by the Warlock. The Warlock then grabbed her neck and used more and more strength, but Hydra still did not react.

Alida felt as if her neck was about to break, and the world around her was becoming more and more blurry.

Hiss!

Suddenly, she heard a sound in her ear, and her pocket moved.

In the next second, a shadow instantly spread out and wrapped around Alida. The Warlock was also dumbfounded, but he still instinctively retreated. However, the shadow was even faster. In the blink of an eye, it had caught up to him and pulled him towards Alida.

“No!”

The Warlock wanted to resist, but the shadow was even stronger. He had no chance to resist at all.

In the shadow of Alida, a huge snake gradually appeared and swallowed the Warlock in one gulp.

In the next second, the shadow dissipated. Alida fell to the ground and panted heavily. She struggled to get up.

“Thank you, Lord Hydra.” Alida thanked Hydra, who had already crawled out of the shadows and revealed himself.

“What exactly is this?” The other Warlocks were also dumbfounded, but in the next second, more shadows devoured them.

In fact, they weren’t the only ones who were shocked. The few celestials present also looked at the city wall.

They could feel the aura of a celestial.

The Bloodline Tower actually had a second celestial.

In the sky, Vya looked at Glen and said, “I didn’t expect you guys to have true spirits. You’ve hidden them well!”

But what she didn’t know was that Glen was also dumbfounded.

How could he not know about his party’s situation?

Could it be Alida…

Glen’s eyes flickered. Previously, Alida seemed to have told them the truth, but he didn’t continue to listen. The reinforcement came.

No way!

Glen looked down.

On the other side, Arona, who was wreaking havoc on the battlefield, looked over. He saw Hydra directly.

“Celestial!” Arona grinned hideously and then prepared to attack.

“Alona, let me handle this.” The next second, Alona suddenly heard Jalin’s voice and was stunned.

...

In the next second, he saw a huge poisonous attack smashing toward the ground. Its destination was where Alida was.

Bang!

A huge explosion was heard, and endless smoke and dust rose.
