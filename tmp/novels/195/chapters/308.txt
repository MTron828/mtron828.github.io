309 Breakthrough, Breakthrough

On the other side.

After returning to the bloodline tower, Eli gave Aisha some instructions and started a new round of preparation.

After that, the changes in the Sofia mountain range were also noticed by many people.

Everyone was shocked, but no one knew why so many beasts had died there. At first, many people wanted to investigate, but in the end, no conclusion was reached, and it was classified as a suspicious case!

..

Seven years later. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

With the sound of a door opening, a mage Tower that had not been opened for many years opened.

Eli walked out.

“It’s been seven years!”

The sun shone on his face, and he felt very comfortable.

Originally, he had estimated that he would be able to reach 470 points of mental power in five years. However, when he reached 470 points, he realized that it did not seem to be his limit. Thus, he continued to meditate and finally reached 472 points of mental power. Since then, his mental power had been completely perfected and could not be improved any further.

The next step was to break through to the celestial realm!

In fact, Eli had already made a lot of preparations.

Mental power was only the last gate. Now that the gate had been opened, there was only one way to break through. There was no other choice.

The changes in his mage Tower were naturally noticed.

After a while, Aisha came over with her people.

“Grandmaster!” Aisha said respectfully, and the people behind her also lowered their heads respectfully.

However, many of them didn’t recognize Herman, and only a few of them knew about Eli. They were all shocked because some of them hadn’t seen him for almost two hundred years. They even thought that he might be dead.

“Grandmaster, you’ve come out this time for?” Aisha asked curiously.

Eli looked at the crowd and didn’t answer. Instead, he asked, “Have you prepared the things I asked you to collect over the years?”

“Grandmaster, we’re ready!” Aisha said.

All these years, they had been collecting soul crystals and other things.

“Sure, then leave it all to me.” Eli nodded. It was still very convenient to have a force.

“Alright. Are you leaving, Grandmaster?” Alice asked.

“Yes, I’ll leave for a while.” he said, nodding. “ask Nikola to come as well. He’ll be going out with me this time.”

“Yes!” Aisha nodded.

Unlike Vivika, who could easily ask some private questions, she was more like a subordinate of Eli.

Soon, dozens of space rings were sent over, and Nikola also came.

“My Lord!” Nikola came before Eli and said respectfully.

At this moment, Nikola’s strength was even stronger than before. However, when a silver light flashed in Eli’s eyes, he saw that black spots had already appeared on Nikola’s soul body as if it had rotted.

“What?” Eli was stunned.

The undead naturally had lifespans, but their lifespans were different from ordinary people. As long as they kept absorbing mental power, their strength would continue to rise. However, this process could not be stopped. Once it stopped, the soul body would start to decay.

Nikola, who was now at the limit of the third circle, naturally did not lack ordinary souls, but it was difficult to find souls of the same level, so Nikola’s condition was not very good these years.

“You don’t look like you’re in good condition!” Eli looked at Nikola and said.

“Your Excellency can see it too, but I should still be able to hold on for a few more decades!” Nikola sighed. As his level increased, it was indeed getting harder and harder for him.

“I wonder what my Lord needs me to do?” He changed the topic and asked.

“Breakthrough!” At that moment, Aisha and the others had already left. Eli didn’t hide anything and told him directly.

“What?” Nikola’s voice suddenly rose, and he looked at Eli in surprise.

Had he finally reached this stage?

“I need you to protect me together with Hydra!” Eli said again.

“Yes!” Nikola immediately said. If his lordship became stronger, then maybe he could change his situation.

“then let’s go. This time, I’ve chosen the southern area as the location for my breakthrough!”

After that, the two of them left the bloodline tower and headed south.

..

A day later.

The two of them arrived at the White Tower area, but they did not stop.

They continued to head south until they reached the territory of the shadow lizard Warlock Academy.

That’s right, this time, Eli had set the location for his advancement to be at the very edge of the West Coast, where external interference could be reduced to the greatest extent.

It was not that he did not want to go further south or even Bryne, but the concentration of elements there was too low, and it was not suitable for a breakthrough.

“My Lord, where is the place you chose?”

Nikola followed Eli in the sky and asked curiously.

“We’ve arrived!”

Suddenly, Eli, who had been in front all this while, spoke up. His speed also began to slow down as he flew toward the ground. Nikola followed him silently and saw where they were.

“Isn’t this the camp of the shadow lizard warlocks? However, it has been abandoned for a long time.” Nikola looked at the ground. This was the place where Eli first came into contact with warlocks.

...

“That’s right!”

At this moment, Eli had already landed on the ground, and the former campsite was right in front of him.

However, as the White Tower moved North, this place was completely abandoned. There were only broken houses and a dirty and messy environment, so Eli chose this place as the place for his breakthrough.

“Nikola, you go and clean up,” ordered Eli.

“Yes!”

Thousands of spirits of the dead emerged from Nikola’s soul body and flew forward, beginning to clean up the place for Eli.

In the process, Eli strolled around for a while.

He was filled with emotions.

Very quickly, the place was tidied up. Meanwhile, Eli was at the center of the square and began to inscribe a spell formation, layer by layer, extremely complicated.

This process lasted for half a month before he finally stopped.

At this moment, a huge hexagram was carved in the center of the town. There was a complicated spell formation carved on it. If an acolyte or even a first circle Mage saw it, they would feel dizzy.

...

Other than that, the area within a kilometer was filled with spell formations. To be honest, the cost of this step was no less than the value of soul crystals because he had used the best materials.

After that, hundreds of thousands of soul crystals piled up on the ground, like a few small mountains spread out around the hexagram, emitting waves of fluctuations.

there are also Tier 4 potions!

After that, Eli took out a four-circle soul crystal and put it on his chest, then took out an orange-red potion. It was made from the Comoros fruit that Jin Ji gave him.

When the preparation work was over, Eli called Nikola over.

“Nikola, if anyone tries to enter within a few kilometers, kill them!” This time, Eli ordered directly.

“Yes!” Nikola nodded. He understood that this time it was a matter of success or death, but with His Excellency’s talent, it would definitely not be a problem.

Watching Nikola leave, Eli summoned tens of thousands of undead skeletons. The undead was in charge of the sky, while the skeletons were in charge of the ground and underground.

Next, Hydra was also summoned.

“Go, guard this area!” Eli touched Hydra’s head.

Hydra rubbed his head before leaving. The current Hydra was able to fight several half-step celestial warlocks.

Seeing that he had done everything he needed to do, Eli looked up at the sky, then sat in the center of the hexagram, closed his eyes, and meditated over and over again.

He needed to let his spirit, soul, and even bloodline reach their peak.

Half a month later.

With a deep breath, Eli closed his eyes.

There was only determination in his eyes.

It was time to break through.
