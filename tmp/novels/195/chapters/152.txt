153 Waiting

“Mr. Roland, you said you wanted to join our camp? ”

Three men and one woman were in a room in the tall mage Tower.

The commander of the camp, Lincoln, was lying on the sofa. His face and body were full of wrinkles, and his bright eyes had become dull. However, when he heard that this powerful mage in front of him wanted to join the camp, his eyes lit up.

Although he was a peak first circle Mage, he was already old. Furthermore, he had just gone through a huge battle, so his life force was not enough to allow him to live much longer. However, the camp needed a strong mage leader.

“Yes,” Eli nodded.

!!

He was sitting opposite the first circle Mage, while Hae and Tijie were sitting on the sofa on both sides.

“Then, can you tell me the reason? I really don’t understand why a first-circle mage as strong as you would want to join us.” Lincoln coughed and asked weakly.

“Maybe I’m too tired. I also want to find a place to rest.” Eli said in a desolate manner.

“Just like that?” Lincoln raised his eyebrows. This was not a good reason.

“Lord Lincoln, Lord Roland is so powerful. He can also provide us with protection. Isn’t that a good thing? ” Said Tijie.

“No, I don’t think so. Although he saved us, it’s not appropriate to let him join so rashly. Besides, he’s the strongest in the camp. We can’t stop him if he wants to do something.” Hae looked at Eli and said with a frown.

“Why would we stop him?” Tijie asked curiously.

“In any case, I don’t agree.” Hae shook his head. He would never agree. Even if he were killed, he would never agree.

For a time, the scene fell into silence again.

A few seconds later, Lincoln asked again, ” Mr. Roland, if you join us, what identity would you like to use? ”

“If I join, I hope that it will be as a battalion commander,” Eli replied straightforwardly.

Lincoln blinked his eyes.

Hae’s eyes were wide open as he looked at Eli. He couldn’t believe that he would be so arrogant, and asked, “On what basis?”

“Because I’m the strongest.” It was still very calm, but it was indeed the reality.

Hae and Lincoln fell into silence once again. Tijie also pretended to be silent. After all, no one knew that she was actually Eli’s follower.

“Oh, I forgot to mention, I have a channel for magic plants, and I can provide it to the camp when the time comes.” After a few seconds of silence, Eli looked at the three of them and spoke again.

“What?”

“Wait.”

As soon as he said that, Eli instantly saw the three of them staring straight at him.

“You say you have magic plant materials?” Lincoln asked, enunciating each word as if he wanted to hear a confirmation from Eli.

Looking at the man’s burning gaze, Eli seemed to have understood something. These mage camps in the wild didn’t have huge herb fields, and materials were in short supply all year round. It could be said that whoever could solve this problem would not only join but also…

“Yes,” Eli nodded.

“Good. From today onwards, you will be the battalion commander of the camp,” Lincoln said quickly, afraid that Eli would renege.

“Yeah, I agree too.” Hae also said hurriedly, completely forgetting his previous complaints.

“You agree just like that?” The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. He even wanted to settle it with force, but he didn’t expect it to be like this.

“That’s right, you’ve already solved the problem of the magic potion and plant. You saved us. You deserve to be a battalion commander.” Hae said.

Eli finally understood how difficult it was to set up camp.

“Fine, from today on, I will be the battalion commander here.” Eli nodded. The magical plants in his arcane realm were now harvested once a year, and he would never be able to use them all up by himself. It was just right to take action.

“Alright,” Lincoln also stood up at this moment and extended his hand as he looked at Eli.

Eli glanced at the three of them, then shook their hands.

With this, he was the manager of this place.

“I’ll announce you as the new battalion commander tomorrow. Go and rest for today. Tijie, bring Lord Roland to his room.” Said Lincoln.

“Yes.”

The next day.

In the middle of the camp.

Lincoln announced in front of everyone that Eli would be the new battalion commander. Everyone was in an uproar, expressing their objection. After all, saving lives and being their leader were two different things.

However, the objection only lasted for a dozen minutes. As Eli went on stage and announced that he could bring magical plant materials to everyone, everyone immediately shut up and began to shout his name.

The mages could not refuse the supply of magic plant materials.

…

“Tijie, tell me about the current situation of the camp.” In one of the rooms, Eli asked Tijie.

Right now, he had completed the transition of power, and Eli had more or less taken control of the camp. Lincoln had also burned too much of his life force previously, so he could probably only live for a while longer.

There was also Tijie and Hae. Since Tijie was his slave, he didn’t care much about her. Hae was only a first-circle Magus, so he didn’t take him seriously.

“master, there are four first circle mages in the camp, including you, so that’s the four of us. There are about 78 zero circle Wizards and about 200 to 300 slaves. That’s all we have.” Tijie reported.

Eli nodded.

“What about our financial situation?”

“Well, there are still more than 100 magic stones in the camp’s warehouse. The magic plant resources are worth about 500 magic stones, and the magic potions are only about 200 to 300 magic stones.” Tijie lowered her head because the data was too bad.

“So little?” Eli was stunned, no wonder Lincoln agreed so readily.

This was an empty campsite, but luckily, what Eli wanted was people.

“hmm, since that’s the case, let’s make arrangements for the reconstruction after the beast tide. We’ll take our time with the follow-up work.” Eli nodded.

“Yes, may I ask my Lord a question?” Tijie suddenly asked.

“Of course, you can.”

“My Lord, did you come here because of the war between the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy and the blood Alliance?” Tijie asked.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

Speaking of this, the war suddenly broke out on the day of the killing. The blood Alliance actually started the war ahead of schedule, and the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy immediately shrank its forces and responded actively.

Of course, Kratos was still a member of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy on the surface and had not rebelled yet, so Eli didn’t have to do anything for now and was still waiting for Kratos’ news.

“Alright, I’ll take my leave then.” Tijie was just curious, so she left after asking, leaving Eli alone in the room.

“Sigh, I’ll just have to slowly develop here until the war ends. If I become a camp leader, I’ll need to become stronger. I’m still too weak now. I need to at least reach the limit of first circle. Otherwise, this might not be a good thing.” Eli shook his head. New opportunities would often bring new crises.

If one didn’t have the ability to deal with the crisis, opportunities could often turn into disasters.

…

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Eli had also completely settled down here.

As the battalion commander here, and with a large number of resources, it was easy for him to get a lot of mage books from the others and learn a lot of interesting things.

For example, combined sorcery. If he could fuse all the skeletons, it would definitely be very powerful. Of course, this also required a certain method, but Eli felt that he could make something out of it.

There was also the issue of the fluctuations of the devouring power. Eli had already spread it out to the camp, forcing all the apprentices to participate. At first, everyone was very resistant, but when Eli offered a huge salary, everyone stopped saying anything.

The status of mages on the West Coast was too low, and there was a lack of powerful organizations. This caused them to have no suitable territories, and it was difficult to get resources. It could be said that before Eli’s arrival, they were all below the poverty line, so the sudden arrival of Eli made these poor mages a little uncomfortable.

They were both mages. How could Eli be so rich?

Just as Eli was using these mages to develop his own power, the war between the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy and the blood Alliance had also begun.

To a certain extent, the two forces were on the same level, so once they started fighting, they would only be testing each other.

After testing the waters for a month, the two sides finally started a real war.

Even 1st circle warlocks often died, let alone acolytes. Dozens of acolytes died every day, causing the two forces to feel heartache.

However, at present, the Blood Alliance still had the overall advantage. After all, they had been preparing for a long time. At the beginning of the war, they had directly taken down several territories of the shadow lizard Warlock Academy, causing them to suffer heavy losses.

The long-planned infiltration also allowed them to have a better understanding of the Academy’s situation, and they were always able to make more appropriate decisions, which made the Academy very uncomfortable.

Therefore, a month later. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The shadow lizard Warlock Academy had completely withdrawn all unnecessary personnel, choosing to abandon the edge parts to protect the main body, which allowed them to regain some rhythm for the time being.

The two forces once again fell into a battle of equal strength.

And this continuous battle lasted for more than two years.

On the other hand, Eli learned about the outside world from Kratos’ token and Ross. Kratos’s rebellion, which he had been waiting for, did not come. It seemed that the Blood Alliance was going for the long haul. After all, a war between warlocks was different from a war between mortals that lasted a few days or a few months. It was not surprising that it would last for more than a decade.

This also made Eli feel even more fortunate that he had left this muddy water ahead of time.

And just when Eli thought he would have to wait another two years.

A year later, just as Eli finished a day of experiments, Kratos suddenly sent a message.

“We’ll take action in three months.”
