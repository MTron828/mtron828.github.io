432 Encounter with a Central Region Warlock

“Why am I here?”

Eli’s eyes were dull as he stared blankly at the scene in front of him!

In front of him, the dazzling sunlight came from billions of miles away and shone behind him. Behind him was a huge planet.

This planet was situated in the void. Its size was the largest that Eli had ever seen in his life. It was at least seven to eight times larger than Earth in his previous life. The blue sea occupied most of the area, and there were many continents in it. The green and yellow continents intersected, and the outer layer was white clouds. Even further, there was a layer of elements wrapped in countless elements.

!!

The light from countless Morning Stars turned into a gorgeous background, like a beautiful painting!

” I’ve been teleported to the outer space of the warlock World! ” Eli’s mouth twitched as he looked at the warlock World.

He could clearly feel that his body was almost falling vertically to the ground!

After crossing nearly 700 kilometers, Eli directly left the warlock World!

“How interesting!”

Eli raised his eyebrows slightly. He was in the void, and there was nothing under his feet.

This was also his first time entering the outer layer of the warlock World. Generally speaking, a fourth-circle could already survive in the void.

Therefore, Eli could have entered the void a long time ago, but he had not come for two reasons.

Firstly, he didn’t have a clone before, and he didn’t know what was going on in the outer void, so he didn’t come out. Secondly, he was busy and didn’t have time.

This unexpected coincidence had brought Eli here, and it was a rare experience.

However, this time, he also discovered that the situation outside the warlock World was a little different from what he had imagined.

What he had just described was only the warlock World itself. The other places were rather shocking. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Eli turned his head to look in front of him, which was the vast void beyond the warlock world!

It was not endless darkness, but rather, there were many shimmering continents or world fragments. Most of them were embedded in the void and hidden spaces, and these fragments were scattered in every corner of the outer layer of the warlock World!

In between, there was also a large amount of space junk. Whether it was the broken space satellite of the Mage Era or the Sky Castle that had been broken into countless pieces, they could all be seen. They had been floating quietly in the void for countless years!

At this moment, Eli finally understood why there were so few Magi returning from the outside world and why he had not heard of any race coming to the warlock World to seek revenge through the Void for so many years!

” So many world fragments. It seems that the battle back then was really terrifying! ” Eli felt his breathing quicken.

Even if they were only visible to the naked eye, there were at least ten thousand worlds in front of him. As for those hidden worlds, there were probably at least a hundred thousand world fragments. The formation of world fragments was often more demanding.

At this moment, Eli recalled the impact of that war in his mind, as well as that civilization, the powerful civilization that Nikola called the dark and strange civilization.

“An eight-circle powerhouse from the Dark and Strange Civilization has fallen, and two eight-circle powerhouses from the mage Civilization have fallen.” Eli’s throat moved slightly. Eight-circle, that was almost the peak power of the endless world. Even if it was only a seven-circle creature, it could be destroyed unconsciously if it entered an ordinary world. The power of an eight-circle was unimaginable to Eli!

They could easily crush a world, cross several galaxies in one step, and even create a world!

However, three of such powerful existences had died. One could completely imagine the cruelty of that war.

“Awesome!” Eli sighed.

Other than that, he saw more. No wonder the Mages left without worry. It seemed like they had created a layer of protection for their hometown!

With such a layer of world shield, it was almost impossible to break through, even if it was a large world. Even the Sky City of the Mage World would probably be smashed into pieces by the world fragments and become part of the ” space trash “.

“The mage Alliance has arranged everything!” Eli sighed, feeling happy from the bottom of his heart.

Perhaps some mage wanted to leave this cursed world after breaking through to the fourth circle, but Eli didn’t have the slightest intention of doing so.

The price to pay was his lifespan, which was the most useless to him. Moreover, the mages in this world had left behind enough for him to grow. Since he knew that the threat from the outside world could not enter, it was great news. This meant that his living environment would be safer.

He just wanted to have a stable environment and slowly become stronger until he could have the power to protect himself when hewas exposed.

“That’s great!”

Eli pursed his lips. Today was a double blessing. Not only did he understand the significance of the spatial teleportation array, but he also received good news.

“But …” Eli pursed his lips and looked at the world fragments that were like stars.

Although these fragments carried the effect of a ” firewall, ” they were also treasures. There might be a lot of good things!

“Do I want to take a look?”

Eli pursed his lips. Since he had already made preparations to abandon this clone, it would be better to do so now. He could also explore a world fragment and see what these world fragments were like. He wanted to see if there was a chance to get some treasure!

Thinking of this, Eli’s figure turned into a golden light and flew towards a world fragment.

Whoosh!

“Sir, it is not recommended to enter the world fragments in this area at will.”

Suddenly, a slightly aged voice came from behind and stopped Ely.

” Thank you for the reminder. Is there something wrong with this area? ” Eli was also surprised to encounter a Warlock.

“Haha, hello. I am a Warlock from the Thousand-Eyed Tree Demon clan in the central region. You can call me Gade Davan.” the old man said with a smile.

Warlocks from the Central Region?

” Hello, I’m Eli from the Bloodline Tower of the Western Regions! ” Eli nodded, but he was more curious about why Gade had stopped him.
