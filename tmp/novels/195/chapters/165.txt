166 Whack-a-Mole

After leaving the forest, Eli changed into a common face and set off toward the target area.

Along the way, there were many signs of battle. It was obvious that the warlocks of the White Tower and the Blood Alliance were fighting non-stop. Eli could only pray for their good luck.

Soon, he arrived at the demonic plant garden.

“It’s inside?”

Eli’s eyes lit up, and a large area came into view. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The tall fence was carved with fine runes, and although he was not close, Eli could already feel the aura of a large area of high-quality magical plants. If he was not wrong, they should all be in the magical plant garden.

However, at this time, there seemed to be a lot of auras outside the gate of the secret realm, and there were faint sounds coming from inside.

“It seems like someone is one step ahead of us!” Eli thought for a moment, and a large shadow shrouded him as he sneaked into the magical plant garden.

…

At this moment, in the magical plant garden.

“Damn it, these spell formations seem to absorb natural energy, so they haven’t broken yet.” A first-circle warlock looked at the protective barrier in front of him and frowned.

He turned his head to look at the other places.

This was the magic herb field. There were many precious plants growing in the area. Not only were these plants precious, but they were also very old. They were at least magic plants from the first and second circles. What made his teeth tingle was that every inch of the magic herb field was covered with a spell formation.

“Klee, let’s decide how we’ll split it.” Suddenly, another voice sounded.

At this time, he was not alone. In the wide area, there were seven or eight first-circle warlocks and more than 20 apprentices, all of whom were Wizards from the Blood Alliance.

They had all agreed to come here to reap a harvest as soon as they entered the secret realm.

“Split it?” Klee looked in the direction of the voice. The other first circle warlocks and apprentices all looked over.

“Of course, we’re not the only ones in this secret realm. There are people from the White Tower as well. We’re here first, but we can’t guarantee that they won’t come here when we’re harvesting.” A Warlock glanced at him and said.

“Yes.” Klee nodded. It should be so.

They quickly came up with a plan.

“According to our plan, we’ll split up and head to other places after we’re done here. How about this? We’ll each pick an area and break the spell formation. Whoever breaks it will take it. The first circle Warlocks can do it themselves, while the other apprentices can work together to break it. What do you think?” Someone suggested.

“Sure.”

“Sure.”

Everyone nodded.

“Then I’ll take this piece of dragon scale grass. This magic plant can increase the compatibility of bloodlines and increase the possibility of a Warlock with a first-circle bloodline breaking through to the second-circle to explore the depths of their bloodline.” A first-circle warlock made the first choice.

“Then I’ll take the snake scale fruit. It can increase the defensive power of my scales, and is suitable for my kemoyin bloodline.”

One by one, the first circle warlocks quickly chose the most valuable magic plants, and the apprentices divided the rest. Klee looked at the center of the magic herb field and said, “then I’ll take this field of Bloodsoul flowers. I think I saw a Blood soul flower in the second circle among them. It’s worth a lot.”

The blood soul Flower was currently one of the most valuable magical plants here, but the defensive power of the spell formation was also very strong, so very few people chose it. However, he was at the late stage of One circle, which was why he was so confident.

“Then let’s start!”

Everyone began to move. Klee took a deep breath, and hot flames shot out of his body, turning into a pillar of fire and bombarding the spell formation.

Flames scattered in all directions, and the temperature here instantly rose. The energy of the shield was also rapidly consumed. This shield could not be maintained for long by only relying on natural elements.

Other than him, the other warlocks did the same. Some used the elemental power of their bloodlines to attack, while others relied on the power of their bloodlines to directly attack using their physical bodies.

“There’s still the protective shield!”

At that moment, in the shadows a distance away from them, Eli watched them work in full swing.

“Should I make a move now or later?” Eli was also very envious of these people, and he didn’t expect to find the Bloodsoul flower so easily.

But after thinking for a few seconds, he didn’t attack. Instead, he walked out the door.

Anyway, according to what they said, they would leave after breaking through the spell formation. He just had to guard the door and wait for them to come out, and then Eli would snatch them one by one.

This was more comfortable. He didn’t have to attack the protective shield himself.

Soon, Eli walked out of the entrance of the magical plant garden and waited on the side.

A dozen seconds later, he seemed to feel that something was wrong, so he set up another spell formation, hiding the area.

“I’m too considerate. This way, they can rest assured and farm for me, no, for themselves.” Eli took out a small stool and waited by the door.

Half an hour later.

Suddenly, Eli heard a shattering sound, and his eyes lit up. He stood up and took out his wizard staff.

…

“I’ve really earned a lot this time. So many snake scale fruits from the first and second circles. I’m afraid they’re worth almost 100 mid-grade magic stones. As expected, this unexplored secret realm is still the best!”

The first circle warlock walked out of the magical plant garden while holding a huge bag containing his harvest.

“I have to hide these first and take them when I go out later.”

Ordinary warlocks didn’t have any spatial equipment, but it would be troublesome if someone saw so many valuable snake scale fruits. Therefore, he could only hide them for now.

He finally saw the gate after passing through the road.

Seeing the door, the Warlock immediately sped up.

After a few seconds, he arrived at the door and walked out.

“Eh, is it dark already?”

The Warlock was puzzled. Why was it pitch black the moment he walked out of the door?

Something was wrong!

The Warlock immediately reacted, but in the darkness, a wand was already flying toward his head. It was too sudden, and he had no way to block it. He could only watch as the wand hit his head.

Bang!

In the next second, his soul trembled, and the Warlock seemed to have encountered something. He fell unconscious and fell to the ground.

After the Warlock fell unconscious, the shadow gradually dispersed, revealing Eli.

He was holding a magic wand in one hand, and runes were activated on the wand. This was the key to knocking the Warlock out.

“Wow, snake scale fruit, not bad, not bad.” Eli looked at the things in the bag and smiled. He could use this thing too. Long-term consumption should be able to strengthen the defense of his scales.

Soon, he stripped the warlock naked and threw him aside.

“Who will be the next lucky one?” Taking out the small bench again, Eli waited patiently.

In the time that followed, it was as if Eli was playing whack-a-mole.

The warlocks came out to be whacked one after another.

Sitting on the small folding stool, Eli turned his head to look. Not far away, dozens of warlocks had been stripped of their clothes and piled up like a small hill.

“A man on top of a man, it’s a little blinding to the eyes.” Eli clicked his tongue.

If he remembered correctly, there should be 38 people in that group. There were still two people missing.

Half an hour later.

As Eli knocked out another Warlock, he took a large amount of dragon scale grass, stretched his body, and walked in.

There was only one left.

However, just as Eli walked through the door, he suddenly saw a Warlock striding towards him from not far away. It was Klee, who had just finished collecting the blood soul Flowers.

The two of them looked at each other in silence.

“Who are you?” Klee looked at Eli and asked. At this moment, Eli’s expression had changed.

“Oh, you’ve finished collecting the blood soul Flowers?” He saw the bag behind Klee.

“Blood soul Flower? How did you know that I’m collecting blood soul Flowers?” Klee frowned and felt that something was not right.

But the next second, he opened his mouth wide.

In his eyes, countless shadows instantly attacked him. He wanted to resist, but he realized that these shadows were too powerful. In an instant, they locked him down, and he couldn’t move.

Then, under his dumbfounded gaze, the man took out a wand and walked toward him.

“It’s a little painful, so bear with it,” Eli said with a smile.

Klee was stunned. Then, he saw Eli waving his wand proficiently and smashing it toward him.

Bang!

Klee’s mind was in a daze, and his body fell backward. Before he fell, he vaguely saw the man take away the container containing his blood soul Flowers, but he had no way to stop him.

“How can this be?!”

That was his last thought before he fell to the ground.
