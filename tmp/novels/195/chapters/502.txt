503 Entering the Time World Fragment

Sunlight shines in front of the temple.

Erwin’s mouth twitched as he looked into the distance. There were three huge figures tied to the ground. Blood was still flowing from their bodies as they fell like waterfalls.

“Is it over?”

She was a little stunned as if she couldn’t believe it.

The power of a single arrow had defeated three Leaders.

“Sir Eli!” She looked forward. At this moment, Eli, who had put away his longbow, was extremely calm. It was as if he had just done something small. As if he felt her gaze, he turned his head and said, “Erwin, I think we should send people to the territories of the three foreign races.”

“Uh, okay, okay.”

Erwin hurriedly replied, looking a little flustered.

..

Soon, the elf army set off.

The alien races that were originally dependent on the three core races also understood the situation and quickly changed sides. Compared to humans, the foreign races did not care about their reputation. In any case, it was just a change of superiors.

Even if their superior was a little special this time, they could still distinguish between life and death.

The collections of the various foreign races were quickly transported to the elves.

“Sigh, there’s nothing!” In the elven temple, Eli sat on his chair and sighed deeply. This made the many foreign races sitting below tremble in fear, including the three shrunken foreign race leaders.

They hadn’t died at that time, and they had directly chosen to surrender after that. Now, they were also under Eli’s command. They were huddled in a corner, not saying a word.

“Sir, what exactly do you want? Perhaps we can know a little.” Erwin, who was sitting at the side, said anxiously.

“That’s right. Please tell us.”

The other races chimed in as well.

“I need a way to quickly break through to the next level.” Eli didn’t hide anything. He looked at the foreign races present, hoping that they would give him an answer.

Recently, the Hamis family and the warlock alliance had been in conflict. For the first time, Eli felt that his strength was not enough and needed to be improved.

Silence, a deathly silence.

As soon as Eli finished speaking, everyone lowered their heads.

They really had no idea.

Eli sighed again.

He had originally hoped that there would be some gains in green fields. It seemed like there was no hope.

He could only wait.

“Milord, perhaps I have an idea.” Eli immediately looked up. It was the Flame Bird in the corner. At this moment, she raised one of her wings and said timidly.

“You have a way?” Eli looked at her with a flash of anticipation.

“Uh, Sir, it’s actually a bad idea!” Seeing that the gaze was on her, the flame bird suddenly regretted it. However, when she saw Eli’s burning gaze, she still bit her lip and said, “Milord, there is no shortcut to comprehending laws. You can only rely on time.”

Disappointed!

Eli was a little disappointed.

“But…” The flaming bird took a deep breath and said, “If you really want to break through in the ‘outside world’, there’s still hope. As long as you go to other worlds, there’s still hope.”

“The outside world? Other worlds?” Eli interrupted her and asked.

“Yes.” She nodded and continued, “The outside world is our world. However, my lord, the flow of time in some worlds may be different from ours!”

Oh!

Eli was instantly enlightened.

That’s right!

It was not like the flow of time was the same everywhere. He could have gone to a place where the time flow was faster to level up and then come back. Wouldn’t that be fine? Why did he have to endure here?

But soon, his expression fell again. Now that the world was sealed, he couldn’t get out!

“Something’s wrong… Do you know where time flows differently?” Suddenly, Eli thought of the Flaming Bird who had made the suggestion. If she wasn’t confident, would she have made the suggestion?

“Yes, my lord.” The flaming bird’s throat moved slightly. Facing Ely always made her feel a sense of fear. She took a deep breath and said, “I really don’t know of such a place in the Warlock World, but outside of the Warlocks World, I know of a fragment of a medium-sized world.

“That place contains a portion of the Laws of Time. The flow of time there is completely different from the outside world. I once entered the border area. In some places, the flow of time is already ten times that of normal.”

Bang!

It was the sound of Eli standing up. He looked at the flaming bird with a burning gaze.

“Are you sure?” asked Eli.

This time, he was really shocked.

He had never thought that he would have such a harvest this time.

To be honest, he could also accelerate time, but it would only accelerate the surroundings and not affect himself. Otherwise, he would have done so long ago. However, he had never encountered a location with a naturally quicker time flow.

This was too shocking.

The flaming bird was also shocked by Eli’s reaction. She even wondered if she had really given a good suggestion.

Wasn’t it just the flow of time? Wouldn’t it still consume his lifespan?

Moreover, it was in a space where people didn’t even notice. This was too boring. It was better to just improve in the Warlock World. After all, life was limited.

“Take me there!”

But Eli didn’t pay any attention to it.

He did not expect that he would really gain something this time.

Hopefully, he wasn’t disappointed.

..

A day later.

A streak of red and a streak of golden light rose into the sky, passing through the atmosphere of the Warlock World and entering outer space.

Red led the way while gold followed behind.

After another half a day, they finally arrived at their destination.

In a world fragment cluster.

“Is this the place?” Eli stood in the void and looked forward.

Amongst the World Fragments in front of them, one World Fragment was particularly eye-catching. It was about ten times the size of the other World Fragments, and it emitted a silvery-white light. Around it, there were strands of silvery-white threads that dissipated, making it seem like a dream.

“Sir, this is the place.” the flaming bird said as she looked at the fragment.

“Then let’s go in.” Eli nodded. This time, he had sent a clone to test the waters.

“That won’t do. Sir, you have to wait for the timeline to disperse. Don’t underestimate those things. You might lose dozens to hundreds of years of lives if you touch them. Moreover, there are also some inside, but not as many as here!” The flame bird said with lingering fear. Clearly, she had suffered a setback here before.

“Good!” Eli’s eyes lit up, but his expression remained calm.

A few minutes later.

As the time thread appeared, a small crack as tall as a person appeared.

Eli and the flaming bird exchanged a glance and flew inside.

Plop!

A sound that sounded like he was submerged in water rang out, and Eli opened his eyes again.

What entered his eyes was a large area that was as beautiful as the starry sky. However, in between this area, there were silver threads that fell like lightning. The further he went into the starry sky, the more “timeline lightning” there was. As for the center, it was almost a vast expanse of whiteness.

The two of them were at the edge, and occasionally, one or two threads would fall from the sky.

“Sir, you can feel it, right?” The flaming bird carefully said.

“Feel…” Eli nodded. The surrounding air was extremely thick, but he also noticed something different here. The time flow ratio here was roughly two to one. In other words, two days here was equivalent to one day in the outside world!

“Milord, the further we go, the faster the flow of time. However, the lightning in the timeline will also be denser, and the consumption of life force will be greater. The last time I went five times deeper, I only stayed for a while and lost about fifty years of my life!

“It’s not that I want to say this, but Milord, this really isn’t a place for cultivation.” The flaming bird dodged a timeline lightning and then regretted it.

“Indeed!” Eli nodded. The place in front of him was indeed not suitable for cultivation.

Perhaps you might die while meditating.

However, that was for others.

To him, this was a good place.

The natural barrier here meant that no creatures would come in for no reason, and it could also give him time to quickly improve. The main thing was that he only needed to go a little deeper. The speed of time there would not affect him.

“Let’s go, leave this place!” Eli nodded and said.

“Alright,” The flame bird was stunned when she heard that they were leaving. Then, she quickly nodded. Even she did not want to stay in this place.

However, it was unknown if it was a problem with her luck, but just as she finished speaking, a bolt of timeline lightning quickly struck her. As the flaming bird’s fur quickly faded a little, she let out a wail.

“How many years?” Eli asked curiously.

The flaming bird wailed.” Bad luck. Sixty years. Sir, let’s leave this place quickly.”

“Hahahaha, okay.”

Eli laughed.

The two of them quickly left the world fragment and turned into two rays of light as they returned to the Warlock World. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Half a day later.

The two of them returned to the elven temple. Erwin, who had been waiting for a long time, walked up.

Before she could say anything, she waved her hand and walked in. “Forget it. It’s not suitable.”

“Yes.” Erwin nodded and watched as the door of the temple closed.

“It’s over!”

She pursed her lips and sighed. She understood that her master had finally decided to put away his thoughts.

..

On the other side.

In the Grassi land.

Eli was packing up all the things he needed for this trip.

“Eli, are you going somewhere?” Dylan, who happened to arrive, asked.

“Yes.”

Eli grinned.

“Go to a place that even dogs don’t go.”
