252 Middle Stage

Two days later.

In the laboratory.

As Eli fused the last potion into the potion, another bottle of azet potion was successful, and Eli’s potion brewing process was completely over.

Eli concocted a total of four bottles of azet potions. One bottle was usually enough to break through, and even if one’s talent was poor, two bottles were usually enough. But considering his special situation, Eli still concocted two more bottles just in case.

!!

“The preparations are almost complete!”

Eli took out a few bottles of potions. The dark green azet potions glowed with a unique color under the illumination of the alchemy lamp, as if they were liquefied Jade.

Eli’s throat moved slightly. This beautiful color really made him want to swallow it in one gulp!

However, he quickly suppressed the idea. After all, one potion was not enough. He had to make other preparations, but he had already handed it over to Vivika.

Putting away the potion, Eli left the laboratory.

He was going to see Vivika.

He arrived outside the bloodline tower after a dozen minutes.

“I want to see Vivika!” Eli said directly to the guard.

Normally, Vivika was quite busy, so he came to see her today.

“Yes, Lord Herman.” the guard said respectfully as he walked into the tower.

He came out again after a while.

“My Lord, the tower master is waiting for you in the study. Do you need me to guide you?

“No, I’ll go by myself!” Waving his hand in refusal, Eli entered the wizard Tower and came to Vivika’s study with ease.

Bang bang bang!

There was a clear knock on the door, and the door slowly opened, revealing Vivika’s figure inside.

“Teacher, if you wanted to meet, you could have just called me. Why did you come here?” Vivika pulled Eli in and closed the door.

“Hahaha, you’re much busier than I am. I won’t hold you up any longer!” Eli smiled.

As the heart of darkness and the Holy tower began to fight, warlocks from other forces fled to the house of bloodlines every day. There was also some chaos in the territory, which Vivika had to deal with.

“Yes, yes, I know that teacher is concerned about me!” Vivika smiled happily. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You’re too cute! How’s the preparation of the venue I told you about a few days ago?”

“Hmph!” Vivika snorted softly, but when she heard Eli talking about business, she became serious and said, “Teacher, it’s ready. The materials were provided by the bloodline tower and the White Tower, and the spell formation was drawn by the undead called Nikola. It’s in a Valley behind the bloodline tower!”

“Okay, I’ll use it in an hour!” Said Eli as he nodded.

He had been preparing for this for a long time.

“Ah!” Vivika was surprised.

Was he about to break through?

..

The bloodline Valley was a Valley not far from the bloodline tower.

It was usually a place where the bloodline tower stored some miscellaneous items. Just two days ago, tower master Vivika suddenly ordered to clear this place, so hundreds of warlocks only took an hour to clean it up.

After that, a large number of items were transported inside, as well as a spirit that had come from afar.

At the entrance of the valley.

A man and a spirit were standing side by side.

Vivika looked towards the valley. At this moment, a huge spell formation had been drawn in the valley, and the surroundings were filled with magic stones that were piled up like small mountains. In the center, Eli was sitting on the ground. His eyes closed as he entered a state of meditation.

“Nikola, you used to be a mage, so you’re very knowledgeable. You don’t think there’ll be any problem with my teacher’s breakthrough, do you? ” She looked to the side and saw Nikola, who had just arrived not too long ago.

Ever since the destruction of the black Isotta, he had always been in the forest of death.

“My lord will definitely have no problem. After all, it’s only a small breakthrough!” Nikola’a illusionary body was floating in the air. He was much more solid than before, and his aura was close to the middle stage.

However, his eyes were fixed on the valley as if he was lost.

He was conflicted.

To be honest, he was already a little confused about Eli’s condition.

The phenomenon of Eli’s breakthrough more than 150 years ago made him decide to follow in Eli’s footsteps for the rest of his life. At that time, he firmly believed that Eli was an absolute genius, and might even break through to celestial very soon.

But now, 150 years passed.

His lord was actually just about to break through to the middle stage of the third circle. This was not the performance of a genius at all!

Back then, he had only taken eighty years to break through to the middle stage, but Eli took seven years more than him.

“I don’t understand. I don’t understand!” Nikola was a little confused.

At this rate, would Eli really be able to reach the celestial level before the end of his life?

He was the only one who knew that Eli was actually a mage. Things were different now, and a warlock’s life force was almost three times that of a mage’s. It was no joke. A total of 500 to 600 years of life, was there any hope?

“Hey, did I misjudge you?” Nikola was confused.

On the other hand, although she did not know why Nikola’s will had become so low, Vivika was still very excited and prayed that nothing had happened to her teacher.

“It’s starting!”

At this moment, suddenly, a huge spell formation began to activate in the valley. The light from the spell formation’s runes instantly illuminated the valley, and Eli’s aura also began to rise.

“Let’s guard the surroundings,” Vivika said to Nikola, who was next to her, and then rose into the sky.

...

Breaking through was always the most vulnerable moment for mages and warlocks. At this time, a little accident could lead to failure, so most Warlocks would make preparations or find a safe place to break through.

“Alright!” Nicholas was stunned for a moment before he also rose into the sky.

However, as he released his aura, his eyes widened.

Nikola was speechless.

It had been a hundred and fifty years since he last met Eli.

Throughout this process, he had never seen Eli display his strength, but the strength he was displaying right now was probably about thirty times his own elements!

“Thirty times? You still haven’t broken through to the middle stage?” Nikola was stunned!

Damn it, he seemed to have broken through to the middle stage before this. Although it looked like a difference of 15 times, it was not something that could be calculated by simple addition and subtraction. The difference was too great.

So his master was really a genius!

He sucked in a breath of cold air.

“I was too shallow!”

...

His gaze became determined again. He was actually thinking of leaving. He was simply stupid.

He quickly flew into the sky and then flew toward the back of the valley.

Vivika was in charge of the front, and he was in charge of the back.

..

In the valley.

Eli closed his eyes and meditated.

The massive magical stone turned into a large amount of magical energy, instantly creating a high-demonic area and stimulating Eli’s mental energy. Even the mental energy that had not moved for a long time started to throb.

However, that was not enough. It was still not enough to break through the bottleneck!

In an instant, the azet potion was used. Eli opened the potion bottle and drank it directly. His mental power began to go berserk, and the huge mental power spread out in all directions as if it was trying to break through some kind of barrier!

However, the barrier was more difficult than he had imagined. After an entire afternoon, it seemed like the barrier only trembled!

Just as Eli had expected, one bottle was not enough.

“I’m still lacking quite a bit!”

Eli took a deep breath, and this time, he opened two bottles and drank them.

With the use of these two bottles of potions, it only took a moment for Eli to feel as if his mental strength had some sort of power, like a turbulent wave.

Under such circumstances, the barrier began to shatter slowly.

A minute later.

Although he didn’t hear a sound, Eli clearly sensed that some kind of bottleneck had been broken!

BOOM!

In the next second, Eli sensed that his mental power was rising again.

At the same time, all the elements within a hundred-mile radius gushed toward the valley. It was as if the heavenly River was flowing backward, surging into Eli’s body and strengthening him once again.

At the same time, Eli’s mobilization of the external elements also sped up.

Eli closed his eyes as well and immersed himself in this state. This was the most time-consuming part of the breakthrough.

30 times.

31 times.

..

35 times.

40 times

Half a day passed, and Eli opened his eyes. At this moment, his aura had reached 35 times stronger than before. And this was not the end. With this thought in mind, Eli once again sank into it.

40 times!

45 times!

..

The sun set, and the moon rose.

The moon set, and the sun rose again.

In the blink of an eye, it was already noon the next day.

In the valley.

Suddenly, the elements that were pouring in began to stop, and in the valley, Eli slowly opened his eyes. The huge mental power made his eyes shine like light bulbs.

The number of elements that he could sense had also reached 50 times higher than when he started!

Third circle intermediate stage!

“But …” Eli suddenly looked up, and his gaze seemed to cross the valley and look outside.

He revealed a smile.

“We have a guest!”
