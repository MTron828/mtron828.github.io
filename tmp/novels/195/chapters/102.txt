103 Khorium 2

The research on the blood bamboo flower was still relatively smooth. The main part was the flower and some parts of the tissue. However, the blood experiment was different.

Although there were also animal experiments, with Anna becoming queen, living human bodies were no longer a big problem for Eli. As a huge Empire, there were all kinds of people who had to die every day, and Eli kindly accepted these people.

Organ transplant, blood transplant, human tissue observation, organ demonization, flesh, and blood modification

Bloodline was also a path that contained a lot of knowledge, and to Eli, it was also very attractive to him.

!!

And because of the questions he had about bloodline warlocks, Eli also put a portion of his energy into researching bloodlines and transplanting bloodlines.

“Are you ready?”

In the laboratory, Eli looked at the person who was tied to the cross.

It was said that he was a criminal who had killed more than ten people and had been hiding for five months before he was caught. He was only caught because he couldn’t help but go to Liuyang Lane. It was really outrageous.

But at this moment, this evil criminal watched in horror as Eli approached as if he had seen a demon.

Heavens!

Half an hour ago, there had been another person beside him, but this man had injected a tube of mysterious blood into his body, and the spell formation under his feet had flickered, causing the man to explode.

That’s right, it was a physical explosion, and the man was scared silly.

What kind of place had he been sent to? He would rather die right now than suffer this mental torture here.

“Relax!” Eli slowly approached and smiled.

The man became more and more terrified.

“Ah!”

The next second, a terrifying sound came from the laboratory.

On the other hand, Eli was frowning, watching helplessly as the experimental blood fused into his body, and his body tissues began to melt bit by bit. Even the spell formation on the ground could not stop it.

“It shouldn’t be!” Eli frowned.

This time, the bloodline of a Night Gray wolf was integrated into the young man in front of him. It seemed that even this level of the bloodline was not something the criminal could bear.

What a pity.

He failed again.

Half an hour later, looking at the man’s mangled body, Eli cleaned him up and began a new experiment.

…

Spring left, and winter came.

When one was extremely focused, one would enter a magical state. In this state, one’s learning ability and memory would increase greatly, and one would not notice the passage of time.

Eli had been in this state for a long time. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He even lived in the laboratory and had a bed next door.

When Eli came out of that state, he heard the bad news.

…

Marquis Alex was dead.

When Eli stood at Alex’s funeral, he had just completed an experiment. He had just made a breakthrough in the experiment, and he was suddenly notified, so he was caught off guard.

Alex was probably the same age as Eli, and he was the first person to die from Eli’s generation, which made him feel rather emotional.

After attending the funeral, Eli met with his son and left.

The current him was already much stronger than before.

…

It was another year.

There was not much progress in the bloodline experiment.

Eli’s research on the blood bamboo flower had reached a new stage.

He analyzed the petals of the blood bamboo flower in depth and found that only the end of the petals had an effect. There was a strange tissue there that could transform the absorbed vitality into other forces.

The blood bamboo flower experiment had entered its second stage.

The current drug would only destroy about half of the cell tissue, but it could still improve spiritual power.

This was a huge improvement.

But he didn’t know what was going on. It seemed like something else would happen every time there was progress.

This time, it was Herman who was visited by Death.

In the ward, Herman held onto Eli’s hand and said in a trembling voice, “Junior, I’ll be going first this time.”

After saying this, he passed away.

Eli closed his eyes and was silent for a long time before he left the ward.

Herman was one of his closest friends. Even though he was his senior brother, they had worked together in a harmonious environment for almost thirty years, and their relationship was much stronger than Alex’s.

Herman’s sons and daughters had their own families, so he didn’t need help.

At the door, Eli saw his family.

“Grandpa Eli, father told me to give this to you.” His daughter handed him something. It was a fountain pen that seemed to have been given to him by his teacher.

Eli was stunned for a few seconds before he took the pen.

“If you need any help, you can come to me,” Eli said to Herman’s son and left.

…

Another year had passed.

This year, there wasn’t much progress in Eli’s experiment, but the bad news didn’t care about that. They were always rough and cruel.

In the ward, Eli sat by the bed and looked at the haggard Hila.

Because of the magic potion, she was still as beautiful as before, but now, she couldn’t help but look a little haggard. There was light eyeshadow at the corner of her eyes, and there was a sense of beauty that was broken.

“Eli, do you know what I regret the most in my life? ” Hila asked weakly.

She wasn’t married, and she didn’t have any children. At her deathbed, only Eli came to see her.

Eli didn’t answer, he just kept silent.

“In this life, my greatest regret is attending the party when scholar Clement took over the library decades ago. If it weren’t for that, perhaps this misunderstanding would have continued, and we would have encountered a different matter.” Seeing that Eli didn’t say anything, Hila smiled.

“you’re a person who’s far superior to ordinary people in all aspects. Knowing you is too cruel to ordinary people.” Hila was still talking to herself.

“Can you give me a hug?” Hila then requested.

This time, Eli nodded and gave Hila a hug.

When the hug was over, he realized that Hila, who had been talking a moment ago, had already closed her eyes.

This time, Eli let out a long sigh again.

It was really f*cked up!

Why did he have to know so many people?

Hila actually had a very complicated relationship with him. They could be said to be close friends, but it was also more than that.

Hila’s funeral was personally arranged by Eli, and he waited until everything was over.

Eli returned to the laboratory and plunged into work again.

…

A year later.

Eli gave the new criminal in front of him a bottle of potion, and he poured it down his throat.

Soon, the man changed. His muscle tissue rapidly atrophied, and his black hair quickly turned white. However, his eyes grew brighter and brighter.

He collected some of the man’s cells and observed them. All the cells were intact, but their vitality had been completely drained.

“I’ve finally succeeded, khorium II.” Seeing such an outcome, a smile appeared on Elie’s face.

Nine years.

He had finally succeeded.

But looking at the successful potion, Eli had a bad feeling.
