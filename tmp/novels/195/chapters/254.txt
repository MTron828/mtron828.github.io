255 Jin Yin

In the heart of darkness’s reception room.

At this moment, a man was sitting on a luxurious sofa. He was tall and strong like a bear, but his hair was half-white and well-defined. His eyelids were low, but he gave off a sense of oppression.

And beside him sat another man.

“Jin Ji, have you thought about it? As a candidate for the Golden cicada, you’ll have a chance to make the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce take action unconditionally. But are you sure you want to use it here?”

The old man said slowly as he looked at his beloved disciple.

Jin Ji nodded and looked at his teacher with certainty.

A few days ago, he suddenly found out that the heart of the darkness was going to make a move on the bloodlines tower, and their target was Eli. However, Jin Ji couldn’t do anything about it and could only ask his teacher for help.

“Why?” The old man was puzzled!

A third-circle warlock, was it worth it?

“because he gave me hope. Without him, I wouldn’t be who I am now. So I have to do something!” Jin Ji gritted his teeth, but his gaze was firm as he looked at the old man.

“Alright, I understand!” The old man nodded and didn’t say anything else.

In an instant, the living room fell into silence.

A few minutes later.

The sound of someone stepping on the ground suddenly came from behind the door, and the door slowly opened.

“Jin yin, long time no see!” Sergei strode in and said to the old man.

“Sergei, long time no see!” The old man raised his head, and the two of them looked at each other.

“Tell me, why did you ask Noah to withdraw and abandon the operation? I’ve known you for a long time, and I don’t think you would do such a stupid thing!” Sergei sat on the sofa calmly.

As the branch president of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, Jin Yin was very powerful in combat and could mobilize a terrifying amount of resources. He could even mobilize people from the central mainland at any time. He did not want to cause any trouble! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It’s because of my student. The person you’re dealing with is my student’s benefactor. He’s the one who came to beg me.” Jin yin smiled, but his face wrinkled.

“Your student? Him?” He looked at the young man beside Jin Yin. He looked very ordinary!

“Right!” Jin yin replied with a smile.

“Oh?” Sergei was curious. Jin Yin had come from the central mainland and was a high-status figure in the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. Normally, he would not care about such things. Why was he acting so strange this time?

“let me introduce you to my new student. He’s a first circle Golden cicada Warlock, Jin Ji. He’s a reserved Golden cicada. Once he returns, he’ll become a real Golden cicada warlock,” Jin Yin smiled and said to Sergei.

“Golden cicada?”

Sergei slowly opened his mouth and looked at the kid.

You’re not joking, right?

As a famous Chamber of Commerce in the central mainland, their power was no joke. Those who could become gold cicadas were the best among them. Every gold cicada had a high chance of reaching the celestial realm!

How could this place have such a talent?

“Right, this is a student’s sincere plea to his teacher. I can’t do anything about it!” Jin yin shook its head and sighed helplessly, but his eyes were filled with unspeakable pride.

“Alright, I understand!” Sergei nodded. “but I can’t do anything about Noah now!”

“What do you mean?” Jin Ji, who hadn’t said anything, was shocked. He had come for this matter.

Jin Yin also frowned.

There was no reason for Sergei not to give him face.

“Hmph!” Sergei looked at the two and snorted. “in fact, your actions were unnecessary. Noah has already been killed by that guy!”

“What do you mean killed?” Jin Ji’s mouth was wide open in shock.

This time, he had heard about Noah’s strength and begged his teacher for help. However, he did not know that Noah had already been killed. Was his Excellency that strong?

“If that’s what you’re talking about, then please leave!” Sergei snorted and turned to Rodin, “Rodin, send the guest off!”

“Yes!”

Rodin was also dumbfounded at this moment. When he heard the news about Noah, his body trembled. He knew that Eli was very powerful, but he had never expected him to be this powerful.

It was a good thing he didn’t go.

Poor Noah.

“Alright, since you’ve achieved your goal, let’s go!” Jin yin obviously didn’t expect this as he said to Jin Ji.

“Alright!” Jin Ji still heaved a sigh of relief.

As for the opportunity, he didn’t think it was a waste. After all, in order to save him, his lordship had also sacrificed a bottle of precious mother of life potion.

Soon, Rodin returned again.

“Rodin, you’ll temporarily take over Noah’s work,” Sergei ordered Noah as soon as he came in.

“Yes, my Lord!” Rodin’s eyes lit up. This was an unexpected surprise.

“Then, what do you plan to do with the bloodline tower, my Lord?” Rodin asked.

“I was about to take action, but I didn’t expect the Jin Yin to come. Moreover, this matter involves the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. Let’s forget about it for now. According to the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s terms, Jin Yin should be leaving soon. He will definitely take Jin Ji away. I will deal with this bold Warlock when the time comes!”

Sergei’s teeth were numb!

Not only did this person ruin his plan, but he couldn’t deal with it now. It really made him unhappy!

Rodin, on the other hand, did not dare to speak!

His master was already beyond furious!

..

...

Eli knew nothing about this.

He had already returned to the irises’ encampment.

It was the old Katarina who welcomed him.

“My Lord, long time no see!”

Compared to a hundred years ago, Katarina had aged a lot. She was about two hundred years old and no longer as beautiful as she used to be. However, she still helped Eli manage the mage camp.

As Eli’s arrival was kept a secret, only Katarina and another person came to welcome him.

“Who is this?” Eli looked at the boy behind Katarina. He was a little skinny, about eight or nine years old, and was shyly hiding behind Katarina’s legs. The other person he was talking about was him.

“Milord, this is my grandson!” Katarina replied through gritted teeth.

“what? ” Eli was stunned.

However, he immediately understood!

It had been almost 160 years since he last came here, and three or four generations of people had left the mortal Empire. As a warlock, it seemed normal for her to have a grandson.

...

“He’s pretty good!” Eli squatted down and looked at the boy!

Although he had left a mark on Katarina, Eli didn’t have complete control over her. She had her own life, her own friends, and her own story!

“my Lord, his name is Grimm. He has just started meditating. I heard that you are here. My Lord might need an assistant, so let him accompany you!” Katarina said.

“That’s fine, then let him follow me!” Eli smiled.

He understood what Katarina meant. Which family’s adults didn’t want their descendants to be better?

Anyway, he was indeed lacking an assistant in his experiments. As for whether this little guy could live up to his requirement or not, it was up to him!

During this entire process, Grimm had been hiding behind Katarina, his two big eyes looking at this big brother who had appeared in front of him. He didn’t understand why his grandmother was so reverent towards this man!

..

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Just as Vivika thought that the heart of darkness would do something, something unexpected happened. The heart of darkness seemed to have ignored this matter and completely ignored them.

This made Vivika, who had been anxious, a little confused.

Eli was also a little dumbfounded.

He had originally thought that the heart of darkness would make a move, so he had fled in the middle of the night. He didn’t expect that nothing would happen. This was strange!

But it didn’t matter. He had left anyway, and Sergei wouldn’t be able to find him in a short time. At this time, Eli had returned to his mundane work.

Experiment, study, and tease Grimm.

He had to admit that it was quite interesting!

..

Another month passed.

In the secret realm.

Eli lay on the recliner, relaxing and resting.

Not far away, the eight or nine-year-old Grimm was huffing and puffing as he carried a bucket of water and watered Hill. Hill was also swaying his branches and playing with Grim.

As time went by, Hill’s intelligence grew higher and higher!

And it was getting closer to the second circle.

“Hmph!” Grimm, on the other hand, pouted and looked at the resting Eli.

Child labor!

Aiya!

Suddenly, he accidentally fell into the bucket and immediately let out a loud cry.

Eli laughed heartily.

Hill also swayed his branches and made a rustling sound.

It was peaceful!

“How cruel!” Looking at this scene, the young Grimm made up his mind.

Thirty years later.

He had to become a Grand mage and pursue the truth for the rest of his life! He would not be tricked like this again!

Just wait and see!
