258 War

The bright sun hung high in the sky!

As time passed, the heart of darkness’ team gradually set off toward the silver Moon Lake. All kinds of rumors and gossip had spread to various places.

The atmosphere was heavy.

The area with the heaviest atmosphere was undoubtedly the Holy tower Alliance area.

At this moment, on a plain seven to eight miles away from the silver Moon Lake, a large number of warlocks had gathered. There were thousands of them, and there were quite a number of them from the first, second, and even third rings.

They gathered on the plains and formed a line of defense. Like a wall, they wanted to block the enemy and not leave a single person behind.

In the most central area, more than 20 warlocks belonging to the Holy tower Alliance gathered together. Each of them was a third-circle warlock, and each of them was a high-level member of their respective forces. Each of them exuded a powerful aura, and under this pressure, even the first ring warlocks could not move freely.

“Tell me, how do we deal with this?” Udo sat among them, looking worriedly at everyone.

After 300 years of growth, he was now a middle-stage third-ring warlock. He was wearing a black Warlock robe, had a tall body, and had a pair of black eyes, which made him look very oppressive.

He was the Holy tower’s master’s student and also the person in charge of this attack.

“Udo, the heart of darkness is coming at us with such ferocity this time. We must all come to a conclusion. Let’s just fight.” A third-circle warlock raised his head and said.

“Fight? Heh, you make it sound so easy!” A Warlock not far away snorted and gritted his teeth.

“The heart of darkness didn’t even bother to hide its tracks this time. This means that they don’t care about our obstruction at all, or they think they can easily crush us. In fact, it is true.”

The Warlock chuckled and looked at Udo.

“They have a total of fifty third-circle warlocks. Although not all of them are at the late-stage, their numbers are more than enough. With this number, even if your teacher were here, would he be of any use?

“I even feel that our arrival is meaningless. It’s just a meaningless resistance!”

“Indeed!”

Some people were sarcastic, while others were worried. Not all of them were from the Holy Tower so not everyone was united and had their own thoughts.

Looking at this scene, Udo shook his head. These outsiders were still unreliable. However, there was no other way this time. He had to rely on them.

“Everyone!” Udo’s face gradually became serious, and his gaze became determined. He looked at the people around him, his chest rising and falling. “this time, it’s not a matter of whether we can block it or not. We have to!

“If we lose, we’ll have two entities like Sergei, and there’s no doubt about this war. We’ll lose, and we’ll lose miserably.

“Everyone’s forces, family, and friends will die in the war. At this point, they will not accept surrender, so we have no other choice but to fight.”

The atmosphere suddenly became heavy.

Everyone also understood their situation.

“But …”

Udo spoke again, and everyone looked at him.

He glanced at the crowd and said with a firm gaze, ” don’t forget what our goal is. We just need to destroy the elemental core, take it away, or survive the silver Moon lake’s riot, and our operation will be considered a success!”

“That’s right!”

All they needed to do was to get the core!

A glimmer of hope suddenly appeared in everyone’s eyes.

Although it was all hopeless, there seemed to be a trace of hope.

“you guys should leave first. There’s still one day before silver Moon Lake opens. One day later, it should be the time for the war!” Udo waved his hand, signaling for everyone to retreat first!

After everyone left, Udo sat alone in the tent.

He took a deep breath.

Could they do it?

..

The wind howled!

In the sky, dozens of venomous Wyverns flapped their wings and flew forward. On the Wyverns were many Warlocks from the heart of the darkness. The first circle Warlocks could only squeeze together.

On the largest of the venom Wyvern, a dozen third-circle warlocks were discussing their tactics.

“Everyone, we’re not far from the silver Moon Lake, but there’s still a day before the silver Moon Lake erupts. So, we’ll set off in half a day!

“There’s no need to be too nervous. Our numbers are much higher than the Holy tower. Even without this core, it’s only a matter of time before we take care of the Holy tower!”

The one who spoke was a short, dark-skinned fatty. His body seemed to be swollen, but no one dared to look down on him because of his late-stage third-ring aura.

His name was tatuck, one of Sergei’s right-hand men.

The others listened to him and echoed.

“Indeed, I can’t think of any accidents this time!” A Warlock said.

“Almost every force has brought out their best third circle warlocks.”

“Quickly settle it. The war has been going on for a long time!”

Everyone had a relaxed look on their faces, without a trace of worry.

One of the women sighed when she saw this.

She was Simona, the third person who completed the mission with Udo and Eli. She was a harpy, but later on, the harpy joined the heart of darkness, so she had no choice but to join.

She and Udo were still good friends, but now they had no choice but to fight!

“It’s a pity that the bloodline tower and that Lord didn’t participate and remained neutral!” She sighed.

If the bloodline tower joined the war, things might be better. The harpies might not be forced to join the heart of darkness. The harpies were basically forced to join the heart of darkness.

On this mission, she had a bad feeling.

...

Harpies’ spiritual perception had always been accurate, but the heart of the night was so well prepared. Could there be an accident?

“Forget it!”

Simona shook her head and stopped thinking about it. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Let nature take its course.

“Everyone, land on the spot and prepare for the silver Moon Lake to erupt in one day!”

At this time, tatuck shouted loudly, and all the venom Wyverns slowly landed on the ground. Everyone also began to recover their bloodline and prepare for the upcoming war!

..

Time passed by very quickly!

The time for the silver Moon Lake to erupt had finally arrived!

Accompanied by a violent fluctuation, with Silver Moon Lake as the center, countless elements gathered towards Silver Moon Lake like boiling water. All the elements within a hundred miles began to explode. Silver Moon lake’s eruption was about to begin!

However, unlike before, the silver Moon was now empty, and the fishing Masters by the silver Moon Lake had also disappeared without a trace. There were only countless magical fish and the Allied army even further away!

...

At this time, on the plain, thousands of people gathered together like small black dots. They all held their own weapons, wore robes, and stared into the distance.

In the sky above them, there were more than a dozen warlocks suspended in the air, their gazes solemn!

“Everyone, they’re here!”

Udo said, and everyone looked into the distance.

In the blue sky, dozens of venom Wyverns lined up and flew in this direction. In front of them were warlocks led by tatuck.

Menacing!

Then, Tatuck actually left his venom Wyvern.

A huge amount of moonlight was emitted from his body. Then, a huge moonlight arrow that was ten meters long appeared in the sky, emitting a cold light.

No one saw this coming, and not many people even reacted.

The crossbows had arrived!

Hiss!

A shrill screech tore through the sky, and even Udo was shocked.

However, some of them did not make it in time. The moonlight arrow pierced through the sky, and blood instantly bloomed. A three-circle warlock from the bloodline tower fell to the ground.

The entire battlefield was silent for a moment.

They had already lost a third-ring warlock before the battle had even begun.

Everyone felt that the atmosphere was a little heavy, and they were afraid before the battle.

Even Udo’s eyes turned dark.

The attack was very strong!

Would they even be able to come back alive from this battle?
