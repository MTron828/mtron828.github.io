316 Mushroom Cloud

The sun hung high in the sky.

The bright sunlight shone on the ground, providing energy for all living things. In the sky, a bloody light streaked across the sky at lightning speed.

In the blood, Eli’s eyes were calm.

The direction he was heading in was clear, the valley where the Wanderer Alliance was located!

!!

Eli’s speed was at least a few times faster than before. A few hours later, a continuous mountain range appeared at the edge of his vision, and a Valley entered his sight!

“That’s the place!” Eli’s eyes lit up.

The valley was located in the corner of the mountain range, and it seemed to be quite large. Eli could feel the aura of a Warlock from within, and this should be the headquarters of the wanderer’s Alliance.

Upon seeing his destination, the blood light around Eli gradually disappeared, and his body rose once again, only continuing his journey when he was several thousand meters in the air.

This height was already very high, and Eli could almost touch the clouds with his hands.

A few minutes later, he was above the valley.

His eyes glowed with a silver light as he looked towards the valley.

Life auras gradually appeared before Eli’s eyes. There weren’t as many as he had imagined, only a few hundred, but the quality was extremely high. More than half of them had three rings, and there were even seven half-step celestial warlocks.

“Seven half-step celestial warlocks?”

… Eli was a little confused.

If he remembered correctly, there should only be seven half-step celestial warlocks in the Wanderer Alliance. He had just killed three of them, but there were seven more here. This didn’t make sense.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, Eli noticed that something was wrong. He noticed a small black dot beside the valley. On closer look, it was actually a small airship. It looked a little old.

Upon seeing the airship, realization dawned on Eli.

“They should be wanted criminals from the central continent.” A smile slowly appeared on Eli’s face. Since they were already there, they might as well not leave.

Judging from the appearance of the airship, it should not have been here for long.

They were a little unlucky!

They happened to meet him.

“The valley is also suitable for my experiments. It won’t damage the surrounding environment too much.”

Eli didn’t forget that his goal was to test the new techniques of the celestial mage.

Eli’s gaze gradually calmed down, and the mental energy in his eyes churned like waves in the ocean. Eli took a deep breath, and his celestial force burst forth instantly.

A strange aura spread out from Eli.

Behind him, a huge body came out of his body. It was the special method of the celestial mage, the celestial body.

A huge illusionary body emerged from behind Eli, rapidly expanding like a balloon. In the blink of an eye, it had expanded to a height of almost a hundred meters, standing calmly behind him.

The celestial’s appearance was the same as Eli’s original appearance. However, other than the eyes, which were extremely bright, the other parts were made up of special celestial power and elements.

What was more interesting was that there was a Shadow Dragon Tattoo on the back of this celestial body. The huge head of the Dragon was ferocious and terrifying, and the wings extended to the shoulder.

That’s a little too societal!

Eli narrowed his eyes, admiring the celestial body.

The massive celestial body exuded a powerful aura. It could unleash the full power of a celestial, and as soon as it appeared, the surrounding air began to flash, and the clouds were pushed away.

At this moment, if a half-step celestial were to stand in front of him, he might not have the courage to fight.

Eli stretched out his hand, and the massive celestial behind him also stretched out its huge hand.

In the next second, a fireball slowly formed on the tip of the celestial body’s finger.

At first, it was only a meter in size, and the flame was weak, but after a few seconds, the fireball expanded rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it was several meters in size, emitting a scorching heat.

However, this was not enough.

Eli continued to input more.

Slowly, a fireball with a radius of nearly a hundred meters appeared. The inside was a scorching golden-red color, and the outside was wrapped in orange flames, exuding a terrifying temperature.

Eli could feel that the air around him had even risen by dozens of degrees.

It had a radius of nearly a hundred meters. This was a small fireball that Eli had used all his strength to condense, and the source of it was the first circle fireball spell!

Eli felt the scorching heat.

The next second, the fireball fell.

It was like a huge sun that pierced through the clouds, flying toward the valley at an extremely fast speed.

Eli watched this scene calmly, silently recovering the energy he had just used up.

..

At this moment.

In the valley.

In a living room, a small banquet was being held.

There was a long table in the middle with all kinds of food on it. There was roasted suckling pig, bread, roasted duck, wine … Even the tablecloth was a precious material that could be made into a wizard’s robe, and the bright alchemy lamp illuminated everything.

The seven of them sat around the table and seemed to be discussing something.

“Hiladi, long time no see. I’m really happy that you can come here.” Guyiduo smiled as he looked at the Warlock.

“Guyiduo, it’s nice to see you again!” The Warlock had a long face and red eyes. He looked aggressive and smiled at Guyiduo.

...

“Yes.” Guyiduo nodded and looked at him. On both sides of the table were his two subordinates, and hiladi’s three subordinates, all half-step celestial!

Guyiduo’s smile grew wider as he looked at the half-step celestials.

As long as these people joined them, the West Coast would be within their reach.

“Guyiduo, where are your other men?” he asked. Hila asked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“they’re already at the front line. The native force here is called the bloodline tower. You should have seen their force in the central continent. We’ve already fought with them!” Guyiduo replied.

“Bloodline tower!”

Upon hearing the words ” bloodline tower, ” the corner of hiladi’s mouth twitched as if she had recalled some unpleasant memories. She slammed the table.

“What’s wrong?” Guyiduo asked curiously.

“Hmph, it makes me angry just by saying it.” Guyiduo shook his head, “this time, we had no choice but to escape. It was a third circle limit from the bloodline tower in the Western Region of the central continent that took the lead. I think she’s called Vivika. She then allied with many other forces and found our territory.”

“I see!” Guyiduo laughed and raised his glass. “the past is the past. Maybe you’ll have the chance to break through to the celestial realm here. You can take your revenge when you get back!”

“That’s true!” Hiladi nodded, but he still said angrily, “You don’t know this, but she’s just trying to make more contributions so he can reach the celestial level. She’s just an ordinary bloodline with a third circle. She’s dreaming!”

...

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about this?” He shook his head and also picked up his glass.

At this time, the others also picked up their glasses and prepared to drink together.

“I suddenly feel that something is wrong!” All of a sudden, Guyiduo raised his left hand, and everyone stopped and looked at him.

“What’s wrong, Lord Guyiduo?” A Warlock asked.

“My heart is beating so fast like something is coming.” Guyiduo frowned. This feeling was sudden, but he took it seriously.

“Your heart is beating fast?”

Hiladi laughed. Just as he was about to mock Guyiduo, the smile on his face froze in the next second, and his eyes started to tremble.

“No, there’s danger. Leave this place!” He suddenly said.

For a moment, he had felt great fear, as if some kind of danger was coming. But they were clearly in the valley base, so how could there be any danger?

“Let’s run first.”

As half-step celestial warlocks, their reactions were naturally fast.

The moment Hiladi said that, everyone’s blood surged.

As for the roof, it was directly blown away. They felt that the danger should come from inside, and this was the fastest way out.

However, as soon as they flew out of the building, they all looked up at the sky.

They were instantly stunned.

Just a few dozen meters above them, a red light occupied their vision. A huge elemental fireball was coming straight at them, and the power contained in it had already exceeded the third ring.

“What is this?” Guyiduo was dumbfounded.

What the f * ck was this?

The other three half-step celestials were also shocked.

However, what made them even more afraid was that the distance was already too close.

By the time they discovered the fireball, it was only fifty meters away from them. Moreover, the fireball’s speed and size were so great that they couldn’t dodge in time.

Everyone’s eyes widened, and they let out cries of shock and shrieks mixed with fear.

It was the same on the ground. Most of the warlocks fled in all directions when they saw the meteorites in the sky, but they were too close to each other and couldn’t make it.

No one knew where the fireball came from.

In fact, it had only been three seconds since the first person had seen the fireball, which was why they had no time to dodge.

The half-step celestials didn’t even have time to run, let alone the others.

“We’re finished!”

Looking at the huge fireball in front of them, everyone fell into despair.

In the next second, the flames fell on the valley, and everyone was instantly covered in flames.

As the fireball descended, all of its power instantly erupted. Everyone felt a burst of warmth, and then they felt their bodies gradually melting.

The exploding flames swept across the entire valley like a cool breeze.

Then, there was an explosion.

An earth-shattering explosion occurred in the valley.

The violent explosion produced a terrifying heat and hardness. A layer of white air continued to expand outwards. This was caused by the air pressure. In this explosion, whether it was the houses, buildings, or anything else, everything in the valley instantly fell into nothingness.

The flames exploded, and a small mushroom cloud rose from the valley.

It was beautiful and brilliant.

One by one, half-step celestial and low-circle warlocks died in the explosion.

“Spectacular!”

Looking at the mushroom cloud rising from the ground, Eli pursed his lips.

After confirming that the people were dead, Eli turned around and left.

The test was completed, and the power was good.
