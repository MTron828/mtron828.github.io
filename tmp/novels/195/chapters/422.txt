423 The Death of Eli

At this moment, Jesse and the other two stared at the shadowy Eli and roared at the same time!

“Natural disaster!”

The wind and clouds changed color, and the area within a thousand miles instantly turned into darkness. In this darkness, three pillars of light suddenly appeared!

Boom!

!!

Bright pillars of light streaked across the sky, coming from three different directions and converging towards the center of the trio.

The people on the ground also stopped fighting and looked at the sky in the distance with shocked expressions.

“Is this the battle of Radiant Sun?”

” Will he die? With such an attack, Eli will definitely die! ”

“This is too terrifying!”

The low-level Warlocks were all dumbfounded. The power in front of them had completely exceeded their imaginations!

Gulp!

“My lord!” Nikola’s eyes were about to pop out, and his entire body was trembling!

The Warlock who was fighting him also stopped and stared blankly at the sky!

“Protect the low-level Warlocks!” He was stunned for a moment before he shouted.

The other celestials also reacted immediately and stopped fighting to protect the low-level Warlocks. Although they were dozens of kilometers away, they had no doubt that if they did not use their techniques, not many of the low-level Warlocks would survive!

After they protected the Warlocks, a black light suddenly exploded in the distant sky!

This explosion was like the first ray of light from the explosion of the universe. It suddenly erupted from the void, followed by countless thunder-like sounds. All the Warlocks felt their ears tremble and could not help but cover their ears.

Boom!

The explosion suddenly began. A mushroom cloud that was a few thousand meters tall rose from the sky, and the shockwaves it emitted spread in all directions, flattening everything on the ground. Even the huge crimson moon lake instantly turned into steam and disappeared.

In such an environment, all the Warlocks did not have the mood to pay attention to what was happening at the center of the explosion. They were more confused about protecting themselves.

The huge protective shield trembled in the aftershock, and cracks appeared. The celestials could only protect themselves while doing their best to maintain the shield so that the low-level Warlocks would not be killed in the aftershock!

The aftermath lasted for a full ten minutes.

When everything dispersed, everyone’s jaws dropped when they saw their surroundings.

Everything within a radius of a hundred kilometers had turned into scorched earth. Be it mountains, lakes, or all living things, they had all disappeared. The only thing that remained was the Warlocks. At this moment, their shields were like isolated islands in the ocean, the only paradise!

“How terrifying!”

Even the Celestial warlocks felt that it was ridiculous. This combined bloodline skill attack even made them feel like they were facing a fifth-circle opponent!

“Is Eli dead?” Suddenly, someone raised a question. Everyone looked up at the sky.

In the distant sky, three eight-armed nagas stood in a triangle, and in the center was a huge shadow sphere.

At this moment, the protective barrier around the shadow sphere had almost disappeared. There was only a thin layer, and a large portion of the shadow dragon’s body was exposed. Its dragon wings had already turned into nothingness, and almost half of its body had disappeared. Half of its huge dragon head had also disappeared.

Everyone looked at this scene in a daze. After losing almost half of his body and his head, there was no doubt that he was dead!

“Eli is dead!”

After recovering from their daze, the eight-armed naga warlocks shouted excitedly, unable to hide the excitement on their faces!

As for the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower, their mouths were wide open, and their bodies were trembling. Some even knelt on the ground, their eyes filled with shock and despair. The former was because the powerful Eli had died just like that, while the latter was because they were sad about the future of the Bloodline Tower!

If Eli died, the Bloodline Tower would be finished!

“It’s over?”

Nikola’s soul body trembled as he looked at the dead body in the sky. He couldn’t believe it for a long time!

How could Eli loseIn the past thousand years, Eli had always won a crushing victory whenever he encountered danger. This time, he had actually died just like thatImpossible, absolutely impossibleIt must be fake, but his body was already like this. It was impossible for him to still be alive!

“No more!” Tears flowed out of Nikola’s eyes as he gritted his teeth and looked at the corpse in the distance.

He slowly flew in that direction. He wanted to take another look at Eli. As for his own life and death, it was no longer important!

“Stop!”

However, in the next second, a voice suddenly entered his ears. Nikola was stunned!

“It’s the voice of my Lord. He’s not dead yet!” The tears at the corner of Nikola’s eyes suddenly stopped.

The voice that had suddenly entered his consciousness was definitely Eli’s. Could it be that his lord was still alive after that?

Nikola raised his head in confusion. The three eight-armed nagas were approaching Eli. When they were about a hundred meters away, Eli’s corpse suddenly exploded. Boundless golden light spread in all directions, instantly devouring the three celestials. Then, like a constricted heart, it retracted again, and the three celestials were already trapped inside!

Another explosion followed.

All the Warlocks, including Nikola, were stunned again. They subconsciously raised their shields again.

Thus, the scene from before repeated itself. When everything dispersed again, everyone raised their heads to look.

In the distant sky, three Eight-Armed Nagas appeared once again. However, one of them had already turned into countless pieces, and the other had lost all four of its arms. The only one that was intact was Jesse’s huge Eight-Armed Naga, but its body was also covered in countless wounds!

At the center, there was only a golden ball of light!

“This is” Nikola’s mouth was wide open.

Eli seemed to be alive, but he seemed to have self-destructed. Then, he killed a Radiant Sun and severely injured another!

So his lord still died!

Nikola was in a complicated mood, and he didn’t even bother to study what that golden light was!

...

“Eli!”

In the distance, Jesse roared at the sky. His angry voice shook the void, and the Radiant Sun beside him covered the other side of the wound with a painful expression!

“Damn it!” Jesse gritted his teeth, his body almost trembling in anger. They had lost another Radiant Sun Warlock, and another Radiant Sun Warlock was heavily injured!

The only thing worth celebrating was that Eli was really dead this time!

“Randolf!” Jesse looked at the dead body of Radiant Sun and gritted his teeth.

Randolf didn’t defend himself in time during the explosion and lost his life in the end!

” I want the Bloodline Tower to pay the price! ” Jesse looked coldly at the celestials and Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower.

Seeing Jesse’s gaze, all the Warlocks felt as if they had fallen into an abyss. Although Sir Eli had fought to the death and killed a Radiant Sun, it didn’t help the situation at all. As long as there was still a Radiant Sun, the Bloodline Tower was no match for them!

They were going to die!

All the celestials realized that they might not be able to leave today.

“It’s over!”

...

” But it’s enough. If it weren’t for you, I might not have reached this realm! ” Nikola also smiled bitterly. He thought there was still hope, but it was only greater despair.

” Eh? That golden light is changing! ” Suddenly, a celestial shouted.

Nikola immediately looked at the golden light. At this moment, the golden light seemed to be attracted by something and flew into the distant sky.

Jesse and Heda were also shocked. Jesse reached out to grab it, but the golden light turned into thousands of specks of light and flew away.

Where did the light left behind by Eli’s death go?

All the Warlocks were dumbstruck as they followed the golden light with their eyes.

The speed of the golden light was also very fast. In the blink of an eye, it crossed dozens of miles. At the same time, two golden lights flew over from afar. All three rays of light directly fused into one ball of light. The light turned and continued to fly toward the battlefield.

As it got closer, the light slowly dissipated, revealing two people!

Looking at the two of them, everyone’s mouths opened wide again, and a trace of confusion flashed across their eyes.

The two people in front of him were both Eli!

Two Elis?

The two Elis didn’t pay attention to the warlock army. They just looked at Jesse and Heda in the distance and stretched out their hands with a smile.

“Next is the third round!”

“Two against two, fair battle!”
