378 Bloodline Avatars

As soon as Eli finished speaking, Hydra and Nikola immediately became alert.

Hydra’s body swayed and instantly transformed into a huge snake that was a hundred meters long. Its four heads stared into the distance and hissed. The undead behind Nikola descended like a cape. Countless gray gases surrounded him, and the sound of the undead spread.

Eli calmly looked at the enemy this time and carefully observed.

After all, the Dice of Fate offered just a probability, not necessarily absolute. Everything still needed to be taken seriously by Eli.

In the distance.

Jerre and the other Warlocks also slowly stopped. Clearly, everyone had also seen the three figures.

“Jerre?”

A Warlock cast a questioning look at Jerre as if asking what was going on!

” Everyone, our battle has to be brought forward. The one in front is Eli, our enemy. ”

Jerre gritted his teeth. Although he had never seen Eli before, Eli’s image had long been engraved in his mind.

“Oh? Is this Eli? He looks very ordinary!” A Warlock with a Radiant Moon aura laughed disdainfully.

“Two micro star level celestials? He doesn’t think that this will be of any use, does he?”

“Hahahaha!”

As they flew, they got closer and closer to Eli. Finally, they stopped two kilometers away.

“Eli, you are very brave!” Jerre looked at Eli with a cold gaze.

Eli did not answer. He looked at Jerre and activated his mental power.

Within a 200-mile radius of this area, countless shadows began to turn into the fog, slowly covering this area. In just a few seconds, they turned into a huge shadow of an “eggshell “, completely covering this area and blocking the vision of the outside world.

“What is this?”

A Warlock behind Jerre frowned. A flame burst out from his hand and flew into the sky.

The flames hit the shadow, but they were directly absorbed. It seemed to have no effect at all.

The Warlock frowned even more. He flew into the sky, and after flying for more than ten kilometers, he threw a punch at the shadow.

Bang!

A dull collision sound was heard, but the Shadow Barrier was still undamaged. The Warlock narrowed his eyes and quickly flew back to Jerre’s side.

“Patriarch, there’s something wrong with this barrier!” the Warlock said.

“Yes.” Jerre nodded. Actually, it wasn’t just this Warlock. The other Warlocks had tried to probe the shadow the moment it appeared, but they had all returned empty-handed. This shadow barrier was harder than anyone had imagined.

But even so, no one panicked because the barrier seemed to only block everyone inside and had no other effect.

As long as they dealt with Eli, everything would be over.

Everyone looked at Eli.

“Sir Jerre, let’s begin.” A Warlock grinned at Jere.

Jerre looked at Eli, and his aura gradually changed.

” Eli, you’ve offended the wrong person! ”

In the next second, Jerre instantly charged out. In the blink of an eye, a 150-meter-long manticore appeared in the sky. It then roared at Eli, causing ripples in the air. The Radiant Moon aura was released at this moment.

The others looked at each other and smiled. Everyone activated their bloodline avatars at the same time.

In an instant, ten streams of blood aura soared into the sky. In the blood mist, ten huge figures appeared in the air.

There were two 100-meter-long manticore lions, a 100-meter-tall giant deer with two sharp antlers on its head, a 200-meter-long silver moon wolf, a 100-meter-long fire rat with flames all over its body, a giant withered tree demon with life aura, a giant turtle with three scaly tails, a giant crocodile covered in black scales, and two giant birds. One was like a giant eagle, and the other was like a crane!

A total of eleven avatars appeared in the air. When they spread out, the pressure they brought was unprecedented. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In such an environment, a three-circle Warlock might not even be able to move.

” Eli, how should you deal with this? ” A thunderous voice rang out. Jerre stared at Eli with his large eyes, his scorpion tail swaying behind him.

The other ten celestial avatars also looked at Eli.

He was more than a meter tall, but in front of him were huge figures that were more than a hundred meters tall. Even the shadows could not cast any light.

At this moment, Eli was like a mortal who was about to be judged by the gods.

At this moment, even Nikola couldn’t help but feel nervous. He took a deep breath and looked sideways.

His lord was still calm, and Hydra was also glaring at the enemies without a trace of fear.

“Chimeras are really different!” The corner of Nikola’s mouth twitched, but he gradually became determined.

He recalled the spell formations they had set up!

…..

At this moment in the outside world.

The huge shadow covered the entire area within a radius of hundreds of miles as if it was cursed by a god.

A purple arc of light was flying toward them from a distance.

When they got close, the light dissipated, revealing two people.

Lobelia looked at the shadow barrier and frowned. “Are we still late? This should be the defense of the sealed area!”

She touched the shield with her hand and released it a few seconds later.

“I can’t open it!” Lobelia frowned.

” Teacher, if I’m not mistaken, this shield seems to be the works of Sir Eli. ” Liliana said.

...

“What?” Lobelia blinked.

Didn’t that mean that this was set up by Eli?

Was he that confident?

Lobelia frowned. At this moment, another golden light flew over from the corner of her eye.

“Someone is coming!”

The two of them instantly became vigilant.

The golden light in the distance gradually dissipated as it approached, revealing Conilla’s figure.

“Conilla!” Lobelia’s jaw dropped when she saw them. Why would the Golden Cicada Trade Union, a force that was more neutral than them, come?

She suddenly remembered the scene from that day. Conilla seemed to have mentioned Jin Ji!

What kind of relationship did Eli have with this big shot from the West Coast?

“Lobelia!” On the other side, Conilla was also surprised, as if he hadn’t expected to see her.

...

” Looks like you guys think highly of Eli! ” Conilla said with narrowed eyes.

He looked at the shadow and was about to take a look. Lobelia did not stop him.

A few seconds later, he returned.

“This seems to be a spell formation set up by Eli himself. I’ve tried it, but I can’t open it.” Lobelia explained.

“Is that so?” Conilla frowned and fell silent.

“Someone else is here!”

Suddenly, Liliana pointed at something not far away.

The five celestials had huge white wings spread out behind them as they flew over.

“The Amina Family!” Conilla and Lobelia exchanged a glance, feeling a little strange. They also noticed that the two Radiant Moons of this family seemed to have come.

” Everyone, I’m also here to support Sir Eli! ” Selona shouted in surprise.

The two of them were even more surprised!

Soon, seven celestials stood in front of the huge shadow barrier and looked at each other.

“What a mysterious person!” Lobelia took a deep breath. Even the Amina Family had come. This was ridiculous!

“As expected of the person Lord Jin Ji has taken a fancy to.” Conilla sighed.

“Hiss, luckily we came.” Selona looked at the two of them and heaved a sigh of relief.

Even these two neutral factions were willing to send Radiant Moon Warlocks to support Eli. As expected of Sir Eli!

As for Liliana, she pursed her lips. She felt that there was still a long way to go before she could win over Eli.

Could she really win him over?
