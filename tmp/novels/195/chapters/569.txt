570 David Awakens, Eve of Advancement

Eli rubbed his waist and watched Liliana leave. He took out the gem again after three days.

Eli opened his Mercury Eyes and observed carefully.

From the perspective of the Eye of Mercury, this gem was a mass of chaos. There was no fixed structure inside at all. Every time he observed it, he had a different feeling.

“Let’s go to the laboratory.” Eli shook his head and went to the laboratory.

Three days later.

Eli left the laboratory.

In the past three days, he had tried to polish the crystal a little, but he realized that even with his peak fifth-circle power, he could not even make a tiny scratch on it.

“Forget it. I’ll study it later!” Eli guessed that the gemstone might have something to do with the eighth circle, which was why he couldn’t do anything to it.

However, he was not in a hurry. He kept it for now. Perhaps he would know what it was in the future.

At the same time, something else happened.

David woke up.

..

The third floor of the Mage Tower.

In a room, Eli saw the real David again.

At present, due to absorbing the source of the Calamity Lich, he had regained his identity as a Lich. However, at the same time, the death of the Black Fog also reduced the large number of curses on his mind. It could even be said that he had returned to his most innocent self.

In other words, he was ” reborn “.

He had just gotten out of bed when Eli came in, and their eyes met.

Almost instantly, David knelt on the ground with a thump and said in shame, “Teacher, I’m sorry. I was wrong!”

During the time he was trapped by the black fog, he completely realized how ridiculous and wrong his actions were. He had even insisted on that ridiculous idea.

Looking at Eli’s face, which was the same as thousands of years ago, his heart was extremely complicated. Firstly, he missed his teacher, and secondly, he was ashamed and uneasy because he had done something wrong!

Assistant?

“Alright!”

Ely nodded.

At the same time, there was a knock on the door, and Vivika walked in.

She had heard that David had woken up and wanted to see who it was.

“This is Vivika!” Eli introduced them.

“Vivika?” David was stunned for a moment. That familiar name.

But their faces didn’t match.

He looked into Vivika’s eyes. His powerful mental strength allowed him to see more. The more he looked, the more familiar he felt.

In the end, he was sure that this woman definitely had a deep relationship with his former junior sister, Vivika.

“Hello, I’m Vivica.” Vivika also looked at the stranger curiously and reached out her hand.

“Hello, I’m David!”

David’s Soul Fire flickered as he reached out and held his hand. It was just like when they met in Bryne. One of them had become a Lich, while the other had lost her soul and melted into her bloodline.

“We’re all here, but we’re not.”

When Eli saw this scene, his emotions were inexplicably complicated!

Time flowed!

Eli had once again returned to his days of experimenting and cultivating. However, this time, he had another assistant!

At the same time, the new order in the Central Continent was gradually re-established. The new Bloodline Tower was established on the basis of the alliance. It broke the power of the family system and transformed it into a central system, with the Bloodline Tower taking care of everything.

Everything was progressing.

At the same time, Eli also received a message from Laura.

It was about the Deep Sea’s view of this development.

After all, the moderate faction was more powerful than the aggressive faction, so the news of starting a war against the mainland was directly rejected. However, the Deep Sea’s view of the mainland gradually began to change.

After all, a unified force still made them feel very uncomfortable!

Eli naturally understood, but he still hoped that the peace could last a little longer.

” The Sea Tribe isn’t like humans. There are definitely many powerful creatures left behind. At least the rulers of the Sea Tribe are at the peak of the fifth circle. I need to get to the sixth circle,” Eli sighed.

At this moment, he had already reached the peak in all aspects.

Once he adjusted his condition, he would enter the time world fragment and complete his breakthrough to the sixth circle.

He was still adjusting.

..

Three years later!

On this day, Eli was doing an experiment with David’s assistance.

Suddenly, he stopped.

“Teacher, is it an experimental problem?” David asked curiously.

“No, no problem, but I might need to leave for a while.” He shook his head.

“Where are you going?”

“To do something very important. I don’t know how long I’ll be gone,” Eli said to David. “But if anything happens to the organization while I’m gone, I’ll need you to take care of it. Is that okay?”

“Of course!” David was stunned.

After he woke up, he regained his former combat strength.

No one was his match except for Eli!

“But why is Milord in such a hurry?” he asked anxiously.

“This is an emergency!” Eli nodded and checked his own things while giving instructions on the development of his forces.

David listened in a daze.

A minute later, Eli placed a hand on his shoulder and said solemnly, “I’ll leave this to you!”

In the next second, he saw Eli’s figure disappear in front of him.

At the same time, not far from the Grassi Land, the aura of the teleportation array suddenly activated.

“In the Mage Tower?” David quickly walked towards the teleportation circle and found that it was at the bottom of the tower. However, the teleportation circle was already damaged, as if it had been deliberately destroyed.

At the same time, Alida’s figure suddenly appeared at the entrance of the Grassi Land.

She quickly arrived and asked David, “What happened? Why did Milord suddenly send me so many messages, telling me about our future plans?”

It had been three years, so David and Alida naturally knew each other.

“The lord only said that he would leave for a period of time, and then he left.”

Alida was speechless.

Was it so hasty?

..

At the same time!

In the time world fragment!

“I’ve already sealed this area. No one below the sixth circle can disrupt me. I’ve already prepared enough resources.” Eli looked around and took a deep breath.

He headed to the center of the spell formation that he had fixed.

Eli closed his eyes.

He couldn’t take it anymore. He really couldn’t take it anymore!

He needed to break through!
