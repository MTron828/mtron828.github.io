557 Checking the Harvest, Advancing, Intuition

On the other side.

After ending the battle, Eli chatted for a while before flying back to Grassi Land.

He could not wait to take stock of his gains this time.

Under the shade of Hill’s tree, Eli sat on a chair and looked at the long string of portal items floating in the air. There were hundreds of them, all generously gifted by these Warlocks!

“However, that’s all. Unfortunately, I don’t know where their lair is!” Eli shook his head and began to take stock of them one by one.

Advanced Magic Stones!

Soul Crystal!

A precious bloodline!

One item after another was slowly taken out by Eli and thrown to the side.

These things might have been very precious to him in the past, but they were dispensable to him now. As long as he wanted them, he could collect them at any time.

As the rings were opened and closed one by one.

An hour later, Eiy opened another storage bag and saw a huge eyeball in it. It was about three meters in size and was as beautiful as transparent jade.

“The eyeball of a three-eyed giant!” Eli’s eyes lit up.

The three-eyed giant was a giant species with outstanding spiritual attributes. It was one of the giants with the highest bloodline. Its level had reached the level of a sixth-circle giant. It was most likely left behind by a former Mage.

“This eyeball should be able to improve my Eye of Mercury once again!” Eli pondered.

The Eye of Mercury was currently only at the Intermediate Level of the Fifth circle. Although he often used it subconsciously, its level was higher, so its progress was slow.

Perhaps this time, he could allow the Eye of Mercury to evolve and even reach the sixth circle.

Gulp!

Thinking of this possibility, Eli also became excited.

” Calm down, calm down.” Eli kept the eyeball and continued to take stock of the goods, looking forward to even greater gains.

In fact, he was thinking too much.

After that eyeball, he didn’t manage to get anything that surprised him.

There was only one reward in one battle.

However, he was still very calm because this was not the only thing he had gained this time. There were also two hidden gains. One was the increased power of faith and the power of laws of those hundred Warlocks.

Thinking of this, Eli sent his senses into his body.

The huge tree of laws was entrenched. Thousands of roots penetrated deep into the darkness, absorbing the power of laws hidden within. Flowers of laws slowly bloomed on the crown.

Maybe ten years later, he could absorb all these laws. Looking at this, Eli felt that the future was bright.

“No, I’ll go immediately!”

Eli walked straight to the wizard tower. He wanted to go to the time world fragment immediately.

..

A month passed in the blink of an eye. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ten years had passed in the time world fragment.

In the depths of the fragment, Eli was comprehending his gains.

In the past month, on the one hand, the power of faith had truly exploded. The thirty-six petals of power of faith had grown to forty-two petals, and it was still growing. On the other hand, his strength had also grown to the peak of the Thousand Flower Realm.

“Peak of the Thousand Flower Realm!”

Ely looked at the 10,000 flowers of laws swaying on the tree of laws in his body and let out a heartfelt sigh.

Thousands of years of bitter cultivation could not compare to a huge battle.

However, he knew that there would not be a second chance. After all, almost all the old, weak, and sick Warlocks in the fifth circle of the Warlock World had come out, which allowed him to quickly cross this stage.

“So, I can prepare to break through the laws next. However, I still need some time to get used to it. After all, the improvement this time is too fast. I’ll rest for a while and then do experiments to relax.” he muttered.

He wasn’t a robot, so he needed to rest.

As for the upgrade of the Eye of Mercury, he planned to put it aside for later!

Soon, Eli left the world fragment and returned to the Grassi Land.

Looking at the picturesque green valley, his mood instantly improved.

For the next month, he did nothing. He did not go to the laboratory, the time world fragment, or even meditate. All he did was bask in the sun, chat, and go out for a walk every day to digest the pressure of the past period of time.

During this process, Eli would occasionally participate in the alliance’s matters.

The impact of this war was extremely far-reaching.

Not only did the Alliance become more united, but some Warlocks who had been hiding also came out and joined the Bloodline Tower. Even the Lich Tower had given up most of the central region and retreated to the northern region.

The last point surprised even Eli.

After all, the Lich Tower was still strong. Why would they retreat for no reason? It felt a little funny. Eli could only treat it as their fear of the Bloodline Alliance!

In any case, at least in the short term, there shouldn’t be too much conflict between the two sides.

Unless Eli took the initiative.

However, that was basically impossible. After all, he was still busy breaking through the laws!

He was still very weak.

“I’ve rested enough. It’s time to do the experiment.” Eli felt that he was in a better state than ever. Wasn’t this the best time to do experiments?

Moreover, it was time for him to devour the eyeball of the three-eyed giant and advance to the Eye of Mercury.

..

Another month passed.

In the laboratory.

Silver light bloomed in Eli’s eyes, but his brows were tightly knitted as he looked at the experiment table in front of him.

Compared to a month ago, although the Eye of Mercury had not broken through to the fifth ring, it had already reached the peak of the fifth ring. It could be said that it had made great progress.

This was a happy thing, but at this moment, Eli couldn’t be happy.

The reason for this started three days ago. On that day, when the Silver Eye was purifying, he immediately began to study the law of light. Using the same power, he observed the lich appropriately.

However, from his observation, he discovered something amiss!

He could vaguely feel a curse in the Lich’s soul. The curse was very strange. Eli did not know what it was, but the aura it emitted was related to a law Eli was familiar with.

That was the Black Fog Law!

“Are Liches related to the Black Fog Law?” Eli blinked.

It was no wonder that the Lich’s spirit could resist falling into darkness. It definitely had something to do with this.

However, the fact that it originated from the Black Fog Law still made him feel a faint sense of unease. It was an instinctive unease that he could not describe, but it did exist.

“It’s like a warning.” Eli trusted his intuition.

“Liches, eternal life, souls that have fallen into darkness.” Eli began to think about some of the characteristics of the Lich, and the uneasiness in his heart became stronger and stronger, as well as a little twisted.

Yes, how could there be such a creature?

Eternal life?

A simple transformation would grant one eternal life. After all, the ritual was not complicated. Wouldn’t it be too exaggerated and tempting? Even if the price was the corruption of the soul, it was still shocking enough.

“It’s like a bait, a trick of the devil in the story!” Eli muttered.

Yes, bait.

He felt that there was probably something hidden inside!

” Is there a conspiracy? Forget it, forget it. It was useless to think about this.” After thinking for a moment, Eli gave up.

After all, it was just his conjecture. Maybe the lich found this new path from the curse of the black mist!

Of course, this still made him a little wary.

“Becoming stronger is the right path. After the Eye of Mercury evolved, I feel that I am getting closer and closer to the law of light. It seems that I have to master it quickly. This way, if anything really happens, I can deal with it. Of course, it’s time to advance to a law Mage!” Eli became determined.

At the same time, he regretted wasting a month of his time.

At this dangerous moment, he was actually indulging in happiness.

This kind of thinking was definitely not desirable in the future!

“Only by becoming stronger can we deal with everything that comes next, whether it’s the Lich, the Lich King, or even other threats!” Eli muttered, clenching his fists.

But at the same time, he seemed to have thought of something and asked himself a question. “Eh? What is the background of the Lich King? And who is it?”

Eli had dealt with liches for a long time. However, he knew almost nothing about this Lich King.

Even the Bloodline Tower’s files didn’t have any information about this person. It was as if he had appeared out of thin air.

“I have to check. No, maybe there is some information in those Warlock and Lich rings. I was only focused on the spoils of war and didn’t pay attention to potential information.” As he thought about it, he took out the space rings.

The second round of inspection began.

After checking the items one by one, Eli’s powerful mental power really made him discover something.

There seemed to be an identical contract in all the rings. It should be the contract with the Lich Tower. Therefore, Eli, who was curious, opened the contracts.

A powerful mental power instantly swept through the contents, but Eli was stunned on the spot.

He looked at the name at the end of the scroll and the aura on it.

His gaze was a little dazed!

“David?”

Eli opened his mouth wide in surprise.
