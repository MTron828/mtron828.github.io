514 Shadow Chains

“This is called stupidity, hahaha!” The one on the right let out a relaxed smile.

“You didn’t run?!” The left side was a little surprised.

“You poor old fellows dare to enter the Warlock World from outer space and consume your already scarce life force. Why wouldn’t I dare to face you?” Eli answered calmly.

“Old?” The three of them were stunned. A flash of anger appeared in their eyes.

These words were incendiary. They had stronger combat power and longer lifespans, but they had no choice but to hide in outer space like pitiful worms. Therefore, the three of them were instantly angered by Eli!

!!

“Eli!”

In an instant, the lightning python in the center let out a roar. Then, its ten-thousand-meter-long body swayed and rushed away. The rippling air stirred up a storm, and lightning coiled around it as it rushed toward Eli.

The impact was terrifying, as if it wanted to tear Eli apart.

Countless people watched this scene in a daze, their bodies instinctively feeling fear.

Not far away.

Eli calmly took out his staff. In an instant, an invisible time ripple spread out in space. A ripple instantly spread out in all directions, with Eli as the center.

In an instant, the ripples swept past the incoming lightning python.

“How can I be so slow to take a turn? No, the time has changed!”

The lightning python felt everything around it and was a little stunned. However, in the next second, it revealed a cruel smile again and said, “Time domain is very rare. However, can you resist lightning?”

In the next second, lightning gathered on its pure white horn and aimed at Eli.

The dazzling light even caused cracks to appear in space. The law of explosion was also brewing within as if it wanted to directly shatter the domain and kill Eli.

Bang!

The lightning liquid flashed across the sky, but everyone was stunned to discover that the speed of this lighting…Something didn’t seem right!

On the ground, countless people looked at the bolt of lightning that seemed to contain powerful power. Although it was fast, it could still be captured and easily dodged by Eli.

“Just this?”

Everyone was stunned.

But in the next second, they knew that they were wrong. The lightning crossed Eli and crossed the time domain. In an instant, the light disappeared from their eyes. Then, a thousand-meter-long lightning exploded in the mountains hundreds of kilometers away.

Bang!

A nuclear bomb exploded, and everyone closed their eyes in pain.

This was only the beginning. The light shone for a few minutes before it stopped. Everyone then realized that the city’s defensive light screen was already riddled with injuries.

Under the impact of that massive elemental force, everything was damaged.

At this moment, everyone finally understood what the fifth circle meant!

Not good…Then my lord…

Everyone raised their heads to look at the ground, but a trace of dullness flashed in their eyes.

“Eli, you liar, you must have deceived someone!”

In the sky, in the time domain, the lightning python was entangled by countless shadow chains. Each chain was tens of thousands of meters long, and one end was inserted into the void. They were wrapped around the lightning python’s body. At this moment, the lightning python was roaring, and its white horn was emitting lightning, but it was stopped by the shadows.

Not far away, two shadows turned into two smaller shadow pythons that were thousands of meters long. They were trying to stop them from rescuing the captured python. At this moment, the two of them were also furious.

The moment the white light exploded, a boundless shadow appeared beside Eli.

Not only did the shadow transform into a chain that bound the python, but it also prevented the two from helping.

This sudden change shocked and terrified the three of them!

This also made them understand that the enemy in front of them was definitely a Warlock on the same level as them. Even in the embryonic stage, he was definitely a top-notch existence.

As for the Divine Tree stage, they didn’t have any thoughts about it. Whether it was the advancement wave that erupted ten years ago or the fact that they had seen that stage themselves, they understood that it was impossible for Eli to advance in such a short period of time.

That would require a large amount of time or some extremely precious resources. And those resources, other than them, were impossible for other factions to obtain.

“Eli, I think we can talk!” The trapped lightning python struggled but found that it was impossible to break free. The guy in front of them was stronger than they thought.

“No need!”

Eli shook his head and extended his hand.

A shadow spear condensed in the sky on the right. In the blink of an eye, it spread to 100 meters, then 1,000 meters, and finally 10,000 meters, emitting terrifying fluctuations.

“No!”

The three of them shouted at the same time.

In the next second, the shadow spear shot out.

Ah!

Painful wails instantly spread throughout the world. Everyone only saw countless drops of blood drifting and falling to the ground. Every drop of blood emitted a faint lightning fluctuation. Even a one-circle warlock might not be able to withstand it.

Then, they looked at the sky.

The giant lightning python was currently fixed in the sky, and a 10,000-meter-long shadow spear pierced through it. It also gave off a terrifying devouring power, and the python’s body became wretched at speed visible to the naked eye. Its vitality was also rapidly devoured, and it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

After that, the lightning python slowly dispersed.

In the sky, there was an old Warlock who had been pierced through. His flesh was stuck to his bones, like a skeleton, without any vitality.

Without a doubt, he was dead.

Dead?

Countless people stared blankly at this scene.

“He died just like that? How was that possible? That was a fifth-circle warlock! No, from their conversation just now, could it be that Lord Eli also had fifth circle!”

“Sir, you actually have five rings? I knew it. I knew that Sir would definitely win!”

“Bullsh * t. It was you who cried just now.”

Bloodline City was in an uproar. Countless people looked up at Eli in the sky as if they were looking at a god. Not far away, the two lightning pythons were already stunned. They turned around and wanted to leave!

“Trying to run?”

Eli glanced at it, and the Time Domain instantly flattened and extended toward the two of them. Then, countless chains wrapped around the two of them again.

“Sir, please spare my life!”

“We’ll leave now. We’ll definitely teach Azak a lesson.”

“This junior, Azak, is cheating us.”

The two Germinal Warlocks struggled, but when the countless shadows enveloped them, the bloodline power in their bodies quickly drained. The two of them were in despair, and they flew toward Eli.

“Don’t worry. I won’t kill you!” Eli said calmly.

Their eyes lit up.

“A living fifth circle warlock is more valuable than a dead one. I’ve never seen an experimental material of this level before!” Eli smiled, but in their eyes, it was like the call of the devil.

Despair flashed in one person’s eyes while the other cursed. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Eli, you will die a horrible death. I advise you to let us go. Otherwise, when our family’s Divine Tree Warlock comes, you will definitely die without a burial place!”

“I’m warning you. I’m warning you. I’m warning you, let us go. Ah, please, please, don’t… Gululu.”

The shadow completely wrapped the two of them, but Eli ignored them.

Then, he looked at the ground and saw the light of faith slowly disappear. He nodded at the ground and flew back to the Grassi Land as if he was taking a walk!

At this moment, on the ground.

Everyone looked at the disappearing sky, the terrifying lightning that still permeated the air, the fifth circle aura, and the thunderstorm caused by the blood of the Lightning Python not far away. They were still in a daze.

“Is it over just like that?” A Warlock stared blankly at the Warlock beside him.

“Uh, it seems like it’s over.” The Warlock was silent for a moment before speaking.

“Yes, it’s over!” The Warlock nodded.

He raised his head and looked at the other areas of the city. At this moment, the city had already woken up from its daze. Most of them were cheering and celebrating their survival. There were also some who were shouting Eli’s name.

Not far away, the statue of Eli was also filled with people, all of whom were thanking him.

Further away.

Liliana exhaled deeply and smiled. “You bastard, I knew you had a trump card up your sleeve, but to think that you could do this, when did you advance to the fifth circle?

“That was ridiculous. Those were three Germinal Warlocks!

“The Hamis family is about to explode!”

The top of the city!

As the person in charge of the Bloodline Tower, Alida also pursed her lips and returned.

She needed some time.

This was too ridiculous!
