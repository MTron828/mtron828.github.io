522 The Phoenix of Death

“What? Jin Ji came to visit me?”

In the Tower, Eli asked curiously as he listened to Vivika.

“Yes, Lord Jin Ji is outside.” Vivika nodded.

During this period of time, Vivika had been rapidly improving with the help of the Hamis family’s resources and was only a step away from Radiant Moon.

“Then call him in.”

Eli nodded. He was also curious as to why Jin Ji was looking for him at this time. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, sir!” Vivika nodded and left.

A minute later.

The door opened again, but this time, only Jin Ji entered.

Jin Ji’s appearance and attire did not change much, but what surprised Eli was that Jin Ji’s face was very pale. The Golden Cicada’s Fate had also dissipated a lot, especially its aura, which had fallen from the Glorious Sun to the Morning Star!

What happened?

The Warlock Alliance shouldn’t have made a move on him. It shouldn’t be!

“Sir, long time no see.” On the other hand, Jin Ji greeted him warmly, then smiled bitterly and said, “This time, I’m asking you to take in a sorry person like me!”

“Take you in? That’s fine! But looking at you, what exactly happened?” Eli waved his hand, and Jin Ji sat opposite him.

“I’m leaving the Golden Cicada Merchant Association!” The first sentence that Jin Ji said when he sat down stunned Eli!

“You left the Golden Cicada Merchant Association?” Eli found it hard to believe.

After all, Jin Ji had been with the Golden Cicada Merchant Association for thousands of years and was bound by his bloodline. Moreover, he had done a lot for the merchant association. Why would he suddenly leave?

However, such a drop in level was reasonable. After all, the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce was very special and had a lot to do with wealth. Once they left the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce, they would naturally fall!

“Yes, because of the alliance, I was kicked out. Now, I can only come and rely on you.” Jin Ji smiled as if he was not sad. Instead, there was a glimmer of light in his eyes!

Is that so?

Eli instantly understood what had happened!

Golden Cicada played a very important role in the alliance. It seemed like he didn’t have the same ideas as the president of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association and had chosen their side.

After understanding what had happened, Eli felt a lot more relaxed. He looked at Jin Ji with a more serious gaze.

“Of course. The Bloodline Tower is still lacking a Minister of Finance.” Eli replied with a smile.

“Thank you, sir!” Jin Ji had been worried that Eli would not want him, but when he heard this, he felt relieved and stood up to express his loyalty.

“Oh, there is also Conilla and my other subordinates…”

“All of them! Get Vivika to go find Alida.” Eli waved his hand. “Get familiar with the Bloodline Tower first and ask her to make some arrangements.”

“Yes, my lord!”

Jin Ji nodded. Then, Eli called Vivika in and left with her.

..

Just as Jin Ji was familiarizing himself with the environment, the representatives of the various forces and the Family Heads arrived at Bloodline City. They arranged for them to rest and prepare for the alliance meeting in a few days.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye!

On this day.

The entire Bloodline City was in an uproar. Countless Warlocks walked out of their houses, and the city was decorated with lanterns and streamers of various colors.

In the sky above the city, many airships were flying, and countless colored muslin hung down.

A huge red carpet extended from the tallest wizard tower to the city gate.

On the red carpet, the Sea Dragon Clan Head and the Sea Shark Clan Head walked up side by side, looking at the scenery on both sides and sighing with emotion.

“Sea Dragon, look at Bloodline City. Whether it’s the infrastructure or the liveliness, I don’t think it’s any worse than Heaven City. It seems like this lord is not only good at fighting!” The head of the Sea Shark clan sighed with emotion.

“Yes,” The head of the Sea Dragon Clan nodded with a relaxed expression.

Just last night, they had already discussed the matters of the alliance. Today was just a formality to announce the establishment of the alliance and hold a banquet.

“But it’s a pity that the lord was unwilling to be the alliance leader. Alida, a Morning Star, was the one who became the alliance leader!” At this moment, another voice was heard. The two of them turned around and saw a man wearing a green warlock robe.

“It’s the head of the Wind God Family!” Sea Dragon smiled at them. They had only gotten to know each other in the past few days, but they still felt like old friends at first sight!

“But that’s not the case. Everyone knows that Eli isn’t the Bloodline Tower’s Tower Master, but the Bloodline Tower has always been firmly controlled by him!” Patriarch Sea Shark smiled.

“That’s true!”

The other two smiled. This was indeed reasonable.

As they chatted, they arrived at the top of the city. There was a square with a high platform in the middle. A large number of Warlocks had gathered inside. They were all from the families that had come this time.

When these families saw the three of them, they also made way for them.

The three of them didn’t pay any attention. They just looked at the high platform. At this moment, Alida was on top of it, loudly announcing the future of the Alliance.

“From now on, the Bloodline Alliance is officially established!”

Bang!

In the next second, dozens of skyships in the sky fired fireworks. Countless dazzling lights bloomed in the sky, and even the elemental robe roared. It was extremely beautiful!

The three of them looked at each other and saw the joy in each other’s eyes.

Now that the alliance had been established, they would have someone to take care of in the future. They would face the same enemy, the Warlock Alliance.

“Not bad!”

Further further away, Eli stood at the top of a wizard tower, watching this scene with Vivika standing beside him.

“Brother Eli, aren’t you going to show yourself?” Vivika asked curiously.

“No need!” Eli smiled.

“Alright then.” Alida did not refute him. She just stood beside him and admired the fireworks that filled the sky. She inadvertently approached him and was about to stick close to him.

Hehe!

A cunning look flashed in Alida’s eyes.

Suddenly, Eli put his hand on her shoulder.

Alida’s pupils widened, and her heart trembled.

Could it be…

However, when she turned around, she saw that Eli was looking up at the sky with a serious expression.

Vivika was stunned and looked up.

Suddenly, a layer of black fog appeared in the blue sky. An incomparably huge object surrounded by black fog entered the Warlock World.

It was as if it had the power of space. In the blink of an eye, it appeared more than 10,000 meters above Bloodline City, blocking the light and casting a shadow.

And it was still slowly falling!

“What is this?” Facing this sudden change, her mouth was wide open.

” Large World Fragment!”

Eli’s gaze was calm as he looked at the huge world fragment.

The world fragment wrapped in the black fog was undoubtedly from the outer layer of the world. Why would it suddenly appear here? Who did it? He didn’t even notice.

Not only him but everyone else also looked up at this scene.

“This is?”

Many family heads felt uneasy.

Today was the day the alliance was established. Would there be any accidents?

While everyone was guessing, the black fog of the world fragment suddenly stirred. A huge bird’s head poked out of the world fragment. Just its head was more than ten meters long, and its black eyes flickered as if they contained darkness!

“What kind of monster is this?” The Sea Dragon Clan Head’s body tensed up as a fatal threat lingered in his heart.

Not only him but at this moment, everyone could only see a fatal feeling!

It was as if as long as the bird came out, all of them would die.

Everyone did not dare to move and stared at the bird’s head.

In the next second, the bird let out a cry, and the huge and evil mental attack made everyone feel chill. A large number of low-level Warlocks fell to the ground, and even the defensive spell formation of the Bloodline City was activated.

“What kind of powerful creature is it?”

This time, everyone could feel how powerful he was, and fear appeared on their faces.

And this was only the beginning. Everyone saw bird heads poking out of the black fog one after another. Although their breathing was weaker at the beginning, there were thousands of them.

Countless bird heads looked at everyone on the ground, and everyone felt despair.

On the wizard tower, Eli ignored the small ones and only looked at the huge bird head that was coming out. His eyes were puzzled.

” A falling world fragment.

“Undying Phoenix?”
