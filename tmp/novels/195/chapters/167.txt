168 Saving Ross

“No, there are still some!”

Suddenly, Eli pushed away a broken bookshelf. There were still some books under it.

“A popular science book!” Eli picked it up and looked at the cover of the book, which had the words “a comprehensive guide to the races of the mage world “. He picked up the other two books, and they were similar.

However, it was normal. When they evacuated back then, the Mages must have taken away most of the knowledge. Only some of it was left behind.

Thus, Eli quickly went through the books, and in the end, he managed to gather about a hundred books on the first floor. Although most of them were about science, there were still some books that were about research and magic. Eli felt that they might be of help to his research on the second seal or stage of the endless devouring spell.

After confirming that he had finished searching the first floor, he continued to go up.

Walking up the stairs that were covered in a thick layer of dust, Eli could see through the window at the side that Molin was being beaten up and was screaming.

The library had a total of two floors, and the situation on the second floor was different from what Eli had imagined. He had thought that there might be more things left here, but there seemed to be even less.

Eli sighed, and in an instant, a large shadow covered the entire second floor. He did not believe that there was really nothing here. This was unreasonable.

The shadows flowed everywhere, drilling into every crack in this place.

Kachaa!

Suddenly, it was as if a mechanism had been activated.

Hearing the sound, Eli looked over and took a few steps back. A hole suddenly appeared on the wall a dozen meters away, revealing a small hidden space.

The space wasn’t big, only about one cubic meter, but it was filled with books.

“Oh? “Eli’s eyes lit up.

With a wave of his hand, a spirit of the dead appeared. It moved to the space and took out all the books.

“basic principles of alchemy “, ” alchemy capital “, ” 100 attempts “, ” crosos alchemy notes “…

‘This is a complete system of knowledge!’

Who said that there was nothing good here?

Eli took a deep breath and casually picked up one of the books. The content was the basic techniques of alchemy, but Eli was very excited to read it, because in he had almost no involvement in alchemy.

If he could master all of these books, it would mean that he would learn a new skill, and it would be a skill that would benefit him for life. There were not many suitable mage tools now, so couldn’t he just make one himself?

In addition, when Eli had fully mastered alchemy, he could carry out a second transformation on his current mage tools and refine them.

“Not bad, not bad. I’ll have something to do when I get back.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face, and he carefully stored all the items in the books in the secret realm.

Then, he carefully checked the entire library again. After confirming that there were no books there, he turned around and left.

Walking out of the library again, Eli saw that Molin was still under siege.

“eh, these alchemy dolls are all products of alchemy. They should be of some help to my alchemy research.” Originally, he did not care about the alchemy doll. After all, he had the undead. But now, he had some ideas.

“Damn you! If I find out who you are, you’re going to die!” Molin saw that Eli had come out and immediately roared angrily.

He was there being beaten up while Eli reaped the rewards. Was there any justice in this world?

However, to his surprise, the man turned around and walked toward him.

Molin was dumbfounded!

“that’s great. If he can distract the dolls, I’ll be able to escape.” A second later, Molin was overjoyed.

“A little closer, a little closer. Yes, yes, yes.” Molin was overjoyed. He looked at Eli as if he was looking at an idiot. As long as he could get out of this, he would definitely kill Eli.

“Coming. Coming.”

As Eli got closer and closer, one of the alchemy dolls seemed to have finally sensed him, and then, under Molin’s surprised expression, it walked towards him.

“That’s great!” Mo Lin turned around and was about to leave, but when he turned back again, he was dumbfounded!

‘Why is the alchemy doll’s head in that man’s hand? What is he doing? why does it seem like he’s studying it?’

Molin was stunned!

Then, under his dazed and confused gaze, the man walked over and reached out, holding an alchemy doll in each hand. The One circle alchemy dolls were like toys in his hands.

By the time Eli destroyed the core of the last doll, only a dozen seconds had passed.

As for Molin, he was already dumbfounded. His body trembled slightly, and cold sweat kept flowing down his back.

Something was wrong. This was definitely not a first-circle warlock. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Sir, this is a misunderstanding.” Mo Lin tried his best to grin and smile awkwardly. As for his previous thoughts, he had long forgotten them completely.

“Misunderstanding?”

A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

“Why do I remember that Dick told you to kill me?” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

Dick?

Molin was stunned, but in the next second, his eyes instantly widened, and his pupils dilated as he realized something.

“Are you…? ” Molin pointed at Eli in disbelief.

The next second, he turned and ran. At this time, he already understood that this guy had definitely hidden his strength.

However, the next second, he felt a large shadow coming from behind him. He turned around and looked with a face full of fear. However, the shadow had already reached him and wrapped him up.

A few minutes later, the shadow dispersed, and Eli walked out.

“Sigh, I can only say that you’re unlucky!” Eli walked out of the shadows and shook his head.

If not for the fact that he happened to obtain the alchemy books and needed the alchemy doll as a reference, he might have just left.

However, it was nothing. Even without Eli, Molin might have died under the siege of the alchemy dolls, so Eli had freed him in advance.

Molin would probably thank him.

Probably.

After briefly cleaning up the traces, Eli walked outside.

Suddenly, Ross’s soul fluctuated.

“Oh? ” Eli sensed it.

“Sir Herman, I just saw Adams. He just killed one of our late-stage first-circle warlocks, but his strength and speed are not something a normal first-circle sorcerer can display. He is much stronger than Sir Rawls. This is very abnormal.

“Sir, if you encounter Adams, you must run away quickly.”

So it was a message?

Eli smiled. It could be considered that Eli had helped Ross twice.

When Ross was young, Eli saved him from the enemies of his father. When Ross was captured and imprisoned by White Tower, Eli rescued him again.

Therefore, Ross was loyal to Eli, not to mention that he had a soul imprint. Although he had wasted many years in prison, his talent was really not bad. He had also broken through to the middle stage of the first-circle and was only one step away from the late stage.

He was considered one of Eli’s trusted aides.

But in the next second, the soul fluctuation appeared again.

“Damn it, damn it, Lord, I’ve been discovered. This guy is too strong. I’m close to the east side of the secret realm, no, the west side. Lord, please don’t come over. This guy has already gone crazy from killing. I won’t be able to live for long. But that direction should be safe. You can just hide there.”

The messy words and the continuous soul fluctuations undoubtedly indicated that Ross was going through something. He seemed to be escaping while sending messages to Eli.

Even when his life was in danger, his first reaction was to tell Eli where he was so that Eli could be safe!

With such a subordinate, Eli suddenly felt a little touched.

Eli pursed his lips. He was currently on the east side of the mystery realm, so he could definitely make it in time.

To save or not to save, that was the question.

But the answer was definite.

He would save Ross again.

Eli looked in that direction, and the shadows under his feet moved. He sensed Ross’s position and flew forward.

Eli would make Adams understand the true meaning of a disguise.
