254 The Furious Sergei

“Teacher!”

Vivika was a little surprised.

That was a late-stage third-circle warlock!

Moreover, he was not an ordinary warlock but an experienced warlock.

Did he die just like that?

This was too unexpected!

“As expected!” Nikola sighed and shook his head.

My lord had indeed become stronger!

At this moment, after finishing off Noah, Eli flew over to the two of them.

“Teacher!”

“My Lord!” The two of them immediately replied respectfully.

“Vivika, I’m going to leave the bloodline tower for a while. The situation here is a little unstable!” Eli ignored him and said to Vivika.

Noah’s arrival was a warning to him. There were still many unstable factors between the forces. He needed a more stable environment to digest his strength, and the bloodline tower did not have this condition at the moment!

Eli planned to take a look at the irises camp.

The irises deep in the mountains were the most suitable place for him.

“What? teacher, you’re leaving?!” Vivika was surprised.

“Yes, I’ll leave temporarily!” Eli nodded.

“Alright then!” Vivika looked worried. Once her teacher left, the environment here would become even more unstable, but she didn’t say it out loud because she didn’t want to cause trouble for her teacher!

“don’t worry, I’ll leave Nikola here. He’s pretty strong, so there won’t be any problems!” As if he could read Vivika’s mind, Eli said.

“Ah?” Nikola’s mouth was wide open, and his soul trembled!

“But my lord, I’m only at the early stage of third circle. I’m afraid this strength isn’t enough!”

“It’s fine!” Eli smiled, and a shadow appeared before his eyes. A crystal slowly appeared and flew towards Nikola.

The crystal was about the size of a pigeon’s egg, and it was black all over. One could also sense that there was something like flowing water in it. It looked very pure, and one would want to swallow it in one bite.

“This is Noah’s spirit crystal. After absorbing this, you should be able to advance to the middle stage!” Eli could tell that Nikola was already at the limit and was planning to help him.

“Thank you, my Lord.” Nikola’s eyes lit up when he saw the crystal.

At his level, ordinary low-level spirit crystals had almost no effect on him. At most, they could be used as supplements. Only high-level ones were useful, but he could not get high-level ones. So, his strength did not improve much over the years.

But with this, he would be able to break through to the intermediate stage. By then, with his experience as a Mage, he would be able to burst out with at least the strength of an experienced intermediate-stage Mage.

“Then you can stay here. As for the undead in the forest of death, you can bring them over. Vivika will arrange it!” Eli said to them.

“yes, there’s an area not far from the bloodline tower that’s extremely cold. It’s very suitable for the undead to live in!” Vivika said quickly. If Nikola were in the bloodline tower, they would be in a much better situation with two third-circle warlocks.

“Okay, then I’ll stay here!” Nikola’s eyes lit up.

“you can arrange it yourself. If there’s no accident, I’ll leave here today!” Eli looked at the two of them, then said to Vivika, “If anything happens, you can inform me at any time!”

Knowing it was one thing and not taking action was another!

“Alright!” Vivika was touched. She knew that her teacher still cared about her!

“Alright, let’s go back. I’ll pack up and leave!”

Eli was very anxious. He had no choice. Although he wasn’t weak right now, if that ultimate Warlock from the heart of the darkness knew that he had killed so many of their people, he would definitely be furious.

If he were to run over directly, Eli might not even be his match.

Therefore, it was better to run first!

..

At this moment, in the heart of darkness!

Sergei gritted his teeth in his high-back chair, his face gloomy.

“Damn it, damn it!”

Sergei’s eyes seemed to be burning with anger. He slammed the table, and the table made of hard Ironwood was instantly broken. However, he slowly closed his eyes to calm his anger.

“Noah’s dead. It’s the bloodline tower’s doing!”

He took a deep breath!

Noah had the night demonic Wolf bloodline, so they had a special way of contacting each other. Just now, Noah told him that he had encountered a terrifying enemy. He was no match for him at all, and then he was pulled into the shadows.

In the shadow, he struggled madly. However, the shadow seemed to be able to devour everything. His mental strength, physical strength, and even the power of his bloodline were slowly disappearing.

In the end, before he died, he only had time to send Eli’s message to Sergei.

“He suspected the true mastermind is behind the bloodline family, a Warlock close to the limit of the third circle? ”

After venting, Sergei also calmed down.

He didn’t expect the house of the bloodline to have such a powerful person.

“Oh, right, there was a battle with black Isotta more than a hundred years ago. At that time, black Isotta suddenly disappeared. It was probably him too!” He suddenly sucked in a breath of cold air as he recalled an old story.

He didn’t care much about the news at the time, but now it seemed to be a problem!

“A late-stage third circle warlock!” Sergei frowned, a little annoyed.

To be honest, he didn’t really care about Eli. He was more concerned about losing Noah, but not that much.

...

Noah’s strength was decent.

However, whether it was his bloodline, talent, or even potential, he could only be considered a decent third-circle warlock. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In contrast, Sergei had fused with the four-ring bloodline, the night Demon Wolf King bloodline, and he was at the limit of three rings. On the West Coast, there was no one who could match him, not even the Holy tower’s master!

“However, you can’t just walk away like this after killing my people!”

Sergei sneered.

He didn’t care, but he had to do something.

Otherwise, it would damage his prestige!

“there’s nothing to do with the Holy tower now anyway. I’ll deal with this guy who’s trying to play tricks first and then come back to fight with the Holy tower slowly. The process will probably take decades anyway!” Sergei slowly stood up.

The moonlight on his body shone brightly, illuminating the entire room.

Even the air in the room trembled slightly!

The aura of a peak third-circle warlock was slowly being released.

...

As long as the West Coast was united, he would take this credit and add it to his previous achievements to exchange for materials to break through to celestial.

Of course, this required time.

That was why he had to get rid of Eli. He had inadvertently blocked his way, not for the sake of grudges, but for his future!

How could there be so much hatred? it was just for benefits!

Sergei was lost in thought when someone knocked on the door.

“Come in!” Sergei said after a moment of hesitation.

The door opened, and an old wizard walked in.

When Rodin walked in and saw the scene, his heart skipped a beat. ‘Why was his Excellency angry? it seemed like something big had happened.’

“Rodin, what’s the matter?” Looking at the person who came in, Sergei sat down again.

“Sir, the people from the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce are here. They wish to see you!”

Sergei was speechless.

“Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce? ”

Sergei frowned. What was the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce doing here?

Selling supplies?

“Did they say what their purpose was?” Sergei raised his head.

“Uh, it’s about Noah. They hope that you can ask Noah to withdraw from the bloodlines tower!” Rodin said as he took a deep breath.

Sergei was still breathing at full force. Rodin found it hard to breathe. Although they were both at the late stage of three-ring, he could feel that the gap between them was like the distance between heaven and earth!

Sergei was a top-tier third-circle warlock!

“What?”

Hearing Noah’s words, Sergei was stunned.

Did this have anything to do with them?
