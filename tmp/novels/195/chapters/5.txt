Chapter 6: The Knight

Translator: Lonelytree

The next day, facing the morning sun, Eli headed to the library.

On the way, Eli felt the difference after becoming a Level-1 apprentice.

The breakthrough of his mental powers changed the world in Eli’s mind all of a sudden. Everything around him became clear and visible, and his brain’s speed of operation also increased.

As long as he was within a certain range, he could clearly sense all the movements.

There were hurried passers-by with anxious expressions, smiling young ladies, and some people who deliberately leaned into the crowd, their eyes darting around. They didn’t seem to be good people.

It was clear that this was the perception of a wizard. A mage’s perception, memory, and many other aspects completely outclassed a Knight’s.

In fact, even an advanced Knight might not be able to match up to his current perception.

Just as Eli was walking and feeling the changes, he suddenly felt an abundant, powerful life force appear behind him like a ferocious beast.

With the clattering of hooves, Eli turned his head.

A few meters away, a strong man was riding a strong horse in the middle of the road.

The brawny man was very tall and well-built, and his ordinary casual clothes were stretched out by his muscles. A huge sword hung on one side of the horse, shining with a sharp cold light.

Needless to say, he was definitely a Knight.

Whether it was the sword in his hand or the Knight servants following him on both sides, all of these indicated his special identity.

And from the Knight badge on his chest, he was an intermediate Knight.

Knights were divided into low-level Knights, intermediate Knights, high-level Knights, Grand Knights, and Sky Knights.

A low-level Knight was able to use his vitality to increase his strength, which was beyond the limits of a human. An intermediate Knight was even more powerful, with more vitality, and more lasting strength. A high-level Knight was able to completely stack his strength and even control every muscle in his body. Dozens of people would not be able to get close to him.

As for Grand Knight and Sky Knight, Eli didn’t know much about them.

Furthermore, as the backbone of this world, Knights generally enjoyed very good treatment in the Empire. Most of them were nobles or came from great bloodlines, and their status was high.

However, according to the book, as long as one was well prepared, a Level-1 apprentice could even kill a high-level Knight. As such, Saleen Metatrin’s notes were filled with disdain for Knights.

However, despite his disdain, this Empire was still controlled by Knights.

Knights were the mainstream, and Saleen Metatrin’s Magus system seemed to have popped out of nowhere.

Opposite this Knight was another Knight.

A golden-haired Knight with eyes as sharp as an Eagle’s was staring at the brawny man in front of him.

“Elvis, are you looking for trouble with me?” The brawny Knight cast a glance at the golden-haired Knight and said.

“You are the one who is in my way,” The Knight named Elvis didn’t back down either. The badge with two swords on his chest showed that he was also an intermediate Knight.

“Then let’s have a duel.” The brawny man looked at Elvis and said directly.

Duel!

The solution to problems between Knights.

And from the crowd’s discussion, Eli also understood what had happened.

It turned out that the knight named Elvis had bumped into the other knight’s path, which led to this conflict.

It sounded ridiculous.

However, Eli, who had been here for more than two months, felt that it was normal.

That was how the world worked. Even a bottle of honey could be the reason for a fight between two knights.

Even two earls could start a war for various reasons, such as the ownership of a farmer or a good warhorse.

Within the Empire, there were constant battles.

In a war, Knights were the main combat force. They were extremely brave. In front of them, ordinary people, unless they were wearing heavy armor, would die in one blow.

Even if the war failed and the Knights were captured, they would not be killed. Instead, they would be held captive, and their families or Lords would pay a large amount of money to redeem them.

This was a world where only ordinary people suffered.

“Good!” In the face of the Knight’s provocation, Elvis nodded his head.

Then, under the gazes of the commoners, the two knights swaggered away.

Along the way, no one dared to block the way. Everyone dodged.

The two knights were both riding on horses, and they seemed to take everything for granted. They looked at the civilians around them without any fluctuations in their eyes. Only when they looked at each other occasionally did their eyes sparkle like sparks.

Dozens of meters away, Eli saw this scene. The Knights were walking towards him, so he quickly stepped aside as well, not wanting to cause any trouble.

“What a bad world!” After the two knights left, Elie stood there and said softly.

From the gazes of the two knights who passed by just now, Eli saw a sense of superiority, just like how ordinary humans looked at their pets.

They would appreciate you, communicate with you normally, and even protect you from danger, but deep down, they would still despise you. It was not discrimination. Discrimination was looking down on you, and this was complete indifference.

This was a Knight.

In the eyes of the Knights, the status of ordinary people was even worse than what Eli had imagined.

At this moment, a few meters away from Eli, a child looked at him, who was standing on the spot and revealed an excited expression. He looked around, then rubbed his hands and came over.

He reached for the money bag beside Eli with one hand while observing his actions.

‘Very good, his eyes are staring straight ahead as if he is not on guard at all.’ Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The child suppressed the joy in his heart. ‘My first job of the day!’

However, just as he was about to touch the money bag, a hand grabbed his wrist.

The child looked at Eli, who had turned his head around, and revealed an incredulous expression. He looked at the money bag, then at Eli, as if he had seen a ghost.

‘Do you have eyes on the back of your head?

‘I haven’t even touched it yet. How the hell did you find out?

‘This doesn’t make sense!’

On the other hand, Eli glanced at the boy in front of him. He was dressed in tattered linen clothes and was very thin. He shook his head, then let go of his hand and left.

There were many such children in this world, and most of them belonged to gangs. They were used as money-making tools by gangs. It was very pitiful, and there was no need for Eli to make things difficult for them.

The main thing was that it was indeed troublesome. Even if he handed him over to the sheriff, the sheriff would let him go. After all, he was just a child, and it was difficult to give an effective punishment.

The child who was released also looked grateful. Then, he ran into the crowd and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“This world!” Eli touched his empty pocket and sighed.

He had sensed the child’s bad intentions with his extraordinary wizard senses, but even if he didn’t do anything, the result would still be the same.

He had no money at all. Since he had no money, how could he be stolen from?

“Damn it. I’m going to be late.”

As if he had suddenly realized something, he immediately ran towards the library.
