200 Third-Circle Warlock Vivika

“Herman?”

On the other side, in a room of a building.

The room was very spacious, and the decorations were extremely gorgeous. Whether it was the crystal lamp on the roof or the decorations around, they all showed the noble identity of the owner.

A woman leaned back in a high-back chair, holding a document in her hand.

The woman was very beautiful. She had long blue hair, regular facial features, big eyes, and skin as white and delicate as milk, which made people want to touch her.

Although she was wearing a warlock’s robe, it could not hide her good figure, which was elegant and moving.

The most different thing about her was that her eyes were a rare green color. They were clear and bright, like a pool of clear spring water, exuding a light and spiritual aura that belonged to the wind element.

However, this beauty was frowning as she looked at the news. Compared to black Isotta, they had more information channels in the South of the West Coast, so they knew what had happened yesterday.

In fact, it didn’t affect her much. After all, she had just advanced and should be thinking about how to stabilize the bloodline tower instead of the small forces in the South. However, when she looked at the message, she saw a name.

“Herman!”

Vivika frowned. The last time she heard of this name was almost 400 years ago.

At that time, she was still in that backward Kingdom. She was still a little girl learning from her teacher. Later, she left due to an accident. But now, she was the Deputy tower master of the bloodline tower, one of the major forces in the central part of the West Coast, and she was also a third circle warlock.

If she remembered correctly, her teacher used to have a friend named Herman.

“But it’s probably just a coincidence.” Vivika’s beautiful eyebrows relaxed and she shook her head.

The same name didn’t mean anything. She was just too sensitive.

“I don’t know what happened to teacher when he disappeared that day, but he should be dead. Otherwise, he would have replied to me.” Vivika shook her head.

It was her teacher who had brought her away from that filthy noble family. Otherwise, none of this would have happened. Moreover, she had spent almost her entire life with her teacher, so she trusted her teacher the most.

Unfortunately, he was gone.

“Teacher, I missed you so much.” Vivika’s eyes were a little red, and tears flowed down from the corners of her eyes.

“Vivika, you miss your teacher again?”

In the empty room, another person had walked in.

This woman was different from Vivika. She looked much older and her face was full of wrinkles, but she looked very kind, like an old grandmother.

“Tower master, you’ve come!” Said Vivika as she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes.

“sigh, I don’t know what kind of person your teacher is, to be able to make you unable to forget him. An old woman like me can’t do that.” Said Natasha with a smile.

Vivika had joined the bloodline tower more than 300 years ago and had been following her for a long time. Vivika was usually very tough, only acting like this when she thought of her former teacher.

“Teacher, he is the one who pulled me out of the darkness,” Vivika replied.

“I know,” Natasha gently touched Vivika’s head and said, ” now is not the time to think about this. While I still have some time, we have to think of a way to get rid of black Isotta. Otherwise, it will be troublesome when I die.”

“Yes.” Vivika nodded and looked at Natasha worriedly. “Tower master, are you really...”

“yes, I’m seriously injured and don’t have much time left. At most, I’ll have a few decades. Fortunately, you’ve advanced, but Kloss is about to reach the middle stage. Normally, I could naturally deal with him. But now that I’m so seriously injured, it would be terrible if I die.” Natasha shook her head.

Vivika understood Natasha’s meaning and nodded. Her eyes became determined.

There was no time to be sad.

Harman’s name still left a trace of doubt in her heart. She wanted to meet this person, but not now. She could only wait for the future, although she would probably be disappointed.

“Let’s go,” Natasha said.

“Alright!”

..

The impact of the White Tower’s victory over the black isotta Alliance was much smaller than what Eli had thought, only because another matter had exploded.

“Vivika has advanced to the third ring. The bloodline tower and black Isotta have declared war.”

In the White Tower Council, Eli was surprised to hear Kratos ‘news.

After checking the mark, it seemed that Vivika’s aura had really become a three-circle warlock. This was indeed beyond his expectations. His student had actually taken the lead in this round. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“That’s true. This way, we’ll have an easy time. Black Isotta won’t have time to care about us.” Kratos nodded and replied.

This was the first meeting after the White Tower’s victory, and all the higher-ups were present.

At this time, all 13 people had arrived. Other than Rolant, there were two unlucky guys who had died on the battlefield.

“Indeed,” Eli nodded too.

The two forces were both truly powerful, and the war would definitely be a long one. It could not be resolved in five or ten years, so the White Tower could indeed obtain some time of peace.

“Today, we’re discussing how to deal with the follow-up work. Herman, do you have any ideas? ” Kratos asked directly.

At this moment, more than a dozen people, including Rawls and Ross, looked at Eli, waiting for him to guide them on the next step of the work. After this incident, they completely understood who No. 1 of the White Tower was.

“the next task is very simple. Naturally, it is to take over the remaining assets of the five Forces. This has to be done quickly, especially at the Lilith Warlock Academy. I need materials from there.” Eli said directly.

“Yes.” Kratos nodded.

“Well, I don’t have anything else to say. That’s all.” Eli shook his head. Advancing to his third circle was his top priority at the moment, and he didn’t intend to care about anything else.

Originally, he had planned to merge the house of the undead with the White Tower, but he felt that it wasn’t appropriate. On one hand, the house of the undead wasn’t a human force, and on the other hand, if the south presented a unified front, it would be too ostentatious.

It would be better to split up. In any case, they were all his forces. That way, the black Isotta, and other forces wouldn’t care about them. If they really became a force that unified the South, he didn’t doubt that the black Isotta or the bloodline tower would interfere.

It would be much better when he advanced to the third circle. Besides, he could also meet his student, Vivika, then.

The little girl from back then had already become a third-circle expert. It was truly hard to predict.

Eli didn’t interfere, and Kratos quickly arranged everything.

After the meeting, Eli also told Kratos that he was going to leave for a while. Kratos wanted to keep him, but Eli decided to leave just in case.

The time was set to be three days later.

Because there was still one thing that had not been resolved.

Tilted tower’s third floor.
