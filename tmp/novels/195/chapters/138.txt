139 Numbers

“Heinz, are you sure that old bastard Eiffel isn’t here?”

In the shadows outside the palace, more than a dozen people looked at a man with a gloomy face in the middle and asked in a low voice.

“Yes, I used some tricks to draw him to another area. Otherwise, even though we’re four one-circle warlocks, he’s still a one-circle Ultimate Warlock. If he really went all out, there’s no guarantee that we would be able to survive this ordeal. I’m not that stupid.” Heinz grinned.

“That’s good!”

Upon hearing this, everyone else also revealed a happy smile.

“But it’s still a little against the rules for us to exterminate the Elina family.” Someone else sighed.

“Hmph, have you forgotten that day?” Heinz only glanced at the man.

“Alright, let’s kill them.” The man seemed to have recalled some unpleasant memories and changed his mind.

“Yes, we’re all in the same boat now. Don’t worry, as long as no one says anything, my family will take over the business here. Then, everyone will be safe,” Heinz said with hatred.

Ten years ago.

In the Academy, Rock had defeated them all by himself, and it was a completely crushing defeat. This was a huge humiliation for those who lost.

However, Rock was too strong. Not only did he quickly advance to the first circle, but he also seemed to be on the verge of breaking through to the second circle. They could only sigh helplessly and clench their teeth in anger.

But the funny thing was, Rock was dead. The guy was suddenly dead.

Thus, under the lead of Heinz, the group of four first circle shadow lizard bloodline warlocks and fifteen Level 3 Warlock apprentices were ready to slaughter the family.

At first, they were not very interested, but Heinz’s family had always wanted to take over Ross’ family in the name of revenge. After that, they would give one-third of the benefits to everyone. That was why they took action.

After all, more than ten years had passed, and the hatred was no longer as deep as before. However, the benefits were eternal.

“Yes, I’ve already purchased a large-scale spell formation, and four people have already set it up.”

As soon as Heinz finished speaking, the four corners of the palace started to shake. Instantly, a huge translucent film covered the palace.

“This is the Four Seasons elemental spell formation. As long as the time isn’t up, even a second-circle Mage won’t be able to break through it. Furthermore, the outside world won’t be able to hear the sounds and images inside. This is the time for us to kill.” Heinz grinned and walked in first.

The others also smiled and strode in.

On one side was the Elina family, which had no first-circle warlocks but only a group of apprentices. On the other side was Heinz’s side, which had four official warlocks and more than ten third-circle apprentices.

Everyone was already imagining what would happen next.

The Elina family was a mage family. There were many good things in this place, and they could make a fortune from it.

…

“I can’t get out!”

Eli looked at the translucent spell formation in front of him and frowned.

This group of people from the outside world had moved too quickly. They must have planned this in advance and had instantly sealed off this place.

The spell formation in front of him was so strong that even a second circle mage would have a hard time breaking it unless he used a long-term violent attack to break it. That would be slow, and it would definitely attract the attention of the group of people.

“Hey, what the hell is this?!” Eli shook his head. He had avoided the crisis at the camp but not the sudden attack here.

But fortunately, this batch of outsiders did not seem to be too strong. Eli could dispatch them if he put in some effort.

“Yes, I need to set it up quickly.” Eli thought for a moment, then quickly returned to the area where Ross was.

Unfortunately, this spell formation could not be broken, or else Eli would have run away and avoided all these troubles. As for the lives of Ross and the others, it had nothing to do with him.

No one would really think that he had a close relationship with Rock, who he had only met once.

He soon arrived at the castle.

At this moment, Heinz and the others were scattered in all directions and were fighting all the way to the center. The two apprentices in the castle were also shocked and wanted to run away. They had no intention of protecting Ross.

So, when Eli arrived at the castle, only Ross was left.

“Grandpa Herman!” When he saw Eli return, Ross immediately ran over and hugged his leg. “the apprentice protecting me said that there was an intruder and told me to stay here. Grandpa, what kind of intruder is this? How are my mother and the others? ” Ross asked.

Eli could not bear to answer. From what he could sense, nearly twenty warlocks were killing non-stop, and almost all the members of the Elena family were being attacked.

Eli could go and save them, but if he did, he wouldn’t be able to set things up properly. Besides, even if he did, he couldn’t save all of them.

So, after some thought, he gave up.

“Ross, don’t worry. It’ll be fine.” Eli said vaguely.

“Yes.” Ross ran back to the castle as if he had understood something, tears flowing down his face.

Eli shook his head and continued to set up. A Mage who was well-prepared would have combat power that far exceeded his own strength. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At the same time.

Heinz pulled a woman out of the bedroom.

“You must be Rock’s mother,” Heinz said in a brutal tone as the ferocity of his bloodline was activated.

“Please, I beg you, let go…” the Queen was in her pajamas and was being dragged on the ground.

“Ha!” Heinz laughed and killed her.

This time, he had originally intended to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots.

He took a look at this place and then continued to retreat into the palace.

The killing continued.

On this day.

The Elena family would disappear.

…

An hour later.

Everyone met again.

Heinz smiled as he looked at everyone’s bloodshot eyes.

By now, almost everyone had died, and only a few people were still scattered around the castle.

“Heinz, Rock’s son is still in the castle.” A man said fiercely. The shadow lizards were originally brutal creatures, and they became even more so after seeing blood.

“Oh, really? That would be great.” Heinz smiled.

Tonight’s slaughter went smoothly. Although there was a little accident and a few of their people died, it was insignificant.

Soon, they arrived outside the castle.

However, when they arrived, everyone was stunned by the scene before them.

More than ten spell formations surrounded the castle, and a man was in the middle. He was wearing a wizard’s robe and holding a staff, looking at them.

“What is this?” Heinz looked at the spell formations and frowned. They were set up recently.

“Who are you?” Heinz asked.

“If you leave now, I can pretend nothing happened.” Eli looked at the fourteen people in front of him with a serious expression.

Four first-circle warlocks and ten Level 3 apprentices. This kind of combat power was not weak.

“Leave? Haha.” Hearing this, Heinz laughed out loud.

“Do you really think an acolyte like you can hold out for long, do you? Moreover, we have a dozen people here, while there is only one of you. We have the advantage in strength and numbers.”

“As expected, we have to fight?” He had always thought of the worst possible situation. If he had his choice, he would avoid all conflict. But people rarely wanted to go for peace.

Although he was a half-baked Necromancer, it was stupid to compare numbers with Eli…

“Open the spell formation now and hand over Ross, and I’ll let you go.” Heinz tried to solve the problem in a simpler way.

“If you had left quietly, I wouldn’t have to do this,” Eli said, shaking his head. “One more thing. You don’t really have the advantage in numbers.”

Heinz was speechless.

“This Warlock must be scared out of his wits.” Some of the apprentices looked at him as if he was an idiot. They were sure that they would win, which was why they were so relaxed.

But the next second, everyone was speechless.

As soon as Eli finished speaking, shadows suddenly appeared around them. Everyone was stunned as they saw skeletons walking out from the shadows.

Just three seconds.

The dozen or so people looked at the two to three hundred skeletons around them and fell silent.

Why did the situation seem a little off?

What made them feel even more troubled was that there were ten one-circle skeletons.

It was a huge problem for them.

“He isn’t a Warlock apprentice at all. He’s a first-circle Necromancer!” Suddenly, someone shouted.

Heinz finally understood who their opponent was.

It was big news that there was a Necromancer hidden in the Elena family.

But before that, they had to deal with the threat before them first.

“Don’t be afraid, everyone. We can deal with this. Besides, the Necromancer’s combat power mainly relies on their undead. They are weak in other aspects. As long as we deal with the undead, we can easily deal with him!” Heinz encouraged.

At the same time, the undead skeletons also attacked the warlocks.

The battle began.

Looking at the people fighting, Eli took out a small bench and then watched the battle.

Controlling so many spirits at the same time was already his limit, and he had no other means.

Three hours later.

As the last skeleton fell …

Heinz smiled, but his mouth twitched as he looked at the one-circle and three zero-circle warlocks around him. That was all that was left of his group. He had underestimated the Necromancer.

However, since all the skeletons were dead, it was their turn now.

Heinz turned his head and looked at Eli, gritting his teeth.

“You deserve to die. I’ll pull off your head in a moment.”
