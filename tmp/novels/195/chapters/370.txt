371 The Amina Family

“Have you heard? Yesterday’s banquet was attended by the Charm Mansion, the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, the City Lord of Holmes City, and even the Holy Tower in the distance.”

In a tavern in Bloodline City, a Warlock stood on a chair with one leg and a bottle of wine in his other hand. He was surrounded by Warlocks.

“It’s fake, right? Those major powers have almost no connection with the Bloodline Tower.” A Warlock who had just arrived had a look of disbelief on his face.

“Haha.” The Warlock holding the bottle of wine glanced at him and said, “Too innocent!

” These forces weren’t there for the Bloodline Tower. They’re related to the master of this banquet, a powerful Warlock from the West Coast Tower, Eli.

” You don’t know how powerful Sir Eli is. On that day, when the city was besieged, the battle within hundreds of miles turned into daytime … ”

The Warlock seemed to be drunk and was making a lot of noise. The Warlock who had asked the question just now left quietly.

After leaving the tavern, his expression became serious.

He was a warlock from the Manticore family. He had been sent here to sneak in and take a look at the situation, but he hadn’t expected things to unfold like this.

The Warlock frowned as if he could already foresee Lord Jerre’s rage.

“I need to report back quickly.” The Warlock shook his head and walked out of the city.

Just as he reached the city gate, he saw a Warlock in a white Warlock robe walking arrogantly into the city, followed by several Warlocks.

“The Amina Family!” The Warlock blinked and immediately retreated to the sides.

It seemed like he would need more time.

There was going to be a good show.

…..

At this moment, in a room in the Bloodline Tower.

The five of them were chatting around a table.

“Our Charm Mansion will also establish a large branch in this city. We might need some space. What do you think, sir?” Lobelia looked at Eli and asked.

“Of course, you can.” Eli nodded.

The Charm Mansion could boost the economy of a city, so how could he reject it?

Anyway, that was what he thought.

“Our Golden Cicada Merchant Association is the same. When the time comes, we will send someone over.” Conilla sat on the sofa and looked around.

At this moment, other than him and Lobelia, the people from Holy Tower and Holmes City were all there.

” Since everyone is done chatting, let’s end it. If there’s anything else, go find Glen. He will help you deal with it. ” Eli said to them.

Actually, everyone talked about most of the things at the banquet yesterday. Today, they were just there to confirm.

“Then, Tower Master Eli, I’ll take my leave.” Lobelia’s eyes were like silk as she stood up.

“The Golden Cicada Merchant Association also has many matters to attend to. In that case, I shall take my leave.” Conilla also stood up.

“Me too.” The warlocks of the Holy Tower also stood up.

“Thank you, sir, for forgiving my rashness back then.” Amanta stood up and bowed deeply.

Ever since he had heard about Eli’s story, he had realized that he had survived because of Eli’s kindness.

Therefore, he quickly brought a large number of resources to apologize, and Eli did not seem to care and forgive him directly.

” Thank you for your visit, everyone. I thank you. ” Eli also stood up and thanked him.

Although these people came for different reasons, since they were here, they were friends.

He liked to make friends.

As for people like Amanta, he had paid such a huge price and didn’t cause him any trouble since then, so he chose to forgive him.

At least, he would not have any effect on Eli. Moreover, Holmes City was very far away from the bloodline tower, so it might be difficult to see him in the future.

In short, this guy was too weak.

“Alright, then we’ll leave, Tower Master Eli!” Everyone nodded and prepared to leave.

“I want to see who it is that doesn’t have time to see me!” At this moment, a domineering voice suddenly came from outside the door.

Everyone narrowed their eyes.

Then, everyone heard a bang, and the door opened. A man in a white robe appeared in front of everyone.

The man had a long face, long and thin eyes, and a hooked nose. He looked very arrogant, and the aura he emitted was at the level of stars. He was the one who had kicked open the door just now, and there was someone beside him who was stopping him. It was Glen.

Glen looked embarrassed. He let go of his hand and said to Eli, “I’m sorry, my lord. I couldn’t hold him back!”

“It’s fine!” Eli shook his head and looked at the man in front of him. He asked, “May I know who this friend in front of me is? I don’t think I know you.”

Eli’s voice became colder and colder, and the aura he emitted became stronger and stronger.

At this moment, not only was Eli looking at this Warlock, but the other four were also looking at him. Lobelia and Conilla were emitting powerful Radiant Moon auras, and the other two were also emitting the auras of Nebula Warlocks. For a moment, even the air in the room was shaking.

Gulp!

The white-robed Warlock’s throat moved slightly, and cold sweat gradually appeared on his forehead.

The Golden Cicada Merchant Association, the Charm Mansion, the Holy Tower, and someone he didn’t know. Why would these forces appear here?

The white-robed Warlock was called Simon, and he came from the Amina Family, a higher-level faction of the Bloodline Tower. Their goal this time was to obtain the Grassi Land of the Bloodline Family.

After all, even if the Bloodline Tower won, they were still the Amina Family’s subordinate faction. If they made a request, they would obediently comply. They only needed the Grassi Land and Bloodline City.

So he told Glen this, but Glen directly refused and told him that he was no longer in charge of the Bloodline Tower. The one in charge was Eli.

Naturally, he asked Eli to meet him, but Glen told him that Eli was meeting important guests.

...

However, what guest could be more important than the Amina family? He was so angry that he came over.

Then, he saw this scene.

Simon looked at the forces that these people belonged to. They were far more powerful than the Amani Family.

He was a little stunned. He didn’t know what to do.

Glen hurried to Eli’s side and told him what had happened. Eli suddenly realized that this man was technically his boss.

He first looked at his guests and said, ” I’m sorry to have startled you. This is a warlock from the Amina family. It seems that we have a conflict. You can leave first. I’ll handle it myself. ”

“I believe you can handle it.” Lobelia covered her mouth and laughed before leaving.

“Yes, if you need help, you can ask us for help at any time,” Conilla said directly.

He knew a little about Herman and Jin Ji’s story, so he naturally stood on Eli’s side.

“Then we will take our leave.” The Holy Tower Warlock and Amanta nodded.

With that, the four of them left the room, leaving Glen, Eli, and Simon behind.

...

Eli leaned back on the sofa and looked up at the Warlock. “Hello, I’m the Eli you wanted to see. What’s the matter?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Simon’s stiff expression changed, revealing an expression that was uglier than crying. He said in a low voice, “I’m here to discuss something with you on behalf of the Amina family.”

“Oh?” Eli smiled faintly.

Simon was sweating profusely. He lowered his voice and said, “It’s About the Grassi Land. ”

“Simon!”

He suddenly heard Eli calling him. He looked up and saw Eli coming to his side and patting him on the shoulder.

” Actually, I like you more when you’re unruly. See you in the meeting room. ”

Eli left.

Simon slowly turned his head. He had sensed great danger from the few pats on his shoulder.

It was as if Eli could easily kill him!

Just what kind of strength did this Eli have?

He seemed to suddenly understand why the manticore had told them they had given up.

Simon felt like he was acting a little hasty.
