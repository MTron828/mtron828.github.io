537 The Arrival of Miya

“Miya!”

Eli looked at the girl with short silver hair. It was Udo’s daughter, Miya.

Beside her, Vivika followed.

“Sir, long time no see.” Miya lowered her head to show her respect.

In the past year, Eli’s fame had spread far and wide, even more so than the Lich King’s. He was now a legendary figure in the Warlock World.

The story of him defeating five divine trees of the same level with one blow was still circulating.

Of course, the embarrassment of the Warlock Alliance was also related to the man in front of him. Moreover, Eli had saved her life, and it was suspected that he had a long-term relationship with her father.

Therefore, her respect came from the bottom of her heart.

“It has indeed been a long time. Why did you come back? Is there something important?” asked Eli.

“Yes.” Miya nodded and continued,” I have a very important message. I was worried about letting my subordinates send it back, so I decided to come back personally.”

“Oh?”

Eli also became serious.

Miya hadn’t come back with most of the information regarding the Warlock Alliance. She hadn’t even come back personally when the Warlock Alliance attacked her. This meant that this information was much more precious.

It seemed like something big had happened.

“Let’s go. Let’s talk in the room. Follow me.” Eli nodded and turned to walk into the wizard tower.

Miya followed him, and so did Vivika.

Soon, the three of them arrived at a room. Ely sat down while Miya remained standing.

“Sir…” After everything was ready, Miya glanced at Vivica.

“If you have nothing to say, say it. Vivika is not an outsider!” As if seeing through her worries, Eli said.

“Alright!” Miya nodded.

Vivika, who was standing beside him, smiled. She was very curious. Miya didn’t tell her what had happened, and what she had said had piqued her curiosity.

Sensing their gazes, Miya cleared her throat and said, “Sir, it’s about the Gray Mage Tower!”

“Oh?”

Eli narrowed his eyes, and Vivika widened her eyes in surprise. “Is it the legendary Mage Tower?”

Miya glanced at her and nodded. “Yes, that Mage Tower!”

Hearing this, Vivika’s eyes widened. She wanted to ask more, but Eli stopped her. He shook his head and said to Miya, “Let her finish first.”

Vivika wasn’t annoyed at being interrupted. She stared at Miya curiously.

Miya continued to look at Eli and said, “My lord, you knew about the Warlock Alliance’s expedition in the Western Region more than a hundred years ago. This time, it was because of this that they finally found the location of the Gray Mage Tower in that document three days ago.”

Found it?

Eli’s eyes widened as if he had not expected this.

After so many years, he had almost forgotten about this matter. He did not expect the Warlock Alliance to actually find something. This was going to be troublesome!

“What’s the current situation?” asked Eli.

“Sir, almost all the high-end combat forces of the Warlock Alliance have been secretly gathered. They are ready to enter the area where the Gray Mage Tower is located and can set off at any time,” said Miya.

“So decisive?” Eli was surprised.

“Sir, the Warlock Alliance is in a really bad situation right now. They have lost so many high-end combat forces, and they still have to face the pressure of the Lich Tower and Sir. If they don’t do something, they will really be gone in a few decades.

“Thus, when this news spread, almost the entire Alliance was excited. This was their only chance, so they decided to give it their all.

“If they successfully obtained the Tower, then their crisis would naturally be resolved, and it might even change the current situation. After all, the legendary Tower had the power to rule the world.” Miya said quickly, her face showing a trace of worry.

Vivika was also stunned as she received the news that was enough to shock the world.

Eli was deep in thought!

What should he do? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Should he stop it? Of course, they couldn’t get the Tower.

However, how should he stop them? Should he stop them outside the entrance, control them, snatch them, or follow them? Anyway, he had the key…

Miya didn’t dare to disturb him as she watched him fall into deep thought. She quietly took out a communication device as if she was checking it. However, in the next second, she seemed to have seen something, and her body froze.

Gulp!

Her throat moved slightly, and cold sweat even appeared on her forehead.

“My lord, my lord.” Her voice was almost trembling.

“What’s wrong?”

Miya raised her head, pursed her lips, and said with a trembling voice, “Sir, just now, my men discovered that the Warlock Alliance’s higher-ups have disappeared for three hours!

“It was very likely that they had already left the Warlock Alliance’s territory.”

She was flustered because she knew what this meant!

The look in Eli’s eyes also changed.

Alright, there was no other choice. It seemed that there was only one last option.

He immediately stood up and said solemnly, “In that case, we can only stop them. Gray Mage Tower must not fall into their hands!”

“Sir, we don’t know where!” Miya reminded meekly.

“I know!”

“Then how do we find their location?” Miya was puzzled.

“I mean, I know the location of the Mage Tower!”

“What is it? Sir, you, you, you…You know about it?” Miya almost jumped up.

“Yes!” Eli didn’t explain. He looked at the two and said, “There’s no time to lose. Let’s set off quickly.”

After saying that, the two of them felt their vision darken.

When they regained their vision, they found that they were already high in the sky, being carried by Eli at an extremely fast speed.

Apart from the three of them, there was also a dog, Dylan.

At this moment, Dylan was also dumbfounded.

He had been resting when he was suddenly pulled up by Eli. Before he could react, he realized that he was in the sky. He looked at the two people around him, and the doubt in his heart reached its peak.

“Eli, where are we going?” he asked loudly.

“Go find Gray Mage Tower. It’ll be up to you after we enter.” Eli glanced at him and replied.

Hearing the answer, Dylan was dumbfounded. Then, his eyes gradually lit up.

“No problem. I know every inch of that place!” Dylan chuckled, understanding that Eli had finally decided to explore the mage tower.

Miya was speechless.

Vivika was speechless.

The two of them heard the conversation between the man and the dog as if they knew everything. They were a little confused.

Why did it seem like Eli knew everything?

Eli’s speed was very fast. In just ten minutes, he had almost crossed the western region and finally entered the western region’s Suo Ya Mountain Range. This was the entrance to the mage tower.

At this point, he suddenly slowed down. A shadow enveloped the few of them and then passed through the shadows. During this period, a few of them did not make a sound.

A few minutes later.

The shadow dispersed, and they appeared in a forest.

Seeing the light, Miya was about to speak, but her mouth was covered.

She blinked and saw Eli pointing at the sky with his other finger.

She looked up and was stunned.

In the sky, there was a space-time gap that had appeared at some point in time. Outside the gap, there were nearly twenty Warlocks gathered. She even saw many familiar faces. They were the higher-ups of the Warlock Alliance.

At this moment, a dozen Warlocks were struggling to maintain the dimensional rift in the sky. They were surrounded by precious resources and an altar made of millions of magic crystals to help maintain it. The rest of the people entered one by one, and the Warlocks who maintained the rift also entered one by one until the dimensional rift closed.

Even after the rift closed, Eli and the others did not show up.

Seeing them enter, Miya didn’t care about the shock of her master knowing the location of the tower. She said anxiously, “Sir, the crack is closed. How do we enter?”

It wasn’t strange that she was anxious. After all, she had seen how difficult it was to open the secret rift in the sky. Miya felt that they couldn’t do it with just a few of them. Moreover, they didn’t have that many resources.

If he went back to gather his men, it would take up a lot of time.

Eli reached into the ring and took out a silver key. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry, we have the key!”

Looking at the key shining under the sun!

Miya was stunned on the spot!

Why was the situation a little off?
