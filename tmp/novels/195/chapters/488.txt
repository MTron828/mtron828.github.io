489 Desperate Nero

Western Region!

In a prison in the east, faint light shone through the windows. The dripping sound of water made the dozens of heads imprisoned here feel annoyed.

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

“Everyone, don’t worry. The final victor will definitely be the Heart of the Abyss. At that time, we will be safe.” In a cell, a skinny old man spoke.

A small voice swept across the cell, causing everyone to raise their heads.

A glimmer of hope flashed in everyone’s eyes.

“Patriarch of the Dallas family, you’re right. As long as we persist, victory will be ours.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Patience. We just need to wait patiently.”

“The Heart of Abyss is a great force. It won’t collapse so easily.”

One by one, the powerful Patriarchs began to encourage themselves. After all, this was the only thing they could do. After all, they couldn’t expect the Bloodline Tower to let them go. Their hope was the Heart of Abyss’ victory.

Crackle! Crackle!

Suddenly, the door of the prison cell in the distance opened.

A Warlock walked in from the light of the door.

He looked at everyone and slowly said, “Let me tell you a piece of good news. In Rolle City, Sir Ely defeated six half-step fifth circle warlocks from the Heart of the Abyss by himself and destroyed Rolle City.”

The Warlock seemed to have specially come in to say something, then turned around and left.

The door closed once again, and it was also the door that everyone hoped for.

“Rolle City has fallen? Eli has defeated six half-step fifth circle warlocks!” This was the skinny old man. At this moment, he collapsed on the ground like a hopeless person.

The others were also shocked at first, but then their eyes dimmed.

There was no point in lying to them. This could only mean that what the Warlock said was true.

Rolle City had really fallen. Eli had defeated six half-step fifth circle warlocks.

Was Eli actually this strong?

After a few dozen seconds, the old man looked at the crowd and said, “Everyone, since Eli is so powerful, I’m afraid we really won’t be able to escape this time. I plan to surrender. At least I can save my life.”

Silence, a long silence.

“Sigh, let’s do this. From now on, the Sala family will never be the same.”

“It’s over!”

A dejected voice echoed throughout the cell. Everyone chose to lower their proud heads!

..

“Just like that…Is it over?”

Nero closed his eyes and looked at the information in front of him.

This time, he did not roar hysterically. He just sat on the high-back chair, calm and silent.

“Even I wouldn’t dare to say that I could defeat six people working together. So this guy, Eli, has hidden himself so deeply? He usually hid himself better than anyone else, but when he truly erupted, his aura swept through the entire forest.” He muttered in a low voice.

“Could it be that the Heart of the Abyss is going to end in my hands?”

At this moment, Nero only felt deep despair.

Even if he could defeat Eli, the story was already like this!

After this battle, the Heart of the Abyss would be severely injured, and it would no longer be able to maintain its position as the number one force in the Western Region. Eli’s fame would completely crush him, and the Bloodline Tower would also be promoted to a new first-class force!

“Eli is indeed very strong, but it doesn’t mean that we have no hope… Nero, we can sacrifice the entire City of Dawn. We can temporarily create enough half-step fifth circle warlocks. Although their lifespans will be very short, they will still be able to fight. When the time comes, we can directly take down that guy. With the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Warlocks and our previous accumulation, we should be able to barely open the seal. This is a rare opportunity.” At this moment, the voice in his mind sounded again.

“Sacrifice the entire City of Dawn?

“No, I’m working with you for the future of the Heart of the Abyss. If the City of Dawn is gone, the Heart of the Abyss will become the target of everyone and will be attacked by all forces. I can’t agree to your request.” Hearing the suggestion in his mind, he shook his head.

“What else can you do? Either you die with the Heart of Abyss, or you run away and give up. Which one do you choose? Hahahaha.

“Moreover, do you think you can make a comeback? You will only become the trash of the entire World, and there will be no place for you in the entire world.” Nero’s expression turned ugly when he heard the seductive voice.

Silence, a long silence.

Sigh!

Nero sighed deeply, but his eyes gradually turned cold.

Yes, he had no other choice.

The human Nero had already knelt on the ground in the Abyss and begged for his life. After agreeing to the demon’s enslavement, he died!

A few seconds later, he walked out of the door and looked at the guard beside him.

“Summon all Warlocks of the level of the Radiant Sun to the bottom of the Mage Tower. I want to see them. Also, inform the Warlock Union that we can’t hold on any longer. If they don’t want to see the Western Region’s Bloodline Tower become the only power in the future, then they better do something!”

With that, he returned to his room.

The former was naturally for the final battle, while the latter was to stall for time.

..

In the grassi land.

Eli stretched his body and looked at the mark on his right hand. Two of the four marks had been filled, and the third was slowly being filled.

The impact of the victory was much greater than Eli had imagined.

Now, it wasn’t just the Western Regions that were afraid. Most of the factions in the Central Region knew about this matter. Perhaps the news had even spread to other regions.

“Now that I have some faith reserves, I’ll be much more at ease.” Eli heaved a sigh of relief.

Ever since most of the power of faith was used to maintain the erosion of the black fog, he did not have any excess. However, this wave had allowed him to replenish some.

“And with so much faith power, I might be able to create another clone!” Eli pursed his lips. He needed at least two Imprints of Faith to display a clone, and that was the reason why he had yet to break through.

If he reached half-step fifth circle, he wondered if he would be able to create a powerful clone.

“But forget about this. I might have to personally appear in this war.” Eli pursed his lips. He was really worried about Nero, so he planned to descend personally.

In any case, his clone would go first. When the time came, he could leave if the situation was not right!

He was completely unflustered!

“Moreover…” Eli turned to look at the laboratory in the distance. At this moment, the six corpses had already been transferred here. With so many corpses, it was enough for him to extract some of Nero’s information to cast a curse.

“I hope you will like this big gift.”

Eli grinned.

He was determined to unify the Western Regions, whether it was for himself, Dylan’s possible body, or the stable environment he needed for his development.

He only wanted to develop in peace, but the Heart of Abyss was restless!

Since it was not at ease, he could only get rid of it.
