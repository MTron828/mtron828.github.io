560 Meeting Laura Again, Merman Poseidon

Deep Sea.

Mermaid Palace!

Laura sat on the shell and looked outside through the empty space in the palace.

In the blue sea, the periphery was filled with merfolk, each of them holding weapons. Not far away, there was a shark-like humanoid creature. It was the Megalodon Shark clan, eyeing the merfolk like a tiger eyeing its prey!

They were surrounded!

“We haven’t left the Imperial Dynasty yet, and they dare to invade. They’re disregarding the rules of the ocean!” Beside Laura, Eval was furious, but his anger was filled with unwillingness and despair.

Just a moment ago, the Giant Megalodon Shark clan suddenly appeared at the periphery of the mermaid clan and slaughtered their way to the core area of the mermaid clan.

In less than five minutes, they had surrounded the place.

At this moment, outside the hall, the merfolk powerhouses were guarding the palace. Inside, there were only Laura and Eval.

” There’s definitely a traitor!” Eval was furious, and his voice echoed in the empty hall.

“Eval, calm down!” At this moment, Laura spoke!

Eval stopped talking and looked at Laura.

At this moment, Laura had a calm expression on her face, but her eyes seemed to have a volcano brewing in them. Clearly, her mood was similar to his.

Eval sighed deeply and asked, “Your Majesty, what should we do?”

“Surrender!” Laura’s eyes were like a clear spring as she spoke calmly.

Surrender?

“What?” Eval widened his eyes in disbelief.

“That’s right. I originally thought that our Mermaid Race would have some status, but it seems like it’s just a mirage. The deep sea isn’t suitable for us.” Laura shook her head, but her eyes were filled with endless loneliness.

After going through so much trouble to return to the deep sea, it actually ended like this. It made people sigh.

“But…” Eval’s eyes were filled with unwillingness. He still wanted to say something!

“Do you want the entire merfolk race to die here today?” Laura looked at Eval and said calmly.

Eval was completely silent.

After a few seconds, he sighed and said, “Let’s do as Your Majesty says.”

After saying this, his eyes gradually lost their spirit, as if his spine had been extracted. The already old merman seemed to have aged by hundreds of years at this moment!

“Let’s go!”

Laura stood up and walked out of the castle. Eval followed silently.

“Oh, there’s also a statue!” After taking a few steps, Laura suddenly remembered that she hadn’t taken the statue that Eli had given her. She immediately turned around and prepared to take it back.

But when she turned around, the statue was still there.

However, there was a figure beside it, a figure that she would never forget.

“El…” Her body trembled as if she couldn’t believe it.

“Little Laura, long time no see!”

Eli looked at her and smiled.

..

Outside the palace.

Outside the palace, there were a large number of mermen captured by the Megalodon Sharks. In front of the palace, there were a few mermen supporting each other. They all looked miserable.

Not far from them was a Megalodon.

He was nearly five meters long and looked like a human, but his body was like a shark. At this moment, he opened his mouth, revealing a few rows of teeth, and looked at the people in front of him with a ferocious expression.

His name was Karsus, the king of the Megalodon Shark race, a powerful Sea race in the nascent stage of the fifth circle shark race.

“I’ll give you three minutes. If I don’t see the queen of your race, today will be the day of the extinction of the Mermaid Race!” Karsus said with a relaxed expression.

To him, the merfolk were too weak.

It was so weak that it was not worth mentioning.

He was only interested in the Mermaid Queen.

“Karsus, the Mermaid Race is under the protection of the Imperial Dynasty. You are disregarding the rules of the Sea Race. Thousands of years ago, you were just a vassal of our Mermaid Race.” An old merman looked at Karsus with a face full of anger. The other mermen also stared at him.

“Hmph, it’s been so many years. The Mage has left, and the world has changed. The strong are respected. It’s time for you mermaids to give up such a good piece of territory.” Karsus was disdainful, and the Megalodon Sharks around him laughed out loud.

“You will suffer retribution!”

“How can this be?”

The loud taunts made the merfolk furious, but at the same time, they felt helpless!

Yes, this was no longer a few thousand years ago.

Times had changed!

On the other side, Karsus was getting impatient as he looked at the palace that was still silent. He walked towards the palace and prepared to open it himself.

The merfolk were furious, but they didn’t dare to stop him.

Crack!

But suddenly, the palace in front of them slowly opened as the water rippled.

The leader, Laura, who had colorful scales, slowly swam out. On the left was Eval, and on the right was an unfamiliar merman wearing a shell and holding a trident.

The merfolk were stunned.

Who was this?

They had never seen it before!

However, Karsus, who was at the side, was unaware of this. He only stopped in his tracks and looked at Laura with narrowed eyes. He couldn’t help but drool.

“It’s so white. The meat must be very good.” Karsus looked at Laura, not hiding his ” interest ” at all.

Looking at the greedy look in Karsus ‘eyes, Laura felt a chill down her spine. However, she turned to look at the tall Murloc beside her and asked, “Uncle Poseidon, I’ll leave the rest to you!”

Seeing Laura suddenly turn her head to greet the merman beside her with such respect, the mermen nearby blinked their eyes in bewilderment.

Uncle?

Laura actually had an uncle?

Poseidon?

I’ve never heard of such a person among the mermaids!

“Oh?” Karsus narrowed his eyes.

Laura’s behavior made him feel strange, and the tall mermaid beside her also made him feel uncomfortable.

“Who are you?” He took a step back and asked cautiously.

“Hmph, you invaded my Mermaid Clan’s territory and still asked me who I am. If I hadn’t returned from my travels, you would have exterminated the Mermaid Clan. Have you asked me for my permission to do that?” The tall merman looked at him and said rudely.

As for the merman, it was naturally the person who had turned out to be an Eli. His face had undergone a simple transformation.

Karsus blinked his small eyes, but his gaze gradually turned cold.

Since he was a mermaid, he might as well kill him. Then, he would slowly savor Laura’s taste.

“Playing tricks.” With a loud shout, the water around him surged. Then, his figure surged towards Poseidon, and the laws of the ocean surged around him!

The huge figure brought along endless seawater, and the aura it emitted made all the merfolk and Megalodon sharks feel a chill.

“He is making a move!”

“Hey, who is this merman? Why did he infuriate Karsus? He’s a fifth circle Megalodon.”

They sighed in their hearts. Some of them could not bear to close their eyes, while the Megalodon Sharks revealed cruel smiles as if they could see the scene of ‘Poseidon’ being dismembered.

Weng!

The huge Megalodon was like a hammer as it flew toward Eli.

Beside Eli, Laura and Eval were a little nervous.

When they met just now, they didn’t have time to talk in detail. Ely only said that he would handle everything. But could he really defeat this fifth-circle creature?

The Megalodon Shark was getting closer and closer, and everyone’s gazes focused.

In the next second, Eli slowly raised his trident. With a hum, he swung it at the Megalodon Shark. The bottom of the sea instantly seemed to be shaking, and everyone felt unstable.

However, everyone still looked at the two of them, waiting for the result.

Under everyone’s gaze, the two attacks collided.

In the next second, all the creatures opened their mouths wide.

In the collision of the tridents, the Sea Law around the Megalodon Shark melted like snow, and his body instantly turned into countless blood veils of mist. He didn’t even have time to scream.

With just one collision, the man had easily killed the powerful shark!

He was dead!

“How is this possible?”

“Are you kidding me?”

“He died in one strike. He was a powerful fifth-circle megalodon!”

In an instant, the merfolk in the distance opened their mouths wide, their eyes as big as pearls.

Further away, the Megalodon Shark clan was stunned on the spot, as if they could not believe what was happening in front of it.

As the center of the matter, Eli only waved the trident lightly to clean off flesh and blood on it. Then, he raised his head casually and looked around. A huge aura instantly erupted.

“How you dare to have designs on the Mermaid Race?

“From today onwards, whoever dares to invade, this megalodon will be your example.

“Mermaid clan, Poseidon will protect you!”

A powerful aura swept across the bottom of the sea. Countless creatures felt as if they were being pressed down by an endless sea. They couldn’t move at all, especially the Megalodon Sharks. They felt cold all over their bodies as if a sharp sword was hanging above their heads.

However, the merfolk found that they were not affected.

However, when they saw the majestic figure in the middle, their eyes were filled with excitement! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Poseidon!”

It was unknown who shouted, but it was picked up by the rest of the merfolk.

They looked at Eli, their eyes filled with passion.

On both sides of Eli, Laura’s eyes were also filled with shock. Looking at Eli’s broad figure, the corners of her mouth finally revealed a smile as if she had been relieved of a heavy burden. She whispered,

“Thank you!”
