523 Summoning the World Will

The Phoenix King let out a cry, and a layer of formless soul fluctuation spread out like ripples. The entire sky turned gray.

Amidst the cries, the Phoenix King had also completely left the World Fragment.

Its body was like a giant eagle, thousands of meters long.

Some of the feathers were golden, and some were bright red. There were a few long tail feathers on its back. What was strange was that the flames that should have been burning on its body were gray, and it had a cold beauty!

The Phoenix King seemed to be very angry at this moment. Looking at the unfamiliar environment around it, it immediately lowered its head to look at the city on the ground and let out a long cry!

At the same time, countless gray flames gathered around him and flew toward the ground. It was like a rain of fire that covered the sky and the sun!

On the ground.

Many Warlocks were shocked by this scene!

The Patriarchs of the major forces looked at each other.

“I’m afraid I’ll die here today!” The Sea Dragon Clan leader had an ugly expressions on their faces. Although they did not understand what had happened, there was a high chance that it was the Warlock Alliance that had taken action today.

No wonder the Warlock Alliance had been quiet recently. It seemed like they were holding back!

The two people beside him nodded.

In the next second, the three of them flew into the sky.

In the next second, the waves rolled, and the sound of water rippled. The heads of the Sea Dragon and Sea Shark families roared. From afar, Eli saw a huge Sea Dragon and a huge Sea Shark appear behind the two of them. Immediately, endless waves flew into the sky.

The head of the Wind God Yaolong clan took a deep breath. A storm swept up and flew into the sky.

The three of them were all Germinal Warlocks, and their attacks were also infused with Law. Therefore, their auras and power were extremely shocking.

The Warlocks on the ground also looked towards the sky.

It was the same for Eli.

However, he only watched this scene from a distance and did not make a move!

He wanted to see how strong the Phoenix King was and see if he would make a move. Otherwise, it would be awkward if he couldn’t defeat it. Moreover, he also noticed some faint figures nearby. They were most likely Warlocks from the Warlock Alliance.

After all, this time, it was obvious that they were coming for him. He had to be careful.

At this moment, the flames in the sky also collided with the three people’s attacks!

Bang!

In an instant, countless steam rose up, but the expressions of the three people inside instantly changed.

Because with just a collision, the waves shattered like a thin film. Then, the flames actually directly passed through the waves and headed toward the ground. The power of laws within was directly burned clean, and the storm on the other side was almost instantly shattered.

“The difference is too great!”

The Sea Dragon Clan Head’s expression changed. The Phoenix King’s attack in front of him was not something they could block.

At this moment, the Phoenix King also noticed the three of them. It immediately flapped its wings and flew toward the three of them. It glared at the three of them and then flapped its wings at the three of them like a huge hand, setting off a storm.

Puff!

The three of them couldn’t move at all, and the giant wings struck them, sending them flying toward Bloodline City like cannonballs.

Bang!

Three huge pits instantly appeared on the ground, and countless clouds of smoke filled the air.

When the smoke dispersed, a few of them struggled to get up, but countless cracks had already appeared on their bodies. Large amounts of blood flowed out, and they spat out blood as they struggled to climb out of the deep pit.

Seeing the miserable state of the three people, everyone felt a wave of fear.

Even three fifth-circle lords were defeated so easily. What were they going to do?

“Sir Eli!”

On the high platform, Alida looked at the valley behind her, her body trembling!

Now, other than Eli, they had no other choice.

At this moment, tens of thousands of Undying Birds flew out of the world fragment. They immediately let out a sharp cry and set off a flaming storm as they flew toward the ground with a terrifying aura!

This apocalyptic scene immediately made everyone feel a wave of fear!

At this moment, a golden light that blotted out the sun suddenly emitted. A golden membrane instantly enveloped the entire city like a big bowl, preventing anyone from entering.

At this moment, the flames had already reached the defensive layer. Suddenly, crackling sounds could be heard. Multiple cracks appeared on the defensive layer, but it did not waver at all. At the same time, the flock of immortal birds was also blocked.

The Warlocks on the ground also raised their heads to watch this scene.

Amidst the golden light, Eli slowly flew up into the sky.

“It was Lord Eli who protected us!”

“Sir Eli is here, and the threat has been lifted!”

“Is this Eli?”

Countless people cheered, and the heads of the three families helped themselves up. They looked at the god-like figure in the sky and the thousands of Undying Birds.

Could he defeat The Phoenix King?

Everyone’s eyes were focused on Eli!

Even a few gazes in the shadows were looking at Eli with ill intentions.

..

At this moment, Eli was looking at the Phoenix King in the sky.

After some observation, he was sure that the Mercury Blade had a good chance of defeating him. However, he had thought of a better and more efficient way just now!

” Normally, when entering a foreign world, one would be suppressed. However, these creatures have lived in fragments around the world for many years and have been contaminated by the world’s aura. In addition, the world’s will is silent now, so they are not suppressed. Otherwise, it would not be so easy for a fifth-circle creature to enter the warlock world.

“As long as the world’s will was awakened, its strength would be suppressed to the level of a divine tree or even a sprout. What threat would there be?” Eli looked at the Undying Bird and smiled.

The only difficulty of this plan was to awaken the world’s will. The world’s will was silent now, and even the fifth circle warlock could not do it. However, he was different. He had the world’s will’s favor, so he could do it.

Thinking of this, Eli’s gaze became sharper and sharper, and he looked at the body of The Phoenix King more and more arrogantly.

At this moment, the Phoenix King turned its head and looked at the strange human in front of it. It vaguely sensed danger and was looking for an opportunity.

The people on the ground looked at the confrontation between the man and the bird and were somewhat baffled.

“What are they doing?”

The few people in the darkness were a little disdainful!

“Eli is no match for him. If he dares to show his face, he will die!”

Just like that, three minutes passed!

The Phoenix King couldn’t take it anymore. It let out a shrill cry that spread for tens of thousands of meters. Then, it flapped its wings and flew toward Eli.

At this moment, Eli suddenly moved!

He didn’t do anything, but a dazzling golden light shot into the world, illuminating thousands of spaces. A mysterious aura was emitted from his body, and at the same time, a similar aura was awakened in the world.

Vast, boundless, ancient!

In the sky, the clouds rolled as if a huge creature had awakened.

In an instant, all the Warlocks found it hard to breathe, but they felt as if they had returned to their mother’s embrace. However, the Phoenix King did let out a cry, and its eyes changed. It instantly changed its direction and flew back towards the world fragment.

In the next moment, the Phoenix King’s body instantly froze. The flames around it were instantly extinguished, and its body’s speed was also extremely fast. Its aura was even more ridiculous as it fell directly!

Peak of Thousand Leaves!

Intermediate Thousand Leaves!

..

Peak of the Divine Tree!

In the end, his aura directly fell to the initial stage of entering the Divine Tree.

He wasn’t the only one. The aura of the smaller Undying Birds had also fallen. However, it wasn’t as serious as their King, but their combat strength had also been weakened by more than three levels.

And after that.

With a wave of Eli’s hand, the boundless shadow instantly transformed into a huge hand. Then, the huge hand grabbed at the Undying Bird, but it only let out a painful wail before being dragged into the darkness.

As for the small Undying Birds, they saw the fall of the King and fled towards the World Fragment. They were very fast and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Then, Eli chuckled, and his lifespan was exhausted.

“Star Spirit Seal!”

A chain that looked like a starry sky appeared in the sky, dragging the world fragment towards Ely.

During this process, the World Fragment became smaller and smaller. Finally, it turned into something like a crystal ball and was held in Eli’s hand.

Looking down, it was as if he could still see countless tiny immortal birds.

As the World Fragment was put away, the World Will slowly dissipated.

The wind was calm, and the clouds were still.

With a wave of his hand, the protection formed by the power of faith also turned into countless golden spots of light and dissipated. They flew toward Eli like golden dandelions and were absorbed by him.

Eli did not stop after he withdrew the power of faith. Instead, he looked up at the void not far away. His eyes were emotionless as he said, “Everyone from the Warlock Alliance.

“Are you coming out on your own? Or should I drag you out?”
