533 Am I The Villain?

In fact, 600,000 out of the nearly one million Warlocks had died. Most of them had died in the aftermath of the earlier battle.

More of them would die after this.

At the thought of this, all the low-level Warlocks looked desperate!

At this moment, the two forces in the sky had also finished accumulating their power.

The Warlock Alliance’s side had the World Extinguishing Wind Crystal Butterfly at the peak of Thousand Leaves as the main body. All the bloodline power gathered towards him, and a bloody light gathered in front of him.

In the distance, Eli raised his head. The Shadow Dragon’s breath emitted an icy aura.

He looked at Eli. The blood had already dyed his body red. The burning blood almost made his will faint, but he still stood there, looking at Eli and letting out the last cry of life!

“Eli, take this and stay here forever!”

Boom!

A blood-red light exploded, and a blood-red pillar of light tore through the sky.

The space along the way was torn apart, but it was unstoppable.

“It feels like a great demon king!”

Eli suddenly let out a laugh, but all his power was released at this moment!

Shadow Dragon’s Breath!

Five times the Shadow Dragon’s Breath gushed out without holding back. It tore through the sky like a flood of shadows and flew toward the blood-red bloodline light pillar before colliding!

Bang!

They collided.

The bloody light and shadows dyed the world on both sides.

At the center of the explosion, the power had already surpassed Thousand Leaves. With it as the center, a spatial black dot suddenly appeared. Then, it rapidly expanded and spread in all directions.

Boom!

The sound was like thunder within hundreds of thousands of meters.

Then, there was an explosion. A huge force collided, and the space began to collapse on a large scale. It was also a terrifying disaster on the ground.

It was indeed the case!

In the blink of an eye, the countless defensive barriers on the ground shattered, followed by countless blood dances and wails. Even the celestials had to block the terrifying aftershocks, like small boats drifting in a storm!

In the blink of an eye, the ground caved in by dozens of meters. The ground within 10,000 meters had turned into a purgatory. Moreover, it was mixed with the power of laws. This would probably make the affected area uninhabitable for thousands of years!

The shockwave lasted for dozens of minutes. Then, in the smoke that filled the sky, Luo Ye’s defense was broken layer by layer, and he opened his eyes with difficulty.

Cough, cough, cough!

“Is it over?” He didn’t look around but raised his head to look at the sky.

At this moment, in the sky, a large area of space was connected to the spatial turbulence, emitting a terrifying power. Not far away, the seven figures stood still, but their life auras had completely disappeared.

‘Burning their life force, it’s normal for them to die. I wonder how my lord is doing?’

He raised his head and looked to the other side.

The huge shadow wrapped around something like a planet!

Kakaka!

The shadow shell gradually dissipated, revealing a figure that was 10,000 meters tall. It roared towards the sky as if it was announcing victory.

Luo Ye relaxed and collapsed on the ground.

He wasn’t the only one. All of the celestials had awakened as well. Of course, some of them had died in the aftermath of the battle. Most of the living ones were also looking at Eli in shock. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“We won, we won!”

“This is the undefeated Lord Eli.”

They looked at Eli with admiration. They understood that another giant was about to appear on this continent, and they were one of them, sharing this victory.

“Victory!”

Luo Ye raised his head again, and this scene was deeply engraved in his memory.

He understood that he would never forget this scene for the rest of his life!
