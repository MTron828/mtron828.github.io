239 Udo and Simona

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.

The news of a Warlock catching a big fish worth 3000 magic stones at the silver Moon Lake spread. Many warlocks went to try to catch the big fish, but they all left in dejection.

Speaking of silver Moon lake, every 50 years, the elements here would go into a frenzy. At that time, the activity of the fish here would be much higher than normal, and many fish that usually didn’t live here would also show up.

At that time, almost no one would miss it.

The silver Moon conference that was held once every 50 years was also related to this.

Naturally, Eli didn’t know that his fishing had caused such a stir because it was already the agreed meeting time. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The backyard of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce.

Eli looked at the two third-circle warlocks beside him.

“Let me introduce you. These two are Udo and Simona. They are both 3-circle early warlocks!” Next to Eli, Jin Huan introduced the two three-circle warlocks to him.

A man and a woman.

The man had blonde hair and black eyes. He was wearing a gray Warlock robe and looked very thin. There was even some fur on his hands, making him look like a monkey.

The woman, on the other hand, had dark green eyes, and her hair had a hint of green, but her figure was very sexy. She was only wearing leather armor that could barely cover her private parts, and she was winking at Eli.

“This is Herman!” Jin Huan also explained to the two of them.

“I’ve never seen this little brother before. I wonder which force you’re from?” Simona looked at Eli and asked with a smile.

Most of the third circle warlocks on the West Coast were well-known, but she had never seen this person before.

“Bloodline tower!” Eli looked at the two of them and said.

This time, he did belong to the bloodline tower.

“Oh, the bloodline tower has third-circle warlocks other than Vivika!” He exclaimed. The woman named Simona’s mouth was wide open, and she looked at Eli with even more surprise.

“Hello, my name is Simona. I’m from the school of harpies. I have the third-circle harpy bloodline. We harpies are all beautiful. Are you interested in joining us? ” Simona slowly approached Eli, inadvertently showing off the curves of her body, and the atmosphere around them couldn’t help but slowly turn ambiguous.

Seeing that Eli didn’t move, she smiled.

But just as he was a meter away from Eli, he saw him take a step back silently.

“I’m sorry, I don’t like to be too close to other people!” Eli reached out and stopped Simona!

The smile on Simona’s face slowly froze.

“It seems that your charm is of no use to this friend!” The man beside him smiled, walked up to Eli, and extended his hand.

“Hello, I am Udo. I have a third-circle hell fire Monkey bloodline, from the Holy tower. Simona has no ill intentions. She just wanted to see your strength!”

Eli shook hands with Udo.

He did feel the strong charm from Simona, but fortunately, his 3rd-circle enchantment was also a charm spell, so he could easily resist it.

“Hello, I’m Herman, a 3rd circle shadow lizard Warlock!” After greeting Udo, Eli turned to look at Simona. In theory, the shadow lizard also had the potential to break through to the third circle.

“Yes, hello!” Simona smiled and shook his hand.

To be able to escape her charm so quickly, it seemed that the third person invited by Jin Huan was not weak!

“Hahaha, it seems like everyone is getting along well. That’s great!” Jin Huan looked at the three of them and smiled.

The Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce often recruited people from other forces to take on tasks like this.

“let’s go quickly. I still have to attend the silver Moon conference after this.” Udo, who was at the side, said directly.

“that’s fine. The venom Wyvern is ready. I’ll have him take you three there.” Jin Huan clapped his hands, and a first-circle warlock walked out from the side.

“Alright, let’s talk on the way!” Eli nodded as well. There was indeed no need to waste time on an earth demon bear at the peak of the initial stage of the third circle.

Soon, a venomous Wyvern took flight and left Silvermoon town.

In the sky, the four of them sat on the venom Wyvern, and the first circle warlock leading the group was directing the venom Wyvern.

This was a second circle venom Wyvern, and its size was much larger than the first circle. With four people on it, each of them could have a large area.

Eli was sitting in an area to the side, looking at the air currents on both sides.

“When I get the formula, I’ll be able to advance to the middle stage. By then, my combat power will probably surge again. By then, I’ll be able to run away even if I face an enemy at the limit of the third circle! …” Eli pondered.

On the other side, Simona slowly walked over. “little brother, I’ve never heard of the other third circle warlocks of the bloodline tower. It seems that you’re very low-key!”

Simona smiled as she approached, looking at Eli seductively. “I like men who keep a low profile.”

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. Harpies were famous for being promiscuous creatures. Generally speaking, one would be affected after fusing with their bloodline, just like how it was easy to become violent after fusing with some fire elemental bloodlines.

“I’m sorry, I need to rest for a while. Please don’t come near!” A shadow slowly appeared and blocked the two of them.

“Heartless man!” Simona pouted and walked toward Udo, but she quickly left again.

Then, she walked towards the first circle warlock. Every now and then, Simona would laugh like a flower, and the atmosphere between the two was very ambiguous.

Eli didn’t pay any attention to them. He exchanged a glance with Udo and looked at the man in front with pity.

Time passed very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.

The first circle warlock and Simona were chatting happily, and their eyes were filled with love. However, they had no choice but to stop.

Because they had already reached their destination.

“My Lords, we’ve arrived!” The venom Wyvern slowly descended.

Eli looked around. This was the end of a mountain range, winding and magnificent. Not far away was a huge mine, but at this time, Eli didn’t hear a single sound.

“Ever since the demonic earth bear came here, the people here have all evacuated. The demonic bear is now inside the mine.” The warlock said to the three of them.

The Wyvern slowly descended and soon arrived at a mountain not far from the mine. It was about a kilometer away from the mine.

“We’ve finally arrived!” Simona opened her arms, revealing her blood-white skin. The first-circle warlock’s eyes were red, and his face was even redder. “What an adorable little brother!”

...

Simona touched the face of the first circle warlock and jumped down.

The first circle sorcerer felt the silky smoothness of Simona’s skin, and his heart thumped.

Eli also walked to the Wyvern, thought for a moment, and said to the warlock, “I forgot to tell you that harpies are all males when they are young, but they become females when they reach adulthood. From what I understand, one has to be male to integrate into the harpy bloodline.”

He patted the warlock’s shoulder and jumped into the afternoon.

“Male!”

The sweet smile on the first circle warlock’s face froze.

Udo looked at the man pitifully before jumping down.

“Blargh!”

After a few of them left, the Warlock suddenly felt a wave of disgust. He covered his mouth and tears flowed out.

What had he done?

..

...

“This should be the place!” On the other side, the three people who had left quickly arrived in the sky not far from the mine.

“So, do you have any plans?” Eli asked the two of them.

“There’s no plan. There are three of us with third circle and only one early-stage third-circle demonic bear. We’ll just attack directly!” Udo was still as cold as ever!

“Alright!”

Eli nodded. That was indeed the case.

“Then lure them out!”

Eli looked towards the mine. There was a huge hole in the center, and the aura of a third-circle creature was emanating from it.

Udo stretched out his hand, and a Black Flame appeared in his hand. It then fell into the hole like a meteor, flying straight in.

Eli and Simona watched quietly.

Bang! Bang!

In the next second, a violent explosion came from the mine. The loud sound spread through the mine like an earthquake. The smoke dispersed, and at the same time, a loud roar came from the mine!

The smoke slowly dispersed, and a huge body slowly walked out of the smoke.
