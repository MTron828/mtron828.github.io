211 Conjecture

“F * ck!”

Nikola couldn’t tell how many times he had cursed already. His soul almost kneeled in front of the huge elemental vortex.

“I …” Nikola’s mouth twitched, and his entire soul body trembled.

Only God knew what the hell he had seen.

Eight days ago, when Eli began his breakthrough, he was standing guard outside the forest.

Then, he sensed the changes in the elements around him. This was normal. He had experienced the same thing thousands of years ago.

When the elemental Whirlpool’s radius increased from 50 meters to 100 meters, he was a little shocked.

According to the Mage’s classification, when an ordinary Mage made a breakthrough, the elemental vortex that they could create was usually only 30 to 70 meters long. Anyone who exceeded this range would be considered a genius.

Back then, he was a famous Dark Mage genius on the West Coast. When he broke through, his elemental Whirlpool reached a width of 90 meters. At that time, he was known as a genius that only appeared once in 200 years on the West Coast, and caused quite a stir.

However, Eli had actually reached 100 meters. To put it bluntly, even if he was placed in the mage world, he would still be a true genius.

This made him very happy. After all, as his master, the stronger he was, the better.

Another day passed just like that. He felt that it was about time.

Then, he saw a scene that he would never forget for the rest of his life. The whirlpool had actually expanded again.

It had expanded from 100 meters to 200 meters.

At this time, Nikola’s eyes glazed over as he watched this scene.

Two hundred meters. He seemed to have only heard of this level in the legends. Only the legendary mages above the seventh circle could reach this level.

It was only then that he realized how terrifying Eli was. It was like a dream, and he even felt that being Eli’s subordinate seemed pretty good.

Three days passed in this hallucinatory state.

He felt that it should be enough.

The f * cking elemental Whirlpool had actually expanded from 200 meters to 500 meters. At this time, Nikola knelt on the ground. He even doubted if there was a human inside.

“Ah, this …” Nikola was so excited that tears flowed out. His soul was almost dazed, and he only had one thought in his mind.

Eli was celestial reincarnated.

If someone ran over and told him that Eli was the creator of the mages, he would believe it. Five hundred meters? even the legends weren’t that ridiculous.

Even in the mage world, there might not be such a powerful third-circle mage. Eli was already enough to be recorded in the history of the mage world as a legend.

An elemental vortex that was five hundred meters long.

Eli was not a normal human!

Therefore, when Eli walked out of the forest, he flew towards him, and his first reaction was to kneel.

..

“..”

as soon as Eli walked out, he saw Nikola kneeling on the ground and was dumbfounded.

“Did something happen? What’s wrong? ” Eli asked.

“Ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah!” Nikola was normally a very smart spirit but now he could only make meaningless ravings.

A few minutes later, he finally spoke his first fluent sentence.

“My Lord, don’t leave me behind.”

Eli, “…” What was happening?

In fact, Eli didn’t know how much of an impact he had left on Nikola. After all, he had no idea what a 500-meter elemental Whirlpool meant.

“Uh, calm down, calm down,” Eli said.

What the hell was going on? he had broken through to the third circle but Nikola was more excited than he was.

“Yes, yes, yes. I’m very calm, my Lord.” Nikola stood up and said.

Eli glanced at Nikola, who was trembling all over. As someone who had witnessed the fall of the mage world, Nikola was too easily impressed.

“forget it. I just broke through and need a simple test. Set up something for me,” Eli said.

“Of course, of course!” Nikola quickly nodded and looked at the calm Eli. As expected of his Lord, he was so calm even after creating such a terrifying elemental vortex. Instead, he looked like a fool.

Eli didn’t care anymore. Instead, he checked the changes that had happened to him after his advancement. At this moment, in his consciousness, the original spirit crystal had disappeared, and in its place was another gaseous substance. It was the power of the fusion process of mental force, mana, and bloodline.

In reality, the third circle’s advancement was about the same as the second circle’s. There were also three stages, which were the three states of solid, gas, and liquid.

He could now communicate with nature’s power 15 times more than he could in the past. This situation made him feel amazed because normally, only a middle-stage mage could reach this level. He had just broken through and he had already reached it.

There was also his mental force, which was now about 236 points. The third circle mages would have 200 to 600 points. He could try for the next breakthrough at 400 points.

Of course, these were all very common knowledge. The only thing that made Eli concerned was this new fused power. Not only was it stronger than any of the normal forces, but it also seemed to have other interesting characteristics.

The individual elements could be separated.

Eli focused his consciousness, and the mysterious power in his space of consciousness began to reassemble, slowly dispersing, once again separating into three different powers, and then fusing again.

If he fused his mental force with mana, he would appear as a pure mage with control of the elements.

If he fused his mental force with bloodline, he exuded the aura of a Warlock. At this time, no one could say that he was a mage.

Eli felt that this was a good thing. It was a very convenient way for him to hide among the warlocks. He had truly integrated himself into the warlocks.

“So what’s the reason for this?” Eli was curious as he pondered why such a thing happened.

Not only could the three powers fuse, but they could also reassemble in different configurations. This was too ridiculous.

...

Soon, he had a guess.

“Could it be that my bloodline and mental force are at their limits, which led to this change? ” Eli was puzzled, but he immediately denied such a thought.

It was unlikely. In the old world, experienced mages would have trained their bloodlines to the limit too. However, he had never seen any records of such a fusion in the books.

“It might be related to something else!” Eli pursed his lips and pondered. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Could it be …” As if he had thought of something, Eli focused his consciousness and went deeper.

As his consciousness went deeper, he found what he was looking for. A white pillar of light that penetrated everything stood there, emitting a gentle light as if it had passed through endless time.

“Is it you?” Eli looked at the pillar of light that gave him immortality and fell into deep thought.

This was his biggest secret, and also his only secret.

When he broke through to the first circle, he sensed that he gained a time talent. When he broke through to his second circle, he felt that his time talent received a certain degree of improvement. When he broke through to his third circle, he didn’t have anything. Instead, he gained a new power of fusion. It was hard not to overthink it.

However, this question was destined to have no answer. The White pillar of light stood there for a long time without any response.

“Sigh, there’s no point in thinking about this.” Eli shook his head and left the space of consciousness.

...

It would be too much to understand what the White pillar of light was. It was better to think about it later. This was a question with no answer for now.

At this time, Nikola returned from the distance and seemed to be ready.

“Sir, everything is ready!” Nikola said respectfully.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

Back to reality.

He was also very curious about how strong his true combat power was at this moment.
