Chapter 34: First Phase Completed

Translator: Lonelytree

“Eli!”

Soon, Eli arrived at the library. Coincidentally, Herman had just arrived as well. However, he couldn’t hide the smile on his face. He must have encountered something wonderful.

The two of them walked up to the second floor.

Eli didn’t ask because he knew that Herman wouldn’t be able to resist telling him.

Sure enough, a few seconds later, Herman, who was next to him, saw that he didn’t respond. He took the initiative to approach him and said, “Eli, I’m so happy today.”

“Oh!” Elie nodded and continued walking.

Seeing that Eli was still ignoring him, Herman suddenly felt a little uncomfortable, as if he was constipated. However, a few seconds later, he couldn’t help but lean forward and say, ” Eli, do you still remember when I said I was tricked? ”

“I remember. Why? Did you gamble again? Aren’t you afraid that teacher will beat you to death? ” Eli turned around and looked at Herman in confusion.

With this kid’s intelligence, he could do anything.

“How is that possible? Didn’t I tell you that I was dragged there by someone else?” Herman quickly denied it. Then, he whispered into Eli’s ear, “That person is dead.”

“?” Eli was puzzled.

“Yes, I think he was beaten to death by the people at the casino. Although he’s really pitiful, I’m really happy.” Herman sighed and added, “He cheated me of my money but lost his life. I didn’t lose anything this time!”

What a strange way of consoling himself!

“His name is Evans!” While they were walking, Herman suddenly said.

Evans?

Upon hearing this familiar name, Eli was taken aback. Wasn’t this the young man who had led him to be deceived the other day?

“Oh, right, and that casino, it seems that it’s not doing well recently. It closed a few days ago!”

Moca casino closed.

Eli admitted that he did earn some money there, and he had been there a few times after that. He just made a small profit, but it closed down right away. He had overestimated the ability of these casinos to withstand pressure.

But that wasn’t necessarily the case. Maybe other casinos wanted to annex it. Moca casino was not a very big casino, to begin with, and could only be considered a medium-sized casino.

“I heard that it was done by an outsider. It’s a pity that he’s not here. Otherwise, I would have kowtowed to him on the spot.” Herman was amazed and said with a smile.

Eli smiled and didn’t say anything.

Soon, the two of them started working after visiting scholar Clement.

...

After the matter at the casino was over, Eli’s life also returned to normal. He paced back and forth between home and the library, occasionally going to the base in the valley outside the city to conduct some experiments.

During this period, there was no news from count Gimori’s side, so Eli was free.

With sufficient funds, Eli also purchased a large number of materials from Roland for experiments.

Of course, in order to avoid Roland’s suspicion, he also blurred Roland’s memory with magic so that it wouldn’t be leaked. After all, trust was trust, but he couldn’t lose the necessary caution.

In any case, to the outside world, he was just a scholar without any combat ability.

He could improve his status and social circle without any scruples, but he would never expose his strength. The former would only make people think that there was a good scholar in the Empire, and the high-ranking people would not care too much about it. It would even make him safer, but the latter might make some people feel fear. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Moreover, he would only be able to obtain more resources if his social circle improved.

Hiding was for development, not because of cowardice.

...

“Experiment one hundred and thirty-sixth, failure!”

In the laboratory, Eli threw away the experimental waste again with a calm expression. Although he failed, he didn’t feel discouraged because as time passed, he felt that he was getting closer and closer to completing the first stage.

The experiment had been going on for a month, and he had failed every time.

“No rush!” Eli took out a new set of materials from the side and continued his experiment.

For a moment, the bright basement fell into silence again, with only the sound of Eli operating the instrument.

“Experiment number one hundred and thirty-seventh, failure.”

“The 138th experiment, failure.”

...

“The 201st experiment, failure.”

...

“The 301st experiment, success!”

Three months later, Eli finally succeeded in the first stage.

Eli looked at the potion that had been roughly concocted in front of him. It was actually faintly emitting a wave that was close to spiritual power. He felt a little excited. He had finally found a substitute experimental material for the original formula.

The next step was to adjust the comparison of these materials and then finally concoct the potion.

“When that time comes, my spiritual power will be able to grow rapidly. It might not take that long!” Eli was a little happy too.

His current spiritual power should be around 6.3, and with a rate of 0.5 per year, it would take 7.4-8 years. If he could formulate the potion, it would greatly shorten the time.

Although he didn’t really care about the time, this advancement would reduce a lot of his concerns.

Once he advanced to a level 2 apprentice, his combat power would increase again. He wasn’t sure about Grand Knights, but anyone below that would be easily beaten. His survival ability would also increase.

At that time, even if he was really exposed, he didn’t need to have so many concerns. At most, he would just run away.

“Next up is the second stage, which is the detailed replacement.”

Eli took a deep breath and prepared to continue his experiment.

However, when he went to get the materials, he realized that he had used up all the experimental materials without knowing it. There was nothing left.

“It looks like I’ll have to go find Roland again.” Since there were no more materials, Eli could only proceed with other work.

As for continuing the experiment, he would have to wait for the new batch of materials to arrive.

...

“Are there no more purple irises? ”

It was a familiar room. Eli was puzzled.

“Yes.” Roland nodded and said helplessly, ” I have all the other materials you want, and I can help you find them. But I really can’t find purple irises now!

“Why?” Eli was still a little dazed.

He had come to Roland today to order materials, only to be told that one of the materials, called purple irises, could not be found.

However, the purple irises were the most important ingredient in potions and were completely irreplaceable. If he really didn’t have any, his potion experiment couldn’t be completed.

“Here’s the thing. The purple irises can only be found in rock Manor, which is outside the city. It seems to be a unique plant there and was transplanted from a very far place. A few days ago, Rock Manor suddenly stopped selling them. It seems that they are not going to continue selling them!” Roland explained.

“This sucks!” Eli sucked in a breath of cold air.

This meant that he couldn’t continue his experiment.

“I really don’t have a choice. Oh, right, that Manor belongs to the Count Alina family. Don’t you know count Gimori? he seems to be very familiar with the Alina family. Perhaps you can ask him for help.” Roland gave a suggestion.

When Roland said this, Eli actually recalled the ball from half a year ago. Didn’t Alex belong to the Alina family? Unfortunately, he had no way to contact him, and the two of them were not familiar with each other.

On the other hand, he was more familiar with count Gimori, and he might really be able to get help from him.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t help you!” Roland apologized.

“It’s okay. I’m already very happy that you can help me find the others.” Eli smiled. He had no reason to blame Roland.

“Then I’ll take my leave first.” Since there were no materials, Eli didn’t plan on staying any longer. He bade farewell to Roland and left.

On the way home, Eli was filled with mixed feelings.

It was not good for a good experiment to face the risk of failure.

“I can only ask Count Gimori for help.”

Eli thought about it and soon returned home.

When he walked into the courtyard, he found that there was a letter in the mailbox at the door.

Eli opened it and found that it just so happened to be from Count Gimori.

The letter told him that the rest of the horses had arrived at the stable and hoped that he would go over.
