67 Error in Thinking

Since he had no choice, he could only accept it.

Eli and clement took their simple luggage and settled down here. The most fortunate thing was that the bedrooms here were still in good condition and relatively clean.

Early in the next morning, Ake gathered everyone and decided to have a seminar to discuss what to do next.

“Before we start the discussion, scholar Clement and Eli, please introduce what you’re good at so that I can arrange work.” Asked ake.

“I’m good at history, Botany, and some natural science.” Scholar Clement said.

“I’m good at history and heraldry.” Eli continued.

“Yes, Botany may not be of much help, but history will be of some help. No wonder you were assigned here. But you must not be so familiar with the history of the Lorraine Kingdom. I need to think about how to arrange the work.” Ake fell into deep thought.

Suddenly, he heard snoring sounds. Arthur had fallen asleep and was drooling on the table. Vera nodded her head.

The corner of ake’s mouth twitched when he saw this.

“I’m sorry, both of them like to work at night. They’re always like this during the day!” Explained Ake.

“It’s okay, let’s continue.” scholar clement closed his eyes in despair and accepted the situation a few seconds later.

“Okay, I’ll continue. Where were we just now? Oh, I’m talking about history. The Lorraine Kingdom was built on the foundation of the Olisen Empire. We’ve also received most of the Empire’s heritage, so our history here is a little complicated. Speaking of which, if you want to talk about it, you’ll have to start from the first king of Bryne, Saleen Merlin.”

What the hell did he just hear?

What?

The first king of Bryne, Saleen Merlin?

Saleen Metatrin!

“Ake!” Eli’s breathing was a little rushed as he quickly interrupted Ake.

“Ake, wait a minute. How do you know the name of the first king of the bryne Empire? almost no one in the bryne Empire knows this name.” Eli asked. He had not been this excited for a long time.

“Oh, right, this should be confidential information, but it’s fine. You’ve already joined the project team, so you’ll know some things. I forgot to tell you. The project team was directly under the Queen’s supervision at that time. So, even though we don’t have money, we still have the authority.

“We can even enter the Empire’s second library to read some important documents. However, don’t you know the name of your first king?” Asked Ake.

Eli nodded.

In just a moment, he slightly understood.

He had never entered the real library of the kingdom, so he did not know some of the secrets. But here, some things were not necessarily secrets, and the information here might be more accurate than the Bryne Kingdom.

This was because many countries would modify their own content. For example, Saleen Merlin had hidden his name and the people around him in the Bryne history, but other countries would not!

Subtly, Eli felt his breathing quicken.

If it was true, this project team was a treasure vault for him!

The treasure did not matter. More importantly, it allowed him to get closer to Bryne’s history, the real history.

Furthermore, combining the information from before, there was a high probability that this Saleen Metatrin was Saleen Merlin.

On his first day on the project team, he confirmed a question that he had previously suspected.

This was truly a treasure trove.

“Oh, that’s right. After all, this information seems to be quite confidential” Ake nodded.

The two of them were speechless. ‘Then, why are you telling us?’

“Forget it. I’ll just continue.” Ake shook his head. “speaking of Saleen Merlin, he actually had a student. Very few people know about this, but it was this student who was the liaison between the Olisen Empire and the Bryne Empire at that time. He was in charge of diplomacy, but it seemed that something had happened later on, and the Empire had destroyed the Olisen Kingdom.”

Ake explained slowly, and at that moment, Eli was already numb!

Fortunately, he was assigned to this place.

Saleen Metatrin actually had a student who was a diplomat for both empires.

This time, eli didn’t ask. Instead, he was prepared to investigate this himself.

This time, he had thought that his biggest gain was the Chamber of Commerce, but now he could only say that he was too shallow and inexperienced.

The ruins of the Empire? This was his treasure.

Soon, Ake gave a simple explanation of the latter part, but there was nothing that eli wanted to hear. Then, he assigned the two of them their jobs.

He mainly gave them some historical documents to read. Of course, if they wanted to read more advanced information, they could also tell him. He could bring them to the Kingdom’s second library.

Clement sighed while Eli’s eyes were shining.

...

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

The Bryne Empire and the Lorraine Kingdom were discussing the exchange of interests. Neither side was giving in to the other. This made the negotiations continue, but there was almost no progress. Marquis Alina was so anxious that he could not even eat.

Some were anxious, while others were happy.

For the past month, Eli had been really hungry and thirsty for knowledge.

Not only did he read through all the documents here, he even asked Ake to take him to the second library and read almost all the materials he could.

This was a huge gain for him.

First of all ...

He was certain that Saleen Merlin was Saleen Metatrin, and this was an important discovery.

Second.

He found that Saleen Merlin did have a student named Weiss. It was said that he had appeared here with Saleen. This was also in line with what Marquis Alina had said, that they were outsiders.

Third.

After analyzing the materials, it was found that Weiss had died in the battle with the Olisen Empire, and his items had been seized by the Empire and kept in the Treasury.

The most important point was that when the Olisen Empire was defeated, the treasury’s collection was also in ruins. It had disappeared along with the Olisen Kingdom.

Eli guessed that there was a high chance that Weiss was a wizard.

So, now that Eli confirmed there was a relic left behind by a wizard in the ruins of the Empire, and that it was once owned Saleen Metatrin’s student, it made Eli feel a little tempted.

Alright, he wasn’t tempted but determined to get it.

The only problem was finding the Empire’s ruins.

Eli felt that it was time for him to contribute to the project team.

He just wanted to help the poor project team. What was wrong with him? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He could only blame himself for being too kind.
