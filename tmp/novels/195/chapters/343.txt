344 The Crisis of the Main Tower

The woman clutched her clothes, so nervous that she was speechless. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She couldn’t imagine that there was a celestial in the West Coast branch tower!

This was a celestial!

The bloodline tower’s main tower only had two celestials. Moreover, due to the bloodline tower’s recent turmoil, one of the celestials had fallen. As a result, the bloodline tower only had one celestial.

Because of the war, they had to summon all the branch towers to support them. The third-circle warlocks were sent to the branch towers in the central continent, while she was sent here to contact the West Coast, an enclave that she hadn’t contacted for a long time.

So it was hard to imagine the shock she felt when she crossed thousands of miles and found that the tower master here was actually a celestial.

A barren land actually had a celestial!

This was like a joke.

However, she understood that this was probably her only chance, a one-in-a-million chance.

“Oh? What’s happening in the main tower?” Eli asked curiously.

As time passed, he wasn’t too sure about the specific situation in the Western Region of the Main Continent, but it sounded like something big had happened in the bloodline tower.

“Sir, you may not know this, but the forces in the Western Region of the main continent are generally divided into four levels, and our bloodline tower has always been a force of the fourth level. This time, we have provoked a force on the third level, and the conflict this time is very big. They are determined to destroy us!” The female Warlock said.

“I see.” Eli nodded to show that he understood.

It seemed like a battle between forces. However, this was a good opportunity for him to establish himself on the central mainland.

“So you’ve been sent here to ask for help?” Eli laughed and teased.

“Yes, my Lord.” The Warlock lowered her head. She was very nervous because she was not sure if the sub-tower would agree to their request.

As if he could see her worry, Eli replied with a smile, ” you don’t have to worry about the reinforcements. I’ll go there myself, and I’ll even take most of the warlocks here with me.”

She heaved a sigh of relief.

“Thank you, my Lord.” The warlock said gratefully.

“Of course, we might need some time. We might have to trouble you to wait for a while.” Elie said.

“It’s no trouble, no trouble at all!” The Warlock hurriedly said.

What a joke. She couldn’t even imagine how the Lords of the bloodline tower would feel if she brought back a celestial.

“May I ask for your name, miss?” Eli asked.

“Sir, you can just call me Alida.” The warlock nodded.

Eli nodded, then clapped his hands.

Soon, the door opened, and a Warlock walked in.

“Make sure miss Alida is properly settled, she’s an important guest!” Eli said to the Warlock and then turned to Alida, “I might have to discuss some things next. See you later!”

Just like that, the Warlock took the dizzy Alida outside.

On the way, Alida found out that the Warlock’s name was Kylie, a first-circle Warlock.

“Kylie, can you take me to the bloodline tower for a walk?” Alida asked Kylie as soon as they walked out of the wizard Tower.

“Of course.” Kelly smiled.

Alida was obviously much more relaxed now that she didn’t have to face the celestial. She chatted and laughed with Kylie along the way, and she also learned about the general strength of the bloodline tower.

Alida was surprised that the entire West Coast was under the control of the bloodline tower. She had read the records before coming here and it said that they didn’t provide much support during the war.

However, it was not difficult to tell from the few words in the report that the main tower had obviously underestimated this place.

At the very least, the main tower had estimated that there would be 10 to 30 third-circle warlocks here, but in reality, there were about 250 third-circle warlocks here. The difference in the base number was even greater.

Their assessment was seriously wrong.

“Oh, right, Kylie. I heard that Lord Eli only advanced recently. How did the bloodline tower manage to occupy such a large territory before this? ” Alida asked as they walked.

“Because we had Sir Herman before. He was also a celestial Warlock, but he died! but we’re stronger than before, ” Kylie said as she walked. “Master Kriman, master Nikola, master Hydra, these are all celestials. Who dares to challenge us? ”

“Eh, where is she?” Suddenly, Kelly turned her head and saw that Alida was not there. She turned around and saw that Alida was a few meters away.

Alida stared at her, her voice almost trembling.”Those people you just mentioned are all celestials?”

“Yeah!” Kylie asked curiously.

“Four celestials!” She exclaimed. Alida blinked her eyes and felt like she was about to faint.

She had thought that Eli was the only celestial, but there were actually three more.

Is this a f * cking sub-tower?

Alida closed her eyes and felt like she was dreaming.

If everything was true, then the power of the sub-tower had already surpassed the main tower.

Who was the main tower?

….

Just when Alida doubted her life.

On the other side, Eli and Kriman had already started discussing.

“Are you preparing to leave, my Lord?” Kriman asked.

As the person in charge of the bloodline tower after Eli left, he was naturally aware of Alida’s arrival and knew that His Excellency would agree to it.

“Yes,” Eli nodded.

This was indeed a good opportunity to enter the central continent. Moreover, the bloodline tower’s main tower was weaker than he had imagined, so it would be easy for him to take control of it.

...

He needed this opportunity.

“I understand, Sir.” Kriman nodded and said, “then how many people do you need to take with you?” After all, it was a reinforcement.

Upon hearing this question, Eli fell into deep thought.

He would not be able to come back in a short period of time. He, Nikola, and Hydra had to leave. As for the others …

After thinking for a few minutes, Eli raised his head and said, ” as for the manpower, the third circle is 100, the second circle is 300, and the first circle is 500.”

This was the number that Eli was thinking about. This number wouldn’t have a huge impact on this place, but it would also allow him to quickly gain a foothold in the central continent.

“Alright, I’ll make the arrangements.” Kriman stood up and prepared to leave.

“Oh, right. Make sure that people who are coming are all willing. After all, they might not be able to come back after this.” Eli reminded.

“Lord, you can rest assured.” Kriman nodded and left.

Watching Kriman leave, eli stood up and walked to the window.

Looking at the bustling bloodline tower outside the window, he was filled with emotions.

...

He had spent too much time on the West Coast, and he had too many feelings for this place.

This place had witnessed his Ascension from a first circle mage to a celestial and also witnessed the bloodline tower’s growth from an ordinary force to the dominating force on the West Coast.

However, he was still a mage, and the pursuit of the truth was still engraved in his soul. So, it was time to start a new journey.

Next stop, central continent.
