462 Capturing the Dragon with One Hand

Roar!

Thank you readers!

The dragon’s roar resounded in the blue sky. Dragon King Giovanni lowered his head and looked at the city in the distance.

“We’re very close to Ortiz!” Giovanni said as he flew.

Hearing his voice, the eyes of the other dragons lit up!

Were they finally reaching their destination?

!!

“Speed up!” Giovanni shouted and sped up again.

The other dragons followed closely behind.

Sayis also sped up to catch up. He lowered his head and looked at a city not far away. There was a huge human statue that was dozens of meters tall. Its dim eyes were staring straight ahead, shining under the sun as if it was observing them!

…..

How fast were dragons?

Three hours later!

When the mighty dragons arrived outside the Bloodline City, the entire city instantly turned into darkness!

In the sky, the thousand-meter-long Giovanni’s huge body emitted a scorching heat, like a new sun.

The hundreds of dragons behind him also lowered their heads to look at the Bloodline City not far away. The surrounding elements gathered like a storm, like an ocean.

In front of these massive troops, the relatively large Bloodline City was like a child’s toy!

“Is Ortiz here?” Sayis looked at the Bloodline City curiously and asked.

“Yes, I can sense his bloodline aura here!” Giovanni blinked his thick eyelids and stared at the city in the distance, or rather, at a valley behind the city!

He was very sure that Ortiz was here!

It seemed that he was imprisoned in the valley. It seemed that his captor was a powerful warlock.

However, with him around, they had to pay the price for their stupidity today!

His body was gradually covered in flames. The color of the flames was deep, like the hottest lava. It wrapped around his body like the dragon king’s robe or crown. Even his eyes turned red. He lowered his head and looked at the valley in the distance.

“Human, hand over Ortiz!”

On the ground!

All the Warlocks looked at this scene in a daze. The news of the dragon invasion had already spread, but no one expected the disaster to fall on their heads!

Why would such a powerful dragon race attack them?

And … What was Ortiz?

“What exactly happened? If these dragons swarmed up, I’m afraid this city would be razed to the ground today.”

“What exactly is Ortiz? What kind of stupid thing did the higher-ups of the Bloodline Tower do?”

“We’re doomed, we’re doomed. No, we still have Sir Eli here. Sir will definitely be able to solve this problem!”

The warlocks were at a loss. Their bodies were stunned by the dragon’s voice and aura, and they could not move. However, their thoughts were flowing rapidly. They were either shocked, desperate, painful, or sad. No matter what it was, in the end, everyone’s thoughts turned to hope for Eli.

With the enemy in front of them, only Sir Eli could save them!

But the enemy is so terrifying. Can Eli really deal with it?

…

“My father is here. Lord Father, I’m here!”

In the Grassi Land, the Red Dragon Ortiz suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the dragon camp in the distance. He immediately stood up and shouted.

His eyes were filled with joy.

It was as if, as long as his father came, he could leave this terrifying place.

“Stop shouting. There’s a screen here. He can’t hear or see you!”

At this moment, a voice was heard. Ortiz turned around. It was the fully armed Eli!

He was wearing a black wizard robe that was decorated with stars. He held a magic staff in his right hand. The head of the staff was a gem that flickered with silver sand. The body of the staff was like a tree that had shrunk countless times in an instant. There was also a mage book, a ring, earrings, bracelets, and boots that looked extraordinary!

And that was not all. He even saw a mercury-like flowing armor under the sorcerer’s robe!

Gulp!

Ortiz blinked her eyes, recognizing that every piece of equipment on this body was at least a fourth circle mage Tool!

The magic staff and the mage Book, if he was not mistaken, should have reached the fifth circle.

Was he that rich?

“Eli’s Scepter, Book of Amir, Bernari Belt, Crimson Gold Ring, Blood Feather Earrings…” Eli took stock of his equipment one by one. They were all Eli’s gains over the past few decades, which had also increased his combat strength to a certain extent!

After taking stock, he glanced at Ortiz and flew into the sky.

After flying over the Grassi Lands, he arrived above the Bloodline City. At the same time, he released the aura of a celestial and descended!

The Warlocks on the ground immediately felt the pressure that had been shrouding them dissipate.

“It’s Sir Eli!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Sir Eli is here!”

The Warlocks raised their heads and saw that it was Eli. They were all excited. Everyone recognized Eli’s combat strength!

At this moment, Giovanni, who was opposite him, also looked at Eli and stared at him.

The dragon opened its mouth, and the scorching flames unconsciously flowed between his teeth. He said angrily, “I sense Ortiz’s aura on you. You imprisoned Ortiz!”
