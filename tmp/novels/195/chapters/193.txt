194 Joint

Big trouble?

Everyone looked at each other and then at Kratos, curious about what had happened.

Eli raised his brows in doubt.

“Yes, I just received the latest news today. Black Isotta is now free to deal with the South of the West Coast, and we are one of their targets!” Kratos sighed.

“The black Isotta?” All of the representatives were shocked. Black Isotta had a third-circle Warlock. If the third-circle warlock came, they wouldn’t be able to defeat him even if they all went up together!

“Of course, the third circle warlocks of the black Isotta won’t make a move!” Kratos reached out his hand to calm everyone down and continued, ” This time, they don’t intend to attack us directly. Instead, the five Forces will form a union to eliminate us, then deal with the family of the undead. Finally, they will unite all forces to deal with the bloodline tower.” Kratos said calmly.

When they heard this, the others all gasped.

The goal of this plan was undoubtedly the bloodline tower, and they were the only obstacles that needed to be cleared. They had suffered an unexpected calamity.

“Then, my Lord, where did you learn of this plan?” Someone asked.

“There’s no need to know that. The Alliance they formed has already started to move. Many small forces have been destroyed along the way.” Kratos sighed.

The entire Parliament fell silent.

On the other hand, Eli frowned. If that were the case, it would be troublesome!

Although the White Tower had developed well, those few forces a hundred years ago were all major forces in the South of the West Coast, comparable to the White Tower. Although they had weakened a lot after the passage of time, they were still a Union, so it was no wonder that everyone was silent.

In their eyes, this was a hopeless battle.

However, where could they run to? The entire South of the West Coast was only so big, and training could not be done by themselves. Without a force to continuously provide resources for advancement, it could be a disaster.

“There’s also bad news. They’ve come in full force this time and have reached a few hundred kilometers North of the White Tower. They’ll probably be here in two days.” Kratos once again revealed the bad news.

“We’re finished!”

Some representatives gritted their teeth and closed their eyes.

“Do you want to leave this place?” Rawls also frowned and asked Kratos.

“We can’t run. They’re going down like a net. This time, they’re going to plunder all the forces in the South. No force can avoid them unless you take a ship and leave the West Coast. However, the endless sea is an even more dangerous place.” Kratos thought for a moment and shook his head in refusal.

“Herman, what do you think?” With that said, Kratos looked at Eli and found that he had actually taken out a die.

It was as if he was playing.

Everyone who saw this scene frowned. Lorant was even more disgusted. At this time, Kratos didn’t have a reaction, and he was looking forward to Eli’s answer.

“How many people do they have?” Eli played with the die and asked.

“Judging from the remaining warlocks of the other forces, there are about eight to nine peak second-circle warlocks, a large number of second-circle, first-circle warlocks, and acolytes.

“However, most of the second-circle warlocks will rush to carry out the assassination strikes. The others will come later. So, our first opponent should be a team of five to eight peak second-circle assassins.” Kratos’s tone became more and more serious.

White Tower currently had four peak two-circle Warlocks, Kratos, Lorant, Rawls, and Herman.

He was already old, and his combat power was only equivalent to a late-stage two-circle warlock. Of course, if he went all out, he might be able to fight to his limit. However, there were only Rawls and Lorant. Even if Herman could fight two of them, there were still three or four of them. How could they stop them?

“Is there any way?” Kratos asked. He knew how powerful Herman was.

“Five or six? Seven or eight?”

Everyone stared at Eli, only to see him actually throw out the die. Staring at the die, everyone was also puzzled. On the side, Rawls looked at the die, then at Eli.

“Superstitious!” Lorant mocked.

Although his voice was low, the others still heard him. They were surprised that Lorant was going against Herman. They didn’t expect an internal fight to break out. If that happened, the situation would be even worse.

At this moment, the die also stopped.

6.

The die stopped, and then Eli moved as well. He put away the die and looked up.

“Just prepare for defense as usual. I’ll take action when the time comes!”

After saying that, he turned around and left.

The White Tower was already one of his forces, and it provided him with a large number of resources every year. If it were destroyed like this, it would be too hasty. Moreover, the die of fate had already given a very definite answer.

..

Everyone was dumbfounded as they watched Eli leave.

Rawls took in a deep breath of cold air. This f * cking familiar feeling.

The corner of Lorant’s mouth twitched. He was at the peak of his second-circle, after all. Why was it that Eli didn’t take him seriously at all? Did he have to be so arrogant?

The others were also a little dissatisfied. They were not from the previous batch, and they had never seen how Eli saved the White Tower. They just thought that he was putting on a show with his past achievements.

“Sigh, the black Isotta Alliance this time can’t be compared to the Blood Alliance in the past. Herman is a little arrogant.

“Indeed, he only got his honorary title when the White Tower was still weak.”

“Times have changed, but he’s still stuck in the past.”

While some of the council members were talking among themselves, Lorant slammed his hand on the table and said, “He’s too cocky!”

The crowd was in high spirits.

“Um.” Suddenly, someone spoke at this time. Everyone looked over and saw Ross, who said with an embarrassed expression, “I don’t want to say it, but based on my understanding of Herman, he’s not arrogant, he just never put you in his eyes.”

Everyone, “…” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Indeed,” Ross added.

Everyone was instantly speechless. What the f * ck?

Kratos covered his face with his hands. Rawls and Ross were undoubtedly on Herman’s side, but the others might not come. He was old, and many things were inconvenient for him.

...

“Hmph!” The corner of Lorant’s mouth twitched. He seemed to want to say something, but he held back and turned to leave.

This force was beyond saving.

It seemed like he had to find another way out.

The others looked at each other, not knowing what to say.

“Since we’re done chatting, let’s disperse. Prepare to defend.” Kratos sighed and dismissed the meeting.

..

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

Black Isotta’s Allied forces didn’t hide their actions, so the news spread throughout the White Tower’s territory on the same day, causing everyone to fall into a state of panic.

Many warlocks felt that there was no hope at all, and many warlocks ran away. Some chose to lie flat and give up resisting.

Of course, the officials of the White Tower had also taken measures. Kratos gathered most of the warlocks in his sphere of influence on the same day and built a line of defense overnight to stop the enemy’s attack.

As for the majority of the higher-ups, they were also summoned to join the defense line.

...

Running away would only lead to a faster death, but if they were in a group, there was still a glimmer of hope for survival. The only thing that surprised everyone was that two people did not come.

They were Herman and Lorant.

Lorant had disappeared since yesterday,while Herman was still leisurely in the Black Tower. According to people, he was still patrolling the Black Tower this morning, which made everyone silent.

‘This is f * cking …’

Everyone was nervous as they welcomed the strong enemy. Are you going to work as usual?

This also made many people feel a little disappointed in Eli. They thought that this former honorary Member of Parliament was just afraid and used work as an excuse. Many people even believed this reason.

A day passed by in the blink of an eye.

The people of the black Isotta Army were getting closer and closer, which made the atmosphere even tenser.

According to the Scout, the execution team had already set off. They directly sent out eight peak second-circle warlocks, as well as a bunch of second-circle and first-circle warlocks to cover them. This news made everyone feel a little desperate.

How could they possibly resist it?

In the Black Tower prison, Eli finished his day’s work, locked the gate tower, and quickly flew to the front line.

After absorbing this wave, his mental power should be able to reach 200.
