Chapter 8: Learning

Translator: Lonelytree

What was the fastest way to understand a world?

Eli thought it was history.

History was not just a simple record of what happened in the past. It also bore all the traces of the world’s past, as well as the changes in thought and appearance.

As Eli browsed through ‘the complete history of the Empire’, he also gained a deeper understanding of this world.

Of course, he had a deeper understanding of the Byrne Empire.

Located to the South of the dark Mountain range and North of the endless sea, there were four duchies under the Empire. They were the Frostwolf Duchy, the Furious Lion Duchy, the Elk Duchy, and the giant whale Duchy.

The four dukedoms were located on four different sides of the Empire, and they were managed by the four Dukes. Jun Ling city was located in the center of the Empire, and it managed the vast lands of the Empire. It also coordinated the various Marquises, Earls, barons, and Viscounts, as well as other forces.

Each noble territory was managed on its own, and the Empire would not ask for too much. Thus, even though the Empire was in a unified state, there were still ongoing wars.

There was even a saying.

Every noble had started a war with the king.

Of course, this was just a joke, but it could also reflect the current situation of this huge Empire.

“The history of the Empire ” was about everything that happened from the establishment of the Empire to its subsequent development. It had detailed information about every war and some major events.

However, the strange thing was that the name of the first king who established the kingdom was not written on it. Eli was a little surprised, but he did not care.

Eli sat on the chair and flipped through the book page by page.

He only read each page once. If it were from someone else’s point of view, they would see that Eli was flipping through the book as if he was randomly flipping through it. He flipped through the book quickly, as if he was just casually perusing.

But only Eli himself knew that he had really remembered everything.

“This is too good.” He had never felt this way before. Eli was experiencing what having a photographic memory felt like.

One by one, the words were imprinted into Eli’s brain as if they were carved into his brain, never to be forgotten. Every word, every punctuation mark, he could remember them clearly.

If Eli had such a memory in his previous life, he wouldn’t need to work overtime for more than a month. He should be the one who made others work overtime.

After reading the entire history of the Empire for a while, Eli closed it and put it to one side, and opened the ‘heraldry of nobles’ on the other side.

If there was a place where the empire’s history was reflected, it was in the heraldry.

At first, the heraldry was just a badge that represented the identity of a family. However, as the Empire developed, it was also instilled with deeper meaning by the nobles and Knights. In addition to the representative symbols, the nobles would also engrave some symbols of historical significance to highlight the honor of the family.

It could be said that a herald was the history of a noble family.

As far as he knew, the four Dukes’ emblems were Frost Wolf, angry lion, elk, and a giant whale.

The king’s herald was the violet flower, so the family of the king was also called the violet family, which represented their Supreme honor.

Therefore, heraldry had always been one of the most popular fields in the Empire. It was also known by the nobles in Junlin city as an elegant knowledge that only true nobles could master.

Of course, this was just an excuse from the nobles.

Naturally, Eli wouldn’t take it to heart, but he would still study it. After all, it was part of his examination. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

If it were any other country, he might not even look at it, but he still had to live here for a long time, all which meant that Eli had to master it.

“Three days should be enough.” Eli looked down at the four books he had obtained.

These books were not independent of each other, and they were all in the area mentioned by scholar Clement.

“After I master this, I’ll memorize a few dozen more books. There shouldn’t be any problems!” Eli memorized the unique heralds one by one as he flipped through the study of the Empire’s history.

He didn’t know how difficult the test would be, so he could only try his best.

Time passed by slowly.

Eli was immersed in his book and had completely lost track of time.

...

“Eh, there’s still someone here?!”

Clement returned to the library with the books in his arms.

As a scholar, he also had to take care of some noble inquiries, which was why he had gone out just now. As soon as he finished his work and returned, he saw that the reading room, which was supposed to be closed, was still lit.

“It must be some careless brat who forgot to turn off the lights.” Scholar Clement frowned.

He put the tidied books aside and walked towards the reading room. He saw Eli, who was still reading with his head lowered.

“It’s that kid from earlier today.” Seeing the unfamiliar figures inside, scholar Clement thought of something.

‘Wasn’t this the kid who had asked him what he should study for the exam?

‘What is he doing? He’s reading!

‘I did say that I would allow them to stay and read.

‘But ... You call this reading?’ The corners of scholar Clement’s mouth twitched as he watched Eli quickly flip through the book.

That speed was simply outrageous.

This was complete nonsense!

“Eli, What are you doing?” As a veteran scholar, scholar Clement could no longer tolerate Elie’s blasphemy of knowledge and angrily shouted.

Upon hearing the voice, Eli looked up and saw the Furious scholar Clement.

Eli was a little confused, but looking at the slowly approaching scholar Clement, he said with uncertainty, ” I’m reading a book ... Is there a problem? ”

“Reading books? You call that reading?” Scholar Clement’s mouth twitched.

A page per second, you call that reading?

“I’ve already been observing you for half a minute. During this time, I’ve seen you flipping through your books aimlessly. Eli, I thought you were a good kid, but you’ve disappointed me.” Scholar Clement shook his head, looking at Elil with a disappointed expression.

Not expecting such a thing to happen, Eli immediately said, “scholar Clement, I was really reading. I’ve read the first few pages, so I quickly flipped through them again.”

He had no choice. He couldn’t possibly say that he had the Quick Memory spell.

“Are you telling me that you’ve memorized everything?” Scholar Clement also realized that he was a little agitated, but he still asked, “I don’t believe that!”

“I do,” Eli replied.

“You do?” Clement felt his anger igniting. He stared at Eli and said, ” alright, let me test you. If you can’t answer, you don’t need to take the test.

“let me ask you, how many Baron territories are there in the Empire, ” Scholar Clement asked a question that he thought was very cunning. After all, who would remember the number of barons?

“Two thousand two hundred and twenty-one.” Eli blurted out.

Clement was speechless.

He took the book to check. It was really 2221.

‘Coincidence, it must be a coincidence.’

Ten minutes later.

Clement stood in place with a dazed expression.
