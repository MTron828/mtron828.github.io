469 The Truth, Nero’s Fury

Plan!

Thank you readers!

This was the most terrifying thing he knew from Tuman’s memories, and it was also the origin of everything. It was about Nero.

And this had to start with Nero’s disappearance more than 500 years ago.

500 years ago, the Abyss had undergone a change, and a large number of demons had invaded. As the ruler of the Heart of the Abyss, Nero was naturally duty-bound. At that time, he had killed countless demons as a half-step fifth-circle demon. In order to find the reason, he had even entered the Abyss.

Then, he disappeared.

Three years later, when everyone thought he was dead, he walked out of the abyss.

No one knew what Nero had encountered in the past three years.

However, Tuman was the first to find out.

Nero was pulled into the abyss, and his soul was devoured by the fifth circle Demon Lord. Tuman knew that the reason was very simple. He was also enslaved by the Demon Lord and had been branded. He had even been bestowed with greater power.

Previously, he was just an ordinary peak fourth-circle warlock. After the modification, he had become a half-step fifth-circle warlock!

Their plan was very simple. They would use at least half of the population of the Western Regions as blood sacrifices to trigger the curse and completely release the demons sealed in the Abyss!

Eli’s throat moved slightly!

According to Tuman’s memories, there were many fifth-circle demons in the Abyss, and there were even more powerful existences within. With the current power of the warlock World, once it was detonated, the entire world might fall into darkness!

“And I will lose everything. I won’t even have the environment to start over again. Because at that time, the weak Warlocks in the current world might not be able to suppress them….”

Eli’s gaze gradually turned serious. He would never allow this!

“It seems that this war is unavoidable. Moreover, we might be able to inform the other factions!” Eli was deep in thought, but he wasn’t actually panicking!

This was because even if Nero was actually an Abyss Demon Lord, it was only his spirit that had taken over a human body. Demonic Nero was only a half-step fifth circle!

Fortunately, he had discovered it early, and Nero did not know that he had been discovered.

So now, the enemy was in the open, and he was in the dark!

Most importantly, because of Eli, he had obstructed Nero’s plans many times, causing his plans to be in a half-finished state. There was still some time!

“I have to destroy the Abyss Heart first…No, who knows what other tricks a fifth-circle demon has? I definitely can’t treat it as a half-step fifth-circle demon. Therefore, it’s best to let others take action first. Then, I’ll do something. It’s best to let others help me investigate!”

Eli stood up straight and looked at the two corpses with a deep gaze!

“I have to inform the other factions immediately. Nikola, you go.” Eli looked at Nikola and was about to instruct him to inform the other forces when he waved his hand!

“Sir, why should I go?” Nikola asked.

From the beginning, he had noticed that there was something wrong with Eli’s expression. Now, this feeling was even stronger!

“No, wait!” Eli suddenly waved his hand and gave up on this idea!

To deal with such an enemy, one had to end everything with a thunderous method. There was only one chance, so this method could not be used. Otherwise, Nero might run away directly, which would be even more troublesome.

He absolutely could not alert the enemy!

After all, if they were to make a move, Nero would definitely know who the mastermind was. It would be very troublesome if he escaped!

” Moreover, Nero is under my misdirection, so he will definitely be fine for the time being. Also, their progress is already slow, so I still have at least a few decades to develop. During this period of time, whether it’s the success of the celestial Bloodline Body or the advancement to half-step fifth circle, I have absolute confidence that Nero won’t have any chance to get rid of Bloodline Tower in one go. I can even add some trouble to them!” Eli quickly came up with a plan, so he looked at Nikola again.

“Sir, what orders do you have?” Nikola immediately lowered his head.

“Pass down my order. Increase the manpower of the Law Laboratory and the Bloodline Laboratory by 20,000 people. As long as anyone has a key discovery, they will be rewarded, whether it is a fourth-circle high-rank bloodline or wealth.

“Then, you will secretly form a team and monitor every move of the Heart of the Abyss!” Eli said.

“Yes, sir!”

Nikola was shocked.

What kind of mental planning did his lord go through in his heart for such a big move?

20,000 people, the investment of so many people was not a small number. It almost emptied the Bloodline Tower’s reserves. Moreover, the knowledge invested in the two experiments showed determination of Eli!

It felt like he was staking everything on one bet!

However, as one of Eli’s trusted aides, he didn’t ask and just nodded!

“Keep this secret!” Eli patted Nikola’s shoulder and said.

He trusted Nikola very much, which stemmed from thousands of years of loyalty!

Soon, Nikola left, and Eli walked into the laboratory and immersed himself in his research!

A storm was coming!

..

The Heart of the Abyss.

In the Mage Tower.

A sound of gnashing teeth could be heard.

“Damned Black Mandala!” Nero’s eyes seemed to be burning with anger, and his eyes were still flickering with what he had just seen.

In the middle of a forest, a group of Warlocks with black Mandala Flowers surrounded Tuman and Lous and killed them.

Nero could not understand how they had offended this faction. This shouldn’t be the case. They didn’t have much interaction with this faction. They even felt safe and didn’t communicate with them!

Of course, this was obviously not done by the Western Regions because no one had the financial resources and strength to do so. But how could it be done by the Warlocks of the Central Region? What was their plot?

“Could it be the Warlock Union? They wanted me to join them, but I never agreed!” Nero frowned, but he was even angrier. Be it Tuman or Lous, they were both products that he had modified for a long time. They were not casually created!

“But I’m very sure that the old rules have long disappeared. These greedy Warlock Union have long been eyeing the resources of the Western Region and even the Abyss itself. There’s a high chance that they did it. These people are really annoying.”

Nero angrily knocked on the table, and it instantly shattered into pieces!

“Men!”

Nero shouted!

A Warlock walked in with bloodshot eyes!

“Destroy all the known Warlock Alliance strongholds in the western region and the Death Mandala’s strongholds secretly. These people have gone too far this time.”

Nero gritted his teeth.

“Yes, sir!”

“Also, pass down my order. I have two chances to break through to half-step fifth-circle warlocks. Let’s see which two of our members are willing!” He stopped the Warlock and said.

“Yes, sir!”

Only after the Warlock left did Nero lie back down on his chair.

However, looking at the mess in front of him, he closed his eyes helplessly.

It was that dog again!

He was lucky this time. It was better for him to take his head in the future personally!
