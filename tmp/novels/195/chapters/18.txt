Chapter 19: Moore Manor

Translator: Lonelytree

Moore Manor was a large Manor in the West of Jun Lin city, and it belonged to the Gimori family. It was mainly used for feasts, hunting, and planting some precious crops. It was a gift from the king to the Gimori family.

And today was the day of the banquet held by the Gimori family.

Eli and Herman took the rented carriage and quickly headed toward the manor.

The carriage was fast, and they soon arrived at their destination.

“What a great Manor!”

As soon as they got out of the car, Herman looked at the manor and exclaimed.

Eli also got off the carriage and looked towards the manor.

The first thing that came into view was a castle-like building built with black stone bricks. On both sides were two smaller attics, and on top of them were dark green vines.

The road in front of him was also paved with stone bricks. It was flat and clean, giving him a good feeling.

On the other hand, Eli was relatively calm. After all, he had seen magnificent buildings that were hundreds of meters tall in his previous life, as well as all kinds of buildings. Although the castle in front of him was not bad, it was not enough to cause him to have a huge reaction.

Herman, who was standing at the side, glanced at Eli and saw his calm reaction. He sighed in his heart and thought, ‘Eli is just a commoner, but he’s so calm.’ he immediately felt ashamed.

He was actually inferior to a commoner.

“Eli!”

Suddenly, a shout came from not far away.

The two of them saw Rias walking over from not far away.

She was wearing a light purple dress and light makeup, but with her beautiful face and figure, as well as her purple eyes, she looked like a violet flower that had just bloomed.

Eli’s eyes lit up. He liked beautiful things.

Herman’s mouth was wide open as if he didn’t expect Rias to be so beautiful.

“Rias, you’re beautiful today!” As Rias walked over, Herman was not stingy with his praise.

“Thank you!” Rias nodded, but she still looked at Eli.

“Rias, you’re much more beautiful today than you were before, ” said Eli.

“Was I not beautiful before?” Rias revealed a sly smile and looked at Eli.

“uh, of course not. It’s just that you’re even more beautiful today.” Eli smiled in response.

“hehe, I’ll stop teasing you. Let’s go. The banquet is about to start.” Rias smiled and led the two of them toward the castle.

“Banquet? Aren’t we hunting?” Eli asked directly, having some doubts.

Looking at Eli’s puzzled expression, Rias smiled and said, ” the hunting will be after the banquet. After all, everyone needs to rest first.”

Elie nodded and did not say anything else.

This was the first time he was attending Noble’s banquet, and Herman was not as lively as he usual as he followed Eli.

Rias led them into the castle and into the banquet hall.

As soon as he entered, a loud noise entered his ears.

There were already many people here. Most of them were dressed in gorgeous clothes with the coat of arms of the nobles on their chests. They were gathered in twos and threes and seemed to be members of the noble family.

With just a glance, Eli memorized every one. To be more precise, he memorized everyone’s coat of arms. The Alina family, the Sovia family, and the Alexander family were all famous families in the Empire.

Of course, there were also some small nobles and a few civilians, but on the whole, this was a banquet for nobles.

Many people turned to look at her when Rias entered.

They were surprised to see that Rias had brought two civilians in. As the Herman family was small, many people did not know him and treated him as a civilian.

In the corner of the banquet hall, two men and one woman looked over and frowned.

The three of them seemed to have been standing together and chatting. They were all dressed in gorgeous clothes and seemed to have high status. Not many people dared to get close to them.

And that was the truth.

Alex was from the hereditary Marquis Alina family.

Alice was from the hereditary count Sovia family.

Klein was from the Alexander family, a hereditary count.

When Klein saw Eli, he raised an eyebrow. “A commoner? Rias actually took the initiative to invite a commoner. Do any of you know him?”

“I don’t.” The other two also shook their heads. They didn’t know him.

“Um, but I remember that she joined the library. Maybe they met in the library. Maybe he’s a student of the same teacher? ” Alice seemed to have remembered something and said.

“Is that so?” Alex nodded. He had the highest status among the three of them.

“I think so, but Rias actually invited a commoner without telling us. I wouldn’t have come if I had known.” Klein frowned and said unhappily.

Klein didn’t look old, about twenty years old, and he looked at Eli with disgust.

Not every noble could accept a commoner sharing a room.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Alex, on the other hand, didn’t seem to have much of a reaction. He didn’t pay attention to Klein’s words, and he walked toward Rias.

“Alright, big brother Alex.” Alice laughed.

Klein was a little unhappy, but he didn’t say anything and followed.

“Rias, you’re getting more and more beautiful!” Alex said loudly as he strode over.

“Big brother Alex, long time no see.” Rias smiled when she saw the man.

Meanwhile, Eli followed behind her, looking at the others calmly.

From the coat of arms they wore, Eli knew which family they were from, but the only thing that caught his attention was the two men. The one in the middle, called Alex, was probably an advanced Knight, and the one beside him, who had an unhappy expression, was an intermediate Knight.

“let me introduce you. This is a student of the library’s scholar Clement, Eli. He’s very well-versed in heraldry and history. This is Herman, also a student of scholar Clement.” They exchanged a few pleasantries, and then as if remembering something, she turned around and introduced Eli and Herman to the three of them.

“Scholar Clement?” Upon hearing the introduction, Alex glanced at Eli with interest.

He knew of scholar Clement because his family had consulted him many times. His father even knew him. He was a very low-key but high-ranked Scholar in the Library.

“Oh, so you’re a student of scholar Clement. I’ve admired the scholar for a long time!” Alex smiled at Eli and Herman.

Herman was flattered and he thanked him immediately.

“Thank you!” On the other hand, Eli was relatively calm as he nodded.

He knew that Alex’s kindness wasn’t directed at him but at his teacher.

“So you’re a learner?” The nearby Alice also understood.

Although the people in the library were also commoners, they were still of a higher class than commoners.

“He’s just a student of a scholar.” Klein still didn’t care, and he didn’t look straight at Eli.

“This is Alex, Alice, and Klein.” Leah then introduced the three to Eli.

After the introduction, they separated again.

“I’m sorry for Klein,” After they left, Rias apologized to Eli. She could see that Klein didn’t like Eli. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“it’s alright. After all, not everyone is as friendly as you, Rias.” Eli said with a smile.

Klein wasn’t annoying enough to do anything to him, and a noble who couldn’t even hide his emotions was probably just average.

“You’re so glib.” Rias covered her mouth and laughed, then returned to normal and said, “You guys can walk around first. I still have some things to deal with.”

“Alright,” he said. Eli nodded.

Then, she left and began to direct the party. This was a skill that a noble lady should have.

As for Eli, of course, he was going to taste the food.
