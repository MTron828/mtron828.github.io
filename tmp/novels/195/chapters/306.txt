307 Poignancy

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, Eli’s mental power had already reached 468 points, slightly more than he had expected. This had something to do with Eli’s talent in increasing his mental power.

He was no longer a wizard with trash talent. With his own hard work, he could be called a genius even in the mage World.

Of course, other than his mental energy, Eli’s other preparations were almost complete.

He had made potions from the Comoros fruits, and he had finished preparing the other supplementary potions. The only thing he needed was the spirit power crystal and higher mental power.

The latter was waiting for the time while the bloodline tower was collecting the former.

..

West Coast.

Mount Sofia.

Eli floated in the sky, his eyes calm as he looked down at the long mountain range.

“Almost all the soul slaves are gathered here!”

Ever since the last ten years, Eli had been ordering the soul magic beasts that had been scattered all over the West Coast to gather here. Now that ten years had passed, tens of thousands of magic beasts had gathered here.

He only had one purpose for coming here today, and that was the soul crystal.

Stretching his body, a wave of soul fluctuation began to spread out in all directions, with him as the center, summoning the magical beasts in the Sofia mountain range.

Following his summoning.

The entire mountain range gradually began to emit some soft responses, followed by the roars of countless magical beasts. They gathered together, like a magical beast riot, rising and falling in the mountain range one after another.

This was just the beginning. After the shout, in Eli’s vision, he could see that countless magical beasts were starting to gather here. Between the mountains that stretched out on the ground, streams of water were surging toward this place. It was the same for the sky as well. Large groups of winged beasts covered the sun.

Hundreds of years ago, there were already 40000 to 50000 of them. Now, there were even more than before.

Even Eli couldn’t help but feel shocked at this scene.

The riot lasted for half an hour.

Half an hour later, Eli looked at the mountain range. There were all sorts of magical beasts within a radius of a few dozen miles. They were densely packed together, and they were scattered on the ground like sesame seeds.

He didn’t know if this was enough!

At this moment, the magical beasts were all looking up, waiting for Eli’s orders.

They were also very curious as to why Eli was summoning them!

In fact, it had been a hundred years since Eli had cared about them. He had only restricted them from entering the Warlock’s territory at will, so some magical beasts had even almost forgotten that they had a soul brand.

Tens of thousands of eyes were on him. He smiled, then extended his hand.

It slowly closed.

At that moment, all the demonic beasts felt their hearts throb.

Eli wanted them dead!

No!

Countless rejections turned into a torrent. The eyes of the magical beasts at the edge were filled with madness as they ran into the distance. Fear had made them lose their will. They did not understand why Eli was doing this.

The magic beasts that were quickest to react were the third-circle magic beasts.

All of them roared.

The slave mark that originated from their spirit told them that Eli did want their lives, and gathering them together was just for the convenience of killing.

The power of the third circle had given them a basic level of intelligence, and they understood that they had to kill Eli to have a glimmer of hope. In an instant, nearly a hundred third circle beasts charged toward him.

In the sky, on the ground, in all directions. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They stretched out their sharp claws and fangs, approaching Eli and surrounding him.

“the mark on the soul is an unsurpassable shackle. It’s a pity that they’re a group of living beings who can’t even control themselves.” Eli just looked at them and said pitifully.

The next second, he closed his outstretched hand.

At the same time, the bloodlines and even imprints of countless magical beasts were instantly activated.

Like ripples, the magical beasts’ souls were instantly shattered, and they didn’t even have the chance to resist. The magical beasts in the sky fell together, drawing a path in the air.

Meanwhile, the magical beasts that were charging toward Eli fell like rain.

This was the power of a mage over the soul slave. They had complete control over their life and death.

As he watched tens of thousands of lives slip by in an instant before him, his gaze remained calm, but there was now a hint of enlightenment toward life and his understanding of fate.

If he couldn’t control his own life, he would be controlled by others like these magical beasts. How sad would that be?

This was also the reason why Eli kept moving forward.

To control his own fate, he always chose to be more stable. After all, he only had one life.

“what am I thinking about? let’s just condense a soul crystal.” Eli shook his head.

He took out a few crystals from his space ring and threw them in all directions. He threw them accurately at the boundary where the magical beasts died, and then there were beams of light.

It was a spell formation with a large area.

Seeing the spell formation light up, Eli’s eyes gradually turned silver-white.

A pitch-black vortex slowly appeared in the sky. On the ground, the soul fragments of the magic beasts appeared and began to gather in the sky.

The soul fragments were a faint light blue, so it was as if an orchid rain was falling from the ground within a radius of dozens of miles. The vortex in the sky was black, and it looked extremely dreamy.

“What a beautiful scene! I’m sorry,” Eli sighed.

...

Although the scenery was beautiful, he did not forget how it was built. It was created by the broken souls and lives of tens of thousands of dead, magical beasts.

As the soul crystals gathered, another soul crystal began to form in the sky. Although there was only one, it exuded a huge wave of soul aura. It was far more than ordinary third-circle soul crystals.

This was also what Eli needed.

What he needed was a high-grade soul crystal.

Eli killed a few hundred third circle beasts and endless second and first circle beasts to make this crystal.

Very quickly, an hour had passed.

The crystal in the sky had also reached its final stage. Its aura had already reached the peak of third circle, but it still hadn’t condensed.

“I’m lacking a half-step celestial soul core!” Eli quickly determined that he was missing a core to anchor the souls. But this made him worried. Where could he find a half-step celestial?

But at this moment, he seemed to have sensed something.

He looked in one direction.

In the distant sky, a figure was flying over quickly.

...

It exuded the aura of a half-step celestial and was terrifying.

It was a middle-aged Magus. He looked a little old, and his skin was stuck to his bones. He was wearing a gray-black Magus robe with a bloody mark on it.

As for this wizard robe, if Eli remembered correctly, it should be the recently rising wandering Alliance.

But why would he appear here?

Wandering Alliance should be quite far from here.

But was that important? This was not important.

A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

The Warlock in the distance had a sinister smile on his face as he shouted, “Hand over that spirit crystal!”

Oh, did he come to steal my crystal?

Realization dawned on Eli.

He felt even less guilty about what he was going to do next.
