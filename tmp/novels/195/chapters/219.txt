220 Trap

“The battle between Vivika and Kloss has begun!”

The bloodline tower and black isotta were two major forces in the central continent, and they weren’t the only ones paying attention to the war. The other major forces in the central continent were also paying attention to it.

At this time, outside the battlefield, it was unknown how many so warlocks from other forces were watching. Romeo was also among them.

As a second circle warlock from the unicorn Academy, one of the major forces in the central continent, he was also sent here to investigate. He was currently hiding on a mountain peak, watching the battle from afar.

!!

“It’s finally starting!”

He looked into the distance and seemed to sense the aura of third-circle. He immediately took out an alchemy telescope and put it on his eyes, observing the battle.

Within his line of sight.

In the middle of the battlefield, two figures were suspended in mid-air.

One was Vivika, and the other was Kloss.

Vivika’s long hair was fluttering in the wind, and her arms were wrapped in wind elemental imprints. There seemed to be a storm gathering in her eyes, and countless storms were gathering around her.

Kloss had black hair, but at this time his skin was already red, and a thin layer of flame covered his body, at the same time emitting a terrifying heat. From Romeo’s line of sight, he could see the surrounding air rippling.

Romeo pursed his lips, had the final moment finally come?

He just didn’t know how much time Kloss would need to deal with Vivika.

Ten minutes?

..

“You’re very brave. I even thought that you would run away in advance.”

In the air, Kloss looked at Vivika and said with a faint smile.

“Hmph, if you leave today, our bloodline tower can pretend that nothing happened!” Vivika replied, her calm face showing no fear.

“You’re brave!” Kloss revealed a smile.

The next second, he stretched out his right hand, and a flame instantly flew towards Vivika.

The flames streaked across the sky, leaving behind a scorching trail. Vivika immediately waved her staff, and a wall of wind appeared in an instant, trying to block the flames.

The flames were obviously much stronger than the wind wall. The flames directly broke through the wind wall and flew straight towards Vivika. Due to the wind, the flames were even bigger.

However, Vivika had fused with a wind elemental spirit that specialized in speed. Her speed was very strong even among the third circle, and she managed to dodge the flames in time.

The flames swept past Vivika and flew toward the battlefield.

She turned her head and saw that the area where the flames fell was the bloodline tower’s residential area. The fireball killed many people. Vivika turned her head and looked at Kloss, gritting her teeth. “Sneak attack, despicable!”

“hehe, I didn’t hit you. It’s a pity.” Kloss pursed his lips and did not listen to Vivika’s nonsense. He activated his bloodline and more flames flew toward Vivika.

Seeing the flames, Vivika’s bloodline was also activated, and her hair fluttered in the air.

Four tornadoes slowly appeared around Vivika, blocking the attacks like four walls. From time to time, they would send wind blades at Kloss.

In the face of the wind blades, Kloss only laughed in disdain. Clouds of fire flew around him and blocked them one by one.

Black Isotta and the bloodline tower’s highest combat power finally erupted in battle.

Other than the people outside the battlefield, the people on the battlefield also looked up at the sky from time to time to observe the situation. During this process, the atmosphere in the bloodline tower became more and more serious, while black isotta’s fighting spirit was high.

The main thing was that everyone could clearly see that after only a few minutes of fighting, Vivika had been completely suppressed by Kloss, and she was almost unable to make a reasonable counterattack.

Everyone thought that Vivika’s failure was only a matter of time.

“It’s over, lady Vivika is no match for him!”

“Kloss is too strong!”

“The war is almost over!”

The bloodline tower’s side felt a wave of sorrow. After experiencing the joy of suppressing black Isotta, it was finally their turn. However, this time, they didn’t seem to have any hope of turning the tables.

“Haha, Vivika, you don’t seem to be good enough!” In the sky, Kloss laughed loudly and attacked Vivika.

Vivika dodged left and right in the attack, and it was obvious that she was having more and more difficulty. At this time, her leather cloak had been damaged, and her leather armor was also damaged in many places. Her breath was also becoming more and more unstable.

“No, I can’t fight at all!” Vivika gritted her teeth.

Kloss was stronger than she had thought. She definitely wouldn’t be able to last long under such a strong attack, but did she really have to go to the place Nikola had mentioned?

As time passed, Vivika dodged another ball of fire and took a deep breath. She knew that she had to make a decision soon.

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, countless flame Spears formed in front of Kloss and instantly flew toward Vivika like a storm. The surrounding temperature also rose by more than ten degrees!

To Kloss’ surprise, Vivika did not dodge this time.

She took a deep breath, and in an instant, countless storms gushed out of her body. Then, a huge wind hand appeared and blocked all the flame Spears.

“Are you going to counterattack?” Kloss smiled. At this moment, Vivika was already in her final stage, but the next second, his smile froze.

After blocking the attack, Vivika didn’t attack. Instead, a pair of wings of wind spread out behind her and she flew away from the battlefield.

“Do you want to run?”

After being stunned for a second, Kloss smiled. A trail of flames streaked across the sky as he chased after Vivika. He had to kill Vivika today.

“She ran away!”

The bloodline tower wasn’t the only one who was stunned. Even the observers on the outside were stunned.

Seeing the two of them leave, the bloodline tower’s aura instantly fell to the bottom. They felt a wave of despair. Even the third-circle tower master had run away. What else could they do?

“hang in there! The tower master hasn’t left. She’s just changing the battlefield!” At this time, an upper echelon of the bloodline tower shouted loudly, comforting everyone.

...

“Indeed, the tower plan is only going to change to a more suitable place for battle!” The other higher-ups also reacted and shouted, causing the bloodline tower’s morale to rise.

But only they knew that they didn’t have such a plan. There was a high chance that lady Vivika couldn’t hold on any longer. Everyone smiled bitterly.

The others were also in despair.

“Hey, it’s over!”

At this time, Romeo stood up in the distance and patted the dust off his body.

In his opinion, the battle was over, and the escaped Vivika wouldn’t be able to run far. He just had to wait for Kloss to finish and return to clean up the bloodline tower.

“Victory to black Isotta!”

He took out a crystal ball and sent a message back to the force he belonged to. Then, he prepared to leave after a short rest.

At this moment, most of the people who were hiding around started to leave quickly. No one felt that there would be any turning point. If Vivika really had a trump card, she would have used it long ago. Why would she wait until now?

Looking at the crowd leaving, Romeo also sighed.

Another force from the West Coast was gone, and there was less competition now.

...

..

The warlocks on the battlefield had their own thoughts, and Vivika was still escaping.

She turned around and saw that Kloss had a sinister smile on his face. She turned up her face with fear, which made Kloss even more proud. However, when she turned around, the fear on her face disappeared bit by bit and turned into calmness.

“I hope Nikola and his master won’t let me down!”

Vivika no longer hesitated. She sped up, and her breath seemed to be unstable. She flew towards the agreed location, with Kloss in hot pursuit.

Ten kilometers was not a long distance for mortals, not to mention for the great sorcerers of the third circle. In just a few minutes, the promised valley appeared in Vivika’s sight.

“Is this the place?”

Vivika pursed her lips and flew into the valley without hesitation.

“A Valley?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Two kilometers away, locks frowned as he watched Vivika enter the valley.

“Why did Vivika choose to enter this place? Is there an ambush?”

He was a little hesitant about going in directly, but all his worries disappeared without a trace after a simple thought. He had spies in the bloodline tower, and he knew that although Vivika had been hiding in the bloodline tower, she had never left the base.

The other forces were all competitors and wouldn’t help Vivika, so there was a high probability that she had come here by chance. Besides, he was a middle-stage third-circle warlock, so there was nothing to be afraid of!

He didn’t hesitate and quickly followed Vivika.

He flew into the valley like a flaming meteor.
