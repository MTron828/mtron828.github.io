345 Departure

Soon, the news of the bloodline tower forming a team to the central continent spread out, and the news of Eli, Nikola, and Hydra’s departure also spread.

The bloodline tower was in an uproar.

After all, three of the four true celestials were leaving at once. This would have a huge impact on the entire force. Fortunately, Kriman was still here.

Many warlocks came over to persuade Eli overnight, but they were all sternly rejected.

!!

“It is our responsibility to support the main tower!” That statement made many people speechless.

Although many people didn’t agree, no one dared to say anything when the celestials agreed. The team recruitment soon began.

The gathering process was much faster than expected, and the warlocks’ enthusiasm for this was beyond everyone’s imagination. However, it seemed easy to understand. After all, they were going to the central continent, the center of the world.

In just five days, the team had been assembled.

…..

The gathering of the team was only one aspect. Considering that the situation at the main tower might not be good, Eli also ordered them to take a lot of resources.

Magic stones were the most abundant resource. After all, even in the central continent, magic stones were one of the basic currencies.

Of course, early planning was also necessary. Whether it was the way to the central continent or how to act when the time came, they all needed to think ahead.

In response, Eli invited Alida again.

“My Lord, may I know what you need from me this time?” Alida was as humble as ever.

“Relax.” After consoling this little Warlock from the central continent, Eli smiled and said, ” we’re still not very clear about the situation in the central continent. We need to do some preliminary planning, and we might need you for that.”

“Of course, it would be my honor.” Alida immediately agreed.

Ever since she learned about the situation in this branch, she had been nervous because she couldn’t think of any reason why they would support the main tower.

In terms of power, the branch tower had already surpassed the main tower. In terms of numbers, the West Coast was not small either, only one-third less than the main tower.

So, she took the opportunity to ask her question.

“my Lord, the bloodline tower’s branch is already very powerful. Why did you agree to my request so easily? ” Alida asked.

This time, Eli didn’t brush her off. He smiled and said, ” because the West Coast is still too small. It’s so small that I am already at its peak. It’s so small that it can no longer carry on my path.”

Alida nodded, not fully understanding. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It didn’t matter if she knew about Eli or not. What was important was her knowledge of the central continent.

As it turned out, she knew a lot about the basics. They soon planned out a path.

Starting from Holmes city, which was at the edge of the Western Region, they needed to cross several neutral forces and several uninhabited areas to enter the bloodline tower in the center of the Central Western Region.

“Very good, then it’s arranged like this. I may have to trouble you to be the guide when the time comes. thank you, ” Eli said to her with a smile.

“It’s no trouble at all. This is what I should do.” Alida quickly nodded, her impression of the easy-going Eli growing.

Celestials were all high and mighty, but Eli was able to treat her, a mere second-circle warlock, with such an attitude.

But how could she know?

In Eli’s heart, as long as one’s strength did not exceed his, it did not matter if they had one or four circles. They would die sooner or later.

…

In the blink of an eye, a month passed.

At this moment, almost all the warlocks were ready.

In the square in the center of the bloodline tower, a huge gathering was starting.

A few acres of the square had been cleared, and a seven or eight-meter-high platform stood on it. Eli and Nikola were standing on it.

Below them were all the people who were preparing to head to the central continent. There were several hundred of them, and all of them had anticipation on their faces, and their eyes were bright.

To them, going to the central continent was undoubtedly a huge opportunity. After all, the central continent was once the center of the world. Even though it had declined a lot, it was still far more powerful than the West Coast.

“the central continent must be very prosperous. The bloodline tower must be even more powerful.” A Warlock in the crowd muttered.

“Isn’t that obvious? That’s the central continent we’re talking about. I hope they’ll pay us some attention and not look down on us.” The Warlock said in agreement.

“But with the Lords around, there shouldn’t be any problems.” Although the other Warlock was worried, he also believed in Eli and the others.

However, someone not far away from them was twitching her mouth.

She was Alida.

As she listened to these people’s words, she really wanted to grab their necks and tell them, ‘I’m sorry, the bloodline tower isn’t as strong as you think.’

But Alida couldn’t say it. She just looked at Eli on the stage and cried silently in her heart.

Alida was feeling sad, but a dog beside her was barking.

Doggo, who looked no different from an ordinary dog, looked at Eli in the stands and almost cried in his heart.

The day he had been waiting for had finally come.

It had been almost 1500 years.

Do you know how he’s been living all these years? In the beginning, he looked forward to it every day. Later on, he looked forward to it every few years. In the end, it became a few years, a few decades, and a few centuries.

He realized that Eli really had no sense of time.

It had been more than a thousand years, but back then, Eli had told him that it would be soon.

There were already dozens of generations in the mortal world. Even in the Warlock world, more than a dozen generations had passed.

“But all of this is finally coming to an end.” Doggo’s mechanical eyes were filled with joy.

At this moment, on the high platform, Eli looked at Doggo, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

...

In fact, it wasn’t just him. In the secret realm, Hill was also shaking his branches happily.

The two poor children!

However, Eli didn’t forget his identity. He stood up straight and looked down.

The next second, the power of celestial covered the entire area, and no one spoke.

“Everyone, ” Eli looked at everyone and said, ” I’m the tower master of the bloodline tower on the West Coast, Eli. I’m very happy that everyone can participate in this operation to support the main tower.

“However, I have to say this in advance. After leaving this time, there’s a high chance that you won’t be able to come back. If there’s anyone else who wants to leave, it’s not too late!”

Eli looked at the crowd, but no one spoke.

“Very good, it seems that everyone is very determined.” Eli nodded.

“If that’s the case, we’ll set off in three days. We’ll meet here again.

“Everyone, enjoy your last three days on the West Coast.”

It was a simple announcement, to begin with, and Eli didn’t want to complicate it.

...

After the announcement, Eli left, and so did the many warlocks, bidding their final farewells to those they knew.

…..

Three days later.

It was still at the square.

However, apart from the numerous warlocks, there were also three huge airships. Each of them was over a hundred meters long and had a silver appearance. They looked very high-tech and could carry more than 500 people.

None of them had expected the bloodline tower to have such transportation in stock. They were all very surprised.

In front of the airship, Alida was also dumbfounded.

She had thought that they were going to ride on flying magic beasts, but the branch actually had such a large airship.

If she had not read about it in a book, she might not have recognized it.

Alida was dumbfounded.

After more than 1000 years of deterioration, there were almost no airships on the central continent. Everyone used magical beasts. However, a remote place like the West Coast actually had airships. This made her feel confused again.

What was wrong with the whole world? Anyway, she felt like she was crazy again.

“Alida, let’s go up and have a cup of tea together. The next journey will be a few months.” A hand was placed on her shoulder. She turned around and saw that it was Eli.

At this moment, Eli had changed into a black Sorcerer’s robe, and there seemed to be leather armor under it. In his hand was still the spiral staff, and he was wearing two beautiful earrings. A small snake was sleeping on his shoulder.

“Thank you, my Lord.” Alida nodded.

Alida and Eli entered the airship.

The others quickly entered as well.

Soon, everyone entered.

With a wave of elemental fluctuations, the airship slowly flew into the sky and then slowly flew into the distance. Its speed was slower than the normal speed of the third circle creature.

Kriman was watching this scene from the top of the bloodline tower.

Now that Eli had left, he would be in charge of guarding this place.

Not to mention growth, at least when Eli returned, there couldn’t be too much change.

“I hope you have a safe journey, my Lord.”

Kriman quietly returned to the Mage Tower.
