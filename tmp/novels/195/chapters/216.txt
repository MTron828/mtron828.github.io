217 Kloss’ Confusion

“What’s going on?”

In the distant black Isotta, in a quiet room, Kloss was deep in thought.

Mason had disappeared from the house of the undead!

He had added his own soul aura to Mason’s identity token. A few days ago, he felt that the identity token had suddenly broken. Then he connected to it from a distance and saw Nikola, but he did not see Mason.

Did Nikola kill Mason?

This was unlikely. After all, it was too unbelievable. Although Mason had just advanced, he was at third-circle, and his bloodline was the Earth Dragon bloodline, which was good at defense. He couldn’t have died so easily.

If he didn’t die, where did he go?

“That’s strange.” Kloss touched his chin and asked, “Nikola is also very abnormal. He should not be alive. It seems that I will have to go to the house of the undead.”

Kloss stood up. Although he couldn’t contact Mason all of a sudden, and he might even be dead, he didn’t worry too much.

As a third-circle middle-stage Warlock, Kloss was considered one of the top fighters on the West Coast. Even if he was in danger, he could run away. He didn’t believe that anyone could kill him in an instant.

So, he decided to take care of the bloodline tower and go to the South. The war with the bloodline tower was in its final stage, and everything would be over as long as he killed Vivika.

“Hmph, I saw it with my own eyes that old geezer Natasha obtained a mechanical key from the ruins of the house of mechanics, a subsidiary force of Sky City.” A hint of darkness flashed in locks ‘eyes.

There was no such thing as a war for no reason, and he would not do anything that would not benefit him.

However, this was a matter of great importance. Even if there were the slightest possibility, he would not give up.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!”

The door opened slowly, and a man in a gray Warlock robe walked out. He said to Kloss respectfully, “Milord, the bloodline tower’s exterior has been cleaned up. Our men have already entered the bloodline’s core area. We only need five or six days to reach the core area. Should we speed up, Milord?”

“There’s no need. We’ll just have to fight steadily.” Kloss replied, shaking his head.

“Yes!”

The Warlock left quickly while Kloss walked to the window.

Outside the window, a few thousand warlocks had already gathered. Each of them was fully armed and ready to set off at any time. Further away, dozens of venom Wyverns were already ready to go. They carried a large number of warlocks and were currently leaving in batches.

The war had entered its final stage.

..

On the other side.

Eli and Nikola headed north after leaving the territory of The House of the Dead.

The two of them arrived at the bloodline Tower three days later.

“It doesn’t look good!”

On the peak of a mountain, Eli stood in front while Nikola stood at the side. They looked down the mountain and could vaguely see a large number of warlocks gathering outside the bloodline tower’s range. Many magical beasts were emitting a bloodthirsty aura.

After passing through these, he could see the bloodline tower further away.

A large number of buildings stood in great numbers, and one of the tall blood-red sorcerer towers was particularly eye-catching. Even though they were almost ten kilometers away, Eli could still see it. And if he was not wrong, Vivika was in that direction.

“Milord, what should we do?” Looking at the bloodline tower that was now surrounded, Nikola pursed his lips and turned to look at Eli.

Eli did not expect the situation to be so serious. It seemed that such an ” easy ” mission could only be handed over to his loyal subordinates, so his face slowly turned serious, and he looked at Nikola.

Nikola’s heart skipped a beat, and he had a bad guess.

As expected, he saw Eli looking at him and saying in a serious tone, “Nikola, I’ll leave the task of sneaking in to see Vivika to you. I’ll go nearby to see if there’s a suitable place to set up the battlefield. This task is very important, and I don’t feel at ease leaving it to others. I believe you can complete the task successfully.”

Nikola, “…”

He was crying in his heart. He knew it. Eli made it sound like he could refuse, but he knew that he couldn’t.

“Yes, my lord.” Nicolay was very ‘happy’ to accept it, but he immediately became worried and said, ” but my Lord, the search is so tight here. I’m worried that we might be discovered. Also, I haven’t been there before, so I don’t know Vivika’s location!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“You don’t need to worry about that. These two are for you.” Eli told him, then took out two items.

A black cloak and a soul crystal.

“the black cloak is the shadow Dragon cloak. As long as you use it at night, you can easily sneak in. This soul crystal can help you find Vivika’s location.” Eli introduced.

Nikola’s eyes brightened as he took the two items. If it were really as his lordship had said, then it would be much more convenient. But the only thing that puzzled him was why his lordship had a soul crystal that could sense Vivica’s location.

Vivika was a 3rd-circle Warlock, so how could she be sensed so easily?

For a moment, countless thoughts ran through his mind. Daughter, old acquaintance, friend, life-and-death friend, all kinds of relationships, he thought about them. He even suspected that Vivika might have a similar identity as him. Anything was possible. After all, who would have thought that the leader of the house of the undead was indentured to Herman?

After thinking about it for a long time, there was no result, so he gave up. In any case, he would know after this siege was over.

“Okay, then, let’s discuss the details. When you meet, don’t expose my identity first. Also, you can give her a crystal ball that can send messages over long distances, so it’s easier for us to communicate.” Eli said.

“Yes.” Nikola was also listening attentively. Suddenly, he thought of a serious question and asked, “my Lord, there’s a small problem. How can we make Vivika believe me? ”

“Just show him the aura of Kloss in your mind.” Eli speechlessly cast him a glance, then continued, and Vivika won’t refuse. She has no other choice.

“Yes, yes, yes.” Nikola knew that he had asked a stupid question.

Then, the two of them continued their discussion and only stopped after an hour.

“then we’ll split into two groups. I’ll prepare for the battle, and you contact Vivika. Come to me after you’re done.”

“Alright!”

With that said, Eli glanced at the bloodline tower and left.

Nikola also put on the shadow Dragon cloak and began to hide. It was still daytime, and his lordship had also said that the hiding effect was better at night, and at that time, the black Isotta side was also resting.

Time passed quickly, and the night soon came.

...

Looking at the stars in the sky, Nikola’s eyes became determined. He put on the shadow Dragon cloak and headed toward the bloodline tower, his body gradually melting into the dark night.

Along the way.

He encountered a large number of warlocks patrolling the black Isotta tower, but with his powerful strength and the concealment effect of the shadow Dragon cloak, he quickly infiltrated the bloodline tower.

He took out the spirit crystal in a dark alley in the bloodline tower.

He could feel a magical connection with another person. According to his Lord, that person should be Vivika. Nicholas held it in his hand and then put it away, sneaking into the depths of the bloodline tower.

The soul crystal guided him, but to his surprise, the other end of the crystal didn’t seem to be in the central tower of the bloodline tower. Instead, it was in the outer regions of the bloodline tower.

Due to the war, the bloodline tower’s interior was filled with people. Patrols were everywhere, too. After two hours, he finally arrived at his destination.

“Is this the place?”

In a house, Nicolay looked at a short mage Tower not far away. The soul crystal in his hand flickered with a strong light, connecting with the inside of the Tower.

The target was inside.
