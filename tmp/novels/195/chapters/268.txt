269 Setback

The shadow wriggled, and Eli slowly walked out.

He looked at these people calmly, his eyes slightly narrowed!

Half of them were Holy tower warlocks in white robes, while the other half seemed to be wearing an unfamiliar Warlock robe. On their robes were many silver hourglass patterns, which seemed to be flowing, looking extremely strange.

There were a total of fifteen third-circle warlocks.

This should be the hourglass faction that Vivika had mentioned.

“The hourglass of time?” Looking at these people, Eli silently took out the dice in his hand, and the Golden dice spun in his hand!

“You know us?” The Warlock in the lead raised his eyebrows and smiled.

Since he knew about them, it should be much easier to deal with him.

“Hello, I’m Morris, a third circle warlock in the hourglass. We were in the process of pursuing Sergei, but he ran here by accident. Since you’ve dealt with him, you don’t mind us leaving, do you? ” Morris said.

He saw that Eli was looking at the die in his hand, not even looking at them.

Morris was a little angry, but he did not do anything!

Unless it was absolutely necessary, he did not want to fight with this Warlock!

A few seconds later, he saw the die in Eli’s hand stop spinning. He saw Eli slowly raise his head and smile. “19 points. I don’t have absolute confidence in defeating you!”

“Us too. If that’s the case, I don’t think we need to fight this round.” Although Morris did not quite understand what Eli had done, he still went along with him.

“Sigh, that won’t do. My hundreds of years of experience tell me that when I meet an enemy, it’s best to kill them. Otherwise, a small problem may become a big problem.” Eli smiled and shook his head, looking very relaxed.

These people had been watching the battle just now. Eli knew that they would not hesitate to kill him if he was injured by Sergei. They hadn’t done that because they were afraid of him.

It was best to get rid of them.

19 points was a little dangerous, but he was willing to take this huge risk!

“Herman, you’re very strong. We’ve underestimated you. However, we have thirty-five third-circle warlocks here, and fifteen of them are at the late stage of the third-circle realm. The early-stage third circle warlocks you fought last time can’t compare to us.” The smile on Morris’ face gradually disappeared.

They were unwilling to fight, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t.

It was true that they couldn’t win in a one-on-one battle, but this time, it was one against thirty-five!

“Indeed,” Eli nodded and then snapped his fingers!

In an instant, white skeletons slowly walked out of the space created by the shadows. The undead looked at these people through their sunken eyes, and as the skeletons slowly walked out, the shadows automatically climbed onto them, turning into the undead’s armor and weapons.

In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of undead appeared in the space, including nearly fifty third circle undead, all of which was what Eli had gained over the years.

Their bloodthirsty instincts were triggered.

They had been working in the secret realm for hundreds of years, and their master had finally let them out.

Looking at the ocean of undead that had surrounded them, the smiles on the warlocks ‘faces gradually disappeared, and their faces became extremely gloomy. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

They had been tricked!

Herman was actually a Necromancer!

He was a Mage!

Everyone was shocked.

“Who are you?” Morris looked at him with a serious expression.

This definitely wasn’t Herman. A Necromancer must have replaced Herman without anyone knowing. After all, a normal warlock couldn’t have lived for so long. No wonder he was so strong!

“I am me!” Eli smiled and looked at everyone.

On top of the White bones, he once again hid in the shadows. At the same time, all the spirits of the dead surged toward the group of more than thirty people. The group of them resisted madly in the sea of spirits of the dead, like a small boat in the middle of a storm!

However, there were too many spirits of the dead, so many that they could not resist at all.

The number of warlocks began to decrease!

An hour later!

Eli looked at Morris, who had a bone spear in his chest and slowly approached him.

“I’m very curious about the time hourglass. Tell me in detail.” Eli said.

“In your dreams!” Morris vomited blood and looked at Eli angrily. At this moment, other than him, none of the thirty-five people were alive. It had only been an hour!

Was this the power of a mage?

“I won’t say a single word!” Morris continued.

“It’s okay, you’ll tell me.” As he walked, a silver light flashed in Eli’s eyes, and two silver rings appeared outside his pupils, the silver light even brighter.

“What is this?”

Morris gritted his teeth. He felt his consciousness becoming more and more blurry!

Ten minutes later, Eli personally killed Morris, and then his eyes returned to normal, but his eyebrows raised!

He managed to get information on the time sand.

The hourglass was indeed very strong. It seemed like he would have to lay low for a while.

..

“What? they’re all dead?”

When Woox received the news, he opened his mouth wide.

He grabbed the leading Warlock’s clothes in disbelief. “Can you repeat that?”

“my Lord, the news is confirmed. Herman, Sergei, and our warlocks were fighting near the White Tower. It is said that Herman was the only one who left the battlefield after the battle!” The Warlock said through gritted teeth.

...

“Really?”

Woox retreated to the table and sat down, closing his eyes in despair.

How could it be like this?

Could it be that Herman was higher than the third circle?

Impossible. If he were a celestial, there would be a huge fluctuation when a celestial advanced. There was no way they couldn’t sense it. This meant that he was only a third-circle warlock. If he were a celestial, he would’ve killed them long ago!

But was he really that powerful?

It was ridiculous.

Only the top geniuses in the central continent could achieve such a feat. Moreover, they had the best secret techniques and the best bloodlines!

If he didn’t know, he would have thought that he was on the central continent!

What the f * ck was this!

They had finally killed Sergei, and now there was a stronger one.

...

“F * ck!” Even with Woox’s temper, he felt aggrieved at this moment!

“Woox, what happened?”

At this moment, the door of the room was suddenly violently opened, and a thin and fat Warlock walked in. Their faces were filled with confusion, and their eyes were filled with panic.

“I just noticed that the auras of more than a dozen warlocks in our time hourglass have disappeared!” Fatty situ asked with a frown.

They had sent a lot of high-level combat forces to support this operation!

“Have they fallen into some secret realm or are they sealed? what’s going on? ” The thin Sancher asked quickly. In just a short while, the auras of the dozen or so people who belonged to the time hourglass disappeared one by one, which left them dumbfounded.

Woox raised his head and looked at the two of them. He suddenly laughed.

So they could also panic?

It was really funny!

He looked at the Warlock not far away and nodded. “Tell the two Lords what happened.”

The Warlock didn’t hesitate and repeated the information.

After saying that, the fat and thin duo’s faces stiffened!

The two of them looked at each other in silence!

Silence was the main theme of the night!

Seeing the two of them being defeated, Woox felt inexplicably happy. By now, Woox had become only a front. These people wanted to use the Holy tower’s power to control the West Coast, but it seemed that they had encountered a troublesome person!

“My Lords, what should we do?” Woox asked the two of them after a quarter of an hourglass had passed.

“Sigh, let’s shrink it for now.” The fatty shook his head and said.

Their original plan was to get rid of Sergei and Herman and then spread their influence to the entire West Coast, but now it seemed that they had to reconsider their plan!

All of this had to be rearranged!

“We have to make a trip back to the hourglass!” The thin Sancher looked at Woox and said.

“Indeed!”

Woox nodded.

Such a powerful Warlock was beyond their imagination. They had to go back and ask for help!

“Woox, you’re in charge of stabilizing the situation. It’s still under our control. This is just a small setback. Even though Herman is strong, he’s not invincible! Plus, he’s not unbeatable.” Said Sancher as he looked at Woox.

Woox’s eyelids twitched. ‘There are stronger warlocks in time hourglass?’

“Alright!”

Woox nodded. He was also very curious about what kind of trump card this force had!
