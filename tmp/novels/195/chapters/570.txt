571 Fifty Years

Trees flourished, and trees withered!

The gray matter appeared on the trunk of the law tree, and the branches bent bit by bit. The leaves that had condensed the power of law began to wither and then fell one by one. The petals withered, and the fruits dried up and fell…

It was as if an old tree had entered its death phase, and there was a deathly stillness.

This was the destruction of the fifth circle and the only path to the sixth circle!

Once it started, it couldn’t be stopped.

Either succeed or die!

Of course, Eli was very confident. With the blessings of the world and the resources of a great world continent, he was also extremely powerful, so he was not worried.

Thus, layers of shadows enveloped Eli like an eggshell.

His consciousness also fell into a deep sleep.

This step would take a long time, a really long time.

..

Deep Sea.

Mermaid Clan.

“What? The Lord has fallen into a deep sleep!” Laura looked at the information in her hand and was instantly stunned.

Just a moment ago, she received a letter from her lord!

The letter said that he would be away for a long time and asked her to pay attention to the situation at sea!

“Since Milord said it would take a long time, then it should be a long time.” A trace of worry flashed in Laura’s eyes. She couldn’t help but look at the deep sea in the distance. The sea seemed to be relatively stable now, but this was only on the surface. It was already chaotic in the dark!

Even she did not know what would happen in the future!

Besides, if Sir Eli wakes up, then Sir Poseidon…

At this moment, Eval walked in anxiously and looked at Laura. “Your Majesty, just now, Master Poseidon’s aura disappeared, and he’s gone!”

Laura took a deep breath and pondered for a moment before saying to Ivor, “Announce that Lord Poseidon has temporarily left the territory to break through to a higher level.”

Eval nodded and quickly left.

Seeing Eval leave, Laura returned to her seat. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Time passed by in seclusion.

50 years passed in the outside world, and 2,000 years had passed in the Time World Fragment.

This year, Eli suddenly opened his eyes.

His current appearance did not change from before, but the Tree of Law inside was completely different. The tree had completely withered, and layers of cracks appeared on the surface of the trunk. Leaves, flowers, and fruits were scattered on the ” ground “. Even his aura had almost fallen to the extreme.

It could be said that the current Eli’s combat power might not be as good as a Warlock who had just advanced to the fifth circle.

However, his eyes were incomparably bright, as if they contained everything.

“It’s about time. Next, it’s time to condense a world!”

Seeing this scene, Eli no longer hesitated.

In the next second.

The huge tree of laws seemed to have lost its support and collapsed.

However, at the same time, laws were slowly brewing within, especially the four rays of light. The black shadow law, the golden light law, the blood-colored bloodline power, and the mysterious time law.

Four beams of light shot up into the sky like the four pillars of the sky.

In an instant, cracks began to appear in the time world fragments around Eli. In the universe, some light and mysterious elements gathered, but fortunately, there was a spell formation to hide them, and only a few talented creatures noticed it.

The endless power caused the world to change. With the four rules as the pillars, an illusory world slowly formed behind Eli. Everything in the past had turned into nourishment to fill up everything. It seemed real and illusory.

The world was forming!

Eli, who had already observed the world’s formation process through the world’s will, did not face any resistance. The world was forming at a firm and rapid speed.

His aura was also slowly increasing, breaking through the limit of five rings.

Under the influence of this power, the surrounding world fragments could no longer endure it. Cracks began to appear one after another. The world fragments became even more shattered, and the degree of collapse gradually increased.

Three days later!

Behind him was a huge illusory world.

The Four Pillars of Heaven supported the sky, and the earth was filled with other laws. The picture was divided into four colors. They were the dark abyss, the sacred heaven, the blood-red sea, and the Horizon of Time. These were the manifestations of the laws.

At this moment, his aura had already surpassed the fifth circle.

“Sixth circle, world mage!” Eli was delighted.

He had successfully broken through.

However, when he saw that his surroundings had already shattered, he still felt a sense of pity. After all, this place that was so beneficial to him had actually disappeared just like that.

However, he wasn’t worried because he had the same ability.

Thinking of this, he turned to look at the world behind him.

Every scene in this was not just a scene but also represented the sublimation of a power. Whether it was shadow, light, bloodline, or time, he could sense that every power was much stronger than before. Ten times, dozens of times?

“Also, my own strength is about ten times that of a peak fifth-circle warlock.” Eli estimated his own strength and gained a deeper understanding of the sixth circle.

Of course, he still had the world behind him. The explosive power was even more terrifying.

“Why don’t we experiment?” Eli’s interest was piqued. He looked at the shattered time world fragments mixed in the black fog not far away.

However, in the next second, Heaven flashed behind Ely. A dazzling light instantly illuminated the surroundings, and the black fog in the surrounding 100 meters instantly disappeared.

After all, this was not an active black fog. It was the black fog left behind by that person in the past. Even if it was him in the past, he had no choice but to grind it down slowly, but now, he could easily deal with it.

The light stopped shining, and all the time world fragments appeared in Eli’s eyes.

In the next second, the abyss bloomed, and all the time world fragments entered the abyss, strengthening Eli’s strength. The world became clearer, and it was as if another world was beginning to brew.

The devouring power was much stronger than before. It was now enough to devour world fragments.

If he was stronger, he might be able to devour the real world.

Speaking of the world, one had to talk about the level of the sixth circle. It was not the same as the fifth circle. The six rings were the process of condensing the world. The goal was to condense nine worlds, so they were also called World Mages.

The current Eli was a One-World Mage.

However, Eli’s world was already at its peak.

“I don’t know if the marine race still has any remaining sixth circle, but it’s impossible for humans to have any,” Eli said with certainty. At the very least, he didn’t think that there would be any powerful humans left in the mage’s world.

Therefore, he was now the undisputed number one human in the Mage’s World.

“But I still won’t leave.” Eli shook his head and looked at a large number of world fragments outside the Mage’s World. These things blocked the outside world, but they were the best food for him to advance.

It wouldn’t be easy to find them in the future.

The Devouring Power was still useful in the sixth circle!

“But I’ll figure this out later. I’ll go back to the Mage’s World first.”

Shaking his head, Eli decided to return to the world first.

Who knew what the world had become in the past 50 years?

‘I hope nothing major happens!’

As the spatial passageway had been damaged by him, he had no choice but to enter the world directly. However, the moment he entered, he was suddenly stunned when he saw the central continent.

At the edge of the continent, he could feel countless energies.

On the mainland, his power of faith was much worse than before, as if it had suffered huge destruction.

“Something big has happened!”

Eli pursed his lips and decided to return to Bloodline City first!
