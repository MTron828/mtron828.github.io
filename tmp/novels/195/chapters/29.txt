Chapter 30: It Was All Luck

Translator: Lonelytree

“Sir, this is the simplest game we have here. It’s very suitable for you to get started.”

The chair behind him was filled with velvet, which was very soft and comfortable. On the table in front of him were the dice and the dice pot, and beside him was Evans, who was introducing the rules of the game to him.

“Dice?”

He did not expect to see familiar things in this world. It could only be said that there were all kinds of coincidences in the endless world.

“customer, the rules of this game are very simple. It’s a competition for points. There are six dice in there. The one with the lower number wins.” It’s very simple. Evans introduced him.

“Oh, then who’s going to compete with me?” Eli asked.

“I’ll do it!” At this moment, a man walked out of the crowd.

He was wearing clothes with golden threads. His eyes were deep and concave, his nose was aquiline, and his face was long. He seemed to give off a sense of oppression just by standing beside the gambling table, but he had a faint smile on his face.

“I’ll play a few rounds with you.” The man sat down at the table across from him and said to Eli.

“Sure!” Eli nodded and turned around. He asked Evans, “What should I do next?”

His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone heard him.

The waiter smiled, and the man glanced at him, too. Only Evans was still ” enthusiastic ” about helping Eli. He explained, “Sir, you can roll the dice first, then place a sum of money to see if the other party is willing to follow or raise the sum. If they follow, you can continue to follow. If they don’t follow, then we’ll start a competition for points. At most, you can add one gold Tarl at a time.”

“I see!” A look of realization appeared on Elie’s face, and she immediately took out a golden Tarl, saying, “I’m in!”

“Sir, you have to roll the dice first!” Evans did not know what to say.

“Oh, I forgot,” Eli replied, then took back the gold tarl, looking completely like a newbie.

“Come on.” Eli raised his head towards the opposite side.

The man nodded, and the two of them shook the dice at the same time.

After a series of clanking and shaking sounds.

“I’ll start with one gold tarl,” said Eli directly.

“Sir, he’s the dealer. He’ll go first.” As usual, Evans reminded him.

“Ten silver tarls!” The man in front of him sneered and then said.

“then I’ll still raise a golden Tarl. I didn’t bring many silver tars.” Eli said honestly, revealing his bottom line.

“No!” The man opposite him didn’t seem to expect that Eli would still go straight for a gold tarl. It looked like they had really gotten the big fish this time.

“Then are we going to reveal the result now?” Eli looked at the waiter with a puzzled expression.

“Okay!” The waiter nodded.

In the two dice cups, Eli had 20 points, while the man had 26 points. He lost to Eli.

“Sir, you win,” Evans shouted with excitement.

“Let’s play another round.” The man in front of him seemed a little angry and said in a low voice.

“Alright!”

The sound of the dice rang out again.

This time, Eli immediately followed up with two gold tarls.

The result appeared, and Eli won again.

He had twenty-six, and the other side had thirty-five. The man had lost to Eli.

“Oh, Sir, you must be a genius in this field, my God.” Evans did not hide his admiration for Eli at all. Some beautiful women in the crowd were also making eyes at him.

“Detestable!” The man in front of him slammed the table, no longer as dignified as before. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, there were already four gold tarls in Eli’s hand.

What a terrifying money-making speed.

Of course, he completely understood that the money was given to him by his opponent. He didn’t even use any tricks in these two rounds because he was very sure that he wouldn’t lose the first two rounds.

“Again! I’m going to bet everything this time.” The man’s eyes were already a little red as if the money he had lost had already made him feel a little uncomfortable!

But on the other side, Eli just maintained his smile. Under the observation of his spiritual power, he could clearly feel that the man had dripped something into his eyes when he was lying on the table.

Looking at Evans, who was already a fanatical fan of Eli, he pursed his lips.

It was true that in this relatively simple society, most people would probably be deceived by them, but Eli, who had experienced how scamming worked in his previous life, naturally knew that these were all intentional.

He would lose money soon.

However, he could not lose.

“Alright, another round.” Eli laughed heartily, seemingly very happy.

The two of them shook the dice again!

Clanking sounds were heard as if the gold tarls were colliding.

“I have a total of three gold tarls. Are you going to follow?” he asked. The man looked at Eli ferociously.

Eli wasn’t sure if he was going to win this round, so he activated his spiritual perception.

Under the invisible mental power, the six dice in the dice cup were reflected in his eyes.

The man had four one’s and two two’s, a total of eight points. On the other hand, Eli casually rolled three two’s, two Four’s, and one six’s, a total of 20 points.

Obviously, from this point of view, Eli was completely defeated.

Then, his mental power instantly entered the dice cup, and the dice began to flip under the control of his mental power, directly turning into six one’s.

“Alright, I’ll follow!” Eli was as generous as ever.

“Hehe!”

On the other side, a smile appeared on the man’s face. Dice could be controlled through special means. In order for him to win more reasonably, he only controlled his own dice and controlled the number to an outrageous but not-so-outrageous level.

Open!

In an instant, the expression on the man’s face froze.

He saw Eli’s die, and it actually had six one’s.

“Six one’s!”

Everyone around them had their mouths wide open as well. They didn’t expect that Eli’s luck would be so good that even the man with four one’s actually lost to him.

“He has such good luck!” The experienced players were all prepared to see Eli make a fool of himself, but they did not expect him to actually roll six one’s. This made everyone feel astonished.

“How is that possible?” The man seemed to feel that he had shot himself in the foot.

He watched as the gold tarls were once again absorbed into Eli’s bag, his cheeks sweating. This time, it really wasn’t an act. So he looked at the waiter not far away and nodded.

The attendant understood tacitly.

“Hey, mister, you’re really lucky today!” Evans couldn’t help but exclaim at Eli’s luck, and then he congratulated him.

“I can’t stop my luck!” Eli didn’t hide his happiness either as he picked up the gold coin.

“Again!” The man’s face was already red, and he glared at Eli fiercely.

The next time, he would directly adjust Eli’s die, making it impossible for him to win.

“Again!” The man shouted again.

But what he didn’t expect was that Eli actually stood up directly, glanced at him, and said, ” I’m not playing anymore. It’s boring. Let’s change to another game!”

The man was instantly stunned!

How can you fucking stop? If you did, how could I scam you?

“Sir, you’re not playing anymore?” Evans was also stunned and even more anxious.

If he really let Eli go out directly, he would be in deep trouble today.

“no, I see there are still cards over there. Why don’t we go and play cards? ” Eli shook his head as if he felt that shaking the dice was too boring.

“It’s alright!” Evans’s heart sank. Fortunately, it was just a different game, and playing cards was much easier than playing dice. The casino would definitely earn back the money quickly, and he could also get a cut of the earnings.

‘He’s just a person with slightly better luck.’ With that thought in mind, Evans led Eli to the other side.

Only the man was left standing there in a daze, like a fool.

“Luck, it’s all luck!”
