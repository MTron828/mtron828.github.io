484 Sitting on the Wall

“What?!”

“How is this possible?”

Shock and anger burned in Nero’s heart.

Looking at the battle report in front of him, he could not help but clench it tightly, and the armrest of the chair with his other hand turned into almost invisible dust.

Nero was still shocked.

He could not accept it!

It was not a big deal for Eli to have a half-step fifth-circle combat power. After all, it was almost impossible for a four-ring peak to solve the demon battle. But it was a bit ridiculous that he could easily kill Soran, who was of the same level!

“Eli, how well did you hide your power?” Nero’s eyes turned red as anger consumed his rationality. He could not help but close his eyes.

After half an hour, he opened his eyes again.

But this time, his gaze was calm and even a little cold.

He looked at the familiar house and furniture, and a cold killing intent burst forth. With a bang, everything seemed to have been cut by countless knives, and terrifying cracks appeared one after another. Then, he muttered in a low voice, “So what if they’re all dead? It’s reasonable as long as they kill Eli.

“As long as I get rid of Eli, the entire Western Region will be my territory from now on. At that time, the implementation of the plan will naturally be easy, and there won’t even be as much trouble as it is now.

” As for Eli, he’s indeed a strong person. He’s endured for decades. I even admire him a little. But so what? He still couldn’t keep his cool. If you can beat one half-step fifth-circle warlock, what if there are many?”

At this moment, Nero had completely placed Eli on the same level as him, putting down his previous arrogance.

“Men, summon all the active half-step fifth circle Warlocks in the Heart of the Abyss. Since he can fight, let me see how good he can fight!”

Nero sneered and called out to his subordinates!

Half an hour later.

Six figures appeared in the room. Four men and two women.

“My lord!” The six of them greeted Nero respectfully.

“Good!” Nero nodded in satisfaction. These people in front of him were all half-step celestials!

If they were going to fight, they had to give it their all and give Eli a surprise.

The setting sun shone into his eyes like a burning flame. Nero pursed his lips. “You can deal with one, but what about six?”

..

“Sir, two-thirds of the eastern region has fallen into our hands. The leaders and higher-ups of the various forces have also been imprisoned. Only a small number of people have escaped!”

At the front line, Vivika reported to Eli in an airship behind the Bloodline Tower’s army.

Eli nodded in satisfaction.

Those guys in the Eastern Region thought that they could sit on the fence and watch, but how could Eli allow these fence-sitters to exist on his flanks? Moreover, they had completely overestimated their combat power. In less than a month, the Eastern Region was in the hands of the Bloodline Tower.

“However, my lord, our friends from the Central Region, the Thousand-Eyed Tree Demon family, has sent a secret message. It seems that the Hamis family is secretly preparing an army and has even gathered at the edge of the Western Region.

“However, it was strange that they did not seem to have any intention of making a move!” Vivika continued to report.

Of course, she didn’t collect all of these. Instead, they were collected and sent to her by various parties.

“The Hamis family. This is troublesome. Are they planning to take advantage after the war?” Eli narrowed his eyes.

As the battle progressed, they had almost advanced to half of the region of the Heart of the Abyss. It was not only the interior, but the exterior was also surging with wind and clouds.

Countless factions were paying attention to this war or were prepared to take some benefits.

“Just be careful. I have deployed troops at all the borders. There’s no need to worry!” Eli shook his head.

He had long considered this point. Otherwise, he would not have mobilized the Dragon Race and the various races in the Green Field!

As long as there was a problem, both sides would act as emergencies to ensure the safety of the Bloodline Tower. Of course, this was only one insurance. There was another insurance, and that was that the real Eli was still at the back!

At least there was still a strong line of defense. He did not need to worry too much.

“Yes, sir.”

Vivika nodded as if this was what she should do.

No one could say how many tricks Eli had up his sleeves.

“Give me the report on the current situation on the battlefield.” Eli changed the topic.

Vivika organized her thoughts and said, “Currently, the main battlefield is going very smoothly. It’s so smooth that it’s surprising. In a month, we’ve completely occupied 80% of the cities in the north, and we’re not far from the center.”

“What about the remaining 20%?” Eli raised his head curiously.

Vivika glanced at him and said, “Brother Eli, this is your fault!”

“My fault?” Ely blinked.

“Your airship troop’s firepower is insane. After a few rounds, many cities have been seriously destroyed. They can’t be occupied at all and can only be abandoned.” Vivika teased.

“Alright then.”

Eli’s expression was strange. So that was the case!

However, that was true. If the airship bombardment were used against a city, it would be impossible for a city without the defense of a spell formation to last for a few times before it collapsed.

“Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Also, we’ve discovered something wrong with the recent attacks.” Vivika suddenly changed the topic, and her eyes became serious.

“What’s wrong?”

“That is, we discovered that the defenses of the cities in front of us have dropped quite a bit. However, according to the rules, the deeper we go, the stronger it should be. However, it’s the opposite here.

“Moreover, there were surprisingly few people in the city.”

There were few people. They should have evacuated in advance. However, there was something wrong with the lack of defense. There was indeed a problem. However, it was impossible for Nero to give up on the Heart of the Abyss. It seemed like there was a big surprise ahead!

” We’re guessing that the most important city in the central region ahead is Rolle City. It’s also the most important node to open the center of the south and the central region of the Heart of the Abyss. I’m afraid there’s something there!”

At this point, she couldn’t help but look at Eli.

If the Heart of the Abyss had set up a trap, it would not have been targeted at them. It could only be targeted at Eli.

“Brother Eli, why don’t we change directions?” She bit her lip and said worriedly.

Eli smiled and patted her head, but his eyes became sharp. “So be it. Let’s see how much strength the Heart of the Abyss still has.”

“But…” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Don’t worry. This is just a clone!” Eli consoled.

Vivika’s eyes lit up.

She was so worried that she actually forgot about this!

That was good!

Eli looked at her relaxed expression and stroked her soft hair.

Seriously, did she think he did not even consider the danger that he might face?

“But… I’m here!”

Eli looked ahead, his eyes flashing with silver light.

His line of sight crossed tens of millions of miles and came to a huge city. In the center of the city was a huge Mage Tower. There were six people sitting inside, all with their eyes closed.

“Six half-step fifth circle warlocks, so that’s what it is!”

Eli understood that this was an ambush and immediately relaxed.

It might have been enough in the past, but now?

“Brother Eli, are you done touching?”

Suddenly, he heard a bitter voice. He looked down and saw that Vivika’s face was slightly red, her eyes were rippling, and her hair was in a mess. Her hair was tousled by him.

Eli let go of her hand in embarrassment!

“Actually, you can also touch other places!” A timid voice sounded. It was Vivika, who was looking forward to it.

Pa!

“What are you thinking about?”

Eli patted Vivika’s head and said unhappily.

“We’re still on the battlefield!”

“Is it okay if we’re not a battlefield?”

Pa!

Another knock!
