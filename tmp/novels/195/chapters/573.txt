574 The Battle of the Three Great Sea Race Sovereigns

Seeing the three figures, the Warlocks who were quarreling stopped arguing. Even the three people in front of them had ugly expressions, including Kyle.

“Ink Turtle Emperor, Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor, Sea Giant Emperor.” David looked at the three fifth circle beings with an ugly expression. The Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor was a peak fifth circle being, while the other two were also late-stage fifth circle beings.

Usually, there was only one emperor or none, but this time, all three of them had moved out. Were they planning to fight a decisive battle?

This time…Could they hold on?

“Humans, today is the day you die!” A thunderous voice resounded over the surface of the sea. It was the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor in the center who had spoken!

His words were like a prologue. In an instant, the entire sea surface boiled.

Countless members of the Sea Tribes emerged from the surface of the water. A huge amount of seawater spread across the ground and buried the skeletons. The tens of millions of members of the Sea Tribes also attacked the human defense line!

The battle had begun!

On the city wall, the Warlocks launched their attacks while the peak fifth circle powerhouses were at a loss. At this moment, Kyle said, “David, you deal with the Sea Giant Emperor. I’ll deal with the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor. Nola, Si Ka, and Suo Duo, you three deal with the Ink Turtle Emperor.”

Seeing Kyle take over the command, Alida didn’t say anything.

“Good!” David nodded helplessly.

Now was not the time for internal strife. If they lost today, no one would be able to live.

The other three, who were called by Kyle, nodded and walked out. Nola was also a Law Warlock, but her aura was weaker than David’s. She was at the lowest level.

Kyle directly flew up, flying towards the distant Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor. His body also gradually enlarged, turning into a ten thousand-meter-long demon wolf, with countless ghosts coiling around him.

Sixth circle bloodline, Nether Demon Wolf!

David let out a breath of grey air and flew towards the Sea Giant. Nola was sent flying with an ugly expression. Although she had been given the weakest Black Turtle Emperor, it was still a peak fifth circle…

“Die!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

On the other side, the Deep Sea Demonic Whale King looked at the demonic wolf. It stirred up boundless waves, crashing toward the demonic wolf. The terrifying might made everyone look sideways.

However, Kyle controlled the endless ghosts to fight with him. For a moment, the two were evenly matched.

On the other side, David also controlled the black fog to collide with the Sea Giant.

“I hope Nola can hold on for a while longer!” David and Kyle had the same thought.

However, in the next second, everyone heard a mournful wail.

Turning his head, he saw that on the other side of the battlefield, the Ink turtle Emperor’s shell was covered with countless shining magical symbols. It was like a sealing spell, and Nola and the other two were within the seal as if they had been frozen.

Gulp!

The Black Turtle Emperor swallowed it in one gulp, then turned to look at David and Kyle, causing them to feel cold all over.

“Hehe, the Black Turtle Emperor may seem unremarkable among the Eight Great Sovereigns, but anyone who underestimates him will definitely die the most miserable death. This sealing technique, even in the Mage Era, was praised by a seven-circle Mage!

“Let’s see what you can use to resist this!” Opposite Kyle, the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor laughed loudly.

“Damn it!”

Kyle’s expression was ugly.

This time, he had underestimated the determination and strength of the Sea Tribes.

There’s nothing left to fight!

He and David had no chance of winning. They would need to run, or they would all die here.

In almost an instant, the demon wolf’s body shook, and it turned around to flee. This made the Warlocks present widen their eyes. The nearby Demon Turtle Emperor and Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor were also stunned.

‘You’re running away from a war?’

“Don’t even think about running!” But how could the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor let him run?

The giant tail swept through the air, and its figure disappeared in an instant. It came behind the demon wolf and blocked it. Its speed was actually faster than the demon wolf.

At this moment, the Ink Turtle Emperor had also arrived opposite Kyle, confronting him together with the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor.

“We’re done for!”

It wasn’t just Kyle. Everyone present had the same thought.

Alida was fighting with a member of the Sea Tribe, looking at the sky in despair.

Nola, a law warlock, was actually dealt with in an instant.

Sea Dragon Clan Leader and Sea Shark Clan Leader were also in despair. They were evenly matched in a one-on-one battle. The result of a two-on-one battle was obvious. Kyle couldn’t win. It would be best if he didn’t die here!

As for the low-level Warlocks, their momentum suffered a devastating blow, and they suffered heavy casualties in an instant!

On the other side, the Sea Giant immediately launched an attack when it saw David distracted. It swung its fist fiercely and sent David flying toward Kyle.

Kyle caught the injured David, and his expression became even uglier.

Now, it was three against one and a half, so they should just surrender.

He raised his head and looked at the three Sovereigns of the Sea Tribe who had already gathered. His body couldn’t help but tremble. He had originally only wanted to make a fortune, but now it seemed that he was going to lose his life.
