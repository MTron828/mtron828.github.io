476 The World Shakes, Eli’s Harvest

A bright light shone on every inch of the warlock world.

Be it the sky, the uninhabited mountains, the desolate plateau, or even the land beneath the ground, the extreme north, and the ocean that occupied two-thirds of the world’s surface, and everything was enveloped by the world’s will at that moment.

At the bottom of the abyss.

The Balors hid in their eyes in panic, while the inferior demons and supreme demons hid in the caves. Many unlucky guys were trampled to death by a large number of demons.

All the Demon Kings and Demon Monarchs raised their heads to look at the top of the Abyss, their faces filled with shock.

!!

All the demon powerhouses felt a familiar aura as if they recalled the years when the mages had once dominated them, an era filled with blood, tears, and fear.

“It’s the world’s will descending. It’s as disgusting as ever!”

In the depths of the abyss, in a black-red palace made of obsidian, a figure sat on a high throne. His golden eyes opened, and he looked at the sky.

She was tall and had two black and red curved horns on her head. Her body was humanoid. Although it was covered in black and red patterns, it just wrapped around her seductive figure!

At this moment, a demon walked into the palace from afar. He lowered his head and said respectfully, “Lord Demon Heart, the chaos has stopped. Someone in the human world should have triggered the descent of the world’s will. It shouldn’t affect our plan!”

“I know. You may leave.” She nodded and waved her hand to disperse the demon.

After the demon left, she looked at the sky and fell asleep again.

Compared to the descent of the world’s will, she was more concerned about the situation of the Heart of the Abyss.

Soon!

..

At the place of extreme chill…

The howling cold wind covered the sky.

In the vast expanse of whiteness, there was a mage tower that was a few thousand meters tall.

At the top of the Magus Tower, in a pitch-black room, a figure sat calmly on the ground in the middle.

It was a black warlock robe that was propped up. Under the robe were ice-cold white bones and ice-cold spiritual flames that burned like flames.

Suddenly, flames lit up, and the entire skeleton seemed to have awakened.

Gagaga!

The white bone head turned and saw the light from the outside world.

In the white, black dots could be seen. They were Warlocks who were struggling to advance, and their vitality was on the verge of dying.

“Very good. More and more Warlocks are coming. As long as this continues, there will be more and more Liches. Soon, I will be able to return to the main continent and take back everything that belongs to us.

“At that time, I will reconstruct this world and reverse this distorted world.

“I can also disguise this Warlock who triggered the World Will as a Lich.” The Lich King pondered for a few seconds before he shook his head and sighed.

” Ever since I created the path of the Lich and triggered the World Will a thousand years ago, I thought that this would be a better path for mages, but as time went on, I felt that my body was getting more and more immersed in the darkness. Perhaps one day, I would completely sink into it, but unfortunately, I had no other choice.

“The moment I embarked on the path of a Lich, I had no choice.

“However, if everyone is transformed into this, is it really correct?”

The Lich King slowly raised his head, his will wavering.

After a few days, his body trembled slightly. Then, his will gradually became firm, and he strode back to his room.

No, he was not wrong.

The world was wrong!

When his teacher had taught him the path of the Mages, he had told him that this was the way of the Mages.

“Teacher will support me, even if he is dead.”

A soft laugh rang out, and the room fell into darkness.

..

Deep Sea!

In a palace.

She had an exquisite face, snow-white skin, and a sparkling tail.

Laura was wearing the crown of the Mermaid Queen and holding the Mermaid Scepter in her hand. She sat on the huge shell throne in the palace.

Beside her was her dignified mother, the former Mermaid Queen. In the palace, there were dozens of Mermaid Race experts.

“Your Majesty, we have taken back all the tribes of the Mermaid Race. Next, we will return to our tribe and take back everything that once belonged to us!” A murloc stood out and said.

“Yes.” Laura nodded.

But suddenly, all the murlocs seemed to sense something and looked up.

Golden light shone into the sea, and the majestic world will was like a god!

” The World Will has descended! ”

Laura looked at the sky with a surprised expression. However, in the next second, she seemed to have sensed something. She suddenly looked into her clothes and took out a statue.

The statue was also trembling.

Seeing the statue tremble, Laura’s expression was somewhat agitated. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Is that you?”

Joy flashed in Laura’s eyes, and the promise of hundreds of thousands of years flashed in her mind.

However, the statue only flickered for a moment and did not move, as if nothing had happened.

“Not yet, but it should be soon,” Laura revealed a smile.

The former Queen looked at the statue, and her eyes flashed as if she had recalled something.

A few minutes later, everything dissipated.

Lola kept the statue and looked at the merfolk below. She said, “Order all the gathered murlocs to set off for the deep sea.”

Lola’s voice was powerful.

She had not forgotten her promise. At the very least, she could not be slow.

Only when she returned to the tribe would she be considered a true Mermaid Queen.

..

Eli didn’t know about the chaos in the outside world.

A few days later, Eli, who was lying on the ground, opened his eyes.

“Hiss, I really didn’t expect that it would really attract the world’s will!”

Eli scratched his head and stood up from the ground.

As he stood up, he was comprehending the benefits that the world’s will had brought him.

“I’ve really gained a lot.” Eli closed his eyes and felt his harvest.

A total of three.

” Firstly, I’ve received the world’s attention. Although this doesn’t seem to be of much use, I’m afraid I’ll need it in the future. Of course, if the world is threatened, I might be able to use a portion of the world’s power.”

Eli chuckled. He was very happy about this. After all, it was extremely rare to be noticed by the world will.

“However, compared to the other two rewards, it’s still much less useful to me now.”

Eli sank into his body again and felt the elemental power flowing rapidly in his body. Whether it was his affinity with the elements or his absorption of the elements, it was almost twice as much as before.

His talent as a Mage had directly risen from second rank to first rank and was even at the peak of the first rank.

It had been thousands of years since his talent had increased. Since then, his talent had almost never increased. However, the arrival of the world’s will this time had settled this.

“Awesome!”

Eli was overjoyed.

His talent had increased, and all of his aspects had improved to a certain extent. This was a great thing for him.

However, compared to this, Ely’s third harvest was even more terrifying.

“As the founder of the Blood Celestial Body, the first person to completely fuse the path of Mage and Warlock, the power of the Blood Celestial Body has almost doubled.”

Eli pursed his lips and felt his heart beating a little fast.

Although he had never fought before, Eli knew that once the Blood Celestial Body fused, his combat power would be dozens of times stronger than before. Even a half-step fifth-circle warlock would not be able to defeat him.

Now, with this, there was no one below the fifth circle who could match him.

Not even Nero.

“Looks like it’s time to settle everything.”

His eyes gradually lit up. He had endured the Heart of Abyss for a long time.

It was time to end everything.

Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.

“Come in!”

Eli said after sensing the arrival.

The door opened, and Alida walked in. She looked at Eli and said, “Sir, you haven’t shown up for the past few days. I thought you were the one who did this. You scared me. ”

“No, I don’t know what caused it. I’ve been doing experiments.”

Eli shook his head. Before he woke up, the Grassi Ground had been sealed.

“That’s good.” Alida nodded.

“Oh, is there anything else?” asked Eli.

“No, I was just here to see you, sir. Also, the Heart of the Abyss moved to occupy another mine. It’s not a big deal!” Alida said casually.

According to her recent understanding of Eli, the lord would not take this matter to heart!

“Then let’s declare war.”

Eli turned around and changed the topic.

“Destroy the Heart of the Abyss.”
