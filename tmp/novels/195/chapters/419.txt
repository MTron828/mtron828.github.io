Saka Plateau!

At this moment, all of the eight-armed Naga celestials had extremely ugly expressions on their faces as they stared at Eli.

They couldn’t understand why Eli would appear here. Shouldn’t he be on another battlefield?

As for the battleAll of the Warlocks felt immense pressure. After all, on the battlefield in Nightfall City, Eli had single-handedly defeated a dozen fourth-circle Warlocks, including a Radiant Sun Warlock. But now, there were only twenty or so celestials here.

!!

However, it was obvious that Eli had no intention of peace. Otherwise, he would not have created this shadow cage.

“Everyone, we have no other choice. It seems that we can only fight!” A Celestial warlock turned to look at the others and said.

The others nodded.

“I’d like to see if Eli is really as powerful as the legends say.”

“That’s right. I’ve been here for more than a thousand years. What kind of dangerous situation haven’t I encountered?”

The Warlocks’ morale gradually rose. They saw that Eli was full of fighting spirit. How could they reach the celestial level without talent? Which Warlock hadn’t experienced life-threatening situations? Therefore, even when facing Eli, they didn’t completely sink into the sea of despair.

Without fighting, who knew if Eli’s fame was overblown or not?

A total of 24 celestials slowly flew into the sky, and their bodies rapidly changed into huge bloodline avatars. Then, they lowered their heads to look at Eli like gods that filled the sky!

” Come on, Eli. Let us see how powerful you are! ” An eight-armed Naga Warlock shouted, gritting his teeth as he looked at Eli.

“Good!”

Eli smiled, and his body changed rapidly. Countless shadows surrounded him, emitting a terrifying aura.

Seeing Eli’s massive body and terrifying aura, all the celestial’s eyes narrowed, and they couldn’t help but take a step back!

“Sir Glen, should we attack?” A Warlock next to Glen poked his head out and asked.

“There’s no need. Our participation will only hinder Sir!” Glen shook his head.

After witnessing the battle in Nightfall City, he naturally understood that these Warlocks were not enough for Lord Eli.

“Alright!” The Warlock nodded.

They all looked up, and many Warlocks who had never been to Nightfall City gaped.

At this moment in the sky.

Shadows intertwined with each other. Eli was high up in the sky, and the twenty celestials attacked at the same time. Their attacks were of all colors, dyeing the sky with all kinds of colors. However, there was one place that did not change. It was the area where Eli was located. It was a deep darkness.

The darkness spread around Eli like an abyss that devoured everything. From time to time, shadows would scatter in all directions to attack the celestials!

In this high-intensity confrontation, Glen sadly discovered that they had fallen into the same situation as last time.

Their role was to protect the weaker Warlocks just in case they were killed by the shockwaves.

However, because the distance was shorter this time, even if they tried their best, there would still be occasional shadows that would pierce through their protection and kill a large number of Warlocks!

As a result, the celestials could only use more power to protect the weaker Warlocks, not paying attention to the battlefield above.

However, even without observing, everyone knew that Eli had the absolute advantage. Every once in a while, a celestial corpse would fall from the sky and lose its life.

Seeing these important figures of the Warlock World fall one by one, the celestials of the Bloodline Tower were even more respectful of Eli, and the Warlocks who were protected were even more shocked!

The eight-armed Naga Warlocks watched in a daze as the important figures died so easily. They didn’t even have much chance to resist. In their respective factions, these celestials occupied a large number of resources and power, enjoying everything!

At this moment, many inexperienced Warlocks felt complicated.

So … Even celestial warlocks would die!

When facing stronger opponents, they would be like those low-level warlocks they had encountered. They could be killed.

This absurd massacre was a little easier than everyone thought. In less than half an hour, as the last celestial was torn in half and blood rained down, everyone knew that the battle was over.

“It’s not over yet!”

The Shadow Dragon’s huge body disappeared and turned into Eli. He flew toward Glenm as he spoke.

“Sir, it’s not over yet?” Glen looked at the approaching Eli, and a look of doubt flashed across his face!

” Yes, the battle with Jesse isn’t over yet. His condition isn’t good. I have to go and support him! ” Eli nodded, then looked at the other celestials and said, “I’ll leave this place to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Eli turned into a golden light and flew into the distance.

Looking at the departing figure of Eli, Glen fell into deep thought.

Who was he? Could it be that someone else?

Moreover … Glen raised his head. If he remembered correctly, Eli always morphed into a blood light when flying, but why was it golden light today?

Glen pursed his lips and felt that his brain was not working well. There was too little information and he could not think at all.

However, there was one thing that was certain.

The war didn’t seem to be over yet.

Thinking of this, Glen’s eyes gradually lit up.

The light was called Hope!

…..

At the same time.

Nightfall City!

At this moment, the sky in this area had turned into a pitch-black night, just like the name of the city.

The night covered the sky, and the battle was taking place. Occasionally, the warlocks would scream from the night. It was from the celestials of the Eight-Armed Naga!

“Another celestial has been killed. There are five left!” A Celestial Warlock was shocked. He was a Celestial who had recently joined the Bloodline Tower!

...

“Yes, our lord is too strong!” The throat of a female Warlock beside him moved slightly, trembling with excitement.

In the darkness, Eli was like an adult dealing with a child. Under siege, every few attacks would kill a celestial. Now that half of them had disappeared, there were only five celestials left, and they were still struggling to survive.

As for the Warlock who had started to clamor, Eli had fulfilled his promise and killed him first!

The Bloodline Tower’s celestials were also filled with excitement. Not only were they happy to be alive, but they were also shocked by Eli’s strength!

Facing Eli’s power, they suddenly understood why the Eight-Armed Naga would resort to such a tactic!

It was already very difficult to defeat Eli by relying on individual strength below the fifth circle.

Soon, as the last celestial in the sky died, Eli also flew towards them.

“My lord!” A few celestials immediately stepped forward.

“I’ll leave the rest to you guys. I’ll go support them!” Eli looked at a few of them and said. After saying that, he turned into a golden light and left.

They were about to congratulate Eli, but they were stunned by Eli’s actions.

Support them?

...

Who?

Could it be that the battle between the other two sides had not ended yet?
