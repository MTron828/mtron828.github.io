193 The New Council

Wearing a robe, Eli walked out of the black Tower prison.

After passing through the forest, he soon arrived at the main area of the White Tower.

“What a great change.”

As Eli walked down the street and looked at the environment around him, he could not help but sigh. Compared to a hundred years ago, both the number and density of buildings had increased by a lot.

!!

Of course, the ones who changed the most were the members of the White Tower, who were much stronger than before.

Ten minutes later, he arrived at the White Tower.

“Stop. This place is off limits.” Two level 3 apprentice guards stopped him.

Eli didn’t expect this to happen either, but he understood in the next second that he hadn’t shown his face for too long. He then took out his token.

“This is … Sir Herman? You’re Sir Herman.” The two guards glanced at the token. At first, they were confused, but then they reacted, and their mouths were wide open.

The man in front of him was one of the legends of the White Tower, Herman.

“Your Excellency, please come in!”

The two guards immediately stepped aside, afraid of provoking Eli.

Naturally, Eli wouldn’t argue with the two guards and walked straight in. The White Tower was no longer in charge of other business and was quite different from before, so it was very spacious. He soon arrived at the door of the meeting room.

He opened the door and walked in.

“Eh, am I the first one to arrive?” When he walked in, there was no one inside. He was actually the first one to arrive, which was a little rare. After thinking for a while, he sat directly in the seat that used to be his.

Half an hour later, the first person came in.

..

Clint was a second-circle wizard who had made a great contribution in an important battle more than ten years ago. He had also become a member of the Parliament.

Today, he was notified to attend the meeting.

“Eh, someone has already arrived.” Looking at the opened door, Clint was a little surprised.

Ever since the meetings were usually delayed by half an hour a few years ago, very few people came so early. He only came earlier today because he had nothing to do. It seemed like someone was even earlier than him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Who is it?” Clint walked in with large strides and was prepared to greet them.

However, when he walked in and saw the only person inside, he was stunned.

“What is this?”

He blinked his eyes and noticed that the seat of the Deputy Speaker, which had been empty all this while, was now occupied by a person.

“He looks young, but his aura is only at the first-ring level. I’ve never seen this person before!” Clint frowned and did not quite understand.

To be able to come here, it was absolutely impossible for him to be an ordinary person. Could he be …

Clint’s eyes widened as he thought of a possibility.

He walked into the meeting room and asked Eli respectfully.

“Hello, my Lord. I’m Clint, the eighth Councilman. Are you Lord Herman? ” Clint asked carefully as he watched Eli approach slowly.

Eli nodded.

“What? Are you really master Herman? I didn’t expect you to come to the meeting.” Clint was in disbelief. This honorary representative had not shown his face for almost a hundred years.

If it weren’t for the Black Tower prison being in operation, some people would have suspected that he was dead.

After greeting him, Clint suppressed his excitement and returned to his seat.

It was too explosive.

However, he immediately realized that something was wrong. Even Herman was in the meeting. What exactly happened?

Following Clint’s arrival, the representatives arrived one by one.

They were also rather shocked to see Eli.

There were eight councilmen, and Eli didn’t recognize any of them. They were all new faces, but the difference was that they were all second-circle warlocks, and one of them was at the limit of second-circle, which showed the difference between the current White Tower and the White Tower of the past.

Another five minutes passed.

Eli finally saw a familiar face.

“Herman, you actually came out!” Rawls joked as he sat on the seat of the Deputy Speaker.

“Haha, what happened?” Eli asked directly. He hadn’t been paying much attention to the outside world recently.

“I don’t know,” Rawls shook his head.

“Alright,” Eli was helpless. It seemed that he could only wait for Kratos to come.

After a while, the other Members of Parliament arrived one by one. Ross also arrived and sat in the seat of another Deputy Speaker. As for Theron, he died in a battle 30 years ago.

Ross and Eli were very familiar with each other. Initially, he wanted to come over and say hello, but Eli only gave him a look. After all, it would be more or less strange for Ross to address Eli as his master on this occasion.

By then, almost everyone had arrived. Eli looked around. Other than Ross and Rawls, he only knew three of the other twelve people. The others were already different.

All twelve of them were also in the second circle. Ross was at the later stage of the second circle, and Rawls was at the limit of the second circle. However, to Eli’s surprise, the first representative was also at the limit of the second ring.

From the others, Eli learned that his name was Lorant, and he had fused with a three-ring bloodline known as the thorned Earth Dragon. He had joined the White Tower by chance and had been here for almost seventy years.

“What do you think of his strength?” Rawls teased in a low voice.

“Not bad.” Eli gave a simple comment.

“Hehe, he’s more than just ‘not bad’. A third-circle bloodline coupled with the strength of a second-circle warlock. I’m probably no match for him now. If not for my seniority, I wouldn’t have been able to suppress him. Also, he’s always been unhappy with Ross becoming the Deputy Speaker. He thinks that there’s something shady going on and has some opinions about you.” Rawls replied rapidly before turning around.

After hearing Rawls ‘words, Eli also realized that it did seem a little like that.

...

Lorant was a man who looked to be in his 30s. His face was a little yellow, and he was very tall. His eyes were khaki, and he would glance at Eli and Ross from time to time.

Eli smiled and did not take it seriously.

It was just a Warlock at Pabulo’s level, and he didn’t guess wrong.

He would not care about what others thought when he appointed one of his own to be the Deputy Speaker.

He shook his head, closed his eyes, and waited for Kratos.

“You’re still the Herman I know.” Rawls chuckled softly as he looked at eli. He had never seen eli panic ever since he met him.

“Damn it!”

Rolant gritted his teeth. He was just testing Herman, but Herman ignored him completely. He just closed his eyes and rested.

“Times have changed, and you still want honorary titles? If I were at my current level back then, I would be able to deal with pabulo as well. Moreover, this man hasn’t made any contributions for decades, but he has always occupied a large number of resources and power.” Lorant took a deep breath.

He was very unhappy, extremely unhappy.

Ten minutes later.

...

Ta ta ta!

The sound of footsteps rang out, and Eli opened his eyes, looking towards the door.

Here came Kratos.

However, compared to a hundred years ago, Kratos had changed a lot.

He was old.

Just like his former teacher, Kratos’ skin was full of wrinkles, his hair was mostly white, and his body was no longer as burly as before.

He was already at the end of his life.

At the end of a Warlock’s life, due to the power of their bloodline, there would be a huge backlash on their appearance, which would make them age faster. Kratos was at this stage.

At this moment, he slowly walked in and saw Eli. He nodded. Eli nodded as well.

Another one was about to die!

As soon as Kratos arrived, the others also became serious.

He slowly walked to the Chairman’s seat, looked at the crowd, sighed, and said in a heavy tone, “Everyone, we’re in big trouble.”
