58 Hijacked?

In the afternoon, Eli walked out of the street, satisfied.

He turned around and saw that it was a rather wide street. On both sides of the street were three-story buildings. Red and purple silk were hung on the buildings, and sexy girls stood at the entrance of the buildings.

“As expected, the place is still a little different from Bryne. They both have their own unique characteristics. ” Eli stretched his back. It wasn’t even noon when he went in, but it was already afternoon when he came out. Eli was proud of himself.

“Sir, you’ve come out.” at this moment, the coachman who had been waiting outside the alley saw that it was eli and quickly came over.

‘This gentleman’s physical strength is really good. He has been here for more than half a day!’

“Sir, where are we going next?” the coachman asked.

” Well, next, we’ll go to the casino here to make up for the money we spent. ” Eli thought for a moment. He had been busy spending a lot of money today, so he had to replenish his funds.

“Alright, Sir, please get in.” The coachman immediately brought Eli to the front of the previous carriage and lifted the curtain of the carriage.

Eli went up directly.

” Please sit tight. I’ll check the carriage, and then we’ll leave. ”

In order to avoid any accidents, every time the carriage started, the coachmen would check to see if the carriage was in good condition. After all, someone would really dismantle the carriage’s parts to exchange for money. If an accident happened, it would be troublesome.

The coachman circled around the carriage while eli was sitting leisurely in the carriage.

He could clearly sense the situation around the carriage with his spiritual power. The coachman was checking the back of the carriage. A figure was hiding in the corner of the alley and seemed to be watching the carriage!

“Oh? ” Eli raised an eyebrow.

It should be a coincidence, but looking at that posture, curled up in the corner, holding his head, it looked more like he was hiding from something!

“Damn it, sir, a small part of the wheel has been stolen. I need to fix it. ” At this time, the driver’s cursing came from behind the carriage. He needed to go to the toilet earlier and left the carriage unwatched. A theft did happen.

In fact, this was a rare situation because most guests wouldn’t stay in one place for too long, but he didn’t expect that eli would be here for so long.

What else could Eli say other than yes? But his attention was on the man in the corner.

He did not move, but he seemed to be afraid of something. His muscles were in a tense state, and from the strength of his aura, he should be a low-level knight.

Eli guessed that he was probably hiding from someone.

“Find him. We must catch him today!”

Suddenly, a few burly men ran out of Camellia Street and searched around.

On the other hand, eli could clearly sense that the man’s aura of fear was even more obvious.

Did the man eat without pay? Or was this revenge? Eli didn’t know, and he didn’t want to know. He just hoped that the man wouldn’t drag him into this.

There were about seven or eight strong men, but the weakest of them was an intermediate Knight. They were exploring the street in this direction. If there were no accidents, they would be able to find the man soon.

The coachman was carefully repairing the car at the back. Suddenly, the man seemed to have made up his mind. While most of the knights on the other side had entered another alley, he rushed directly toward eli.

It was a short seven to eight meters, which only took a few seconds.

The coachman didn’t notice that the man had already slipped into Eli’s car.

A cold light suddenly appeared.

“Take me away!”

The sharp dagger was pointed at Eli, and the shadow of the dagger swayed inside the carriage under the candlelight.

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

It was only then that he saw the man clearly. No, it would be more appropriate to say that he was a boy. He was about 19 years old and looked a little young. He had brown hair and black eyes. Although he looked calm on the outside, Eli’s senses told him that the child was very frightened.

Whether it was his rapidly beating heart, his tensed muscles, or his slightly trembling dagger, all of them spoke of his nervousness.

“Sir, the carriage is fixed. We can leave now.” at this moment, the coachman had also finished repairing the carriage.

“Tell the coachman to bring us away!” the boy said again, still holding the dagger in his hand.

Eli smiled and nodded. Although Wizards were not good at strength, due to the increase in mental strength, his physical fitness was not much weaker than that of a low-ranked Knight.

At this distance, his safety could be completely guaranteed.

“Then let’s go,” Eli said calmly.

This made the boy a little less confident.

Wasn’t he trying to hijack the car? Why wasn’t there any panic in the eyes of the man in front of her?

However, when the carriage started moving, the boy seemed to be much more relaxed.

“What are you afraid of?” suddenly, a voice was heard. The boy saw that it was actually the kidnapped eli. The boy was speechless.

‘Is this something you should be asking? Can’t you have a little self-awareness that you’re being held hostage?

‘You’re just an ordinary person. How can you be so brave?’

“Shut up and keep quiet!” the boy glared at eli and said in a low voice.

“Oh, I see. You’re probably being hunted down. Let me guess, are those people your enemies or hired to kill you? You’re so young, so you’re probably not a Big Shot. You should be the descendant of a great noble or a merchant with status.”

What the boy didn’t expect was that Eli actually started analyzing.

“If you’re a descendant of a noble, you don’t look like one. You don’t have the habit of a noble, and your skin is very fair. You probably don’t go out often. You look more like my friend from the chamber of commerce.

“Are you a descendant of some big merchant association, and you’re being hunted?” As if it was something fun, Eli analyzed the situation.

However, it was only a guess.

“Who are you?”

What Eli didn’t know was at this moment, a storm was already brewing in the boy’s heart. Although Eli’s analysis was strange, he didn’t get much wrong.

“I’m warning you, don’t talk nonsense.” The boy felt a little nervous for some reason, and the dagger in his hand unconsciously moved closer to Eli as if it would give him a greater sense of security.

He extended his dagger.

He saw the man, in front of him, smile at him. Suddenly, he felt a little dizzy. His head was dizzy, and his vision was a little blurry. At the same time, he felt as if he had lost something.

It didn’t take long, only a few seconds.

However, the next time he woke up, he found that the dagger in his hand had already moved from his hand to his neck.

The man in front of him, who was eli, stared at the boy, one hand holding a dagger to his neck as he said politely, “Sir, if you don’t explain why you got into my car without permission, you’ll die!”

He could feel the coldness of the dagger on his neck and face the polite smile of eli. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The boy’s back was instantly drenched in sweat.

He seemed to have just left a wolf’s den and entered a tiger’s den.
