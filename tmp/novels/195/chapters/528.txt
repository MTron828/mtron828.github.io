529 Memories of the Lich King

The Warlock Alliance had made a move against the Bloodline Union!

It was the day when Eli reached the peak of Thousand Leaves.

Even Eli did not expect the Warlock Alliance to have the courage to go all out.

That night, Eli also received detailed news about the war.

“Millions of Warlocks from the Warlock Alliance crossed the border and entered the Western Region. They formed a line to invade and fight, and every part of them had fifth circle combat force.”

Eli took a deep breath.

There was no doubt that the Warlock Alliance’s goal was clear.

That was to completely eradicate the Bloodline Tower, kill their Warlocks, destroy their infrastructure and Warlock system, and completely eradicate the Bloodline Tower.

In fact, they didn’t seem to care about Eli in this battle.

” Or rather, to them, what they care about is the Bloodline Tower, not me. It’s obvious that they want to destroy the Bloodline Tower even if I don’t intervene. If I intervene, they’ll kill me along the way. Is this the Warlock Alliance’s plan?” Eli narrowed his eyes.

An open scheme!

It was a completely open scheme!

The Warlock Alliance seemed to be saying that they would rely on their powerful foundation to destroy the Bloodline Tower!

“How vile.” Eli shook his head.

If it was a few months ago, he might still have some misgivings and choose to protect himself. However, after many times, he already had the power to eliminate trouble and solve this plague.

“Hmph, if you fail again this time, do you still have the foundation to do it again, Warlock Alliance?”

Eli sneered and walked out of the wizard tower.

“Phoenix!” Eli shouted in the distance.

On Hill’s branch, the huge Immortal Bird turned its head, and his eyes lit up when he saw Eli.

Flapping his wings, he flew over and said humbly, “Sir, is there anything you need?”

” To participate in a battle!” Eli smiled, showing his teeth.

Not far away, Hydra also raised its head abruptly and let out a screech!

After a while.

In that direction.

It was near the central region.

..

Southern Region!

It was rare for the two family heads to meet again.

“The Warlock Alliance has launched a war against the Bloodline Tower. Are they crazy?” The Sea Dragon Clan’s head stood up, his eyes filled with shock.

“Who knows what they are thinking? To make matters worse, they had sent out most of their fifth-circle combat strength. There were two peak Thousand Leaves, and there were many Thousand Leaves as well!” Patriarch Sea Shark frowned.

Sigh!

The two of them looked at each other with a hint of worry in their eyes.

This time, the Warlock Alliance was acting like a lunatic, but what was worse was that this was a powerful lunatic. What was even worse was that due to the pressure from many parties, this lunatic had almost used all of its resources!

There were so many fifth-circle Warlocks, and besides the Lich Tower and the Sea Tribe, no other force had so many combat powers. At the very least, the strongest force in the Bloodline Alliance was only Eli.

“We can’t do anything. We can only rely on Lord Eli.” Patriarch Sea Shark said.

“Yes!”

During this period of time, they had also been attacked by the Warlock Union and could not move at all.

In other words, if it weren’t for them, Eli would probably have to face even more fifth-circle warlocks.

“I trust you, sir.”

The two of them looked at each other and prayed for Eli!

..

The Central Region!

Golden Cicada Merchant Association!

“The Lich Tower can’t be dealt with in a short time, but the Western Region is finally coming to an end!” Golden Cicada stroked his long beard as if he could already see the scene of rivers of blood flowing in the Western Regions.

“It’s just a pity for Jin Ji. I originally thought very highly of him!”

He shook his head and felt sorry for his former subordinate.

He was talented and had a good short-term vision, but not in the long run.

Abandoning the Warlock Alliance and choosing the Bloodline Tower was undoubtedly a wrong choice.

“But you chose the path yourself, so you have to bear the consequences!” His tone changed, and a hint of viciousness flashed in his eyes.

At the same time, Jin Ji, who was far away in the Bloodline Tower, had just finished counting the economy of the Bloodline Tower. Looking at the industries with potential, he felt that his future was bright.

However, looking at the bills, he could not help but look into the distance with a hint of worry.

“Sir, you must win!”

He prayed and took out the dice that the adults had given him.

Toss!

Six!

Jin Ji’s eyes lit up.

It was full!

..

At the extreme north.

It was unknown when, but a huge gothic black stone castle had been built here.

Within the castle!

The Lich King sat on his cold throne, looking at the howling cold wind in the distance.

Beside him, a Bone Dragon Lich was reporting something!

“Something like this actually happened in the Central Mainland? The heavens are really helping me!” After listening, he let out a cracking sound, and the green light in his eyes suddenly flickered.

“Then, sir, what should we do?” The Lich asked.

“Hehehe!” The Lich King sneered. “Since humans have given us a chance, how can we not seize it? Gather all the Liches. We have to give them a surprise!”

“Yes, sir!” The Bone Dragon Lich nodded, and the bone wings on its back spread out!

This was indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them.

“Oh? By the way, what was the name of the Warlock who was going against the Warlock Alliance?”The Lich King suddenly asked.

“Sir, he is called Eli, and it is said that he is colluding with a Mage who might have returned from the Wizard Alliance!” The Ancient Dragon-Lich thought for a moment before replying.

“Eli…”

The Lich King muttered softly. He slowly raised his head, and the light in his eyes froze for a moment as if he was recalling something.

“This name is so familiar…Have I heard of it before? Could it be that this person is in my lost memories? I keep feeling that this person has a certain connection with me.” He frowned.

Back then, when he was modifying himself, there were some problems, and some memories were lost!

“Who is it?” The Soul Fire in the Lich King’s eyes burned even more vigorously as he pondered. This made the Ancient Dragon Lich feel a wave of fear!

The flames burned and then extinguished, and the light in the Lich King’s eyes gradually dimmed.

“Forget it. If I can’t remember, then it must not be important!

“Compared to that, it’s more important to destroy the Warlock Alliance, establish a new order, and purify this world. This world shouldn’t be like this. Mages are the correct path. Although I’ve already transformed into a Lich, as long as I can bring peace to this world, everything will be worth it!

“Even if I die, it will be worth it. As for the other Warlocks, they should all be eliminated!

“Eh? Who told me this? He seems to be my teacher? Eh, who is my teacher again?”

In the pitch-black and cold palace, the Bone Dragon Lich could not help but take a few steps back when he saw his master start to spout nonsense, especially those strange words.

Transforming into a Lich would cause one’s soul and will to gradually fall into darkness. There was no doubt that he, the leader, had fallen very deep into it. He was even acting like a paranoid person.

“Purify the world once again and put it on the right track!”

The Bone Dragon shook his head silently.

All they wanted was a longer life!

Phoenix was extremely fast.

Three hours later, Eli saw the front line of the battle.
