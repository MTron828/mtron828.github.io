521 A Line of Words in the History Book

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Everything was calm.

The Warlock Alliance still did not take any action, as if they were being ignored.

However, Eli did not let his guard down. He had his subordinates and the Death Mandala Flower help him to inquire about it. After all, the Warlock Alliance was not a good organization.

Miya had found out what the Warlock Alliance was planning, but it seemed like they hadn’t decided yet.

This made Eli nervous, so he immediately began to condense the Mercury Blade.

He still valued the ‘spell’ that came with the Eye of Mercury!

Condensing the Blade of Mercury was simple. It only required mental strength, but it was not a small expenditure. Three days was equivalent to more than a year’s time, and only a portion of it was condensed.

However, he did not give up. After all, this was also a trump card. In any case, with the Time World Fragment, at least from the outside world, did not actually consume much time.

And during this period of time, there was also a small matter!

Elven Queen Erwin had arrived at the Grassi Land.

Her target was Hill. Eli would come out to relax after his daily cultivation. Occasionally, Liliana would come over.

Just like that.

Time passed slowly.

Three months later, the first Mercury Blade was successfully formed.

“Another trump card!” Eli was delighted.

Perhaps it was a coincidence, but at this moment, Alida’s voice also arrived.

“The alliance has been prepared. Members of the various forces will arrive at the Bloodline Tower in half a month.”

Alida was very efficient!

Eli nodded, very satisfied with this. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After all, this time, the factions came from all over the Central Mainland. Each faction was from all over the world. Three months might seem long, but it was actually not that long. It was obvious that Alida was really concerned.

Eli replied and closed his eyes again.

During this period of time, he had been focusing on the Mercury Blade and had forgotten about the others. He had yet to break through to the fifth level of the Explosive Blood Mystic Technique!

..

Eli went into seclusion.

At this moment, the entire continent was very lively. Although the news about the alliance was hidden, it was quickly learned by various factions and shocked them.

The Warlock Alliance’s forces secretly cursed and sped up in the direction of the Bloodline Tower. The other forces also had their own ideas.

The Central Region.

On the huge Sky Cloud Whale, Jin Ji faced his guild leader.

“Sigh, this step of yours is naturally brilliant if you take the right path. However, if you fail, you’ll probably fall into the abyss and be devoured by the demons!” The white-haired president looked at Jin Ji and sighed.

“Milord, but what’s done is done. This is my choice and has nothing to do with the entire Golden Cicada Merchant Association!” Jin Ji lowered his head.

He had played a huge role in the Alliance this time, and he couldn’t hide it anymore.

“Unrelated?” The white-haired old man only glanced at him and snorted. “I’ve told you many times that we’re just merchants and don’t really get involved in the fights of these major powers. This matter is too big, and I can’t protect you.

“After today, you have nothing to do with Golden Cicada Merchant Association.”

Hearing this, Jin Ji closed his eyes.

A few seconds later, he raised his head and bowed respectfully.

Then, he turned around and left without any hesitation.

The old president didn’t stop him. He just sighed and said slowly, “Sigh, it’s a pity that a good seedling is ruined just like that. Such resistance has happened several times in the past thousands of years, but it has never succeeded. Jin Ji’s vision is still too shallow!

“Forget it, forget it!”

..

Heaven City!

It was a familiar meeting room, but this time, there was one less person.

The six families were the Press Family, the Yunge Family, the Dylo Family, the York Family, the Sella Family, and the Hamis Family. The first three families were the top families, while the last three were the bottom families.

Of course, the Hamis family had already been destroyed, so there were only five of them now.

The old man, Patriarch Press, looked at the other four people with a cold expression.

In fact, he had been like this ever since the Hamis family was exterminated.

“Patriarch Press, there’s no need to be so serious. After all, it’s been a few months since the incident happened.” The old woman sighed. She was the head of the Yunge Clan!

“Yeah, no one expected this. The Bloodline Tower Alliance has already formed, but it’s not a big problem. It’s not like it hasn’t happened before. We’ll just suppress it when the time comes.” The head of Dylo’s family was a mature woman in a sky-blue muslin dress. She had quite the charm.

York and Sella didn’t say anything. They just looked at Patriarch Press.

“Cough cough!” The Press family coughed twice, and everyone gathered their gazes.

“Everyone, don’t let your guard down this time. The Bloodline Tower is completely different from before. Don’t forget the Hamis Family.” He stroked his beard, his gaze sharp.

” Moreover, Eli is very sinister. He’s clearly a fifth-circle warlock, but he’s been hiding his strength for so many years. He’s truly a sinister person. I’m afraid he’s been plotting for many years. This time, he actually wants to form an alliance. This will be quite troublesome for us.”

Hearing that he had evil intentions, everyone nodded in unison.

They completely agreed on this point. This person was too sinister.

“Then how should we deal with him, Patriarch Press?” The head of the Sella family asked in a low and muffled voice. He was a strong man.

“Didn’t we discuss a few plans a few months ago?” He looked at everyone.

Everyone frowned and pondered.

The last meeting was when the Hamis family was destroyed. Everyone was shocked and afraid. The meeting was a mess. It seemed that some plans were discussed, but they were not implemented!

“The first is for us to join forces. The second is for the Lich Tower. The third is…” They told the plan one after another.

The patriarch of the Press family interrupted directly, “Everyone, it’s best if we don’t do anything. After all, if we lose the fifth circle, everyone will have a headache. I remember that there was a plan to draw in a world fragment that contained powerful creatures. This is very suitable!

“My idea is that we don’t stop them for now. When the day of the Alliance’s launch comes, we’ll directly draw in that world fragment and use it to destroy them, including Eli!”

“Yes, but are you sure that it can kill them?” The plump woman asked worriedly.

“Don’t worry. There’s a flock of Undying Birds in that world fragment that’s tainted by the black fog laws. Their leader is a peak thousand-leaf, Pheonix King. Even my family can’t deal with them.

Moreover, the Undying Bird specialized in souls, and it was even more so after being contaminated by the black fog. Ordinary Thousand Leaves Warlocks would not be able to resist it, and even Eli was no exception.

“We’ve calculated that in order to kill the Phoenix King, one must have a powerful mental force and a powerful mental force attack that explodes in an instant or have the strength of a thousand flower. At the very least, it’s impossible for someone with a dragon bloodline like Eli to kill the phoenix. This time, he’ll definitely die.”

Patriarch Press was full of confidence.

They had only discovered this World Fragment by chance and did not dare to enter for fear of attracting the flock of Undying Birds. Now was indeed the perfect solution to deal with Eli.

“Indeed!”

Hearing Patriarch Press’s analysis, everyone nodded.

“What a pity for such a good resource!” The plump woman sneered, her chest trembling.

The others also smiled as if they had already seen the tragedy in the Alliance.

At that time, the various factions would be leaderless, and they would naturally take over these organizations. At that time, the Warlock alliance would be even stronger than before.

Eli.

It was just a line of words in history.
