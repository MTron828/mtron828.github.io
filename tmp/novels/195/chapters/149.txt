150 Virus

Destroying a world was a mage’s specialty.

From the books gathered by the four circle celestial, Nick, there were many processes for a mage to conquer the world. Among them was a set of processes on how to destroy the world. Among them, there were things about the collapse of continental plates, rule traps, virus transmission, cutting off the source of bloodlines, causal exchange, and so on, which left a deep impression on Eli.

Since he wanted to destroy it, there was no need to care about what happened. He had to be ruthless. Eli’s idea was to develop a virus.

By creating a suitable virus, then letting them break out at the right time to create chaos, that was the basic idea of Eli.

As for how to deal with the virus, Eli had some ideas.

!!

That was to modify an existing virus.

Of course, the biggest problem now was how to get the virus. The solution was very simple.

It was the magic plant division.

As the Department grew magic plants, every few years, there would be a virus that contaminated the plants, just like the insects from more than a decade ago.

Usually, after a Department solved a problem, they would keep a part of it for safekeeping. It was not for research purposes but for the convenience of resolving it if they encountered similar problems in the future.

Thus, Eli quickly found Rona.

“Rona, go and help me find all the viruses in the magic plants Department.” Eli said calmly as he sat on the chair.

“Sir, this is not allowed!” Rona exclaimed, ” all viruses are very dangerous. Some of them are completely solved by a freak combination of factors. If they are accidentally released, it will cause great damage to the camp. Unless you have the battalion commander’s token, this will not be approved.” Rona quickly said.

“Is that so?” Eli nodded, indicating for Rona to leave.

After Rona left, he quickly went to find Kratos.

“My Lord, I need your orders. I need the virus storage of the magic plant division.” Eli said.

“Sure.” Kratos agreed immediately. It was a critical time now. Besides relying on others, more people were already on the move. The work of Eli and the others were also very important, so he would satisfy them to the best of his ability.

Soon, Eli returned to the Department with Kratos ‘orders.

Rona, who knew that Kratos had already agreed, was shocked and couldn’t believe it.

“Let’s go. We’re short on time.” Eli cast a glance at Rona.

“Alright, Minister.” Rona nodded, but he was puzzled.

Soon, Eli was brought to a building.

On the outside, it was a pitch-black Tower, and the body of the tower was covered with all sorts of plants. But when Eli walked in, he realized that there was actually a staircase that extended downwards.

“My Lord, all the dangerous things in the camp are kept here.” Rona introduced.

“Yes.”

Rona lit up the elemental lamps at the side, and the dim lights lit up one by one, illuminating the path to the stairs for Eli. Looking at the bottom of the tower, which was probably tens of meters deep, Eli walked down.

A few minutes later, the two of them arrived at the bottom of the tower.

There was a huge space at the bottom with a few large doors. Two warlocks were guarding the doors. They were both zero-circle warlocks, and their eyes were determined.

After showing Kratos’ token, the two guards opened one of the stone doors.

“My Lord, I won’t be going in.” Rona looked inside, and his throat moved slightly.

Eli looked inside as well. It wasn’t a big room, and there was only one shelf. There were several bottles and cans on the shelf, and most of them were black or green substances. One of the bottles seemed to be leaking, and there were green mold spots and spider webs all around.

“Only ten?” Eli glanced at the bottle on top and walked in while Rona stood outside the door in fear.

Eli took out a rectangular box and opened it. Then, under the control of his spiritual power, the ten bottles slowly flew up and entered the box one by one, and the box closed again.

His goal had been achieved.

With the box in hand, Eli walked out the door.

“Let’s go,” he said. After beckoning Rona, Eli took the lead and left.

Rona, on the other hand, was looking at Eli in fear. His heart was already in his throat. Oh my God, what was the Minister trying to do by taking away so many viruses?

Does he want to destroy the camp?

…

A month passed in the blink of an eye. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In the laboratory.

On the wide, white table, ten culture media were lined up in a row, and inside were the viruses that Eli had brought from the bottom of the tower.

On the other hand, Eli was in protective gear, observing the ten viruses in turn. After a month of cultivation, he needed to make a preliminary choice.

“It’s too dependent on the environment. I don’t think it can expand too much …”

“This won’t do either. This infectious power is too trashy. At most, it can only destroy a small town.”

“That’s alright. It’s just that the outbreak period is too short, so it’s not suitable.”

…

“This one is not bad.”

Eli observed them one by one and numbered them. Finally, numbers one, five, and six stood out.

However, the strength of the virus was far from enough. Eli took a deep breath and decided to add something else to the virus.

The operation began again. At this time, the laboratory had been completely disinfected. Eli continued to ensure that the things inside would not be leaked out or the arcane realm would be in trouble.

…

Another month passed.

“No. 1’s reproductive ability is too strong. It needs to be weakened appropriately. Also, the pollution is not enough.”

“Number five seems to be able to influence even apprentices. Is it really that good? I need to do more research.”

“Number six pulled is out. However, it’ll detonate when it encounters strong mental power during the hibernation period. Perhaps I can make use of it and detonate it remotely when the time comes. I don’t have to enter the battlefield personally then.”

The research work was getting more and more urgent. On the other side, Eli didn’t know if it was an illusion, but the environment around the camp was starting to get a little tense.

Kratos brought back a lot of people from his trip, and all the resources in the camp were being tightened. Even the magic plants Department began to harvest in advance, and the magic potion Department was suddenly asked to work overtime.

Under Kratos ‘will, the low-level pace of the camp suddenly accelerated, but only the camp staff felt it was a big deal. The outsiders didn’t feel anything and lived normal lives.

In their eyes, this was just a camp, a place where everyone gathered and communicated. It belonged to the shadow lizard Warlock Academy. Whether Kratos was the battalion commander or not had nothing to do with them. Perhaps one day, Kratos would lose his backer, and the camp might have nothing to do with him.

Eli thought that this might be one of the reasons why Kratos wanted to form an organization.

The Academy was the Academy, and he was himself. He couldn’t rely on the academy forever.

Eli expressed his support. If they succeeded, it would be very different for Eli. If they failed, it wouldn’t be that big of a problem. At most, he could just change his face and join another organization. These were all small problems.

However, no one wanted to fail, so he focused more on the virus.

…

Another half a month passed.

In the laboratory, Eli looked at the only remaining virus No. 1, and a smile appeared on his face.

It was a success.

He had only rested for a few days in the past three months, but the effect was still very good.

This virus was a fungal virus. It had a long incubation period, but as long as there was a large amount of mental strength, it could erupt at any time. The most interesting thing was that it could also infect acolytes to a certain extent. It was a truly powerful virus.

The only pity was that its lifespan was very short. However, it was also good as it could prevent it from being widely spread when the time came.

“It’s almost time.” Looking at the virus, Eli nodded.

With this, it would be much easier to cause damage. Rather than doing small damage to a small area, it would be better to affect a big area. Although this virus was ineffective against the first-circle warlocks, it was still a very vicious virus even for the zero-circle warlocks.

“Sigh, I was too kind and deliberately shortened the virus’ lifespan…” Eli shook his head. With the warlock’s ability, it would take a long time for them to come up with a countermeasure. By the time they could resolve it on their own, the war would probably be over soon.

And the three months were getting closer and closer.

Eli also began to collect resources. He packed up the things from the mage relic disposal Department, and the magic plants Department also took items worth thousands of magic stones and exchanged them for various resources they needed.

By the time everything was over, half a month had already passed.

…

“It’s about time. You guys should leave. The start time of the war has also been decided. It will be in one and a half months. So if you want to make arrangements in advance, you should hurry up and leave.” Kratos looked at the three of them with a serious expression.

“Yes.” Rawls nodded and revealed a confident smile.

He had been doing something big in the past three months, and he believed he could one-up Eli this time.

“We’re going to leave now.” Naturally, Evena and Eli were well-prepared.

“When the time comes, contact me with the token. I still have things to do here, so I won’t keep you.”

After a simple instruction, Eli took the map of the shadow lizard Warlock Academy and left. He returned home directly and left after making sure that everything was taken.

On the way, Eli met Alice.

“My Lord, are you leaving?” Alice asked curiously as she looked at the fully-equipped Eli.

“Yes.” Eli nodded. This lady had known him for many years and had grown up in the camp. It was a pity that she did not know that the camp was about to be gone.

“Alice, if possible, I suggest you leave the camp more often to see the outside world,” suggested Eli. This was already the limit of what he could say.

“What do you mean?” Alice raised her brows, not understanding what he meant. She was about to ask when she realized that Eli had already walked out toward the main road.

“Ridiculous!” Alice blinked her eyes.

However, Eli’s suggestion didn’t sound like a bad idea. It just so happened that she had been feeling a little stuffy in the camp recently, giving her a sense of oppression like before a storm.

It was very strange.
