555 The Continent Shakes

The outside world!

Under the pitch-black sky, more than 20 warlocks stopped in midair, including Alida. However, no one spoke or made a sound.

The entire sky was as quiet as a land of silence.

Finally, Alida couldn’t take it anymore. She turned to Jin Ji and asked, “Jin Ji, what do you think our lord’s chances are?”

Jin Ji’s face was filled with sorrow. He glanced at Alida before sighing, “Lord Pagoda Master, I don’t know either, but I’m afraid that Lord’s winning rate isn’t as high as imagined!”

Jin Ji said tactfully.

However, someone beside him was very direct. It was a man with a dark face. He said rudely, “At most 30%. I think everyone should pack up and prepare to leave.”

“Sabo, what are you talking about?” Kyle directly reprimanded him without any politeness, his two eyebrows raised high!

“What did I say? Am I not telling the truth? There are hundreds of them, not just one, ten, or twenty. Tell me you think we can win.” The warlock named Sabo was a divine tree warlock, but he actually refuted him directly. It was obvious that he was very flustered at the moment.

“You…” The old man Kyle glared at him and cursed.

Sabo didn’t stand on ceremony.

The two five-ringed warlocks actually started to curse each other in the sky without grace.

Alida looked at this scene helplessly.

One question had actually caused them to quarrel internally. It was obvious that the hearts of these fifth-circle warlocks were far from calm. It could even be said that they were panicking, which was why they were like this.

In fact, although she believed in Eli, in her heart…

However, she couldn’t panic at this time. She coughed and said, “Both of you are fifth circle warlocks. It won’t be good for you to argue in front of hundreds of thousands of people in Bloodline City!”

Her words still worked.

The two of them glanced at her, and Kyle immediately stopped talking. Sabo, who was beside her, also revealed an angry expression, but he didn’t say anything and remained silent in the corner.

For a moment, the scene fell silent again.

“Hey!” In response, Alida sighed and looked down at the ground. At this moment, countless people in Bloodline City were looking up at the sky. In the distance, many people were kneeling in front of the statue of Eli, praying for something!

Obviously, they weren’t the only ones worried.

“Eh, what happened?” Suddenly, Alida narrowed her eyes. She saw that the countless Warlocks on the ground seemed to have discovered something. They stood up one by one and began to cheer.

Could it be…

She suddenly turned her head and looked at the sky.

The originally dark sky suddenly brightened up, and the shadows gradually dispersed. The sunlight in the sky slowly scattered from within, and in the light, Eli slowly flew down to the ground.

Behind him, in the dark shadows, only blood-colored fog and a deathly aura could be seen. The figures of more than a hundred people had completely disappeared.

“Where are the enemies?”

Her pupils dilated. It was not just him. Everyone around him was also looking at Eli, but no one spoke.

The brain of a high-ranking Warlock worked very quickly. Looking at the scene in the sky, they could not help but imagine it. Looking at the unscathed Eli and the enemy disappearing, could it be that the Lord had really defeated them?

Was that even possible?

Was this reasonable?

Their mouths were wide open, and they felt their worldview begin to shatter.

Eli flew down slowly and arrived in front of everyone.

“Sir, are you alright?” Looking at the unharmed Eli, Alida stood up and asked.

“It’s alright. The enemies have all been dealt with.” Eli nodded.

Hearing the confirmation, Alida’s throat moved slightly. She wanted to say something, but she couldn’t.

“Solved? Did the lord kill those hundred Warlocks?” Sabo asked directly.

“Yes!”

Hiss!

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air at the same time and looked at Eli in awe.

There was no doubt that there was no need for Eli to lie to them about this matter!

But wasn’t this too ridiculous?

“Just how strong is Milord?” The white-haired Kyle looked at Eli’s young appearance and had the greatest doubt in his life. He did not understand!

Sabo didn’t say anything. He regretted what he had said earlier. He just hoped that no one would tell Eli about this.

“As expected of my lord!” Jin Ji heaved a sigh of relief.

However, looking at the relaxed look on Eli’s face, he sighed with emotion.

He was too strong!

Everyone could not help but be shocked. However, they were fifth circle after all, so they quickly calmed down.

However, on the ground, all the Warlocks of Bloodline City were almost going crazy.

“The lord won. The lord won!”

“I knew it. It’s impossible for the lord to lose. I wonder what a bunch of old fellows are trying to do. Didn’t you get punished by the lord?”

“That’s great. It’s over?”

Countless people were celebrating on the streets as if they had gone crazy. There were also children running on the streets, loudly announcing the results of the war as if they had won.

Their reaction was not without reason.

After all, ever since the establishment of the Bloodline Alliance, the entire continent had become one, and the system had changed. This changed the atmosphere and appearance of the continent, and everyone could feel that they were moving up.

They would never be willing to return to the rule of the past!

And today, they encountered the biggest crisis since the establishment of the alliance.

Fortunately, Sir Eli stood up again and killed the enemy, ending the crisis. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the blink of an eye, the number of people in front of the statue of Eli had increased. Of course, it was not just there. It was the same all over the world.

The entire continent was in an uproar.

The Amina Family!

The old Selona sat in his seat. His turbid eyes seemed to see through the hall and saw the cheering family members outside. A smile appeared on his face.

The current Amina Family was the first to join the Bloodline Tower, and they had almost grown into a second-class force. They were on the same level as before, and he was gradually approaching his twilight years.

And all of this started from that afternoon.

“My lord!” He sighed deeply.

Who would have thought that the Warlock, who had easily suppressed him back then, would have grown to such an extent? The Bloodline Tower, a rank three force, had grown to become the number one force on the continent.

And all of this happened in just a few hundred years!

“After today’s battle, the Alliance will only have to deal with the Lich Tower. I wonder if I can see the day when the continent is unified.” He sighed deeply and then slowly closed his eyes.

He was too old!

The Central Region!

The president of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce’s face was ashen, and his body was motionless!

“It’s over? He could win even this?! This is too exaggerated!” The old voice was trembling in disbelief.

Even now, he still could not accept the fact that Eli had won.

“How did he win? That shouldn’t be the case. How could he win? How could he win!” He had a half-smile on his face and seemed to be crying. He kept muttering and didn’t stop.

Not far away, his former subordinates saw this scene and couldn’t bear it.

How did the former president become like this?

It was as if he had gone crazy.

However, they also understood that there would be no more opportunities for them to rise up in the future. It was likely that not long after, these people would also leave one after another.

The Golden Cicada Merchant Association would become history!
