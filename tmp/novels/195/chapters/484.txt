485 Enraged

Eli opened his eyes again. He was no longer in the mage tower but in a room.

The silver walls were covered with runic patterns, and there was only Eli in the empty room.

Shaking his head, Eli stood up and walked to the door to push it open. In front of him was a huge command room. The glass windows on all sides allowed one to directly observe the outside. All the higher-ups of the Bloodline Tower were here.

This was also the Bloodline Tower’s battle command center, and it was also an airship specially made by the Alchemy Department.

When they saw Eli enter, everyone present turned their heads, their eyes filled with respect!

“Sir Eli!”

Vivika and Nikola came to Eli and greeted him.

Eli nodded and went straight to the huge window. Outside the huge observation room, one could see hundreds of airships flying around the command room. Thousands of Warlocks on the ground were like ants.

Opposite them was a magnificent city.

The tall iron wall was a few hundred meters tall, connecting the huge mountain ranges on both sides. The nine doors in the center were arranged in a row, and they were tightly shut. Tens of thousands of Magical Beast Army and third circle Warlocks were flying in the sky, as well as tens of thousands of Warlocks in front of the fortress.

This was the final pass to the heart of the Abyss.

Mountain Stronghold-Rolle City!

“Sir, Rolle City was built during the Mage Era, so the city walls still retain a portion of the spell formation. We can’t break through it directly, so we can only force our way through!” Vivika came to Eli’s side and said.

“Yes!”

Eli nodded and found that the wall was indeed covered with some ancient runes.

“Milord, it is estimated that the entire army will arrive in three days. They should launch an attack within a week.” Nikola also walked over.

“Alright, then we’ll attack in a week!” Eli made his decision.

“Yes, sir!”

After giving the order, Eli turned his gaze to the City!

He looked at the city tower.

“They’re all still here. It seems like they’re waiting for me to show my face!” Eli pursed his lips and smiled.

“When the time comes, the Blood Celestial Body is still not good. It seems that I have to try a new form.” Eli had been familiarizing himself with the Blood Celestial Body these days and realized that he could use not only the celestial Form but also the Bloodline avatar Form. However, it would be much weaker than the celestial Form.

“It should be weakened by at least forty percent, but it should be enough.”

Eli grinned, and the bloodline power in his body rolled like waves, making rumbling sounds. This made the others look sideways and then quickly lowered their heads.

Nikola glanced at Eli and blinked.

Although he had never seen it before, he vaguely knew that Eli seemed to have developed a new method recently, but he had never seen it before.

It seemed that he would be able to see it this time.

“They’re here. Eli should be here too.”

At this moment, in the wizard tower in Rolle City, everyone opened their eyes again.

“Let’s wait for them to take the initiative to attack. It’s impossible for them to break through this city in a short period of time, but the Bloodline Tower lacks time to delay this war. So, Eli will definitely show up.” the old man said.

“Good!”

Everyone nodded and closed their eyes to rest!

They knew very well that the upcoming battle would probably be a life-and-death battle. They had to reach their peak state.

..

A week passed in the blink of an eye.

The war was about to begin!

The command room retreated to the back of the battlefield while Nikola and Vivika entered the middle of the battlefield.

At this moment, hundreds of thousands of warlocks were standing on the ground dozens of miles away from Rolle City. Their faces were cold as they looked at their opponents who were about to fight.

In the sky, countless airships had their elemental cannons ready to fire, emitting a cold light. On the ground, there were also large-scale war magic weapons that were more than a hundred meters tall, which were used to attack cities.

In Rolle City.

Many Warlocks looked solemnly at the front. Although the few Warlocks in the front were also frowning, they were not so flustered because they knew that they would definitely win this time.

“With the six of you here, even if it’s Eli, he will die today!”

“It’s time to end the war!”

The few of them looked at each other and did not say anything, but the corners of their mouths curled up into a smile.

“I wonder what methods they will use to ambush Sir Eli.” On the ground, Vivika stood on a tall chariot, wearing silver armor. She looked ahead with a hint of worry in her eyes.

All signs indicated that there was definitely a big gift in Rolle City!

“Don’t worry, Milord won’t lose!” At this moment, a hand patted his shoulder.

“Uncle Nikola!” She turned around and saw Nikola floating in the air.

” I have followed him for many, many years,” he consoled with a smile. “His Lordship is a legend.

“As everyone knew, legends would continue to exist.”

“I hope so!” Vivika nodded.

Nikola smiled and looked at the battlefield.

“Milord, it’s already the scheduled time.” At this moment, a Warlock came and reported to Nikola.

“Alright, then send out the order to attack. Then…” Nikola waved his hand and was ready to attack. However, in the next second, his hand suddenly pointed at the sky, and his mouth gradually opened.

Nikola’s reaction quickly attracted everyone’s attention, and they also looked at the sky.

In the sky, a streak of blood flew directly to the front of the battlefield. A surging aura spread across the entire battlefield like a mountain, and it pressed directly toward Rolle City.

“Sir Ely!”

“Ah, why did Milord make the first move this time?”

Everyone present was stunned. This was not the plan.

“It seems like this time. Milord is not trying to turn the tide but to break through the city alone!” Nikola’s throat moved slightly, but his eyes were filled with excitement. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This is too dangerous. We should have waited for the other party to make their move first.” Vivika was a little worried, but her eyes were fixed on Eli in the sky.

Not only them but everyone on the battlefield raised their heads and looked at the familiar figure in the sky.

“It’s Sir Eli. What is he doing?”

“Why hasn’t there been an issue to attack? Is Milord preparing to attack alone?”

“Is he crazy?”

“Looks like he’s courting death!”

Hundreds of thousands of people looked up at this figure.

The eyes of tens of thousands of people were on him.

Feeling the spying from all directions, Eli’s eyes were like torches as he looked at Rolle City.

In the next second, a voice traveled dozens of miles.

“Six pieces of trash from the Heart of the Abyss. Get out here!” Eli shouted.

The sound waves rolled like the might of the heavens. The disdainful voice carried arrogance and entered everyone’s ears like a tsunami. Everyone was shocked.

The only thing that puzzled him was…

What exactly were the six pieces of trash?
