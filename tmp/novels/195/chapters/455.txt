456 Udo’s Daughter? Dragon Hunt

A month later!

Thank you readers!

Liliana had visited, and Eli had received the latest news.

“Sir Eli, yesterday, the Golden Cicada Merchant Association’s Vice-President of the Western Region, Apland, died. Currently, the Golden Cicada Merchant Association is completely controlled by Ginger. I feel that you might be very interested in this news, so I came to inform you!” Liliana said.

“Apland!”

Eli nodded. It seemed that the assassination attempt yesterday was planned by Apland. However, Jin Ji’s counterattack was also very fast!

“Of course, we have a little more inside information. I wonder if you’re interested.” Liliana sat down beside him and leaned over.

“Oh?”

“I heard that Jin Ji was ambushed by Apland, but he didn’t die. That’s why these things happened. It should be because of the economy and power!” Liliana whispered.

“I know!”

“What? Does Milord know?” Liliana looked up and exclaimed in surprise.

“It happened a few days ago when Jin Ji visited me in the Bloodline Tower,” Eli said calmly.

“Ah!” Liliana’s jaw dropped.

This matter was the biggest news in the Western Region, but she didn’t expect it to be related to Eli. Moreover, judging from the recent relationship between the Bloodline Tower and the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce, the relationship between these two must be extraordinary. But how was this possible? How could they know each other?

Liliana looked at Eli with curiosity.

“How many secrets does this man have?”

“Oh, right, the one who assassinated Jin Ji was a Radiant Sun warlock wearing a Mandala Flower robe. Do you know which assassin organization this is?” Eli suddenly asked. This was also a question that he was curious about. After all, it was a little ridiculous to have a Radiant Sun level assassin organization!

“Mandala Flower!” Liliana sat up and moved slightly. “Sir, are you sure it’s the Mandala Flower?”

“Yes!”

“Hiss! “Liliana gasped and said solemnly, “If it’s not a disguise or something, then you should be talking about the Death Mandala. This is one of the largest assassin organizations in the Central Region. They are famous and have a record of successful assassinations of half-step fifth circle people.”

“Eh!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. Killing a member at the peak of Radiant Sun, this should be considered provoking, right?

Liliana understood something when she saw Eli’s reaction. If Eli had saved Jin Ji, then Eli must have killed someone.

“Of course, you don’t have to worry, my lord. Ever since Mandala’s leader, Miya, took office more than a hundred years ago, she set a rule. Even if they encounter an accident, they won’t do anything that doesn’t have much benefit unless someone asks them to assassinate you!” Liliana comforted.

Hearing this, Eli relaxed a little. After all, no one wanted to be targeted by an assassin organization!

Wasn’t this the name of the unlucky daughter of Udo?

“Miya? What else do you know about this person0?” Eli turned around and asked. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Although she didn’t know why her lord was interested in this organization, she still replied, “Miya, I don’t know about her combat strength, but I heard that she was once a warlock from the Western Region. It’s said that she was killed by an assassin organization when she was young, and then she grew up and destroyed an assassin organization by herself.”

Alright, Eli confirmed that this was Udo’s daughter. Her experience was almost the same, especially in the beginning, let alone the rest.

However, she did not seem to need his care. She was fine!

Moreover, it was so far away, so Eli felt that the two of them did not have much interaction. There was a high chance that they would not meet!

He waved his hand. After Eli asked some more questions, the two of them entered the room!

A month later!

Liliana left.

Eli also started two experiments at the same time.

One was an experiment to remove the black fog outside the shadow law, and the other was an experiment to mix bloodline avatar and celestial Body!

In order to experiment, Eli built a large number of laboratories on a large amount of land outside the Grassi Lands and recruited many Warlocks to assist in his experiments. He had also done some small branches, just like in the Western Regions, and he was in charge of the main part.

These Warlocks had been through the transformation of the Bloodline Tower by Eli over the years, and they could barely do the job. Although it was just some simple tasks, it could save Eli a lot of time!

Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner!

…

A year later!

The Shadow Laboratory was a laboratory built to study the Black Fog and the rules of purification. It was built in the Grassi Land. Apart from that, Eli would also come here every day to comprehend the shadows!

This day was no exception.

In the laboratory, Eli looked ahead.

In front of him was an experimental instrument that was a hundred meters long. It was like a huge glass tube that was slightly slanted. On both sides were elemental particle launchers that Eli had personally refined. In the center was the shadow law that was controlled within. The black fog was wrapped around it, but it was controlled by an invisible force field!

Eli walked to the side and turned on the device. Instantly, the devices on both sides were activated, and weak particles flew toward the center at a speed that was invisible to the naked eye.

The shadow did not change, but a trace of the black fog was separated and then entered a glass container on the other side of the pipe.

Eli leaned forward and observed with his silver eyes, analyzing the separated black mist.

Soon, the black fog dispersed bit by bit, and Eli finished his observation!

” The black fog that entwines the Law of Shadow seems to have more characteristics than ordinary black fog, so it can’t be directly removed by the power of purification. It seems that I need to constantly test and use a large number of resources to determine what these characteristics are.” Eli made a judgment!

Unlike when he was at the Bryne Empire, he did not have to worry about funding for his experiments. After all, he had such a large organization, so he did not lack ordinary money and resources. This was also the reason why he wanted to establish an organization.

“Take it slow. After all, these are the laws!”

Eli shook his head and separated a few wisps of black fog to observe. He also compared it with the ordinary black fog he had collected previously.

An hour later, the experiment was over, and Eli began to comprehend the rules.

Darkness…Shadow…Change …

As time passed, Eli’s understanding of shadows deepened bit by bit. He even felt that the power of shadow magic had a slight increase!

After three hours, Eli sealed off the laboratory and went to another place, another laboratory!

Different from the previous laboratory, this laboratory was located outside the Grassi Land. It occupied dozens of acres and had more than a thousand people.

As soon as Eli walked into the area, he was immediately recognized. Then, Nikola flew over from afar. He was temporarily in charge of this area!

“How’s the experiment going? ” Eli asked!

“Sir, you know that Warlocks don’t know anything about the mages. They don’t have a deep understanding of bloodlines either. Moreover, it’s only been a month, so there hasn’t been much progress!” Nikola explained.

Eli nodded. ” That’s normal. What you need to do now is to find the commonality between the bloodline and the celestial, or rather, the turning point between the soul and the flesh. Take it slowly. This will take a lot of time, and I will be involved.”

“Yes, sir. But there is still a problem. Sir’s bloodline is of the dragon species. Although Sir gave us a few hundred liters of the dragon species bloodline, it is still too little for experiments. We even need to use living bodies for experiments. I think Sir might need to find some alternative dragons or even real living dragons.” Nikola said again.

“A living dragon?” Eli pondered!

What Nikola said was not wrong. They definitely could not experiment on him, so he naturally had to find some living specimens.

But dragons…It seemed that this thing was not commonly seen. Eli had only seen a red dragon in the Western Regions and even extracted some blood, but other than that, he had never seen a living dragon… No, there seemed to be dragons in the green fields….. Perhaps he could secretly go and catch one!

“Alright, I’ll bring a living one back later.”

Eli nodded. At the same time, his doppelganger in the green field left the elf territory and flew deeper into the green field.

Dragon Hunt!
