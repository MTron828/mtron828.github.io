493 The Wrath of the Warlock Alliance

Heaven City!

It was still the same room in the tower.

However, this time, the few family heads were not as motivated as before. It could even be said that their expressions were uglier than the previous time, and the atmosphere was extremely solemn.

“Everyone, there is no doubt that our plan has failed. The team heading to the Bloodline City is missing, and the team heading to the Green Field has been surrounded by millions of foreign races.” The white-haired old man in the lead gritted his teeth and said. His tone made people shudder.

The other clan patriarchs frowned in astonishment.

What happened this time was too ridiculous!

It was fine if Bloodline City had been defeated, but why would there be a riot in Greenfield? This wasn’t the first time they had crossed Greenfield. Why was there such a big problem this time?

A million alien races?

The entire green field was probably involved. This was too f * cking ridiculous!

“Damn it. The Green Field Outsiders don’t even put us in their eyes. We must make them pay the price!” One of the family heads reprimanded him angrily.

“Indeed, if we don’t do anything, we’ll lose all our face!” Another clan head said.

“Cough, cough, cough!” At this time, Azak, the head of Hamis’ family, coughed and said, “Everyone, we are acting in secret. If we take revenge, won’t we be exposed? Moreover, our involvement in the war in the Western Regions will be completely exposed, and the consequences will be even worse.”

Hearing Azak’s words, the others fell silent.

Yes, they seemed to be acting in secret.

Wouldn’t revenge be like stabbing oneself?

But were they going to let go just like that? That would be too aggrieved.

The scene was solemn, and everyone bit their lips lightly. At this moment, the white-haired Patriarch of Press spoke again, his expression solemn. “And there was another one. Before the team was destroyed, according to the info, the leader of the foreign races seemed to be a human. Most importantly, his methods seem to be that of an elite mage!”

“Elite mage?”

The five of them were stunned and looked at him in unison.

“Yes, it seems to be at least at the advanced stage of the celestial Realm!” The old man nodded with a solemn expression.

Hiss!

Hearing this, everyone’s expression turned solemn.

There were Mages who returned by chance, but they usually came back to look for resources. But if the old man was right, the Mage controlled the entire Green Field. This was not something that a Mage who returned by chance should do.

“And a few years ago, when I entered the Green Field, I happened to hear some rumors. It was said that there were people from the Mage Alliance returning to the Green Field. They said that the Mage Alliance was about to return.” The old man threw out another grenade.

As soon as he finished speaking, the few of them could no longer maintain their composure.

None of them cared about the western region anymore. Compared to that, this news completely affected their interests. If the Mages returned, their families, which had been entrenched for thousands of years, would definitely be the first to be cleaned up!

Is the news accurate? They looked at the old man and asked nervously.

“I haven’t confirmed it yet, but I’ve already sent someone to investigate.” The patriarch of the Press family shook his head. His face was filled with worry as he sighed. “Everyone, we must be prepared for this matter. As for the matter in the Western Regions, let’s not worry about it for now. Send a warning letter and ignore it. No matter what, we have to find out if the Mages are really preparing to return.”

The worried words made everyone nod.

No matter what happened in the Western Regions, at least they still had a way.

If the mages really did return, it would be a huge problem.

“Did they say the name of that Mage?” At this moment, Azak suddenly asked.

The old man looked at him and then slowly said,

“The people of the Green Field call him Roland.”

“Mage Roland!”

..

At the front line.

“How boring. No one resisted, and they were slaughtered so easily.”

Eli shook his head, recalling yesterday’s battle, feeling bored.

Yesterday’s battle was really a lot of talk but little action. They thought that it would be a big battle, but they didn’t expect the Alliance army to give up on resisting. They didn’t lose many people and took down the army.

In just half an hour, the war was over.

“Of course, I can’t blame them!” A hint of pity flashed in Eli’s eyes.

If he were part of the Union’s army, he would probably turn around and run away.

The only pity was that all the races had left after the war, especially the races in the core area. When they saw Eli, it seemed that they were very resistant to him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s a pity. After all, there aren’t many opportunities to gather all the foreign races.”

Eli shook his head with some regret.

Pa, pa, pa!

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. The airship door slowly opened, and Vivika walked in.

“Sir, the Warlock Union has sent a letter requesting us to stop the war.” Vivika took out a letter and handed it to Ely.

“There’s no need to show it to me. Just pretend you didn’t see it.” Eli waved his hand and let Vivika take him away.

“Yes, sir!” Vivika nodded.

The war had already reached this stage. It was true that it could not be stopped by just a letter.

“There’s one more thing. The Warlocks of the Hamis clan in the eastern part of the Western Regions have also withdrawn. They seem to have given up on their advances.” Vivika seemed to remember something and reported again.

“Yes, I understand.”

Eli nodded.

In his opinion, retreating was inevitable. Two armies were completely annihilated. The Hamis family’s advance was naturally meaningless. Retreating was only a matter of time.

The only thing that surprised him was that the Hamis family moved too quickly.

It was so fast that it was abnormal. It seemed that there should be other things affecting the retreat.

Eli had roughly guessed the reason, which was that Roland’s identity might have been exposed.

However, this did not matter. It was just a fake identity. Moreover, it could hold back the Warlock Union for a while, allowing Eli to focus on the Heart of the Abyss.

“How long until we reach the City of Dawn?” asked Eli.

“Three days!” Vivika replied.

Three days.

Eli nodded. This time was fine. His main body had enough time to come.

“Very good. Get the entire army ready. The final battle is about to begin.” He smiled and said.

If the war were won, the Western Region would be completely in his hands.

“Yes, sir!” Vivika also smiled.

The two of them chatted for a while before Vivika left.

..

Time passed.

A day later.

Eli’s main body came to the frontline army and secretly infiltrated a warlock army, becoming an ordinary second-circle warlock.

Two days later.

The army arrived at the Great Plains of Dawn, where the City of Dawn was located.

However, the moment he arrived, Eli’s expression instantly changed.

A thick blood aura entered his nostrils.
