142 Rawls

“The magic plant Department and the mage relics disposal Department?”

Eli blinked.

“Yes,” Kratos nodded.

“The magical plant Department is one of the most important departments in the camp. Together with the magical potion Department and alchemy Department, they are also one of the most important departments in the camp. They are in charge of planting magical plants in the camp. It used to be managed by my subordinate, but he died in the battle, so I have to find a new department lead.” Kratos said.

“What about the Mage relic disposal Department?” This was what Eli was curious about.

!!

“Um, what do I say about this Department?” Kratos frowned and said, “As you know, there are some mage relics in our area. The camp will send people to explore them. That’s why this Department was formed.

“This Department is mainly in charge of managing and storing the miscellaneous items that can’t be sold and things that no one wants. Actually, there’s not much work to do. When the time comes, you just have to manage it casually. The main thing is that the camp is currently lacking manpower.” Kratos shook his head and said apologetically, “I’m a little embarrassed, but it’s really troublesome to hold two positions.”

“It doesn’t matter. This is what I should do!” Eli nodded.

What a joke, trouble?

He couldn’t be happier. Forget about the magical plants Department, Eli also had his own arcane realm where he planted many magical plants. Now, he had a whole department where he could experiment on magical plants.

Of course, this was not a big deal. The main reward was the Mage relics disposal Department.

What did warlocks not need?

It was nothing more than things that couldn’t be used, or some ” useless ” knowledge, but these were what Eli needed. This was practically sending him into the House of Gold.

In the future, Eli wouldn’t need to spend money to buy mage knowledge anymore. He could just quietly collect them in the Department.

“Yes, but don’t worry, the mage Plant Department is probably too big, so it has always been handled by two people. I’ll introduce you to your colleague today.” Kratos answered with a smile.

Speak of the Devil, just then, there was a knock on the door.

“He’s here,” Kratos smiled at Eli and said, “Come in, Rawls!”

Eli turned around.

The door opened, and a man walked in.

He had golden hair, slightly red eyes, and a faint smile on his face. He was tall and well-proportioned, and he wore a black top and long pants. He looked extremely elegant.

“This is Rawls, just like you, he just advanced to the first circle. He has integrated the bloodline of the second circle Balor the flame demon and has the opportunity to break through to the second circle in the future. Even the shadow Lizard Wizard Academy tried to recruit him, but he refused.” Kratos introduced with a smile.

“This is Herman, a first circle bramble tree demon. In the future, he will manage half of the magic plants Department with you. He is very good at magic medicine.” Similarly, Kratos introduced Eli to him.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Rawls stretched out his hand with a smile.

Likewise, Eli shook hands with him.

It seemed that this person who would work with him in the future was quite polite.

Seeing this, Kratos laughed heartily.

“then I’ll assign you your tasks. The magic herb field is currently on the East and West sides. Since the wizard relic disposal Department is on the east side, Eli will be in charge of the East, and Rawls will be in charge of the West. What do you think? ” Kratos distributed.

“Yes, I will definitely not let you down, Sir,” Rawls said.

“I can do it too.” Glancing at Rawls, Eli nodded as well. He suddenly felt that there was something wrong with this colleague of his.

“Okay, Rawls, you can leave now. I’ll arrange other works for Herman.” Now that he was done, Kratos waved his hand to dismiss Rawls.

“Herman, I need to tell you something about Rawls. I hope you’re not affected.” Kratos said.

Eli, “…”

“Hmm, Rawls might be very competitive in everything and hope to defeat his opponents. Therefore, he’s always very serious. I hope you’re not influenced too much. Just do your best. Additionally, he’s a bit narrow-minded. Please forgive him as much as possible.” Kratos explained tactfully.

Eli understood now. However, he doubted that he would be affected. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Okay, I got it.” Eli nodded.

“Fine, that’s all I have to say. You will gradually get acquainted with Rawls. Actually, he’s not bad in other aspects…” Kratos wanted to say something but stopped, and in the end, he only left a cheering expression for Eli.

Eli was baffled.

Then, Kratos told Eli some things to take note of, and Eli left.

…

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Eli had yet to take over his duties, but after advancing to the first circle, he got to know many new first-circle warlocks under Evena’s guidance, and the level of the people he knew was raised once again.

Eli also understood why Kratos had a complicated look in his eyes at the end.

Although Rawls was always elegant and polite to people outside, he was actually a man who liked power. He was a little narrow-minded and extremely hardworking. If you offended him, you would have to be careful of being reported by him and often be punished.

But fortunately, Rawls was very rule-abiding and would not make things up out of thin air, nor would he slander others. Therefore, many people had complicated feelings about him, but overall, he still had a good reputation.

Knowing this, Eli relaxed. He was still wondering what would happen. He was such a conscientious, law-abiding good person. What did breaking the law have to do with him?

Just like that, another half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

…

He came to the magical plant farm.

The magical plants division was located outside the camp. Next to the large magical herb field, there was a three-story building. It looked very simple, and a plant similar to an ivy climbed on it.

What Eli didn’t expect was that he would run into Rawls.

“Rawls, long time no see.” Eli greeted.

“Yeah, I remember you’re Herman. I hope we can work together in the future.” Rawls gave a standard smile as he walked over.

The two of them met at the entrance, where the two deputy ministers were also present.

“Minister Herman, I’m Rona. I’ll be helping you with your work from now on.”

“Minister Rawls, I’m Erdo. I’ll help you deal with this in the future.”

Because the area of the magic plants Department was too large, it was almost equivalent to two departments put together, so everything was almost doubled. The only shared probably was the department building.

And so, Eli and Rawls were invited in by the crowd.

Moreover, their office was a very large room, each taking up half of the space.

“Rona, introduce me to my current job.” Eli glanced at Rawls, who was not far away and said to Rona.

“Minister, the magic herb field in the East has a total of 100 acres. It is mainly planted with more than a dozen magic plants, including the silent Crescent, Dracaena, cross flowers, and so on. These are our jobs. In fact, we just need to ensure the quality and quantity.” Rona said cautiously. He wasn’t too familiar with the Deputy Minister’s temper.

Eli nodded.

How could the Head of Department manage everything? He mainly depended on his subordinates.

“Alright,” he said. Rona nodded. It seemed like this Minister was very easy to talk to.

“Alright, that’s it then. We’ll talk about it later.” Eli nodded and prepared to leave.

At the same time, Erdo had just finished introducing Rawls.

Rawls also nodded.

He looked over at Eli. He had asked about him, and the information said that this person was usually very carefree. He was very lazy and often went to brothels.

“This kind of person is really the cancer of the camp!” Rawls shook his head, looking down on Eli.

He hated people who were lazy and didn’t do anything. One should work hard in life!

He would work hard and strive to increase the production and sales on his side and then kick Eli out of the magic plants Department.

After all, there were two department heads in one department. It made him feel uncomfortable.

At that moment, he could see that Eli was about to leave after understanding the situation.

“Herman, you’re leaving already?”

“Yes. What else is there for us to do?” Eli asked.

Looking at Eli’s back as he left, Rawls’ mouth twitched, and he said to Erdo, ” go and bring me the information on the magic herb field. I need to study it carefully so that I can cultivate it better.”

He also had a certain understanding of magic plants. Otherwise, he would not have come here.

“Alright,” he said. Erdo immediately went to get it, but his face was twitching. ‘Are we still working today?’ He suddenly felt that following Rawls might not be a good idea.

He looked at Rona, who was also preparing to leave, and revealed an envious expression.

…

Eli, who left, did not know what Rawls was thinking. He could not wait to go to his other Department to take a look.

The Mage relic Department!

This was practically what Eli wanted all his life!

Soon, Eli passed through a few small paths and saw the Department in a remote corner of the camp.

However, looking at the overgrown ground in front of him and the low two-story building not far away, he suddenly realized that this Department was far inferior to the magic plant Department.

However, Eli still followed the path and walked in.

Very quickly, someone came to show Eli around.

“Paul, are there only six people in our department?” Eli said to Paul.

Paul was the Deputy Minister of the Department. He was a skinny old man with very little hair.

“Yes, my lord. There are only a few of us.” Paul nodded.

Eli could only accept his fate.

Soon, Paul introduced him to a job, which was to store and transport useless things after exploration. He often had a few months of leisure time a year. This might be why even though Eli was already the Minister of another department, he was still assigned to this place.

“Forget it. Just bring me to the department’s warehouse.” Ignoring these details, Eli said to Paul.

Eli was still interested in the Mage’s relics here.

He wanted to see if there was anything he wanted in the warehouse.
