417 Overt Conspiracy

Swamps of Gloom.

Eight-Armed Naga Family!

It was still the same dark castle, but it was much livelier than before. At this time, the two sides of the long oak table were filled with Warlocks, at least dozens of people, and every one of them had an aura that was above celestial.

And these weren’t just the Warlocks of the Eight-Armed Naga family. There were also forces that were affiliated with the Eight-Armed Naga and controlled by it!

!!

Jesse sat in the main seat at the front, calmly looking at the Warlocks on both sides.

Beside him sat a man and a woman, both wearing dark warlock robes. Their auras had reached a shocking level, and they were Radiant Sun Warlocks.

“Everyone!” Jesse suddenly spoke, and the others all stopped and looked at him.

“I’m glad that everyone can come!” Jesse stood up and thanked the Warlocks.

“Milord is too polite!”

“This is what we should do!”

The Warlocks all laughed.

But in the next second, Jesse slowly sat down and smiled.” I’m sure you’ve heard about my invitation. I won’t hide it. I only have one purpose in gathering you all, and that is to take down the Bloodline Tower! ”

Everyone nodded. They were not fools and naturally understood.

” As for why I want to take down the Bloodline Tower, perhaps everyone has their own guesses. Some people think that I’m greedy for the wealth of the Bloodline Tower, some say that I envy their methods, and some even say that I’m doing it for the Grassi Land, to save my family’s declining Bloodline cultivation Land! ”

At this point, Jesse’s tone gradually turned cold. He looked at the subordinate forces with a fake smile and said, “Then let me tell you, all of you guessed correctly!

” Whether it’s the Bloodline Tower’s wealth or their Grassi Lands, we need them all.

“Thus, the Eight-Armed Naga will go all out in this battle.”

Hearing Jos’s words, the others ‘expressions changed. They didn’t expect the Eight-Armed Naga to be so serious about this war!

He felt like he was staking everything on this. As expected, there was a huge problem with the Eight-Armed Naga’s bloodline cultivation land!

” Therefore, I’m here to discuss some of the issues of this war with everyone and how we’ll deal with it next! ” Jesse stood up, and the aura belonging to the Radiant Sun instantly erupted. Then, he said,” In this war, although it looks like we are facing the Bloodline Tower, my only enemy is Ely. I believe everyone has heard of this name! ”

“Of course, I’ve heard of it!”

” Bloodline Tower, Eli! ”

Everyone nodded. The details of the battle of Nightfall City might not be credible, but at least one thing was credible. The death of a Radiant Sun Warlock from the Akasha family and the Eight-Armed Naga family was done by Eli!

This was a powerful Warlock!

Although the Bloodline Tower wasn’t bad, it was still far from the Eight-Armed Naga. As long as he could get rid of Eli, the Bloodline Tower would naturally be within his grasp. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Everyone was curious about how Jesse would deal with Eli, so they all looked at Jesse.

Jesse slowly took out three tokens from his bracelet and said calmly, “This is something I found by chance when I was excavating a Mages ruin. It’s a spatial teleportation token that can be used to communicate with each other. As long as you hold one in your hand and crush it, you can teleport to the location of other tokens.

“As for the other two advancing warlock armies, you will continue to attack. This time, I want to destroy the Bloodline Tower!”

Jesse’s cold tone made everyone feel a chill run down their spine, and this plan was flawless!

After all, there were a total of three Radiant Sun Warlocks.

Even if the Bloodline Tower discovered something wrong, there was nothing that Eli could do. This was a completely foolproof scheme!

Unless Eli gave up on the Bloodline Tower, the Eight-Armed Naga’s goal would be achieved. After all, their original goal was the Grassi Land!

The only thing that they didn’t expect was that Jesse was so bold this time. He made the entire force attack without holding back. The opponent was only a Bloodline Tower of a level 3 force, but there were more than one or two powerful level 3 forces here!

Even a lion would use its full strength to hunt a rabbit!

This story was different from the Warlock story, where the big boss sent small bosses to consume the energy!

” This is my plan. I wonder what other ideas you have! ” Jesse looked at everyone calmly.

Everyone shook their heads!

A perfect plan!

….

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

When the news of the Eight-Armed Naga was released, the entire northern part of the Western Regions was in an uproar. All the factions had their mouths agape.

No matter which faction it was, they could not imagine that the Eight-Armed Naga would be so ridiculous as to choose to come out in full force!

Faced with the huge difference in strength between the two sides, many Warlocks from other forces within the Bloodline Tower’s territory chose to leave. Even the Potion Department, which was previously crowded with people, suddenly lost a lot of people. Some local Warlocks also left overnight.

Not only that, the Bloodline Tower’s prison was almost filled with Warlocks who had defected in the past few days.

The Eight-Armed Naga was truly a hopeless enemy. Even some of the Bloodline Tower’s upper echelons were nervous!

At this moment, Eli strangely discovered that his power of faith was actually increasing. This was because many people treated Eli as their last life-saving straw and were chanting his name!

As long as you were in Bloodline City, you could see people praying in the newly built statue of Eli!

…..

At this moment, in the tallest wizard tower.

Conilla looked at the praying people in the distance and then turned his gaze behind him.

It was a simple room with simple furniture and simple colors. At the same time, there was only one person sitting on the sofa, Eli.

” Sir Eli, I think you should really consider leaving for now. The Eight-Armed Naga is coming at you menacingly this time. Although I really want to help, there’s really no other way. But as long as we leave here, the Eight-Armed Naga won’t be a threat to you, sir. ” Conilla advised Ely.

“Good suggestion.” Eli smiled and nodded. He stood up and walked to Domo’s side, looking out the window.

In fact, not only Conilla but also Lobelia, Liliana, and many others had advised him to leave for the time being!

...

Eli understood.

After all, the enemy was indeed very strong, and the attack plan was also very unsolvable!

However

Eli looked down at the city below. Compared to before, at least everyone here could eat and have a place to stay. There were also so many people who trusted Eli. This was what he saw. There were many more things that he could not see. The mark of faith was proof!

He did not want to leave.

Of course, he wasn’t a fool. After all, he was an immortal. If necessary, he would definitely leave.

But the problem was Eli looked down at the dice in his hand. It was the one he had just thrown, and the number was twenty.

His problem was the possibility of defeating the Eight-Armed Naga!

Eli thought, ‘this … MaybePerhapsStaying was not a problem.’

” Alright, if you need anything, feel free to call me. I’m still waiting to introduce you to the vice president! ” Conilla nodded and walked out.

“Jin Ji?” Eli smiled.

...

Shaking his head, he fell into deep thought.

The power of faith from two and a half marks could perhaps turn into three clones. However, each of them might be slightly weaker, at most 25% of their strength!

“But it should be enough!”

Eli shook his head nonchalantly. He had a doppelganger anyway, so what if he was a little reckless? Moreover, with a success rate of 20 pointsIt shouldn’t be too wild, right?

….

Holy Tower!

A gentle breeze passed through the open window and blew on Luo Ye’s face. He was sitting on the sofa with a Warlock standing beside him. It was Luo Bu who had visited the Bloodline Tower back then!

“Sir, the Eight-Armed Naga has attacked the Bloodline Tower. Do we need to do anything?” Luo Bu asked.

“No need.” Luo Ye shook his head and said in a low voice.

He had already asked the Pagoda Master, but he was rejected. The reason was that the Heart of the Abyss had intervened!

Luo Ye shook his head and sighed for Eli in his heart.

What a pity for Herman’s students!

…..

Time flew by.

A week later!

The news from the front line came. Three huge teams appeared in three directions of the Bloodline Tower.

On the same day, Eli’s three doppelgangers silently left the Grassi Land and hid on the battlefield.

Meanwhile, Eli was sitting on the Grassi Land, paying attention to the situation and preparing to leave at any time!
