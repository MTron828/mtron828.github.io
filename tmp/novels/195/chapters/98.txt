99 Under the Palace

“This must be the Great Hall that Seviro Mesa was talking about!”

With the Empire’s stability, Eli finally arrived at the palace of Bryne Palace.

And it had been almost 20 years since seviro Mesa had told Eli about this place.

“Yes, teacher, are you sure it’s here?” Anna asked curiously.

!!

At this time, there were only two of them in the hall. The others had long since been dispersed.

Eli turned his head to look at Anna. Today, Anna was dressed in a gorgeous red dress, her dress dragging on the ground. There were only simple gems on her head, but she was still dazzling, like a phoenix.

This was the new queen of the bryne Empire, bryne the eighth-Queen Anna.

However, unlike the domineering Queen that this Queen, who had been in power for two months, had displayed to the public, she was like a little girl as she followed behind Eli.

“Yes, something is indeed not quite right.” Eli nodded.

He stepped lightly on the ground ,and his mental power seeped into the ground. He could feel an obvious resistance at a depth of five or six meters. There was definitely something at that depth.

“Go to the side!” He waved his hand to get Anna to move aside.

Anna obediently walked away.

On the other hand, a gust of wind element slowly appeared in Eli’s hand and quickly condensed, turning into a rope-like wind pillar. In the next second, the wind pillar lashed out like a whip.

An ear-piercing sound of friction rang out, and on the ground, a large piece of rock was instantly split open.

Just like that, Eli used the wind blade to directly cut apart a piece of the surface rock in the palace, revealing the bottom part. The original form of this spell was actually a wind wall shield, which had long been modified by him into a completely different form.

As the surface of the rock was cut open, the bottom was indeed different. It was a large piece of rock and soil. At this point, the wind blade was not suitable.

Spell-Earth Control.

He activated his mental force to construct a spell model. The ground slowly parted to the sides, and a hole appeared.

Through the hole, Eli looked down, and there really did seem to be a huge space below.

“I found it.” Eli could feel the faint magic fluctuations within and smile.

“Is this teacher’s power?” Not far away, Anna’s eyes widened as she watched this scene.

What happened just now was too much of an impact on her. She had seen Grand Knights swing out wind blades before, but only the top Grand Knights could do that. But what about Eli? he actually turned the wind into a whip and used it to cut.

So powerful.

She felt that even the wind blade would have torn a Grand Knight apart.

“Hmm, where’s the person I asked you to find?” At this moment, Eli suddenly asked Anna who was beside him.

There seemed to be a large karst cave below. The space was huge, and Eli’s mental power could only see so far.

“Yes.” Anna immediately knocked on the door on the side. Soon, the door opened, and a bound Knight pushed in.

The situation inside was unknown, and it contained the legacy of a first-circle wizard. Eli didn’t dare to go in himself, so he asked someone to help him take a look first.

“Your Majesty!” The criminal was also confused. He was supposed to die today, but he was suddenly brought out and told that he might be needed to do something.

If he was needed, he might be able to live, but if he was not needed, then he would die.

Hence, he had been waiting anxiously. Then, he was told that he was needed. The man was ecstatic and was taken away.

However, when he arrived at the hall and saw everything in front of him, as well as the old man not far from the Queen, the prisoner was a little dumbfounded and did not understand what was going on.

“Investigate the situation down there. If you can come out alive, I won’t kill you.” Anna didn’t care about the man’s state and said to him directly.

“Alright!” Although the Knight was dumbfounded, he knew that this was his only chance.

Soon, after tying the rope to the Knight, the man jumped into the hole.

It seemed to be very deep down, and the rope descended more than twenty meters before the Knight landed.

Eli waited calmly while Anna pulled on the rope beside him.

For the first twenty minutes of the probe, the rope just kept extending and then stopped moving. Eli even thought that something had happened to the man, but a few minutes later, the rope below suddenly moved, indicating that it could be pulled up.

“Are you done with your investigation?” Eli’s eyes lit up. Beside him, Anna, who was dressed in gorgeous clothes, slowly pulled the rope.

Soon, the man was pulled up by Anna.

After getting on, the man panted heavily.

“How is it? What’s the situation down there!” Anna looked at the Knight and asked.

“Your Majesty, there is a naturally formed cave below. There are no living creatures, but there is a small lake formed by water droplets. There is also a cave on the side of the rock wall. I went in and found a few boxes and a dead body on the side.” The Knight panted. Although he was curious why the Queen was pulling the rope and not the old man, he still explained what happened next.

On the other hand, Eli observed that the man’s spirit was not fluctuating. It was stable, and it seemed like he was not lying.

There really wasn’t any danger down there. It was indeed safe, so Eli prepared to go down too.

However, considering other issues, Eli still asked a few questions. After confirming that there was indeed no danger, he nodded at Anna and prepared to head down.

However, he had only taken a few steps before he stopped.

Why would he go down personally? Couldn’t he just ask the knight to take out the item? Who knew if there were any traps on the corpses? it was better to let the brave knights take responsibility.

“You know that what happened today can not be revealed, right?” Eli turned his head and said to the Knight.

“I understand!” The Knight quickly nodded, but he also understood to a large extent that he might have seen something important. After all, this was the palace Hall. He was a little worried that the Queen would not really let him go.

“Do you really think we’ll let you live?” Eli asked again.

The Knight broke out in a cold sweat.

“How about this, I’ll give you a chance, a chance to become my slave, and I’ll let you live. Are you willing?” Eli said calmly.

The Knight was a little confused and looked at the Queen.

“If you agree, no one here will hurt you,” Anna said with a nod.

Knight received the promise and nodded solemnly.

“I’m willing to.”

Half an hour later, the Knight who had his soul branded went down to the karst cave again.

…

Half a day later.

In the main hall.

Looking at the three boxes in front of him and the corpse in a wizard’s robe, Eli smiled in joy.

This was especially so when the Knight took out the wizard robe and the crystal ball from the skeleton’s pocket and handed it to Eli. Eli established a connection and sensed the contents inside the pocket of the robe. The first thing he saw was Saleen metatrin’s wizard diary, and he could not help but smile.

He found it.

He had really found it.

Furthermore, Saleen metatrin’s body was actually here. It was no wonder that the head of the library did not find Saleen metatrin’s body in the tomb.

Looking at the crystal ball, Eli could not hold it in any longer and sent his consciousness into it. He wanted to see what Saleen metatrin was looking for.

Let me take a look!
