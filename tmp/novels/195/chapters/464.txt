465 Condition, Again Again Again Again Again Again Again!

Thank you readers!

The negotiation went smoothly!

After half an hour of discussion, Giovanni personally agreed to Eli’s conditions!

There were two of them.

First, he would agree to cooperate with all the experiments that Eli would need him to do!

The second was to agree to Eli’s enslavement. After that, the dragon race would become Eli’s vassals for a thousand years!

Giovanni sighed and allowed Eli to imprint the soul mark in his bloodline.

“Don’t worry. I only need your help in experiments recently. Also, I won’t look for you for no reason in the next 1,000 years. It’s only 1,000 years anyway.” Eli consoled as he branded the dragon.

Giovanni couldn’t help but sigh!

A thousand years was indeed fine for a dragon, but no one wanted to be enslaved!

However, there was no other way. He had to accept the conditions or die.

If only he were alone… but he had brought a large number of his clansmen. If they all died here, he would be the sinner of the dragon clan. On the contrary, a thousand years was an acceptable time!

“Father, don’t worry. Actually, the experiment is very easy. It’s just drawing blood and then cooperating with some strange experiments!” Ortiz said.

Upon hearing this voice, a nameless flame suddenly burned in Giovanni’s eyes, and he glared at his unlucky son!

Seeing the look in his father’s eyes, Ortiz lowered his head and did not dare to speak again.

If it weren’t for Eli, he felt that he would definitely feel the warmth of a father’s love!

“Okay, then you can take your people and leave. Then, take Nikola with you. He will build a huge teleportation array at your place.” Eli nodded and called out to Nikola, who was not far away!

Nikola also flew over and agreed to the mission given by Eli!

“Alright, then, can you help me remove the seal now?” Giovanni said.

Feeling the release of the shackles, Giovanni respectfully lowered his head to Eli, but his eyes glanced at Ortiz, who was not far away. “Sir Eli, I hope you don’t mind me having a friendly chat with my son before we part.”

“As you wish!”

Eli smiled and turned to walk towards the wizard tower in the distance. Then, Ortiz’s voice came from behind.

“Sir, save meAh, Father, I was attacked. Ahhhh, I’m your son.”

Miserable screams lingered in the air above the Grassi Land, causing all the creatures here to turn their heads.

Half an hour later, Ortiz was paralyzed on the ground, lying flat on the ground, looking at the sky with empty eyes.

From the corner of his eyes, Nikola hid between Giovanni’s scales and flew into the sky, disappearing from his sight in the blink of an eye.

“Old thing, I have a good relationship with the laboratory staff. I will definitely make them give you the best experiment!” Ortiz’s heavy eyelids blinked, and crystal tears flowed out of them, shining with a unique color!

On the other side.

The giant dragon Giovanni flew out of the Grassi Land and arrived above Bloodline City!

All the Warlocks of Bloodline City gaped at the sight of the dragon that had escaped their control.

“Milord, has he released this giant dragon?”

“What happened?”

The Warlocks discussed animatedly, but Giovanni had no intention of listening. He looked at the dragons who were still standing in place and shouted, “All dragons, follow me and return to the green fields!”

With that, he flapped his wings and flew north!

The dragons were also surprised and happy. They quickly followed. As for the war, it did not matter. They only wanted to leave this terrifying place and stay away from that powerful Warlock!

The mighty dragons once again streaked across the sky, but this time, they were not aggressive, but as if they were fleeing!

….

Just as the dragon left!

More news about the war began to spread around the Bloodline Tower!

What one-handed dragon captureOne man fighting hundreds of dragonsEli had already advanced to the fifth ring. The dragon surrendered immediately.

All kinds of messy, true, and false news spread quickly. As it spread, it became more and more ridiculous!

So, that day, Eli found Liliana and told him to change the news to that the dragon was a peak Radiant Sun dragon. After a difficult battle, Eli successfully made peace with the dragon. As for the reason, it was unknown. And Eli wanted them to sell the news at a high price.

When Liliana asked him why, he replied, “You guys are professionals, so everyone actually believes in you. Since you’re selling it at such a high price, I believe many people will believe it. If those who have the money to buy it believe it, others will believe it too.

“As for those who knew the truth, they were only a minority, so it was not a big deal.

“Moreover, that giant dragon was a giant dragon at the peak of the RadiantSun, but it belonged to the huge dragon race!”

“Alright!” Liliana’s expression was strange. It did make sense!

This way, at least a large number of people would be confused and believe this version!

But would anyone really believe it?

Liliana pondered.

….

“A dragon at the peak of the Radiant Glorious, I regret it!”

The patriarch of the Twilight Giant Lizard Warlock Clan, Qigu Mark, had a pained expression on his face.

The wrong estimation made him make the wrong decision, and this wrong decision would at least make them pay a heavy price.

At this moment, the door opened, and a Warlock walked in. He said to Qigu Mark, “My lord, the Bloodline Tower has released a new list today. They said that they want to strengthen their connection with the eastern part of the Western Region. The Holy Tower and the Siren Family are also included, but we seem to be excluded!”

Upon hearing this, Qigo Mark’s expression became even more unsightly. Just as he was about to say something, another Warlock ran in hurriedly and said, “Sir, something bad has happened. The Bloodline Tower has cut off all contact with us, and many forces have also cut off all contact with us!”

Qigu Mark’s expression instantly froze.

A few seconds later, he leaned back on the high-back chair expressionlessly, his eyes empty!

He regretted it.

…

The City of Dawn!

Nero looked at the news in front of him and could not help but frown. His expression was ugly as well.

“A large dragon is only at the peak of the Radiant Sun? “He gritted his teeth and looked at Tuman not far away. “Is this information accurate?”

“Sir, this is the news from the Charm Residence. One hundred thousand magic crystals. It shouldn’t be fake. Moreover, according to the news from the scouts that day, it seems that the dragon was captured very easily. It should be confirmed that it was only a dragon at the peak of the Radiant Sun, not a half-step fifth-circle dragon!” Tuman took a deep breath and said,

“Damn it, trash dragon raceHad they declined to such a state? Is there something wrong with it?”

Nero cursed and chattered non-stop!

Looking at Nero’s expression, Tuman could not help but lower his head.

After cursing for more than ten minutes, Nero looked up at Tuman again. His angry expression was gradually replaced by a gloomy one as he whispered, ” Unknowingly, this guy, Eli, has become a serious obstacle to our plan. Tuman, I think it’s time to get rid of this guy. You and Lous go and get rid of him together. Even if the worst-case scenario is that he’s really a half-step fifth-circle warlock, he’s at most just a beginner. The two of you who are half-step fifth circles are enough!”

Hearing Nero’s words, Tuman was stunned, but a hint of bloodlust flashed in his eyes. He smiled and said, ”

“Alright, sir. I’ll go now. I can’t wait any longer.”

Tuman was about to leave when he was stopped by Nero!

Nero pursed his lips and said, ” Don’t move for now! Wait for this incident to blow over first!”

“Alright!”

Nero smiled happily and bent down as if he was joking.

“I will obey your orders!

“Demon Heart Sovereign King. ”
