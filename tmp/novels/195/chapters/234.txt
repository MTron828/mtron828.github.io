235 Silver Moon

“The ruins have been discovered?”

Eli’s eyes widened as she looked at Vivika.

Vivika nodded and looked at Eli.

Her teacher’s aura was much stronger than before. Although she was about to reach the mid-stage of the third circle, she felt that the gap between them was getting bigger and bigger.

!!

‘As expected of a teacher!’ Vivika admired him in her heart.

“Is the information true?” Eli asked again.

Although there had been some news a few years ago, he didn’t expect it to be true. This was much earlier than he thought!

“there’s a high chance that it’s true. It’s said that the ruins were discovered in the heart of darkness’ territory, and some mechanical objects were found in the periphery!” Vivika explained, putting aside her thoughts.

Eli nodded.

He knew about the heart of darkness. It was also one of the forces from the central continent, but it was much larger and stronger than the bloodline tower. Even in the central continent, it was not considered weak.

Based on the current situation, the entire West Coast was divided into three parts: the North, the middle, and the South.

The North took up about two-seventh of the West Coast, and it was rather far away, so Eli wasn’t sure, but the middle took up about four-seventh of the West Coast. It had a vast area and relatively more resources. The South was the White Tower, which took up a relatively small area, and the resources were the poorest.

As for the central region, there were currently eight main forces.

They were the heart of darkness, the heart of thorns, the Holy tower, the unicorn Warlock Academy, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, the helwall, the bloodline tower, and the school of the harpies.

Among them, the heart of darkness and the Holy tower was the strongest. It was said that they both had peak three-circle warlocks. There were also some in the early and middle stages. The unicorn and the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce were slightly weaker, followed by halwell, the bloodline tower, the thorn heart, and the Harpy school.

To put it bluntly, the bloodline tower should be the weakest group. After all, Vivika was the only third-circle warlock.

“Heart of Darkness?” … Eli pondered.

If that was the case, he felt that it was necessary to go and take a look.

He didn’t have to participate, but he could go and understand more. Moreover, he felt that this matter wasn’t that simple. Why would an ordinary force expose such a huge discovery?

He also asked his own question.

“It’s like this. It was discovered by both helwall and the heart of darkness.” Said Vivika.

“Alright,” Eli nodded. It seemed that he had been overthinking.

“Then, teacher, are you going this time?” Vivika asked just like she did fifty years ago.

“Yes, why not?” Eli said.

“You’re not going, okay.” Vivika nodded, then reacted in the next second. She looked at Eli with a surprised look.”What? Teacher, you’re going this time?”

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

It was not for the ruins, but to purchase a new potion formula.

He had reached a bottleneck and needed external help.

“yes, the silver Moon gathering will be in a month. Teacher, you can come to the bloodline tower and come with me. After all, you’ve never been there before, so it’ll be more convenient!”

“Sure!” Eli agreed.

After chatting with Vivika for a while, Eli personally sent her off and returned to the black Tower.

..

Half a month later.

A ray of blood-red light flew out of the black Tower and headed north.

On the same day, the prisoners realized that Eli seemed to have left, and they immediately cried tears of joy.

“He’s finally gone!”

“I hope he can go out for a few more days. It’s best if he doesn’t come back for a lifetime!”

“that’s great. Oh my God, he actually dragged him to the lab yesterday. I actually saw my former cellmate’s limbs turn into octopus hands.”

The prisoners cried tears of joy as if they were celebrating a Festival.

At this time, the White Tower patrols who happened to pass by saw this scene and looked at each other.

It seemed that the conditions of the black Tower prison were not bad. The mental state of the prisoners was very good.

It seemed like the rumors were not reliable. Sir Herman was such a kind person; how could he do such a cruel thing? otherwise, the prisoners wouldn’t be so happy.

The Lord is too kind!

..

On the other side.

Eli, who treated the blood-ignition technique as a travel manual, completed the three-day journey in a day and arrived at the bloodline tower.

After showing his identity, Eli saw Vivika without any obstacles.

Vivika was pleasantly surprised to see Eli. “Teacher, why are you here so early?”

“I thought I could replenish some resources here, so I came here first.” Eli smiled.

“That’s fine. Teacher, do you have a place to stay? Why don’t we go to the same place as last time?”

“Alright!”

With a few simple words, Eli settled down in the bloodline tower again.

..

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

...

Eli was writing something on the desk in the Tower when there was a sudden knock on the door.

“It’s the time!”

Eli looked up and did some calculations. It seemed like today was the day to leave.

Everything was already packed. Eli went downstairs and opened the door. It was actually Vivika’s student, Aisha, who was knocking on the door.

“Grandmaster, it’s time to leave. Teacher asked me to bring you to the square!” Aisha called out respectfully. After a hundred and fifty years, she had already reached the limit of first circle and could advance at any time.

“Alright,” he said.

Nodding, Eli walked out of the Tower.

The two of them walked in the direction of the square. Along the way, the two of them chatted. Eli also guided Aisha on some questions, and Aisha learned a lot. When they arrived, she was even a little reluctant to leave.

“Thank you, Grandmaster. It’s right in front!” Aisha thanked him.

At this moment, Eli realized that they had already arrived at the square, and Aisha had left first. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It seems that there are many people going!” Eli looked around and sighed.

...

At this moment, there were nearly 100 people in the square, and the number was still increasing. There were quite a few people in the first and second circles, and each of them was carrying a lot of things. They were most likely going to the Silver moon society.

But that was not the point. Eli raised his head and saw a huge airship floating in the square.

It was almost 50 meters long and had a huge white airbag on the outside. The main body was silver and alchemy runes were carved on the airbag, which emitted wind elemental power and allowed it to float.

“An airship!”

Eli pursed his lips. If it were the Mage world of the past, it would be an aircraft. An airship was something from the ancient times of the Mage world, but it was the only thing they could use.

It seemed that the alchemy skills of warlocks were worrying!

At this moment, a Warlock at the side looked at Eli’s expression and thought that he was shocked by the size of the airship. He smiled and said to him, “brother, this is your first time seeing such a large alchemy creation, right? it’s not uncommon to see such a large alchemy creation. This is one of the most advanced items in our bloodline tower. Isn’t this shocking? ”

“Yes, yes!” Eli nodded too. He was indeed shocked.

“Hahaha!” Upon hearing Eli’s praise, the Warlock smiled and asked, “Brother, why haven’t I seen you before? I’m kami. Let’s get to know each other. I’m from the bloodline tower’s Resources Department!”

The Warlock by the name of Kami said smugly. He was a robust fatty!

“Oh, I’m Herman!” Eli said casually. He was still using that name.

“Oh, I’ve never heard of you before. Brother, you’re planning to attend the silver Moon conference this time, right? ” Kami came over.

Eli nodded, only wondering if something was wrong with this guy.

“Hehe, do you have a ticket?”

“Tickets?”

“You don’t have a ticket?” Kami blinked his eyes. He had noticed that this person’s aura seemed to be very low, so he wanted to see if there was a chance to buy Eli’s ticket. However, Eli didn’t even have one.

“No, I didn’t!”

Kami’s eyes turned, and a big smile immediately appeared on his face. He patted Eli’s shoulder and said, ” you might not know this since you’re new here, but the silver Moon clan’s airships require tickets. You can’t get on without tickets. The cheapest one before cost 2000 magic stones, but since you’re fated to get on, I’ll sell one to you for 1000 magic stones!”

Kami looked at Eli. Normally, a ticket would only cost 300 magic stones, but at a time like this, he would definitely go for the highest profit. That’s right, he was using his authority to resell the tickets.

Seeing Kami’s expression, Eli also understood what he meant. He smiled and said, “There’s no need. Someone will come and pick me up!”

“Uh, that’s impossible. You can’t get on without a ticket!” Kami frowned. These were the rules. “how about 800 magic stones? I’ll give you a discount.”

“They’re here!” Eli ignored him and looked forward.

Aisha led Vivika and walked over. Behind her were a few higher-ups of the bloodline tower. The people on both sides made way for her. Kami also saw this and immediately lowered his head and moved to the side. He had no choice. He was forbidden in the bloodline tower and couldn’t be seen.

“Brother, come here!”

He suddenly realized that Eli wasn’t moving and immediately pulled him to the side. He was still preparing to promote his products!

However, even though he was holding onto him, Eli didn’t seem to have any intention of moving at all. Kami was extremely anxious, and as Vivika was getting closer, he immediately let go.

“He’s really bold!” Kami glanced at Eli. ‘Damn it, I met a fool today.’

However, something that left him dumbfounded happened. Tower master Vivika actually came directly to the man named Herman and looked at him.

“You fool!” Kami was gloating.

“Teacher!” Vivika said respectfully.

Teacher?

Kami blinked. He looked at Eli, then at tower Lord Vivika. What did he just hear?

The person in front of him was the tower master’s teacher? Kami’s body trembled as if he had thought of something. If this person in front of him was the master of the tower’s teacher, then didn’t that mean that he was the honorary Deputy tower master from more than a hundred years ago?

Kami’s throat moved slightly. What did he do just now? he was done for!

He was actually trying to scam one of the higher-ups in the force. Wasn’t this the same as selling drugs in front of the police station?

He felt his vision go black and his legs went soft as he knelt on the ground.
