225 Changes in the Situation

“Hu hu!”

Moses stood on the tall pile of corpses and wiped the blood off his face. He wanted to continue killing, but he discovered that the bloodline power in his body was almost exhausted, to the point of almost burning his bloodline.

He looked around and saw that the bloodline tower had been completely suppressed. Failure was only a matter of time. Only a third of the original thousands of people were left. Some of them were his friends and his former teachers.

He thought back to his past when he was discovered to have the talent to become a Warlock in a small city. He first studied in a Warlock Academy under the bloodline tower, and through his own efforts, he became a first-circle wizard and joined the bloodline tower.

He had everything, and he enjoyed it all. But today, everything would change.

“It’s time to end this!”

At that moment, a few more first-circle Black Isotta warlocks noticed him and walked toward him.

“Hahaha, there’s a first circle warlock with a dried bloodline here!”

“I’m going to cut off his head.”

The warlocks were unscrupulous. Moses gritted his teeth. Even if he had to die, he would not let these bastards go so smoothly.

The three warlocks charged at Moses. Moses gritted his teeth, let out a furious roar, and rushed forward. However, before he could take a few steps, he saw a hurricane coming. The few people in front of him were instantly torn into pieces of flesh and blood, splattering on his face.

“What is this?”

Moses stood in his spot in a daze. He wiped the fresh blood off his face and looked up. In the originally calm sky, two figures had appeared out of nowhere.

They stood in the air, exuding a powerful aura. The three people who had just died were casually killed by one of them. That person was Vivika.

“Tower master!”

Moses’ eyes widened in disbelief. Furthermore, he noticed that there was another spirit beside the pagoda master.

It wasn’t just him. The others also noticed Vivika’s return. Everyone tacitly stopped and looked up at the sky, at the two third-circle warlocks in the sky.

No one had expected Vivika to return.

What about Kloss?

It was a battle of life and death between the two, and it was also the final battle. It was impossible for Kloss to let Vivika go, so it seemed that there was only another unreliable explanation.

Could it be that Kloss failed?

Everyone in the bloodline tower couldn’t believe their own speculations, and everyone in the black Isotta had a bad feeling. Moreover, there was an additional third-circle warlock beside Vivika, which made everyone feel uneasy.

In the sky, Vivika lowered her head and looked down. She felt a pain in her heart, especially when she saw that there were not many warlocks left. The tower master had given her the bloodline tower, but now it was in this state.

Fortunately, her teacher helped her. Otherwise, she would not have been able to face Natasha.

Taking a deep breath, Vivika’s eyes gradually became firm, and then she loudly said, “Kloss is dead!”

The sound was transmitted through the wind element and quickly swept across the entire battlefield, entering everyone’s ears. When they heard this sentence, everyone was stunned. Some people even dropped their wizard tools inadvertently, making a clear sound.

“Dead?”

Moses’ eyes widened. Kloss was dead. He was actually dead. How was this possible?

Although he had absolute trust in his tower master, was it really possible to do such a thing?

Kloss was a third-circle mid-stage powerhouse!

“Master is dead? It’s probably fake.”

“How is this possible?”

“I don’t believe it. Master is invincible. How could he die at the hands of Vivika, who had just advanced to the third circle? He must be lying.”

The people of the bloodline tower were already suspicious, not to mention the people of black Isotta. In their hearts, Kloss was an existence that could beat Vivika. How could he die so easily?

However, when they looked at the confident Vivika and the strange third-circle warlock beside her, they began to lose their confidence.

“no, she might be lying to us. How could she have killed Master? ”

“That’s right. It’s absolutely impossible!!”

At this time, someone shouted. They were Kloss’ trusted aides. Their faces were red as they tried to expose Vivika’s lies.

“Nikola!” Vivika, who was in the sky, just looked at Nicola calmly.

“Alright, miss Vivika!” Nikola used his mental power, and a gray screen appeared in the sky.

It was the scene of Kloss being killed.

Everyone looked at this scene and saw that locks had been turned into nothingness under the countless attacks. They were all silent. Under such an attack, even their master would not be able to survive.

As for who the attacker was, it was no longer important.

“We’ve lost just like that?”

A black Isotta Warlock at the peak of the second circle looked at the scene in the sky. This kind of memory-like scene was difficult to imitate, and it was meaningless, so Vivika did not lie to them. Kloss was really dead.

He could not understand how things had turned out this way.

They were so close to winning, just a little bit more …

However, if Kloss died, even if Lord Mason returned, Vivika had the aid of another third-circle warlock, it would be difficult to change the outcome. They had failed! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This shouldn’t be our ending.”

He bit his lips, still unable to accept the reality.

“I surrender!”

The black Isotta was a large force, and not everyone was loyal to Kloss. Some people quickly recognized the reality, and a first-circle warlock was the first to lay down his weapon.

The voice was not loud, but it was like a thunderclap that woke everyone up. Then, one by one, the black Isotta warlocks gave up resisting and surrendered.

Even Kloss’ former confidants revealed bitter smiles and put down their weapons.

...

There was no point in resisting.

“I failed!”

Although they had all surrendered, there was one more question in everyone’s mind. Who killed Kloss? The last attack was obviously not from Vivika or the undead but from someone else.

“Master has chosen the wrong target!”

The second-circle warlock was also subdued by a few first-circle Warlocks. He was covered in a sack. Not only was his vision blocked, but his bright future was also blocked.

Behind the bloodline tower, there were even more powerful warlocks.

They had failed!

..

The next day.

The news of black Isotta’s defeat and the bloodline tower’s victory spread throughout the two forces, and with the help of some people, it spread even further.

After hearing this news, many forces were stunned.

...

Black issota’ strength was obvious to all, and Vivika was only at the initial stage of the third stage. How could she possibly kill him? However, everyone saw the scene played by Nikola.

What made everyone dumbfounded was that it wasn’t just Kloss who died. The news of Mason’s death spread as well. Two of black Isotta’s third-circle Warlocks had died!

This made many people look at each other in dismay, their fear of the bloodline tower growing.

No one dared to make a move as they watched the bloodline tower gobble up the cake left behind by black Isotta. The house of undead took part of the cake too.

Many of the major powers chose to sit on the wall and watch.

Of course, there were also some people who had received more secret news. For example, it was possible that Kloss wasn’t actually killed by Vivika, but by someone else behind the bloodline tower.

Just like that, everyone watched as the bloodline tower rapidly took back the areas they had once occupied and expanded towards the black Isotta region. Everything was changing rapidly.

In this change, various forces had different ideas.

..

In a Mage Tower.

Many warlocks were sitting in a circle. There was only a dim candle in the room. The atmosphere was heavy, and everyone had their heads lowered. No one was the first to speak.

They were the ones who had ridiculed the White Tower for not leaving the bloodline tower and joining the black Isotta first.

The joy they felt at that time was equal to the pain and regret they felt at this moment.

“Yali, this is all your fault. Otherwise, how could we have left the bloodline tower? ” Suddenly, an old woman with a face full of wrinkles opened her mouth and looked at the black-robed Warlock at the front of the table with resentment.

“Sophie, you were so supportive back then. What’s wrong? Now that the situation has changed, you’re blaming me? ” The black-robed warlock slammed the table and stood up, looking at the woman.

“You! It’s all your fault!” The woman was trembling.

“Hmph,” he snorted. The black-robed Magus looked at the others and said, ” it was a joint decision back then. Now that this has happened, don’t blame it on me. The most important thing now is to discuss what to do next.”

He looked at the crowd. Except for the woman who had a resentful face, everyone else had their heads lowered and kept silent.

“Sigh, we don’t have a chance anymore!” After a long while, a middle-aged Warlock sighed with a pained expression.

They were the ones who betrayed the bloodline tower first, so how could the bloodline tower forgive them?

“That’s right. There’s no hope!”

“Sigh, we were mocking white tower back then, but now I feel like we’re fools!” A Warlock also had a self-deprecating expression, but the regret in his voice could not be concealed.

In an instant, the atmosphere in the room became even more solemn. Everyone could only sigh.

It was all over!

They were the ones who messed up everything, so they could not blame anyone else.

“Forget it. The meeting is meaningless. Good luck, everyone.” The black-robed sorcerer shook his head.

In fact, this meeting was just a glimmer of hope in everyone’s hearts.

However, it was obvious that they had no other choice but to surrender completely. They would definitely not be able to keep their forces, and they might not even be able to keep their lives.

The others nodded and left one by one.

The black-robed Warlock extinguished the candle and walked out as well.

The mage Tower once again fell into darkness.
