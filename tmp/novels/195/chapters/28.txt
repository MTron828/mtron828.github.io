Chapter 29: Big Fish

Translator: Lonelytree

The moonlight wrapped around the night sky, and the lights were lit up in moon alley.

At night, the liveliness here had just begun.

“Sir, do you want to come in and gamble a few rounds?”

In front of Moca casino, Evans was wearing a black waiter’s uniform with a light perfume on his body. He was smiling and attracting passing guests.

He was a casino attendant, responsible for attracting passing guests or serving familiar gentlemen.

However, it seemed that his business performance today was not very good. A few hours had passed, but he had not seen any rich gentlemen. Only the stinky tramps passed by.

There were even customers he had once received, but that was in the past. They had long been emptied out by the casino, and they were no longer important. Of course, if they became rich again one day, they would receive their respect again.

“Get lost. Do you think you can enter this place?” After driving away a few homeless people, Evans sighed.

“The market hasn’t been too good recently. If I can’t get a few easy targets, I’m afraid I won’t have money to eat.”

The casino also had to earn, and it was clear that he had not completed this month’s target.

“Welcome!” After welcoming a guest in ordinary clothes, he stood at the door again. Only the guests who looked very distinguished were worthy of his attention.

Suddenly, the sound of horse hooves could be heard.

A carriage came from not far away. The exterior of the carriage was made of rosewood and was purple in color. The horses were also shiny and strong. What was even better was that the curtains on the windows were made of red roses, a high-end fabric.

“This person is definitely very rich!” Evans was envious.

The carriage was probably his decades of savings. The people inside must be very rich. It would be great if they were his guests.

As if the heavens had heard his wish, the carriage actually stopped in front of the gambling house.

Then, the curtain was pulled open, and a man in a luxurious black suit, a black hat, and golden glasses walked down. He held a very luxurious cane in his hand, and he had a short beard. He looked like a gentleman, and then he walked towards the casino.

It seemed that Evans did not expect that the story would really happen.

He immediately went up to welcome him.

“welcome to Moca casino, honorable Sir.” Evans put his right hand on his chest and lowered his head.

The gentleman didn’t seem to mind. He just frowned and waved his hand as if to dispel the dirty smell. Then, he walked inside.

Seeing this, Evans was not angry but happy. It seemed that this man rarely came here.

He immediately walked up to the man and asked, “Is this your first time here, Sir?”

“Yes, it is.” Eli nodded and replied.

The gentleman was naturally Eli, but the disguised Eli. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In order to make money, he naturally had to put on a disguise. Otherwise, it would be terrible if he got into trouble later.

Therefore, as soon as he left the place yesterday, he found a carriage company. He first rented a high-end carriage, then rented a few sets of luxurious-looking clothes, and then disguised his face before he came to the casino.

As for why they wanted to rent high-end clothes, it was because of Evans’s attitude.

“Oh, Sir, is this your first time coming to such a place?” Evans asked in greater detail.

“Yes, I’m here to have some fun. I came from a far away chamber of commerce, and I was a little bored, so I came to have some fun. This is my first time.” Eli smiled in response.

Chamber of Commerce! This was his first time!

The two keywords made Evans’ eyes light up.

This was an easy target!

It was not easy to establish a Chamber of Commerce. Each of them had at least unimaginable wealth, not to mention the large Chambers of Commerce that spanned regions and even countries.

“Sir, if you don’t mind, let me lead you to have some fun.” With a smile on his face, Evans tried his best to hide his joy.

“I do need someone to introduce me to the rules of the game.” Eli smiled, taking out his money bag.

After that, he accidentally revealed a lot of gold tarls in the bags and gave Evans a few silver tarls as a tip.

“Thank you, sir!” When Evans saw the gold, he estimated that there were at least dozens of gold tarls. He swallowed and felt that he was really going to get lucky.

“Hey, then, don’t just stand there. Bring me in to play.” Eli kept his money bag and touched his cane.

The gold coins were naturally fake. In fact, only one gold and silver Tarl were real, and the rest were fake.

“Alright, alright, please!” With an ingratiating expression on his face, Evans led Eli inside.

“I might have reached my quota for this year!” He had already started to let his imagination run wild.

Evans walked in front, and Eli followed him unhurriedly.

He passed through the main door and entered the casino.

It was luxurious and noisy.

That was Eli’s first impression of this place.

The floor was covered with gorgeous carpets, and there were all kinds of tables in the large space. All kinds of guests were playing all kinds of ” games ” around the tables. Silver tarts and gold tarts were everywhere.

A lady in revealing clothes was holding a high-end wine. Most of them were dressed very nakedly. If he didn’t know where he was, he would have thought that he had gone to a brothel!

“Sir, it’s your first time here, so you can play something simple,” suggested Evans.

Eli nodded, a ” lost ” expression on his face as if he didn’t know where to start.

“Alright, please come with me.” Evans smiled.

At this time, not far away, a man climbed out of a door and spat out blood. Then, in just a few seconds, two people grabbed him back in, leaving only the blood on the ground.

“he owes the casino a lot of money. Don’t worry, Sir. Our casino is very law-abiding.” Evans explained when he saw Eli’s eyes.

Follow the rules?

Eli smiled and didn’t say anything. He just kept following Evans.

“Here, move, move!” Soon, they arrived at a gambling table. Evans immediately stepped forward and dispersed the crowd, leaving the middle seat for them.

“Sir, here!” Mr. Eli,” said Evans.

Looking a little embarrassed, Eli glanced at the people who had stepped aside and was pulled to sit away by Evans.

“Sir, you have the right to sit here!”

The other customers looked at this scene with strange expressions, but they didn’t say anything. As veteran gamblers, they could tell at a glance that Eli was a ” newbie ” who had never come into contact with this place.

Eli sat down, and Evans, who was standing behind him, quietly made a gesture to the waiter in the middle of the table. The waiter immediately understood.

He looked at the harmless-looking Eli and smiled.

The big fish had taken the bait.
