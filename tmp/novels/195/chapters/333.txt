334 Surrender

At this moment.

In a Wizard Tower far away, Kriman was working hard to circulate his bloodline, making it run continuously in his body. The bloodline origin in his body was also improving bit by bit.

“This new bloodline circulation method is more suitable for us than the meditation technique.” He sighed. He was now using the latest cultivation technique from the central continent. It was a replacement for the previous meditation technique, which was more suitable for mages.

“This is the beginning of a new era, an era that belongs to warlocks.”

!!

He slowly stood up and walked out of the mage Tower.

He was currently in a city. Not long ago, this place belonged to the bloodline tower, but now it was his territory.

“A force without even a celestial has actually occupied such a large area. What a pity.”

As he walked, the people on the road all looked at him with admiration. These were basically people who had followed him these days. After all, he was a celestial

At this moment, a person not far away suddenly came to him. “my Lord, the bloodline tower’s reply has arrived. They have rejected my Lord’s request.”

Kriman nodded and said, ” I expected them to reject me. It’s a pity that they still don’t understand what a celestial is.”

He stretched his body, and a cruel smile appeared in his eyes.

He looked forward and saw a huge statue that was seven to eight meters tall on the largest square in the center of the city.

The statue was made of stone, but the sculptor had put a lot of effort into it, which made the man look very energetic. He was wearing a Warlock’s robe and a hood, holding a threaded staff in his right hand and looking forward with confidence.

There were many fresh flowers in front of the statue, which meant that it was quite popular.

He suddenly became interested and turned to his subordinate beside him and asked, “Who is this? ”

A statue!

The Warlock blinked and thought for a few seconds. “my Lord, if I remember correctly, this statue is almost 300 years old. I’ve only been on the West Coast for a few decades, so I don’t know much about it. But I heard that it’s a very important person in the bloodline tower.”

“His name is …” The Warlock pondered, but he couldn’t remember. More and more wrinkles appeared on his face.

Suddenly, a voice was heard from the side.

Herman.

“Yes, yes.” The Warlock came to a sudden realization and quickly nodded. At the same time, he looked to the side and saw an unfamiliar young man.

Black hair, black eyes, wearing a gray Sorcerer’s robe, and holding a metal spiral staff. He had never seen this man before, but he had a strange sense of familiarity as if he knew him from somewhere.

Suddenly, his body froze. His entire body turned cold as if a bucket of ice water had been poured on him.

He finally remembered where he had seen it before.

His body stiffened, and his head turned to look at the statue not far away. When he turned back to look at the person, he found that they were exactly the same.

He roared in his heart, feeling a little uneasy. However, he quickly calmed down. He had Lord Kriman, a celestial from the central continent, by his side.

He turned around and looked at Kriman. Kriman was staring at the person who had just arrived. His face was solemn, and cold sweat was dripping down his forehead.

“Are you the one who wants the bloodline tower?” Eli looked at the man with a smile.

Kriman looked at Eli, his eyes filled with caution.

He couldn’t see through this person who had suddenly appeared. This meant that this person was at least a micro-star Warlock or his rank would be higher.

Thus, he was a little uncertain.

He didn’t know that there was such a figure in the bloodline tower.

“you look a little nervous, but I think we need to talk. The bloodline tower is my private property, after all. It’s not very polite of you to do that, especially since you hurt my people.” The relaxed smile remained on Eli’s face, but his tone was unquestionable.

“Alright!” Kriman nodded with difficulty.

He understood that he had been too impulsive this time.

Thus, the underling watched the two of them fly into the sky and then fly toward the mountain range in the distance.

He immediately ran to the sky and looked in the direction the two had left.

The underling’s mouth gradually opened wide, and his black pupils were shining brightly. Terrifying sound waves were coming from the mountain. He watched as the mountain closest to him was flattened by a flash of light. He also heard a bear’s roar. If he remembered correctly, Kriman’s bloodline was a fourth-circle earth demon bear.

However, the voice only lasted for a few seconds before he heard a shrill scream. Then, the voice disappeared without a trace.

There was no more movement after that.

Although it was fast, the noise and movement were not small. The third-circle warlocks rose into the sky one after another, and the city wall was filled with their warlocks.

Their eyes were filled with curiosity, and their eyes were wide open as they looked at the razed mountain peak.

A Warlock came to Hart and asked, “Hart, what happened? ”

Hart glanced at him and said, ” do you see the statue on the ground?”

Speaking of the statue, it was naturally the one in the city center.

The warlocks were also dumbfounded.

The person of this statue was still alive?

“Then what exactly happened?” The Warlock asked.

“Master Kriman is fighting with that man. It looks like the battle has ended.” Hart said absentmindedly, his eyes fixed on the distance.

He felt a little uneasy when he heard the scream.

Soon, two figures appeared in the distant sky. His eyes lit up. It was over.

The others also saw it, and their eyes widened.

But when they saw it clearly, everyone seemed to choke.

There were two figures in total. One was flying in the sky, and the other was being held in his hand. Upon closer inspection, it was Kriman. He looked extremely miserable. Not only were his clothes torn, but his left arm was also missing. He had fallen into a coma.

...

Looking at this scene, Hart felt like he had fallen into the abyss.

The fact that his lordship had been beaten to such a state meant that Herman was far more powerful than his lordship.

Other than him, the others were also stunned by this scene.

“No way. Who is this? Our lord was beaten up like this?!”

“It’s the bloodline tower, right? They’re so powerful. I was wondering how they managed to occupy such a large area.”

“I’m finished.”

As Eli got closer, everyone could confirm that the unconscious man was Lord Kriman, a celestial Warlock. They all felt a chill in their hearts. They knew that Kriman had failed, and they would not have a good ending either.

He had thought that the bloodline tower was easy to bully, but that was clearly not the case.

On the other side, Eli brought Kriman into the city, and everyone quickly dodged.

“Prepare a place for me. I want to talk to Kriman.” Eli said as he came to Hart.

“Yes.” Hart dared not to disobey and immediately said. Looking at his master, who was being dragged to the ground, he could not help but close his eyes.

...

Talk? It was probably a one-sided discussion.

Soon, everyone watched as Eli led Kriman into a mage Tower.

An hour later, the door opened, and Eli walked out. Kriman followed behind him.

Kriman lowered his head and didn’t say a word.

“make the arrangements. We’ll be going to the bloodline tower next.” Eli said to him.

Kriman raised his head and saw that the people who had joined him before were standing on both sides of the street, looking at the mage Tower.

His eyes were filled with unwillingness, but he still looked at the crowd and said loudly, “Guys, from today on, I will join the bloodline tower. I won’t interfere with your decision. Of course, you can join the bloodline tower as well. It depends on you,” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as Kriman finished speaking, the entire street fell silent. Hundreds of people looked at Kriman in a daze, as if they didn’t expect such a thing to happen.

A few hours ago, they were still full of ambition, aiming to conquer the bloodline tower. A few hours later, their leader joined the bloodline tower.

Even though it might not have been voluntary, it was still too fast.

For a moment, everyone was speechless and could only look at the two of them in a daze.

“It seems that your prestige is not bad.” Eli turned to Kriman.

“My Lord, please don’t joke around.” Kriman smiled awkwardly.

He didn’t expect that Eli would be this strong. He was no match for him at all.

So, when Eli asked him in the mage Tower whether he would serve him for a thousand years or die, he gave the answer without hesitation.

He wanted to live.

“Then let’s go. You’ve knocked Aisha unconscious. You have to apologize and meet your future boss.” Eli smiled and then flew into the sky.

“Yes.” Kriman followed.

Then, under everyone’s gaze, the two of them flew toward the bloodline tower.

Everyone was left looking at each other dumbly.
