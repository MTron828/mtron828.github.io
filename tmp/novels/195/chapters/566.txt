567 The Descent of the Blazing Angel, The Descent of the World Will

Humph!

Eli’s words made Black Fog snort coldly, and his tone turned cold.

“You’re very arrogant. I hope you can still be so arrogant later!” Black Fog looked at Eli coldly.

At this moment, he was almost at the peak of the fifth circle. If not for the fact that Eli had taken away a large part of the curse, he could have even advanced to the sixth circle directly.

But even if he did not, he was still a peak fifth-circle existence. In fact, because of his nature, he was stronger than an ordinary peak fifth-circle warlock!

He didn’t think that Eli could defeat him.

“If you hand over the Calamity Lich to me now, I can let you live a little longer,” he said again.

“Alright, then come and get it!” Eli smiled as he reached out his hand, and the Lich of Calamity appeared in his hand.

“Throw it over!”

“Come and get it yourself!”

“Alright, looks like we still have to fight!” The black fog said coldly. The boundless black fog covered the sky. He seemed to be hiding within it, like a high and mighty sky.

In an instant, the area within tens of thousands of miles fell into darkness.

Gulp!

On the ground, everyone who had just recovered from the fact that the Liches had died felt their scalps go numb again.

What the hell was going on today?

“This aura is too strong.” A peak Thousand Leaves Warlock looked at the squirming black fog in the sky. A human face slowly appeared, staring straight at Eli.

Even though the pressure was not directed at him, he still found it difficult to breathe.

“Brother Eli.” Vivika ignored the lich beside her and looked at Eli with concern.

Everyone’s eyes were focused on the sky.

They understood that this would be the final battle!

..

In the sky.

Feeling the pressure from all directions, Eli smiled.

In the next second, his bloodline instantly began to burn like a flame. A blood-colored fog wrapped around him like a blood-colored fire god.

However, in this transformation, his aura was soaring.

Double.

Twice.

..

Nine times!

The Explosive Blood Secret Technique was a secret technique that Eli had obtained earlier. The ninth level was a level that even the creator had never used before. This was because he had died from overburning his life force at the fifth level.

Meanwhile, Eli had successfully cultivated it to its peak in the past few years.

At this moment, this secret technique was at its peak.

At the same time, Eli’s eyes were also flickering. His Mercury Eye had reached its limit. His faintly discernible mental strength was affecting the surroundings, even causing the surrounding air to begin to distort.

In the sky, Black Fog looked at Eli, and his pupils suddenly dilated.

Why was current Eli’s aura a little…ridiculous?

And every second, he could feel the large amount of life force that Eli was burning. Was he really crazy? Does he want to die there?

“You lunatic!” His voice was sharp.

This was the first time he had seen a lunatic who was crazier than he was!

He did not dare to wait any longer!

He was wrapped in endless black fog and transformed into a huge shadow palm. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The giant palm brought with it black smoke as it attacked Eli.

The huge palm was almost ten thousand meters wide, like a piece of land falling from the sky. Before it landed, the ground had already felt the pressure and began to sink slowly.

This palm was like a demon god in the world!

The Warlocks were unable to move at all. This palm even had the ability to lock down space.

“Brother Eli!” Vivika looked at Eli in the sky with difficulty, but he still did not move. This made her afraid and worried, and her body even began to tremble!

However, just as the giant palm was about a hundred meters away from Eli…

Suddenly, he moved!

Eli raised his staff, and in an instant, endless light bloomed.

Warmth, gentleness, purification, recovery…

Light!

Weng!

Like sunlight meeting snow, light swept through space. The black fog began to disintegrate, and the huge palm seemed to have met its nemesis, collapsing directly.

“How is this possible? What law was that? How could the black fog laws be destroyed?” Seeing this scene, the black fog’s face was extremely terrified.

At this moment, he felt that his worldview had collapsed.

He was a strange life form born from the black fog, and he knew his origins. He knew that the black fog had no counter in the mage’s world but that day… He had encountered Light!

He felt that every inch of the black fog that came into contact with the light was disintegrating.

He finally understood Eli’s confidence.

He panicked!

At this moment, he was completely panicking!

” Eli, everything is negotiable!” He looked at Eli in horror.

However, Eli ignored him, and he raised his staff again.

What happened just now was just a small test. The real attack was coming up next.

Light gathered in front of Eli and gradually transformed into a ten-thousand-meter-tall angel. Layers of purifying power rippled out, and the power of faith grew pairs of wings behind him.

The power of light transformed into a sharp sword with the eternal burning bloodline fire attached to it. There was also the mental power provided by the silvery-white eye, which rippled around like divine might.

“Try my Blazing Angel!” Eli shouted, and all his power exploded.

In the next second, the angel spread her wings, and light bloomed. She raised her head and let out a furious roar as she charged towards the black fog. She gripped her sword tightly and pierced through the black fog.

“No!”

The black mist cried out in fear. Layers of black mist rushed toward the angel, but they were easily broken through.

In the blink of an eye, the angel had already arrived in front of the black fog. Then, she held her sword and plunged it into the black fog.

The light faded.

In the next moment, a dazzling light erupted.

“No!”

An even more mournful wail sounded for a moment before it ended!

On the ground, all the Warlocks looked at this scene in shock.

In the sky, the black fog dispersed, and light descended. The Angel also completely exploded in the black fog. The explosion crossed tens of thousands of meters and wanted to dispel all the darkness. Everyone could not help but close their eyes. Vivika put on a shield for herself and David!

The light lasted for a few minutes before it slowly dissipated.

She opened his eyes again.

There was no longer any black fog in the sky, only a blue sky. All the bloodstains on the ground had disappeared, and all the Liches had perished in the light, except for David, who was protected by Vivika.

As for the black fog, there was no trace of it at all.

There was only one person left in the sky.

“Sir Eli.”

Everyone looked at the god-like Eli in the sky, and their eyes were filled with fanaticism as if they were infected by the light. There were no exceptions.

The scene was too shocking!

This also meant that the war was over!

“It’s over!”

In the sky, Eli looked at the black mist and took a deep breath.

However, he suddenly noticed something not far away.

He reached out and took it. It was a black gem-like crystal!

“Was it left behind after the Black Fog died?” Eli was puzzled, but it was obviously not the time to study it.

He put it away and flew in the direction of Vivika.

However, before he could fly for a few hundred meters, an ancient aura suddenly enveloped the sky. The air rippled, and he instantly felt as if he was locked on!

Eli raised his head.

In the sky, a familiar vortex slowly appeared, and a vast aura descended!

“Wait!” Eli opened his mouth wide.

He had experienced a similar scene once, a long time ago.

Did destroying the black fog count?

Was this considered a major contribution to the world?

“This is good!” Eli muttered subconsciously.

In the next moment, the world’s will enveloped Eli.
