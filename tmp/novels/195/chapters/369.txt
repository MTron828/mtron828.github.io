370 Feast

Two months passed in a flash.

The restoration work of Bloodline City was basically completed, and the time for the feast was also confirmed. It would be in a week.

A week later.

The entire Bloodline City instantly became noisy. Countless Warlocks walked out of their houses, and the city was decorated with lanterns and streamers of various colors. Everyone was very happy.

At the top of the city, in a spacious hall, the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower had already gathered.

Glen had already changed into a layer of gorgeous clothes and was standing outside the hall, but his expression was not very good.

” Sir, it’s confirmed. None of the forces near the Bloodline Tower have come. ” Alida came to Glen’s side and said.

“Is that so?” Glen sighed helplessly.

Although he was helpless about this, he completely understood the actions of these forces.

The Manticore clan had not been completely destroyed yet.

If they didn’t want to come, then so be it. They could just treat it as a celebration within the Bloodline Tower.

” Sir Eli will be here soon, and we can begin. ” Glen said to Alida.

“Yes, I’ll go and call the Lord now.” Alida nodded and walked out.

Glen walked into the hall.

There were already many Warlocks in the hall. Most of these forces belonged to the Bloodline Tower.

At this moment, these people were also whispering.

” It seems that no major powers dare to come. In the end, only those who can’t refuse will come. ” A muscular Warlock shook his head.

” Isn’t that so? They’re still afraid of the Manticore Family. ” Another old man sighed.

” Heh, I think the Bloodline Tower will be destroyed sooner or later. The Manticore Family won’t let the Bloodline Tower go. ” Some of them weren’t that interested in the Bloodline Tower. They thought that the Bloodline Tower had made them take on an unknown risk.

” Quiet, quiet, Sir Eli is here. ” Suddenly, a Warlock at the door shouted.

Everyone instantly quieted down and looked towards the door.

Glen stood at the very front of the hall, watching.

Alida was the first to enter, followed by Eli. He was dressed in a black warlock robe, his hands empty. He looked very easy-going, and there was always a faint smile on his face.

Upon seeing Eli enter, the people who had been badmouthing the Bloodline Tower didn’t dare to speak. Although they didn’t think much of the Bloodline Tower’s future, Eli was a Radiant Moon powerhouse.

” Since you’re here, Eli, and I think everyone’s here, let’s get started. ” Glen said to Eli.

“Sure.” Eli nodded and walked toward Glen.

Glen took out a box from the side. When he opened the box, there was a golden ring inside. This was the identification of the Honorary Tower Master.

In fact, Eli had seen this ring yesterday and knew that it was a high-level mage ring. It was passed down from the mage era and was a fourth-circle mage tool. Its function was to store fifty units of celestial stars, which could be used by a mage at any time.

Eli was also very surprised. He did not expect that an Honorary Tower Master would actually obtain a fourth-circle mage Tool.

At that time, Eli even asked.

He still hadn’t forgotten Glen’s answer.

” This thing requires too much mental strength. Warlocks can’t use it. I instead use it as proof of identity. ”

“Come on.” At this moment, Glen took out the ring.

Eli walked over and put on the ring under everyone’s gaze.

In the next second, everyone started clapping to celebrate Ely becoming the Bloodline Tower’s Honorary Master.

The ceremony was so simple, and Eli was very satisfied with it.

The banquet was next. Usually, the Bloodline Tower would have a friendly conversation with other forces, but since most forces didn’t come, there was nothing for Eli to do.

At this moment, some Warlocks had already begun to decorate the hall and prepare for the banquet.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving,” Eli said to Glen.

“Yes.” Glen also nodded helplessly.

If not for the Manticore incident, it would have been quite lively today.

” Sir Eli, you can’t leave. If you leave, wouldn’t I have come here for nothing? ” At this moment, a pleasant voice came from outside the hall.

Everyone looked over curiously and saw a woman slowly walking in.

The purple Warlock robe accentuated her curvaceous figure like a ripe peach. She had a faint smile on her face as she walked in leisurely. Her body was emitting a faint, pleasant smell.

The woman came to the main hall and said with a smile, “The Charm Mansion, Radiant Moon Warlock Lobelia has come to congratulate Lord Eli! ”

Seeing the woman who suddenly appeared, everyone was stunned, and their mouths were wide open.

Since when did the Bloodline Tower have a relationship with a faction that could be found all over the central continent? Furthermore, a Radiant Moon Warlock had come to pay a visit.

Even Glen was stunned. They didn’t have much contact with this force.

He turned his head to look at Eli, his small eyes seemingly asking him if he was the one who invited her.

But he noticed that there was confusion in Eli’s eyes. Ely didn’t understand either. He thought about it and realized that the only connection he had with the Charm Mansion was Liliana.

As if she could see the confusion in Eli’s eyes, Lobelia explained, “Liliana is my student. ”

Is that so?

Eli nodded. He understood.

” I came here not only to congratulate you but also to establish a friendly relationship with the Bloodline Tower. ”

...

Lobelia’s words shocked many Warlocks.

Although the Charm Mansion was spread throughout the various cities, there weren’t many people who had established contact with them. They picked their allies very carefully. It seemed that the Charm Mansion really had high hopes for the Bloodline Tower or Ely.

At this moment, Glen was laughing so hard that his heart was about to crack.

The Charm Mansion was the largest information organization in the Bloodline Tower. Once they establish contact, it would be great news for the Bloodline Tower.

“Then I’ll need you to have a good talk with Tower Master Glen.” Eli nodded.

“Yes.” Lobelia nodded and entered the banquet hall.

The arrival of the Charm Mansion directly blew up the entire venue.

At this moment, Lobelia shrugged her shoulders helplessly. Her words had come true, and she was really the only force to come.

Suddenly, a voice came from outside the door. Lobelia turned around.

A man with a determined expression walked in. He was wearing a gorgeous golden spotted Magus robe, and the aura he gave off surprised Lobelia even more. He had actually reached the Radiant Moon realm, and she would never mistake this robe for something else.

“Golden Cicada Merchant Association!” Not only he, but the other Warlocks also gaped at this scene.

...

Why would the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce be here? It was a large Chamber of Commerce that was spread all over the Central Mainland.

If it was the Charm Residence, they might still have some connections, but the Golden Cicada Merchant Association did not have any branches nearby.

As soon as the man walked in, he asked directly, “I wonder who Sir Eli is.”

“I am,” Eli replied.

” Greetings, sir. I’m Collina. This time, I’ve come to pay you a visit under the orders of Sir Jin Ji of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association. This time, I’ve brought millions of magic crystals, including the Void Abyss Stone and the bloodline essence… After this, he will also establish a new branch here.

“Also, because Lord Jin Ji is heading to the central region, he asked me to pass on a message on his behalf. He is also very sad about Lord Herman’s death.” Collina’s tone was sonorous and forceful.

“Understood.” Ian nodded. It seems that Ian had already sent the information to the higher-ups in Holmes City.

Jin Ji was already a big shot now!

At this moment, other than Eli, the others were once again confused.

“Jin Ji?” Lobelia blinked.

This was a top-notch figure in the Western Region, equivalent to the director of the Charm Mansion in the Western Region. How could Eli be related to such a person? Moreover, he had sent so many supplies. Their relationship was definitely not shallow. This was completely different from the news that Eli knew no one important!

Hiss!

On the other side, Glen narrowed his eyes, looking confused.

Who was he?

The Warlocks of the other small forces also quieted down. There was only one thought in their minds.

Were they in the Bloodline Tower?

In this silence, another Warlock walked in.

He was wearing a crimson Warlock robe and did not look ordinary, but the aura he emitted had reached the level of a fourth-circle Morning Star warlock.

At this moment, when he entered and looked at the quiet hall, he seemed to be a little confused. When he saw the people from the Golden Cicada Merchant Association and the Charm Mansion, his eyes widened as if he didn’t expect to meet people from these forces.

His throat moved slightly, and then he asked cautiously, “I wonder which one of you is Sir Eli. ”

“Me!” Eli blinked again. Seeing the Warlock robe, he knew who it was.

He didn’t expect that his arrival would attract the attention of so many old friends, but it was normal. His current identity was Herman’s student.

” Greetings, Sir Eli. I’m from the Holy Tower. You can call me Luo Bu. This time, I’m here on behalf of my young tower master, Sir Luo Ye. I’ve brought resources worth 500,000 magic crystals. ” the Warlock said humbly.

Holy Tower? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yet another major force, one that was even stronger than the manticore.

At this moment, people were already numb.

Lobelia was already in the crowd. ‘How do you know so many forces?’

Mara, who was standing at the side, seemed to be a little surprised. The investigation before coming was not like this!

Bang!

The knocking on the door sounded again, and another Warlock poked his head in.

Lobelia looked over. She didn’t recognize him, but his aura was at the peak of Nebula, one step away from Radiant Moon.

Another one?

That person came here as soon as he entered and walked straight toward Eli.

” Sir, I’m here to celebrate and apologize. This is a million magic crystals worth of resources. ” Amanta lowered his head and took out a Space Ring.

Eli pursed his lips.

Today was even more lively than he had imagined.

The Charm Mansion, the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, the Holy Tower, and the Lord of Holmes City, Amanta.

Interesting!
