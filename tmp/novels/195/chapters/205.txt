206 Fishing in Troubled Waters

“Sigh, another boring day!”

As usual, murloc Moke put on his scale armor and held a bone spear that glowed with white light. He walked out of the camp and began to patrol according to the route.

As one of the tribe’s guards, his job was to patrol every day. The content was simple, but in fact, the reward was not bad. If his father were not a first-circle murloc, he would not have been able to obtain it!

Looking at the familiar environment around him, he patrolled around in boredom, not feeling that there would be any problems.

!!

The murloc tribe had occupied this area for decades and was a small force in the vicinity. No one dared to provoke them, except for those high-level magic beasts with low intelligence. However, they usually did not come here.

“Maybe I should go to the hunting squad and take a look.” Moke’s body was swimming in the water.

This job was too boring.

Why don’t I take a break?

Moke’s eyes rolled, and then he ran directly to a rock pillar at the bottom of the sea not far away. He inserted the bone spear into it and then leaned on it.

It was wonderful.

“This is the life that murlocs should have!” Moke’s huge mouth moved up and down, and bubbles appeared one after another. His fish head was up as if he was feeling the sunlight on the sea.

“Eh, why did it suddenly turn dark?”

Suddenly, Moke felt his vision go dark, and he muttered as he looked up.

Then, he saw a scene that made him stunned.

In the ocean not far away, a few seven to eight-meter-long devil killer whales were swimming towards him. Their bodies were like cannonballs, leaving a trail in the water. Their huge bodies were blocking the light.

In addition to these few devil killer whales, there were also many different kinds of marine creatures following behind them, and their target was the murloc tribe.

“What?!” Moke’s fish eyes widened, and his mouth could not close for a long time.

He immediately swam away from the rock pillar, not even having the time to pull out his weapon.

When the devil killer whale Army passed by, he immediately swam toward the tribe. He was extremely fast, and he felt that he had never been this fast in his life.

He had no choice. If he were not fast, he would be finished.

Soon, after passing through a few small paths, he returned to the murloc camp. At this time, between the rock pillars, hundreds of murlocs were inside. Some of them were grinding weapons, some were eating, and some were reproducing.

“Invasion!”

The murloc used all its strength and shouted in all directions.

With the help of the murlocs’ special receiving device, all the murlocs immediately raised their heads. Their fish eyes revealed a puzzled expression as they looked at Moke.

“Damn it!”

Moke gritted his teeth and immediately ran to a reef not far away. There was a huge conch hanging on it.

In the next moment, the sound of conch shells rang out in the camp. The ripple-like sound swept through the entire camp, like a rooster crowing, waking the entire camp up.

This time, all the murlocs were shocked.

Because this conch could only be blown when a threat to the camp was found …

The next moment, they understood why the conch had been blown. In the ocean, not far away, the sea tribe Army led by the killer whales arrived.

“kill!!!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Hu Wei, the whale that negotiated with Ro before, gave the order, and all the creatures swam toward the murloc tribe.

The murlocs reacted quickly as well. Many of them picked up the weapons beside them and made strange sounds. A seemingly disorderly but stable camp was quickly formed.

In the ocean, a battle could happen at any time.

Needless to say, every murloc quickly arrived at their position.

“kill!!!” Hu Wei’s low and muffled voice sounded.

The devil killer whales led by him charged into the murlocs’ line of defense and began to kill. In an instant, wails filled the air, and blood dyed the sea red.

The fierce battle began.

..

The battle began.

On the other side of the ocean, a two-meter-long small fish silently sneaked into the reef and entered the territory of the murloc tribe.

“It’s indeed tragic!”

As he sneaked in, he looked towards the center of the battle.

The leader of the invasion, Hu Wei, did not have any weapons. He was relying on his strong physical fitness, tail fin, and teeth to kill. Just like that, dozens of murlocs were killed by him in the blink of an eye.

The others were almost the same. The devil killer whales were much stronger than the murlocs. There was no comparison at all. It was obvious that the murlocs were at a disadvantage.

So, Eli had to hurry up.

Two years of scouting had given Eli a clear understanding of the terrain here, and he swam quickly toward a part of the murloc tribe without hesitation.

The underwater magic plant garden was right behind the murloc tribe. Usually, it would take some effort to sneak in, but the flustered murlocs had no time for him at the moment, so in just a few minutes, Eli had already arrived at his destination.

“This is the place.” Eli stood between the rocks, looking at the magical plant garden not far away.

This was an underwater magic plant garden built between seven or eight rock pillars. It was very large, estimated to be dozens of acres in size, and had only one entrance, which was between two rock pillars.

As most of the murlocs had participated in the war, there were not many people here at the moment. There were only five or six murlocs guarding the place, and their ranks were not high.

After making sure that there was no one around, Eli didn’t bother hiding anymore and rushed straight for the entrance.

..

At this time, a few murlocs were anxiously guarding the door, their eyes constantly looking at the magical plant garden behind them and the distance. They were struggling to decide whether to guard or fight.

...

“Damn it, the invaders seem to be devil killer whales. Aren’t they from the coast? why are they here!?” The leader of the group was a murloc from the first circle. He said anxiously.

Killer whales were powerful creatures born at the limit of the zero-circle, so how could the murlocs be a match for them? Although it seemed like there were only a few whales, he knew that they couldn’t win.

“Why don’t we just run away?” The murloc pursed his lips. He wanted to run.

But the next second, he was no longer in the mood. He saw a fish swimming quickly in his direction not far away.

“Sha Ju fish!” The murloc was puzzled. Wasn’t this a kind of zero-circle fish creature that was common in the surrounding waters? It had a gentle personality. What was going on?

The murloc’s eyes were filled with doubt, but his eyes widened more and more. In his vision, the Sha Ju fish had begun to gradually change into a half-dragon covered in scales and was coming at them at an extremely fast speed.

“Enemy attack!”

The first circle murloc understood and immediately began to shout. The other murlocs around them also reacted, picking up their weapons and rushing towards Eli.

In the next second, a shadow swept past, and blood-colored flowers bloomed in the sea instantly, adding a hint of color to the dark blue seawater. Eli was not affected in the slightest.

“Damn it!”

The first circle murloc’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. This guy was too strong.

...

“I surrender. I know all the distribution of the potions and the traps inside!” A wave of spiritual energy flashed as he shouted, but the next second, a shadow flashed in front of him.

Fresh blood splattered as the murloc died instantly.

Eli’s figure didn’t even stop as he swam straight toward the magical plant garden.

He had not worked for two years for nothing, and he was very clear about the layout inside.

After passing through the passageway of two rock pillars, Eli’s body gradually slowed down as he looked inside.

In front of him was a large patch of sea plants that looked like kelp. It was a type of magical seaweed that could even be used as food at times. It was usually quite valuable, but that was not the purpose of Eli’s trip, so he continued swimming forward.

Along the way, Eli easily dodged a few traps and killed a few murlocs who were working. Three minutes later, he arrived at the destination of the trip.

The core of the underwater magic plant garden.

A small area surrounded by sea thorns was the core area where the murlocs planted the most precious materials. It was a flat area on the seabed.

“Water elemental fruit!”

Through the obstacles, Elie saw a huge tree in the center of the area!

It looked like a coral bush and grew on the bottom of the sea, but it was five to six meters tall. On this water element fruit tree, there were five water element fruits growing on it.

This was the last ingredient that Eli needed.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a loud shout could be heard. Upon hearing it, Eli looked over. Next to the fruit tree, there was an old murloc at the peak of the second circle. His skin was stuck to his bones, and it was obvious that he was very old, but his aura was still there.

At this moment, his sunken eyes were staring at Eli, and his fish face was serious.
