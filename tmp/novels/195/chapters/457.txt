458 Sixty Years

The incident with the Saka Family was caused by the Heart of the Abyss!

Thank you readers!

After seeing this Stone fragment, there was no longer any doubt. Everything had an answer.

But Eli’s heart sank!

That was the Heart of the Abyss, the only First-Class Force in the Western Region and also the strongest force in the Western Region!

“What a troublesome matter!” Eli stood up and thought about what he should do next!

!!

However, for a cautious person like him, he had no other choice. There were only two options. One was to pretend that nothing had happened and slowly develop like usual. The other was to run away. Of course, the situation had not reached that stage yet, but Eli was ready at any time!

Eli thought for more than ten minutes before finally choosing a plan!

” The first is to develop slowly. I’ll first make myself stronger and stronger, but I can’t let the Heart of the Abyss feel too comfortable. After all, the fact that they were able to open the Demon Passage and manipulate the Eight-Armed Naga’s bloodline shows that their goal is probably the entire Western Regions or even more.

“Secondly, the Bloodline Tower had to be prepared for battle at any time. We had to make secret preparations for the war. I also have to be prepared to run away at any time. No matter how precious the Bloodline Tower is, it is not as precious as my life. As long as there is time, I can rebuild a faction like this, although it will be a little troublesome!

“Lastly, I need to build a large-scale magic tool to expand my understanding of divination spells and see how strong Nero is!” Eli quickly came up with three plans!

After thinking about it, Eli heaved a sigh of relief. He realized that at his level, it was not easy to kill him. However, he still had to be serious enough because no matter what the Heart of the Abyss’s next plan was, it would have a major impact on him.

Unless he had no other choice, he did not want the huge force he had established to be destroyed so easily.

Thinking of this, Eli turned to look at Vivika. He was still waiting for Eli.

“What do you plan to do next?” asked Eli.

Seeing that Eli had regained his senses, Vivika was stunned for a moment before she quickly said, “Brother Eli, I want to join the new team guarding the Heart of the Abyss!”

“No, this is non-negotiable. I can tell you that there’s a huge problem with the Heart of the Abyss.” Eli rejected her terrifying idea without even thinking!

Vivika wanted to say something, but when she saw the determination in Ely’s eyes, she seemed to understand something. After a full minute of silence, she said, “Then I’ll join Brother Eli’s laboratory. During my time in the Heart of the Abyss, I always felt that I should be very talented in these things!”

Upon hearing this, Eli revealed a strange expression.

After decades of fighting, shouldn’t she be better at fighting? Why would she be better at research? What a change!

“Alright then.”

Eli agreed easily. It was her personal choice anyway, and he had no right to interfere. Besides, he had a feeling that it might really work. He did not forget that Vivika was a genius in the field of bloodline research in her previous life. She even managed to research the reincarnation of the bloodline.

Although it failed in the end, it might really help him shorten the experiment process.

“Yes!” Vivika also smiled.

Vivika walked towards the laboratory while Eli returned to the Grassi Land!

…..

Three years later!

It was an ordinary year for Eli, but it was significant for the Bloodline Tower.

This year, Alida advanced to the celestial realm, and the Bloodline Tower had completely absorbed the Saka Family, making them the overlord of the Western Regions.

And this year, Eli secretly commanded the races of the Green Field and the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower to start producing war magic tools in preparation for a possible war in the future!

At this time, Vivika joined the laboratory and began to understand and study the Warlock bloodline. As expected, she found nothing. After all, she had just started her research. Eli could understand that even a genius needed some accumulation.

Jin Ji also gained complete control of the entire Golden Cicada Merchant Association in the Western Regions during this year. His influence had expanded, and the cooperation that the two of them had discussed three years ago had also entered its initial stages.

Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner!

Ten years later!

With the support of a large number of expensive potions, Eli’s celestial Power had reached 260 points.

With the cooperation of the dragon Ortiz, the experiment on the bloodline avatar was carried out in an orderly manner. At this moment, Vivika also displayed extraordinary bloodline talent, as if letting Eli see the shadow of Vivika. At this moment, she was already the person in charge of this experiment.

At this moment, the Bloodline Tower’s wealth had reached the standard of a Level 1 force.

He was also studying the Shadow law and the Black Fog, but they were still a little complicated for Eli, so the progress of his research was slow. Of course, Eli did not mind and still spent time studying them every day!

During this period, the Heart of the Abyss suggested to the various factions to cancel the support of the various factions to guard the abyss.

Eli was the first to object. Under the pressure of Eli’s faction and the desire of other factions to establish a connection with the Bloodline Tower, everyone also opposed it. Tuman smashed his glass in anger, but there was nothing he could do. Eli was very happy!

Another ten years.

That year, Glen died.

Although he had experienced the treatment of the Origin of Life back then, he was already close to the end of his life. Although it was more than ten years early, it was normal.

The Bloodline Tower observed a three-day silence. Everyone respected the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower’s last era!

Eli and Alida presided over the funeral together. Watching his new friend die, Eli was filled with emotions.

Ever since he became a high-level warlock, Eli rarely felt the death of his friends. But on this day, he understood that, so what if they were Celestial Warlocks? They would still die when their lifespan was up. No one could survive except for himself!

This year, Eli’s celestial Power was 270 points. This was achieved through the massive wealth he had accumulated and various channels.

Money could do most things!

Another five years!

In the Grassi Land, a huge building that looked like a signal tower was built. This was a tool used to increase the reliability of divination, and it cost millions of Magic Stones!

After expending a large number of life points, Eli finally had a better understanding of Nero’s strength.

The success rate was seven points.

This was also the first time that Eli knew that Nero’s strength was so terrifying, far surpassing the average half-step fifth-circle warlock.

This year, Eli’s celestial power was 274 points.

At this moment, his analysis of the celestial Body and the Bloodline avatar had reached 50%. It was developing rapidly. Eli had also invested a lot of resources and Magic Stones. Of course, this was not the only thing. At this moment, whether it was the airship or the storage of the mage Tools, it could be said to be huge. It was as if they were preparing for a war!

Eli was still quietly developing.

At this moment, he no longer investigated the Heart of the Abyss. Since he had already determined that there was a problem, there was no need to do so. However, he would specifically observe their movements and secretly cut off many of their resource channels. This had caused the Heart of the Abyss to be in a lot of trouble recently.

They were upset, but Eiy was happy.

Another ten years.

The analysis of the celestial and bloodline had reached 75% and 76% respectively. Vivika’s progress had surpassed Eli’s for the first time.

After decades of development, the Bloodline Tower was now only weaker than the Heart of the Abyss!

Just when Eli thought that the year would be normal, something happened. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The Western Regions was shaken again!
