342 Herman’s Death

At this moment.

The bloodline tower.

Kriman, who was already 1600 years old, was sitting cross-legged in the Tower, feeling his bloodline.

Compared to 800 years ago, he was now at the Nebula level, just 200 years away from the agreement he had with Eli.

!!

“There are still two hundred years?” He frowned.

A fourth-circle warlock could only live for about 2000 years, so he could only live for a few hundred years at most. However, he was used to the feeling of being supported by resources, and he could not leave the bloodline tower.

“Forget it. It’s fine like this.” Kriman shook his head.

He didn’t want to go back to the central continent anyway, and he couldn’t defeat Herman.

He had met Herman a few times in the past hundreds of years, but Herman’s level was only way higher than his. He had tried to challenge Herman, but he could barely last more than a few moves.

“Such a person is willing to stay on the West Coast.” He could not understand.

With strength like Eli’s, he would be considered a champion even in the central continent. He could not understand why he would be so ‘unmotivated’.

He cast his gaze into the distance.

He was probably one of the few people who still remembered Herman. Even the previous tower master, Hein, had already stepped down, and now, even the new tower master was about to step down. In just a few hundred years, the bloodline tower had gone through many rounds of power changes.

But suddenly, his expression changed.

He could feel the aura of a new celestial on Mercury Island.

“It should be that giant snake, Hydra or Nikola.” He immediately thought of the two “people” around Herman.

It was almost time.

A month later.

Once again, he felt the aura of another celestial.

“Another advancement?” Kriman was dumbfounded.

The interval was too short.

This time, he had even less intention of leaving this place.

But a month later, Eli actually summoned him.

…

Walking on Mercury Island.

Kriman’s old body looked at the Hydra that was entrenched on the mountain in the distance, as well as the aura of the celestial undead that came from the other side of the island. He finally confirmed his guess.

Hydra and Nikola had really advanced.

“I wonder why Milord has come to find me.” Kriman lowered his head and pondered.

Soon, he arrived outside the Tower.

The door opened automatically.

“The second floor’s living room!” A voice was heard.

Kriman was stunned for a moment before he walked in and arrived at the room on the second floor.

However, when he entered the room, he found an unfamiliar man sitting inside.

He had black hair and black eyes. He looked extremely young, but he was very handsome. To him, this was an unfamiliar face. However, this person was wearing familiar clothes, and there was a familiar threaded staff beside him.

“And you are?” Kriman asked.

“What’s wrong? Don’t you recognize me? I’m Herman!” Eli smiled.

After hearing the voice, he was sure that it was Herman, but he was still confused. Why did he change his appearance?

“This is what I originally looked like. Or you can also call me Eli. That’s my real name, ” Eli replied with a smile.

He decided to use his own name and face. As for the name Herman, he would just let it go with the wind.

Kriman was dumbfounded.

He had never thought that Herman would use a fake face and name.

Or perhaps Herman had been replaced many years ago, or perhaps the bloodline tower was Herman’s in the beginning but was later replaced by this guy called Eli.

Kriman didn’t think much of it.

At the very least, Herman would have been Eli by the time he subdued him.

But Kriman was also feeling apprehensive. After all, Eli suddenly revealed his name and identity to him, which meant that something big was going to happen.

As expected, just as he finished thinking, he heard Eli say, “I have something to discuss with you.”

“Your Excellency, please speak!” Kriman also sat down on the sofa opposite Eli and said respectfully.

“I’m going to leave the West Coast and head to the main tower in the central continent,” Eli said calmly.

“That’s a good thing!” Kriman said.

He didn’t understand what the problem was.

“But I’m not going to use Herman’s identity. I’m going to use Eli’s.”

“Sir, I understand.” Kriman nodded.

At this moment, he was certain of his guess. Herman had definitely been replaced by Eli a long time ago.

As for why he didn’t use Herman’s identity, the reason was simple. Herman’s identity was too old. If he remembered correctly, Herman was more than 2000 years old, so it wasn’t appropriate.

...

“My Lord, you mean Herman should die, right?” Kriman asked cautiously.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

He had deliberately guided Kriman. It seemed that he really “understood.”

“That’s right. Herman will die in a few days, and his disciple, Eli, will take over as the new tower master. After that, he’ll break through to the celestial realm. After that, I’ll take some people and leave the West Coast. I’ll have to trouble you to help me guard the West Coast.” Eli didn’t hide anything and directly revealed his plan.

“Sir, I understand.” Kriman took a deep breath.

He had never thought that such a thing would actually happen today.

However, he wasn’t sad because Herman said that he would be in charge of the West Coast. It was a good thing, at least for him.

However, this also meant one thing, and that was that he had to submit completely to Eli.

Otherwise, he might not have been able to leave this place today.

“Sir, don’t worry. From today onwards, I will only be loyal to you!” Kriman immediately stood up and expressed his loyalty.

“Alright!” Eli nodded in satisfaction.

...

Kriman had always been tactful. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Soon, Kriman, who had been branded with a soul brand, left. His next task was to clean up some information about Herman and prepare for the next step.

…

A month later, in the year 4582 of the new calendar.

A piece of news spread.

Herman, the strongest person in the bloodline tower of the West Coast, a fourth circle celestial, had died at the age of 2400.

The news shocked the entire West Coast.

After all, Herman’s statues were found in every city on the West Coast. On this day, countless people walked out of their houses and came to the statues to offer flowers. There was even a shortage of flowers on the West Coast that day, and all the wildflowers in the surrounding area were plucked.

At this moment, some people also made a compilation of Herman’s life. Only then did everyone know how glorious and brilliant his life was?

He built the White Tower, destroyed the bloodline family, destroyed the black Isotta Alliance, destroyed the heart of the night, fought against the holy tower, fought against the hourglass, and fought against the Marine race.

It was as if every major event that had happened in the past was related to him, and his role in it was indispensable.

Without him, the United West Coast would not exist.

His brilliant resume stirred up memories of countless people and also made the new generation of warlocks admire him.

Amidst all the blessings, what Eli didn’t expect was that his faith imprint would fill up again.

“I wonder if this counts as a log-in reward for my new identity.”

And in this chaos, even Herman’s last disciple, Eli, becoming the new tower master didn’t seem to cause much of a stir.
