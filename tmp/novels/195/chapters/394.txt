395 War Begins

Nightfall City!

It used to belong to the Manticore Family but was later recovered by the Bloodline Tower after the Manticore Family was destroyed. Now, it was the northernmost city of the Bloodline Tower. To the south was the Bloodline Tower, and to the north was a force under the Akasha Family!

In the past, very few people would come to this city. There were only a few hundred warlocks stationed there.

However, with the Akasha Family’s unusual movements, both the Bloodline Tower and the Akasha Family were gathering there.

In just two weeks, nearly 10,000 Warlocks from the Bloodline Tower had gathered in the city. There was also a similar number of Warlocks from another force outside the city.

As for the large open space outside the city, there was not a single person. It was unusually quiet.

Eli stood on the city wall and looked into the distance calmly.

His gaze seemed to pierce through space, and he saw the Akasha family on the other side.

” The Akasha Family is similar to what Liliana told me, just a little different. But that Radiant Sun warlock is here so early! ” Eli pondered.

For him, sensing an opponent dozens of kilometers away was not a difficult thing.

He had also just arrived today.

At this moment, an undead floated to his side.

“My lord, the Warlocks of the Akasha family are slowly approaching. The battle should start tomorrow or the day after. “Nikola said.

“Alright, then, let the Warlocks get ready.” Eli nodded and said.

“Yes.” Nikola nodded and stood beside Eli.

After observing for a while, Eli was almost done with his observation and walked down the city wall.

At this moment, objects covered in cloth were being moved to the city wall.

“That’s the most basic elemental alchemy cannon!” Nikola noticed.

“Yes.” Eli nodded and continued to walk down. Along the way, he also observed some Warlocks.

Almost all Warlocks had pockets on their robes, which were used to store potions. Their weapons, be they longswords or other weapons, had a clear silver pattern on them. It was a weapon that had a basic rune imprinted on it.

This was one of the results of Eli’s transformation of the Bloodline Tower over the years.

Eli looked forward to their performance. In fact, this was the first time the Bloodline Tower had given Warlocks rune-branded weapons.

After a brief look, Eli and Nikola walked toward the Warlock Tower in the center of the city.

…

At this moment, in a city dozens of kilometers away from the Bloodline Tower.

In a tower.

Fifteen people sat around a table. Most of these Warlocks were the celestials of the Akasha family, while some were Warlocks from their forces. Seven of them were Radiant Moon Warlocks, while the rest were Morning Stars.

At this moment, everyone was looking at the Warlock on the main seat.

It was a tall man with bright eyes that exuded strong confidence. He was the patriarch of the Akasha family, Pavao Akasha, a peak Radiant Moon Warlock.

“Everyone, the battle is about to begin. What are your thoughts?” Pavao looked at everyone and smiled.

” Lord Patriarch, what do you mean? It’s just a Bloodline Tower. There are so many of us here. Could there be any accidents? ” A Warlock laughed.

” Patriarch, the Bloodline Tower only has a bit of money. They didn’t even have many celestials before. It’s only been twenty-five years now. What changes can they have? High-end combat power can’t be accumulated with money. ” The other Warlock also looked relaxed.

“Patriarch, the Bloodline Tower isn’t worth mentioning. The only thing we need to pay attention to is Eli. He’s very likely a peak Radiant Moon Warlock.” a woman reminded.

“Yes.” Pavao nodded.

Although they didn’t care much about the Bloodline Tower, no one dared to ignore Eli.

“If you can’t beat them, I’ll make a move.” Suddenly, a voice broke the silence.

Everyone looked to the side of the room. There was an old Warlock sitting there. His face was wrinkled and he was wearing silver-white armor that glowed with scales. The Warlock had his eyes closed just now, but now he had opened them.

“With Lord Ma Mu’s words, we can rest assured.” Pavao smiled, and so did the others.

The eight-armed Naga before him was also a Radiant Sun Warlock. Even if Eli was a peak Radiant Moon, Ma Mu could still defeat Eli easily.

Even in the worst-case scenario, Eli was Radiant Sun. With Ma Mu holding him back, the rest of them could clean up the city. It was impossible for them to lose!

“Everyone, Sir Jesse has said that after the Bloodline Tower is taken down, they only want the Bloodline Tower’s territory, but all the resources and money collected belong to us. Let’s see how rich this so-called richest third-class force in the Western Region is!”

“Order all Warlocks to set off. Everyone, let’s set off too.”

Pavao stood up and said to everyone.

Everyone smiled expectantly.

Not far away, Ma Mu’s gaze was calm. The cultivation land of their family’s bloodline was getting worse.

They were determined to obtain the Grassi Land.

…

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

The full sun hung high in the sky, sprinkling down sunlight to warm the earth.

It was warm, but Rafik’s body was cold, and it wasn’t only him.

He raised his head and looked around. It was a dark mass of Warlocks from the Bloodline Tower who were there to participate in this battle.

“Our opponent is the Akasha family!” Rafik took a deep breath, feeling extremely nervous.

Although he hadn’t had any contact with this family before, he understood how powerful this family was after being there for the past few days. They were on a completely different level from the Bloodline Tower.

...

“But…” His right hand reached into his pocket, where the potions were given to them. This made him feel much more at ease.

At this moment, he lowered his head and looked at the longsword in his hand. The longsword was made of alloy, and there was a bright pattern on it. He had secretly touched it just now, and he felt that his sword was very hard, and even its sharpness had increased a little.

And that was not all.

He looked behind him.

The huge walls of Night City were engraved with a few complicated patterns, emitting a unique aura. There were also things covered with a cloth on the walls, which did not look simple.

As for the opponent!

He tried his best to peek out.

The plains in the distance were also dark. Huge catapults were placed behind them, and in the sky, there were huge birds with many Warlocks on them. This was something that he could not understand because, this time, the Bloodline Tower did not seem to bring flying magical beasts. Rafik did not know what his lords were thinking.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

He took a deep breath, which made him feel a little more relaxed.

Actually, he wasn’t the only one. At this moment, he looked at the others around him. They all had nervous expressions and didn’t have much confidence.

...

They were still instinctively afraid of the powerful Akasha Family.

However, it was too late to retreat because the arrow was already on the bow and had to be fired.

Suddenly.

A buzzing sound came from afar, and he felt his ears buzzing.

Rafik was stunned.

His spirit instantly tensed up, and his bloodline was activated.

The war had begun!
