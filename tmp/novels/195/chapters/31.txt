“Hurry up!”

Evans’ shrill voice was heard. At the same time, David and Jones, who had been standing not far away, were stunned for a moment before they immediately took action.

One of them headed for the door while the other tried to get out through the hole in the toilet. However, his body was too thick, and he couldn’t get through at all, so he immediately pulled himself out and chased after the door.

“You go that way, and I’ll go this way!”

David pointed to one side of the casino and ran to the other.

The toilet of the casino was located on the right side of the casino. Behind it was where the carriages were parked. There were people on both sides at all times, so Eli was definitely within this range.

They only needed to split into two groups, and they would definitely be able to find him.

“It’s a good thing the boss deployed people just now.” David had golden hair and was wearing a leather jacket, which exposed his rock-hard body. As an intermediate Knight, he was one of the casino owner’s strongest fighters.

He was very fast and quickly entered the alley.

The alleys here were very dark, and there were many of them connected together. Thus, he checked very carefully, not daring to miss a single corner.

Jones was the same. As a low-level Knight, his vision was powerful enough to see the alley clearly even at night.

“Even a mosquito can’t escape my sight!” Jones grinned. They would not be too afraid of a merchant.

Eli snapped the iron bars of the toilet in advance, so he was definitely not a good merchant.

Yes, Jones believed that Eli must’ve worked together from the inside to open the metal bars in advance, which gave him a chance to escape. As for why the metal bars were like that, he couldn’t think of any reason.

‘Eli, where are you?’

The two of them watched very carefully. In the process, the people from the other casinos also joined in.

But ten minutes later, David had already searched half of the place, and Jones had also finished searching the other half.

At the intersection, David and Jones looked at each other in silence.

The seven or eight casino staff behind the two also had ashen faces.

They couldn’t find him!

They had already searched every corner of the place, but there was no trace of him at all.

“We’re done for!”

One of them even fell to the ground. Evans had no strength left in his body, and he was in despair.

At this point, how could he not understand that Eli wasn’t some fat sheep at all, but a hungry wolf in sheep’s clothing and a hungry wolf that had his eyes on them?

What was even more despairing was that he had taken the initiative to bring him in.

Evans could not imagine what would happen next.

“Oh, that’s right, there’s also a carriage!” Evans ‘eyes suddenly lit up as if he had just thought of something.

“Right!” David and Jones also felt a sense of grievance as if they had been played. Everyone immediately ran to where the carriage was placed.

But when they arrived and saw the coachman, the coachman asked with a puzzled look, “That guest rented my carriage, and I’m not his coachman!”

“Do you know his name?” David grabbed the driver and asked with his eyes wide open.

“Sir, cough, cough!” The coachman was lifted up with one hand, and he felt a little breathless.

“David, let go!” Jones couldn’t stand it anymore. The coachman couldn’t say anything even if he wanted to!

David also realized that he was being a little inappropriate. He let go of the coachman, and the coachman fell to the ground. After a few seconds, he stood up in fear.

“I remembered that when he rented the horse, he gave the name Harry Potter.

“Harry Potter!” David and Jones couldn’t help but repeat the name, trying to remember it.

“Let’s go back to see the boss.”

Since they couldn’t find him, they could only go back and wait for their boss’s punishment.

...

“What? You didn’t catch him?”

In the room, the boss’s face was full of anger. He slammed the table in anger, and the hard table made a loud sound.

“Boss, this could be a gang crime!” Jones said in a low voice.

“Oh?” The boss raised his head.

“boss, look, the rental carriage driver, the iron bars that were opened in advance, and the man who disappeared so quickly. This is definitely not something that can be done by one person. There must be a team!” Jones analyzed.

He wasn’t as strong as David, but being smart was one of the reasons why he was able to be on the same level as David.

“It’s possible!” The boss nodded and closed his eyes. Ten seconds later, he opened his eyes again and said, “How much did the casino lose this time?”

“I’ll have to ask about that.” Jones and the others had been here the whole time, so they didn’t know about this. They quickly called the person in charge outside.

“boss, we lost about 80 gold taels in total. The guy named Harry Potter took about a third of it and won 35 gold taels in total. He left seven and took 28.”

“So many?” The boss’s eyes widened in shock at the number.

He thought it would be at most thirty or forty!

“How could there be so many? and where did the other two-thirds go?” The boss rubbed his head and felt a little pain.

“Boss, that guy always starts with small gambles. If he has more, he’ll bet all of it. That’s why he has so many gambling winnings. The rest is from the gambles who followed him and won.” The person in charge didn’t dare to speak anymore.

Eighty gold tarls!

It would probably take them a few months to earn back that amount.

“Boss, should we get the money back from our existing customers?” David asked.

“If you do that today, our casino will close down tomorrow.” The boss’s mouth twitched as he listened to this suggestion. Most of those customers had a certain status, so how could they do that?

They could only suffer in silence.

“Investigate! I want you to find this Harry Potter guy. I must catch him.” The boss stood up and said with a fierce look in his eyes.

“Yes, boss,” Jones nodded and immediately walked out.

They couldn’t do these things well. They had to find a professional.

“Also, don’t tell anyone about what happened today.” Then, the boss ordered the others.

It was too embarrassing. If word got out, he was afraid that his casino would lose face.

“You guys can leave!” After instructing everyone, the boss dispersed everyone. A man sat on a chair, his strong figure seemed to shrink!

“Harry Potter!”

In the room, the boss’s gritting voice echoed.

...

At the same time, at the place where David and Jones had gathered earlier.

In the dark corner, under the moonlight, a man slowly stepped out of the darkness, put on his hat, and walked out of the alley.

Spell-dark concealment.

After avoiding a few people, the man left moon alley.
