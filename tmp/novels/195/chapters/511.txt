512 The Lightning Python

On the second day Lilianna also came, anxious to see Eli.

Ely thought that something had changed, but it turned out to be a matter of the Hamis family.

This also made Eli understand that in some aspects, the assassin organization was faster than the Charm Mansion in terms of intelligence gathering. The difference in intelligence between the two organizations was not to be underestimated. This meant that the intelligence gathering of the two organizations in the Warlock Union was on a completely different level.

After consoling Liliana, he left.

With the help of Eli’s information, Alida quickly organized the Bloodline Tower’s various forces. However, she knew that they couldn’t stop the Hamis Family.

If a battle really broke out, it would depend on the negotiations between the Hamis family and Eli.

Just as they were preparing, a letter from the Warlock Union was sent to Eli.

Eli did not see it and tore it up because he knew what was inside!

Sure enough, on the third day, the Warlock Union announced that Eli had colluded with the Green Field Mage Roland. They also announced that they would kill Eli as punishment and that the Hamis family would do it.

This matter caused a huge commotion. Not only the Western Regions but the entire Central Mainland was shaken by it.

Southern Region!

Unlike the Western Region, this place was jointly controlled by two First-class Forces, the Sea Shark Family, and the Sea Dragon Family.

The two families had been at odds all year round, but today was a rare truce.

In a secret Mage Tower, the two masters gathered together.

“The Bloodline Tower is the ruler of the Western Regions. It has been peaceful for many years, and the Warlock Union is going to make a move on them.” Patriarch Sea Shark frowned and sighed.

“That’s right. Everyone is watching our two families fight endlessly in the outside world, but they have no idea it is just a show. If not, the Warlock Union would have taken over this place already.” The head of the Sea Dragon Clan nodded.

Sigh!

At this point, the two of them sighed again.

Over the years, the Warlock Union had been decaying day by day, but their influence stretched further and further. Several regions were being taken. The local races wanted to fight back, but they were unable to resist at all. Moreover, they lacked a leader.

“Sigh, poor Bloodline Tower. However, after the Western Region falls into the hands of the Warlock Union, it might be us next.”

“Indeed!”

The two of them nodded. As for the possibility of the Bloodline Tower winning, they didn’t even consider it.

After being oppressed by the Warlock Union for so long, they had never seen any hope.

There were many people who had such thoughts, including the head of the Wind God Yaolong family, the only family in the Eastern Region. He sighed deeply as if he could see the same tragic fate happening in the Western Region.

The Northern Region was even worse off. Not only were they facing the Warlock Union, but they were also facing the Lich Tower.

At this moment, the experts of the other domains were affected by the matter of the Western Region. They didn’t gloat or feel happy. They only felt sad.

However, they couldn’t do anything about it. After all, it was the Warlock Alliance!

Even the Hamis family had the ability to easily crush the Bloodline Tower. After all, Eli was known to be the strongest below the fifth ring, but there was a huge difference between the fifth circle and those beneath it.

There was no hope!

..

Golden Cicada Merchant Association.

Jin Ji clenched his fists when he heard the news from his guild leader that he should leave the Western Regions as soon as possible.

Conilla stood in front of him and whispered, “Sir, the Guild Master asked us to leave with the most important resources. Is the situation really that bad?”

Jin Ji looked up at him and asked in a deep voice, “The Hamis family’s target is Eli. If Eli is gone, what do you think will happen to the Western Region? Will the Warlock Union let this land go?”

“They won’t!” Conilla sighed and shook his head.

Yes, the Warlock Union wasn’t a good place to talk to!

However, the roots of their branch were all in the Western Regions. If they left, it would be a completely destructive blow to them. Even for the owners of the Golden Cicada Bloodline, the blow from the Chamber of Commerce might even directly damage their bloodline!

Moreover, for Jin Ji, leaving meant that he had completely given up his position as the president of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association Branch.

“So, Milord, are we leaving?” Conilla was about to speak.

Bang!

The sound of a cup breaking could be heard. Jin Ji looked at Conilla and said, “Take the core members of the Chamber of Commerce and leave the Western Regions for now. I will stay here.”

“My lord!” Conilla’s eyes were about to split.

“Don’t say anymore!” Jin Ji waved his hand and sighed deeply. “Those who lost the Chamber of Commerce went to the Central Region. It’s better to stay here. You should leave first.”

“Sir…” Unwillingness flashed in Conilla’s eyes, but he still left after a few seconds.

Bang!

The door closed. Jin Ji sighed deeply and looked at the ceiling with bitterness in his eyes. “It’s gone. Everything is gone!”

At this moment, even though he had always trusted Eli, he could not see any hope. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

If his opponent was only a fifth-circle warlock, he might still have a glimmer of hope. However, he was facing the Hamis family of the Warlock Union, one of the giants among the Warlocks.

What the hell was this?

..

Bloodline City, Charm Mansion!

Liliana stood on the highest floor of the room and looked at the green grass in the distance.

“How stubborn. Why aren’t you leaving?” Liliana said helplessly.

When they met, he had told her to leave as soon as possible, but he was still the same as before. He had no intention of listening to her and wanted to stay here.

“However…” She would think of the day they met.

It seemed that Eli was not too flustered.

“So, what is your trump card?” She pursed her lips. For the first time, she hoped that this time, Eli would be able to overturn everything like before.

However, she was also very clear about it. It was very difficult, extremely difficult!

But she was still willing to believe it.

“Don’t die!” She closed her eyes and prayed sincerely.

..

The pressure from the Hamis family not only made the various forces nervous.

In the Western Regions, everyone felt extremely nervous and even desperate.

This time, they were facing a member of the Warlock Union, a family with a top-notch bloodline, one of the six ancient families in the world, the Hamis family.

No one thought that they could win!

Everyone was waiting for the day when the Hamis family’s army arrived at the city.

However, to everyone’s surprise, although the Hamis family seemed to have gathered their troops, they had no intention of approaching the Western Regions at all. It was as if they were only preparing.

Just as everyone was puzzled.

Suddenly, a week later!

Outside the Warlock World, in the sky above the Western Region, everyone saw three lightning pythons cross the world membrane and enter the Warlock World. Their bodies were surrounded by lightning as they headed toward the Western Region.

The length of each lightning python was more than 10,000 meters.

What made everyone’s hearts tighten was the bloodline of the Hamis family.

It was the sixth circle bloodline.

Lightning Python!
