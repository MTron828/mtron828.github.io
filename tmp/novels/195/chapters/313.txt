314 Insta-Kill

The sun was shining brightly, and there were no clouds in the sky.

On the second day after Eli received the news, Aisha sent over all the high-level information about the Wanderer’s Alliance, but Eli only took a quick glance.

What a joke!

Although he was very cautious, there was no need for him to look at everything in detail.

“Then, when is Grandmaster going to make his move?” Aisha asked.

“Today’s weather is not bad. It’s a good day to kill.” Eli only looked at the sky and stretched his body, looking relaxed.

Aisha was pleasantly surprised.

“Then, Grandmaster, do you need us to send people to assist you?” Alice asked.

“Assist?”

“No!” Eli shook his head. “get your men out of the enemy’s territory. I don’t want to hurt them accidentally.”

“Yes, I’ll make the arrangements!” Aisha also understood.

The area of a celestial’s attack would definitely be very big. If one was within the range, one might be killed in the aftermath. If one died without knowing why, then one would be too unlucky!

After saying that, Aisha immediately left the room.

On the other hand, Eli took out a reclining chair and basked in the sun, looking relaxed and content.

Half a day later.

“Grandmaster, our people have all evacuated!” Aisha reported.

“Alright,” Eli got up from the recliner and nodded.

The window opened as the wind blew. In Aisha’s vision, Eli turned into a ray of blood-red light and instantly got up and left through the window. With that speed, before Aisha could even see Eli’s figure clearly, he had already disappeared from her vision.

The only proof that he had gone out through the window was that the window was shaking rapidly.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Aisha silently closed the window and left.

It was all up to Grandmaster.

..

At this moment.

In a forest not far from the front line, hundreds of people formed a long line, and the noise was mixed together as they advanced in the direction of the bloodline tower.

“What do you think tower master Aisha is thinking? is she crazy to ask us to evacuate at this time? ”

“That’s right, there’s something wrong with her. She’s much worse than tower master Vivika!”

“Sigh, what’s the difference between retreating at this time and directly sending out resources? isn’t this a betrayal of the bloodline tower? ”

The warlocks discussed animatedly, their faces filled with dissatisfaction.

“Aiyo, the more I think about it, the angrier I get. How can I give up?”

Some of the warlocks loyal to the bloodline tower were even more unhappy. Some of them had witnessed the bloodline tower’s former glory and were dissatisfied with their current retreat.

“Huh? what’s that?” Suddenly, someone pointed at the sky and said.

Everyone looked up at the sky. In the distant sky, blood-colored spots had appeared and were flying toward them.

As they got closer, the color of the blood grew bigger and bigger. Like a shooting star, it finally streaked past them. It was so fast that they couldn’t even see what was inside!

Everyone was silent.

“What the hell is that?” someone asked after a few seconds.

“I don’t know!”

Everyone frowned. The bloody star was heading toward their frontline.

However, there were only people from the Wanderer’s Alliance there at the moment, so it was very dangerous.

What was it?

Some people didn’t understand, but there were also some who were ready to go over and take a look.

..

After advancing to the fourth circle, other than his own speed increasing, the blood ignition technique allowed him to burn even more power, which made his speed even more terrifying.

In just ten minutes, he had arrived at the front line of both sides.

“This is the place.”

In the sky, Eli did not hide his position at all as he looked down at the ground.

This was a plain. On the plain, there were thousands of warlocks stationed. Behind them were dozens of tents. They should be the higher-ups of the Wanderer Alliance, and there were several half-step celestial warlocks!

After a simple observation, even Eli had to admit that the average level of these people was higher than the bloodline tower. They were indeed Wanderers from the central continent.

“Then let’s start,” Eli said nonchalantly, and his mental energy spread out like a wave.

On the ground, countless shadows began to drill out. From the edge of the battlefield, a huge shadow slowly rose like a high wall, a high wall that separated the world.

He wanted to surround the place!

This sudden change was noticed by many people, and they all shouted loudly.

Not long after, thousands of warlocks were awakened. They also saw Eli in the sky. No one knew who he was, but the shadow walls around them were even more terrifying.

Looking at the shadow that was like flowing water, many warlocks were dumbfounded. Their first reaction was to run!

However, a third-circle warlock punched the shadow, but the shadow only wriggled twice. The shadow spread out like ripples, and then there was no more movement.

Even in the sky, the shadow walls continued to extend, and shadow threads appeared, covering the sky. In an instant, the area within a few kilometers turned into a birdcage.

“What is this?”

“My God. He’s at least a half step celestial warlock!”

The warlocks on the ground were panicking. What made them even more afraid was that more and more shadows began to spread inward.

One of the first circle warlocks was accidentally swallowed by the shadow.

The warlocks were panicking, but there were also some who were calm.

“Why are you panicking? We still have three half-step celestial warlocks?” A three-circle warlock shouted.

The others also calmed down a little.

At this moment, the people in the central tent had also noticed the change.
