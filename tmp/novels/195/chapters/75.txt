76 I’ve Planted a Seed

The whole nation mourned the death of Bryne the sixth.

...

“It’s indeed almost time!” Eli was stunned.

Recalling the state of the king he had seen before, it seemed that he could only live for four or five years. The fact that he was able to live until now was already much longer than he had expected. But it was normal. After all, he was a royal, and he must have some precious medicine.

It seemed that this was also the reason why he did not summon the foreign affairs team. After all, he was almost dead, and he probably did not have the time to pay attention to this.

“Eli, let’s go!” When Clement heard the bell, he was also very surprised. However, his many years of life experience told him that it was best to go home at this time.

Just like that, the two of them got into the carriage and returned.

...

Bryne the sixth became the Emperor in the year 265 of the Bryne calendar. It had been 50 years since then. When he had just inherited the throne, the Bryne Empire was no longer as powerful as it was in the past. It was at its weakest in history.

At that time, all the countries wanted to take a bite of the Empire.

But this Emperor was a truly unyielding person. Using his unyielding methods and tenacious will, he quickly carried out all sorts of reforms, and these reforms quickly began to bear fruit.

Bryne’s strength had increased again.

Up until now, although Bryne was not necessarily the strongest in the neighboring countries, he was not considered weak either.

However, with the death of the Emperor, no one knew whether Bryne the seventh could hold the fort. Only time would tell.

...

On the way back, Eli sat in the carriage and looked out the window.

At this moment, Junlin was in a mess. Soldiers were everywhere. They were holding weapons and maintaining the order of Junlin. If someone wanted to do something now, these soldiers would not be polite at all.

“The heavens are about to change!” On the side, Clement kept talking.

“Teacher, don’t be too nervous. At least it won’t affect the library for a while. You just need to take care of your own safety.” Eli said from the side.

“Uh, indeed!” Clement had been a little nervous at first, but after thinking about it carefully, it seemed to be the case, and he slowly relaxed.

“Coachman, stop here for a moment. I’m going to get something!” The carriage stopped somewhere, and Eli stopped the carriage.

“Sir, why don’t I send you home directly? it’s a mess everywhere now.” The coachman said hesitantly.

This was a bustling Street. It was fine on normal days, but at this time, it really felt very chaotic.

“That’s right, Eli. Why don’t you come to my house and wait a few days? ” Clement was also frowning.

“I’m fine!” Eli smiled and walked out of the car. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The coachman was helpless too, but Eli had already left the carriage.

After Eli got out, he ignored the flow of people and walked straight to the back of the street. Soon, he stopped in front of a shop and looked up. It was the Kazan chamber of commerce.

This was Jun Lin’s Kazan branch.

Occupying the center of the street, the building was three stories high. Whether it was the inside or the outside, it had undergone gorgeous decorations, showing off its luxury.

However, even though it was chaotic outside, no one dared to barge in. This was because there were two advanced Knights standing at the entrance of the Chamber of Commerce.

“Mr. Eli, are you here to get your things?” As soon as eli arrived, someone rushed out immediately. It was a fat man with a smile. His name was Zhong Li, and he was the person in charge.

“Yes, I am!” Eli nodded.

He had asked for a set of materials earlier, and according to the time, it should be ready today.

“Sir, I’ve already prepared it for you. But it’s so chaotic outside. I’ll let the guards send you back.” Zhong Li immediately asked someone to bring him a small box.

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

It was indeed a little chaotic outside, and it was not very convenient for an “ordinary person” like him.

“Chris, go and send Lord Eli off!” Zhong Li pointed at one of the guards and ordered.

Before Chris came, he was warned by Aria to serve Eli properly. Even though Chris had no idea why he still felt that it was better to be obedient.

Just like that, Chris held onto Eli’s suitcase in one hand and followed behind him, escorting him.

Along the way, no one dared to do anything.

It was as if he was taking a stroll, and soon, Eli returned home.

Taking the box, Eli walked straight into the laboratory.

The materials were used to make the incubator liquid. He was going to plant the seeds today.

The formulation of the incubator liquid was actually very simple. To a certain extent, it was just to stimulate the activity of the seeds. Therefore, it only took Eli an hour to formulate six portions.

“It should be about time.” Eli looked at the bucket of incubator liquid in front of him and felt that it should be enough.

Carrying the incubator liquid, he walked out of the laboratory and went straight to the backyard.

In the backyard, he found the flower pot that he had prepared in advance.

Actually, Eli had originally planned to plant it directly in the backyard, but after some thought, he chose a flower pot as it was more convenient to move around. If there was a problem, he could just transplant it again.

He took out the seed.

It was still the dark green seed.

However, there was no soil in the flower pot at the moment, so he started to dig the ground and put the soil into the flower pot. He dug a small hole and buried the seed in it.

He picked up the incubator liquid at the side and poured it in.

Miraculously, the moment the incubator liquid entered the flower pot, it disappeared in the blink of an eye. When the last drop of the incubator liquid was poured in, the soil inside the pot seemed only o be slightly moistened, but there was no change.

“Oh, wow!” Eli was a little surprised. What kind of seed was this? It could actually drink so much. A normal seed would have germinated already.

He turned around, picked up the pot, and walked into the house, preparing to make more incubation liquid.

However, at this moment, a hand appeared on the railing not far away, followed by another hand. Then, with the support of both hands, a person directly jumped in.

This person was dressed in coarse clothes and looked very strong.

“Eh, there’s someone else!” the man also seemed to be surprised. He had only wanted to make some money during the chaos. He picked a random house. He just didn’t expect there to be people in the house.

And if he wasn’t wrong, the guy seemed to be planting something!

A flower pot, a small shovel, and a water basin!

The man was a little shocked. It was so chaotic outside, yet he still had the mood to plant flowers.

“Forget it. Since I’m here, hand over the money. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite.” The man shook his shoulders.

“Robbery is illegal. According to the Empire’s laws, I can even kill you.” Eli hugged the flower pot, a strange expression on his face.

This was the first time someone had barged into his house.

“Hmph, what are you talking about? Hand over the money!” The man completely ignored what eli said.

As he spoke, he walked forward, but he seemed to be stopped by something.

He lowered his head and saw that it was actually a vine!

Vines?

The man was a little confused and turned around. In an instant, countless vines wrapped around him. He didn’t even have time to react before he was pulled into the vines.

“Told you what you were doing is illegal!” Eli shook his head, then turned around to prepare more incubator liquid.

Bryne year 315, Bryne the sixth died.

On the same day, Eli planted a seed and accidentally killed the robber who had broken into his house.
