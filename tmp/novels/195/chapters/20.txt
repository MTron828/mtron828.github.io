Chapter 21: A Professional Dancer

Translator: Lonelytree

Before the two of them walked onto the dance floor, the most dazzling person on the dance floor was Klein, the person who had looked down on Eli earlier.

At this moment, he held the hand of a noble lady and started dancing in the middle of the dance floor.

His dance was elegant and professional. He had a confident smile on his face as he danced with his partner on the dance floor. His movements were dignified, and with the beautiful music, he was extremely elegant.

Outside the dance floor, almost everyone was attracted to him.

“Not bad. The physical fitness of a Knight allows him to have better control of his body. His dance is also very powerful.” Alex said to Alice.

“Indeed, there are only some slight flaws. However, I’m afraid only professional dancers can dance better than him.” Alice nodded in agreement. Her dance was not as good as Klein’s.

“I heard that Klein’s teacher is a top dancer in the Empire. No wonder he can dance so beautifully.” The others added.

The others also praised.

Among his peers, Klein’s noble dance level was close to that of a professional dancer.

“Eh, isn’t that Rias?” At that moment, someone suddenly noticed Rias and Eli.

As the host of this banquet, and with her beauty, there were naturally many people who paid attention to her. However, they were now seeing her enter the dance floor with a civilian.

For a moment, many people looked at the two of them with curious expressions.

Not far away, David did the same.

But when he saw that Eli was actually dancing with Rias, he froze.

“How is that possible?” David was taken aback as if he had not expected that the commoner from earlier would be able to have a connection with the young lady of the Gimori family. He suddenly felt an inexplicable sense of regret.

...

On the other side, on the dance floor, Eli held Rias’s hand with his right hand as the two prepared.

Rias felt the temperature of Eli’s hand, Klein, who was right in front of her, and the gazes from all around. She looked at Eli and wanted to ask him something.

“Are you nervous?” Eli asked.

Rias was speechless. ‘That’s my line!’

Eli was a little taller than Rias, and she looked up at the man before her. He had not a hint of panic.

‘Could he really dance?’

An absurd thought barged into her mind.

Rias was right. It was true that Eli had never learned to dance, nor did he know the noble dance. In the past three minutes, he had really memorized the dance moves and learned them mentally.

Of course, the dance also involved movements, so he had to rely on another spell, absolute control.

Absolute control was an apprentice-level spell. It relied on the connection between one’s spiritual force and the body to allow a Magus to completely control their body for a short period of time, allowing them to do all kinds of actions that they normally could not.

It was usually used during a wizard’s experiments to avoid errors caused by one’s own body, but it was soon to be used for dance. Saleen Metatrin would probably roll in his grave if he found out.

Coupled with Quick memory, Eli could ” learn ” this dance fast.

At this moment, a new round of music started playing again.

The music started. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Eli began to hold onto Rias’s hand as they danced on the dance floor. At first, it was very slow, as if Rias had yet to get used to it, but with Eli’s guidance, their movements began to become elegant after a few seconds.

The power of the spells was terrifying.

Eli could rely on witchcraft to perform the perfect version of the dance in his mind.

‘He can actually dance?!’

At this moment, even Rias, who was being held by Eli, was incomparably shocked. She had never thought that Eli would actually be such a skilled and elegant dancer. It was as if he had danced thousands of times, completely guiding the movements of her four limbs.

More and more people looked over as they watched the two of them dance like butterflies on the dance floor, or more precisely, Eli, who was guiding Rias to dance.

What a powerful dance.

He’s so good!

Many people around them were dancing again, but as they danced, they were attracted by the two, and they stopped to admire them.

More and more people turned their eyes to the two and began to appreciate their beautiful movements.

However, some of them had an inexplicable feeling. Why did it feel like the man was copying their moves?

However, ignoring these details, everyone had to admit that Eli’s performance was absolutely wonderful, much better than Klein’s performance in the center of the stage.

“Very powerful. There are some movements that I can’t do.” In the crowd, Klein fell into deep thought as he watched the movements.

He was an advanced Knight, so the control of his body should already be very good, but there were many of Eli’s movements that he could not do. It felt like Eli had complete control of his body.

However, that was impossible. That was something that only a Grand Knight could do. As for Eli, anyone who had been through Knight training could tell that he was definitely an ordinary person.

If Klein wanted, his one punch could have killed Eli.

“Looks like he’s gifted.” Alex sighed. This kind of control over the body was something every Knight dreamed of, but it was actually mastered by Eli.

It was a pity that Eli was a commoner, and he was also very old, so it was almost impossible for him to become a knight.

“Amazing!” Compared to Alex, Alice’s thought was much simpler.

She just felt that Eli’s movements were so beautiful, and his dance was so smooth, with an indescribable beauty.

Klein was also dumbfounded.

He was very proud and liked to show off in front of others, so he willfully danced on the dance floor. He felt the gazes from all around him, which made him even happier.

However, as he danced, he realized from the corner of his eye that the others seemed to be gradually losing attention to him.

“What’s wrong? What happened?” Klein was a little confused. He stopped and saw Eli and Rias dancing not far away. Everyone’s eyes were on them.

Klein didn’t understand at first, but after a few seconds, he was stunned.

This dance was too good.

He was better than him.

Eli and Rias were like two butterflies on the dance floor, light and graceful. He had been learning dance for seven to eight years, and his level was not low, but he was inferior to Eli.

Especially Eli’s control over his body. He was a Knight, but he was not even as good as an ordinary person.

“This doesn’t make sense!” Klein’s mouth twitched.

It was too ridiculous.

He even had a preposterous feeling that even the teachers of the Empire’s top dancers might not dance as well as Eli, who was dancing in front of him.

In the end, Klein only managed to squeeze out this sentence.

“So elegant!”
