In the grassi land.

Below Hill.

The warm sunlight penetrated the layers of trees and sprinkled on the face of the sleeping elf girl on the grass, making her look even whiter!

Eli was sitting not far away, and Dylan was beside him. In the distance, Hydra was sleeping on the grass, and Hill had thousands of branches hanging down.

“Hill, do you know about the elves? ” Eli raised his head and asked Hill.

“Hill doesn’t know!” Hill shook her branches in confusion.

“Alright then.” Eli nodded. After all, Hill had always been by his side, so he should naturally know if there were any changes.

“Elves?” Dylan, on the other hand, stuck his head out curiously.

“Why? Do you know what’s happening?” Eli turned to look at Dylan. This guy did have a lot of things stored in his head.

“I’m not sure, but I have some guesses.” Dylan looked up.

“Oh?” Eli’s eyes lit up.

” Sir, have you heard of the Mother Tree of Life? ” Dylan asked.

” Mother Tree of Life? Never heard of it. ” Eli shook his head. He didn’t know much about this.

“Alright then.” Dylan slowly stood up and walked to the elf. He looked at Eli and said, “Sir, during the Mage Era, the highest authority in the Mage World was an organization called the Mage Council. This organization included almost all the big shots in the Mage World. These people included Mages, foreign races, and other powerful creatures that belonged to the Warlock Union.

“And the Mother Tree is one of them. It’s a powerful eight-circle creature.”

Eli’s eyes turned cold as he looked at Hill, then at Dylan. “Are you saying that Hill is related to the Mother Tree? ”

“Yes!” Dylan nodded and continued. “The Mother Tree is a powerful plant-type creature. And she has another identity! ”

Then, he looked at the elf on the ground and said seriously,” That is, she is also the protector of one of the most powerful races under the Mage Alliance, the Great Elves. She is the faith of all elves! ”

At this point, Eli naturally understood.

Eli looked at Hill again.

“You are the Mother Tree? No, you should be a descendant of the Mother Tree!”

“Hill doesn’t know. I just want to be by Father’s side!” Hill’s tender voice sounded uneasy and afraid as if she was worried that Eli would chase her away.

“Don’t worry. I won’t let anyone take you away.” Eli comforted.

What a joke. She was such a good daughter. Eli would be angry with anyone who wanted to take her away.

But today, he finally figured out Hill’s background.

The seed he had found in the Bryne Empire was probably the seed or child of the Mother Life Tree!

“My lord, the elf is awake!” At this moment, Dylan suddenly said.

Eli looked over. The elf let out a low groan and tried to open her eyes.

—————–

Erwin shook her head. She felt a sharp pain in her brain and struggled to open her eyes.

She vaguely remembered that she seemed to be in a fog and then fell unconscious.

Yes, it was a human!

Ivan suddenly shivered. She remembered what had happened before. In the fog, she prayed to the Mother Tree, but when the fog dispersed, she saw a human and he fell unconscious.

Therefore, she might still be in a dangerous state.

Realizing this, Erwin suddenly didn’t dare to move. She could only slowly open her eyes, wanting to explore what was around her!

“Just get up! “Suddenly, a voice entered her mind and communicated with her.

Erwin gritted her teeth and realized that she had been discovered.

She opened her eyes and slowly got up. However, when she stood up and saw the scene in front of her, she was stunned!

There was a man and a dog standing on the huge lawn and a huge snake lying in the distance. Each of their auras was above hers, but these were not her concern. She stared blankly at the hundred-meter-tall tree in front of her.

The huge branches stood on the ground, and countless branches fell down like a waterfall. Every leaf on them was as green as jade, emitting a majestic aura of life. There were even specks of green light around them.

“Lord Mother Life!”

Erwin thought of this term immediately. It was a mysterious connection between bloodlines!

Lord Priest, she found it!

Tears rolled down from Erwin’s eyes. When she wanted to look for the green leaves to confirm it, she found that the green leaves on her chest had long disappeared, and even her clothes were slightly messy.

She was a little stunned!

“Fair lady, are you looking for this? I’m sorry, the light that this thing emitted at that time was a little eye-catching.”

Erwin turned around and saw the leaf given by the priest in the human’s hand. It was emitting an unprecedentedly intense light, and the direction of the light was the tree beside him!

There was good news and bad news.

The bad news was that she had been captured by a human. The good news was that she had also found the Mother Tree, and she was right beside her.

” Evil Wizard, the Moon Elves will never yield. With the Mother Tree here, I advise you not to do anything bad! ” Erwin looked at the nearby Eli and warned him. Her body moved closer to the Mother Tree.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
