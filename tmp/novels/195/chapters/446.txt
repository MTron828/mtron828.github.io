447 The Fourth Mark of Faith Condenses

Thank you readers!

Boom!

The black light suddenly dissipated!

Holy Sword stared blankly at the distant sky. It was not just him, and the others were also staring blankly at the sky.

In the blue sky, the body of the Balor seemed to be fixed in the previous moment, but at this time, the upper half of his body had disappeared, revealing the dark red body tissue. However, there were still shadows on it, and it was still relentlessly devouring the flesh of the Balor!

Losing its head and vital body parts, it was obvious that the Balor was dead.

But this was a celestial at the peak of the Radiant Sun Stage, and it died just like that?

“Who is this? This is too exaggerated!”

“Does anyone know? Is this the Bloodline Tower’s Eli?”

” I’ve been to the Bloodline Tower. This should be Eli, but this is too exaggerated. I saw the Flame Demon beating up the Radiant Sun Warlock of our family, but he was slapped to death by Eli! ”

The tens of thousands of Warlocks present also raised their heads and discussed animatedly. It was obvious that not everyone knew who Eli was, but they quickly confirmed his identity as they discussed it.

The figure in the sky was none other than the ruler of the Bloodline Tower, the most powerful force in the north of the Western Region, Eli!

It was a Balor at the peak of the Radiant Sun Stage, but it did not even manage to survive a single move.

At this moment, it wasn’t just the human Warlocks who were shocked. At this moment, all the demons had their mouths wide open and were somewhat confused!

That was a fourth circle Balor, a top-notch figure in the Abyss. Was it gone just like that?

Was this a joke?

The other Balor looked at each other. After more than ten seconds, the first Balor stood up, looked at Eli in the sky, and asked, “Human, who are you?”

The Balor asked Eli. Everyone was surprised to find that the Balor could understand human language. The battle had lasted for a long time, but not a single demon spoke to them.

The reason for this was self-evident. It was all because Eli’s strength had won the attention of the demons!

Even they had to admit that the human in front of them was unexpectedly powerful!

” Demons who are about to die don’t need to know my name! ” Eli shook his head and refused.

Upon hearing this, the Balor was also stunned, but in the next second, endless anger began to rise in its eyes, and its body was also burning with angry flames. As the most irritable and irritable race in the Abyss, the Balor was famous for its bad temper.

However, he was still a demon at the level of a Radiant Sun. Although he was angry, he knew that he was definitely not a match for Eli alone. Therefore, he immediately turned to look at the other celestial Balors and said fiercely, “Let’s attack together and kill this shameless human! ”

The Flame Demons nodded, their eyes blazing!

On the other side, everyone could only see the ground of the Flame Demons instantly crack open and turn into crimson lava. The surrounding temperature instantly rose by several hundred degrees, and the air even began to distort.

A few Flame Demons flew into the sky, eight in a row, looking at Eli.

In the next second.

All the demons raised their heads, their eyes filled with excitement.

That human was definitely no match for them.

On the other side.

Eli’s golden light also instantly bloomed, turning into a ray of light that flew toward the demons as if it was the first ray of light that created the world!

The golden light shone for generations.

The golden light and the eight crimson figures suddenly collided. Everyone first saw a resplendent light explode from the collision. Black spatial cracks appeared in the surrounding air, and they could even see the resplendent space-time warp within them. Then, they heard a buzzing sound that pierced through their souls. At this moment, countless people covered their ears at the same time, but even so, there were still people who had blood flowing out of their ears!

The light lasted for a few minutes. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When the light dissipated, everyone looked up and saw that Ely was still standing in space, emitting a dazzling light.

Opposite him were eight Balors who looked like gods of war. However, at this time, their bodies were still cracked, as if they would collapse and be destroyed in the next moment. Then, in the next second, the auras of several figures suddenly disappeared, and their bodies fell to the opposite side.

The eight demons at the peak of the Radiant Sun Realm, who could decide the battlefield by themselves, were all killed just like that.

The people on the ground watched in a daze.

Obviously, the war had ended, but not in the way they thought it would!

“Is this Eli?” A few second-class forces’ family heads looked at Eli in a daze and were silent.

This was a fucking second-class force?

They finally understood why Eli had to be excluded from the calculations of this force, and they also understood what kind of opponent the Eight-Armed Naga had faced back then!

Luo Ye took a deep breath and pursed his dry lips. “The student has surpassed the master. Herman’s disciple have far surpassed him. It seems that our era has passed. ”

At the peak of the mountain.

Nikola was also deeply shocked and sighed, “The lord has become stronger again. Compared to thirty years ago, he has ascended by leaps and bounds again! ”

The celestials were shocked, but the warlocks were even more shocked. At least Eli, who was far away, could feel an astonishing amount of faith power at this moment. Even the fourth faith imprint was beginning to condense.

” He’s too strong. Is this Eli? ”

“Fortunately, Sir came to support us. Otherwise, I’m afraid none of us will be able to leave today!”

“Ridiculously strong!”

The Warlocks muttered to themselves, but suddenly, another Warlock asked loudly,” Wait, that golden light just now seems to be Eli’s clone. Could it be that this Eli is just a clone? ”

Hearing his words, the Warlocks within a few hundred meters looked over, their mouths agape.

Clone?

Was this just a f * cking clone?

Are you kidding me?

...

At this moment, the Holy Tower Family Head’s Holy Sword and the other two Family Heads were also flying toward Eli.

“Thank you for your help, sir!” The three of them thanked him respectfully at the same time.

“It’s fine!” Eli waved his hand and said, ” Remember to send me the corpses of those fourth-circle demons. I also want a share of the Saka family’s resources. This clone of mine has already erupted with all its power. It’s about to collapse … Scattered!”

Eli’s figure gradually began to change and then suddenly shattered into countless light spots!

The three people present looked at each other.

“It really is a clone!” The corners of Holy Sword’s mouth twitched. The other two clan heads were also dumbfounded at this moment!

” Sir Eli is stronger than we imagined! ” After more than ten seconds, the two family heads sighed deeply.

However, they only sighed for a few seconds because they still had other missions to do.

Holy Sword looked at the two of them and smiled. “Milord has solved our biggest problem. The remaining demons are up to us.

“Also, find the rift and destroy it!”
