60 Perfume

Time always flew by, and by the time Eli came out of the casino, it was already night.

“This is a really good place.”

Eli came out of the casino and stretched.

Behind him was a magnificent three-story building with a long red carpet in front of it. There were only a few people who were poor. This was the biggest casino in Duoling.

Duoling’s business was indeed better than Bryne’s. Elin had seen many new ways of gambling.

Eli had also collected more than thirty gold tarls.

However, Eli didn’t cheat. He was just playing normally, and this amount wasn’t considered too big here, so no one would cause him trouble.

“Sir, you’ve come out.” The coachman was waiting beside the carriage in boredom. When he saw Eli, he immediately came over.

A golden Tarl was thrown over, and it streaked across the sky.

The coachman’s eyes were wide open. He caught the gold coin with the most agile movement in his life. Feeling the dense touch of the golden tars, the coachman felt like he was about to fly.

“Sir, this is?” However, he still asked.

“Let’s go.” Eli walked up the carriage with a smile.

“You are the most generous gentleman I have ever met. as long as you are in Duoling, I will always be at your service. ” The coachman was completely won over by Eli. This was the biggest reward he had ever received in his life.

He quickly got into the carriage and asked, “Sir, where are we going now?”

Now, even if eli asked him to go to the palace, he would still dare to go with him.

“Back to the hotel.” A voice came from the carriage.

“Alright, sit tight!” The coachman was no longer in a tired state. He sat up straight and drove the carriage.

The horse let out a low neigh and then carried the two away.

...

The main purpose of the day was to relax, other than meeting Aria, which was a small accident.

However, Eli didn’t mind the chance encounter. After all, his investment wasn’t high, but if he succeeded, the benefits would be huge. It was so huge that not only could Eli solve his economic problems completely, but he could also solve the medicinal materials and Roland’s problems.

He had even used a portion of his spiritual power to guide the conversation, which allowed the two to carry on smoothly.

“Tomorrow, I’ll find a way to solve the perfume problem.”

After thinking about what he had to do tomorrow, Eli fell asleep.

...

The next day, before he left, he received a message.

The first round of negotiations had failed.

It seemed like Queen Cynthia felt that there was no point in forming an alliance, so she rejected the request of the Bryne Empire during the first round of negotiations.

This caused the entire convoy to feel a little defeated.

However, even though the start was not smooth, Marquis Alina’s side did not give up. The second round of negotiations would take place in three days, and there might be new developments then.

Of course, the diplomatic team’s defeat did not affect Eli much.

On this day, Eli was still in the same carriage as yesterday, but he didn’t go anywhere else. Instead, he had the coachman take him to another place.

“Sir, this is the local perfume workshop. Are you sure you want to come here? ” the coachman brought eli to a street along the river.

It was built along a river in the city, but the nearby area was dyed in various colors. Houses stood on the streets, emitting various smells.

“Yes, I am.” Eli got off his horse, and an invisible wind immediately dispelled the smell near his nose.

As Duoling’s largest perfume production base, it was best to wear a mask or something if you were not working here all year round. Otherwise, the smell would make you uncomfortable.

And he was there to make perfume.

He first had to rent a place to conduct his experiment.

“Sir, this place belongs to private families. If you want to rent it, it may be difficult. ” Eli had already told the coachman his purpose when he came.

“Is that so?” Eli just shot him a glance.

...

Half an hour later, in front of a building.

“Sir, don’t worry. This place will be yours for the next three days. I’ll leave with my family now. You can also order the workers here as you wish.”

In front of a small perfume workshop, a middle-aged man was bending over and smiling. Behind him was a woman in linen clothes, holding a seven or eight-year-old girl in her arms.

She was still young and didn’t seem to understand why her father had pulled them away with their luggage after the handsome brother in front of her had taken out thirty gold tarls.

“Well, Sir, we’ll take our leave first. You can do whatever you want with the rest.” With that said, the man quickly pulled his family away as if afraid that Eli would go back on his word.

Behind them, the coachman’s mouth twitched as he looked at the few of them who were running for their lives.

What just happened?

...

“Help me buy some things now.” as he watched the original owner of the perfume workshop leave, eli turned to the coachman behind him.

“Yes, sir.” the coachman naturally wouldn’t refuse.

Following that, eli handed the coachman a list and sufficient money to make the purchase for him. Then, he turned around and entered the room.

Although it was just a small workshop, it already had the ability to produce perfume. Moreover, this was the capital of perfume. Even if it were just a small workshop, the perfume produced here would not be too bad.

Sure enough, the worker in the workshop handed a newly made perfume to Eli. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Eli smelled the fragrance of the perfume and nodded. With such a quality as the base, it should be enough to match his magic potion.

That’s right, Eli had no intention of making perfume from the start. After all, even though he had a strong learning ability, how could he possibly make a top-class perfume in three days?

That was unreasonable and impossible.

Eli’s plan was to mix a small amount of charm potion with the basis of the existing perfume and then get a smell that had a special attraction but also an original fragrance.

Of course, this wasn’t easy. The difficulty lay in the ratio of the potion and perfume, but it was much easier than making perfume from scratch.

Three days should be enough.

Half an hour later, the coachman delivered the materials. This surprised Eli a little, as he didn’t expect the coachman to be so fast.

“I’ll go back tonight. You can come here then. You can go somewhere else now. ” Eli said to the coachman as he took the materials.

“Sir, you’ve paid. I’ll just wait here.” The coachman said with a smile.

“Alright,” he said.

Eli didn’t refuse and directly entered the workshop with the materials.

Two days later, in the studio, Eli looked at the freshly prepared perfume on the table and smiled in satisfaction.

The perfume was a success.
