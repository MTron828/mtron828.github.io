Chapter 15: Roads

Translator: Lonelytree

The next day, Eli went to the library as usual and ran into Roland again in the changing room.

“Eli, it’s just as I thought. I knew you’d pass the test. I told you I’m good at judging people.” Roland said with a smile. Thanks to his father’s training since childhood, he was very good at talking.

“Thank you,” he said. Eli glanced at Roland and found a bite mark on his neck.

“Uh, this is a mark left behind by a beautiful lady.” Seeing Eli’s gaze, Roland said proudly.

“Fine, fine, fine. Good for you.” Eli pouted. This world’s education on sex was much earlier than in his previous life. There were even people the same age as Eli who already had a few children.

“Haha. If you would like to go with me, I believe you will be more popular than me!” Roland joked. Then, as if he had thought of something, he moved closer to Eli and said, “I heard that you’d been accepted as a student by scholar Clement. ”

“Yes.”

There was nothing to hide, so Eli said it directly.

“It’s actually true,” Roland exclaimed in surprise. He had only heard about it by chance this morning. He had thought it was a lie, but it turned out to be true.

“Oh, it seems like you’re going to welcome a new beautiful life in the future.” Roland sighed. Becoming Clement’s student was enough to change one’s life.

“I hope so. It’s almost time to work.” Eli nodded, then reminded him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Alright,” he said. Roland had also changed his clothes and walked outside with Eli.

When they were about to enter the museum, Roland suddenly asked, ” Oh right, there seem to be a lot more beautiful ladies on Liuying Street. Do you want to go tonight? ”

Eli almost stumbled. He glanced at Roland and replied, ” What do you think?”

“That’s a pity. I heard that they have a lot of new tricks.”

“Oh, call me tonight.”

The new tricks didn’t matter. The main thing was that he wanted to experience a night there.

...

At noon, Eli pushed a book into the bookshelf and ended his day’s work.

An official librarian only had to work for half a day, and they were free to arrange the rest of the day. This was one of the reasons why there were so many librarians.

But before he could leave, he saw someone come over to remind him that scholar Clement was looking for him.

Puzzled, Eli came to the second floor of the library. In one of the rooms, he saw scholar Clement organizing documents.

“Oh, Eli, how is it? Have you settled everything? ” Scholar Clement asked in a gentle tone.

“teacher, I’m fine now. I have to thank you for your help.” Clement was naturally referring to things like renting a house and buying clothes.

“That’s good.” Clement nodded, then gestured for Eli to sit on the stool opposite him.

Eli sat down, and Clement said, “Since you’ve settled down, there’s something we have to talk about. It’s your future.”

“My future?” Eli had some questions.

“Yes,” Clement nodded and said, ” since you’ve become my student, I have to be responsible for you. You need to set your own research direction. A person’s time is limited. Look at the vast library. You can’t possibly master everything, right? ”

‘I’m sorry, but it’s really possible,’ he said in his heart.

Looking at Eli, Clement nodded and continued, “so, you have to choose a few main research areas and study them in-depth. However, there’s no rush for this. You can take your time, but I hope you can become a learner within four years.

“Yes, teacher, I understand.” Eli nodded.

A learner was a person with vast knowledge and a deep understanding of one or two aspects of knowledge. It was not difficult for him since memory and comprehension were things that Wizards were good at.

“It’s good that you’re confident. What do you think? You can have a chat with me, and maybe I can give you some advice.” The more Clement looked at Eli, the more satisfied he was. He leaned back in his chair.

“Uh,” What was going on in Eli’s mind? He was planning to stay here for now, but since he was asked, he thought for a moment and replied, ” history and heraldry. I’m more interested in those.”

History and heraldry had more things to memorize, so those were easiest for Eli.

“it’s pretty good. It’s just that there’s too much content in this area, and there’s a lot of memory work. It’s very complicated, so you have to be prepared.” Scholar Clement said kindly.

“I will.”

“That’s it, then. You can continue working in the library and accumulate experience as you work. After all, you haven’t studied for long.” Clement said after thinking for a while.

“Alright, Thank you, teacher,” Eli said respectfully.

“Good luck. It’s year 306 of the Byrne calendar. I hope I can see you become a real scholar before year 310.”

...

After leaving Clement’s place, he didn’t go home. Instead, he went straight to the library.

He found a few books and read them.

Indeed, although his goal was to stay in the library, he had to have some real skills. Otherwise, it would be too embarrassing if he was kicked out.

“So, for the rest of the time, I’ll meditate and learn about wizardry, digest the things in the notes, and also read some history and heraldry.” He easily set the next schedule, and at the same time, he decided to record everything that would happen in the future by writing a diary.

After all, he would live for a long time. Although he didn’t know what would happen in the future, he hoped that he could record everything.

He put down his book, found a Quill, took out a piece of paper, and began to write down what had happened to him recently.

“Year 306 of the Byrne calendar. Sudden death and transmigration.”

Eli wrote his diary in Chinese to avoid being recognized by others.

“The beginning is not bad, at least much better than most of the main characters in other webnovels. Other than being a little poor, everything else is good.

“I did not expect this world to be an extraordinary world. There is a power known as Knights, and I have also obtained a mysterious wizard’s inheritance. However, that old man Saleen Metatrin is really too much. Can’t he explain everything clearly in his book?”

Here, Eli cursed Saleen Metatrin.

“Can’t you tell me some information about mages? I can’t even figure out what’s going on in this world. All I can tell is that there are obviously Knights here. I’m really speechless.”

This was also something that had been bothering Eli for a long time. Why would a Knight’s Empire have records of a wizard’s meditation technique in the library? He had also gone to the place where the host had taken out the book earlier to take a look, but there was nothing else there. Furthermore, he had never heard of a person named Saleen Metatrin.

The one closest to it was the royal family called the Merlin family.

There was one more thing that made Eli curious, and that was what exactly was the item that Saleen Metatrin was talking about on the title page of the notebook.

“But forget it. It doesn’t matter. There’s no point in thinking about this. We’ll just take one step at a time.” Eli wrote it down simply and sighed.

He put down his pen and decided to set a goal for himself.

“I’ll think about it after I become a level 2 acolyte.”
