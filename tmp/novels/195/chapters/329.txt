330 Eli’s Plan

The Tiger whale leader tried its best to resist the suction force, but it was still inevitably getting closer and closer to the vortex.

As he got closer, he could also feel the water element within it. It was no longer the usual gentle feeling. He could only feel the biting cold of the wind element.

The water elements were like knives.

As if he was in a meat grinder, wounds appeared around his body one after another, and blood flowed uncontrollably before being sucked into the vortex.

He was extremely shocked. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If he, who was at the limit of the third circle, was like this, then what about the other clansmen?

Out of the corner of his eye, he looked into the distance. The Whirlpool at the bottom of the sea was spinning like a tornado at the bottom of the sea, and his people were flying into it one by one.

Most of the time, the moment they entered, they would be torn into countless pieces of flesh and blood. Third-circle whales could hold on for a while longer, but they would soon meet the same end.

In just a few minutes, there were only a few of his clansmen left.

And these few were also almost unable to hold on.

“how can there be such a terrifying underwater Whirlpool near the coast?!” His small eyes were filled with confusion and despair, and he felt as if his heart was being cut by a knife.

He had led his clansmen across many dangers to arrive here. He had originally thought that this was a paradise, but who would have thought that this was actually hell?

“I regret it!”

Endless regret and remorse twisted around his heart. He only felt that the vortex’s suction force was getting stronger and stronger, and he was already almost unable to hold on.

As for his clansmen, every single one of them had been turned into meat paste.

After holding on for a few more minutes, he felt like he couldn’t hold on any longer.

As he relaxed his mind, his body moved closer to the Whirlpool with the seawater.

He had already decided that he was going to die.

All of a sudden, he sensed that a large amount of seawater suddenly gathered in the sea. A huge hand made of seawater that was dozens of meters long suddenly appeared and grabbed at him.

Before he could react, he had already been caught. Like a small fish that had been caught, he left the Whirlpool and flew towards the surface of the sea.

A few seconds later, the giant hand had already brought him out of the sea.

He was at a loss.

Under his body was a huge Whirlpool at the bottom of the sea. At this time, it was still emitting a huge and terrifying suction force, sweeping all the living creatures around it. He had just escaped from it.

Suddenly, he saw that there seemed to be a human looking at him from above the vortex.

“Celestial mage?”

The moment he saw this human, he felt as if he had fallen into the abyss of the sea.

It was a celestial-level human, and he seemed to be a mage.

For a moment, it was as if he had returned to the time when he was enslaved by the mages. Although he was not born at that time, some fears were deeply implanted in his blood.

He also suddenly understood the origin of the vortex. It was not a natural force but a celestial spell!

The human was also flying toward him.

“Sir, please spare me!”

In an instant, he subconsciously begged for mercy.

“Eh? What’s going on? ” hearing the message from his soul, the corners of Eli’s brows rose, and he asked the question he was most concerned about.

“Tell me, what happened in the deep sea?” Eli asked.

The devil killer whale was currently being held in mid-air by the gigantic elemental hand. He watched as Eli flew over. His body trembled uncontrollably, and only after a few seconds did he say, “If you let me go, I’ll tell you.”

“Of course.” Eli nodded and then said solemnly, “I swear on my celestial body that if I don’t let you go, my life will be reduced by a thousand years!”

The devil killer whale was also stunned. So f * cking straightforward!

It seemed that this celestial really did not have the intention to kill him. After all, in the current world, there couldn’t be that many celestial.

Moreover, swearing on one’s celestial body was no laughing matter. If one didn’t abide by the oath, one’s mental power would degenerate from the backlash, and in serious cases, one’s mental power would directly collapse and die.

“Speak!” Eli said.

“Yes, my Lord.” The devil killer whale saw the hope of survival, and its mood also rose a little. He said, “Since Milord is asking me about what happened in the deep sea, that means that Milord should have sensed the elemental insurrection from ten years ago.

“The reason is very simple. In the deep sea, the sixth circle master left behind from the mage era had died.”

“I see!” Realization dawned on Eli.

It seemed normal if it was caused by the death of an important creature.

“Then what’s the purpose of your visit?” Eli asked again.

“With the death of that Lord, the originally chaotic deep sea became even more chaotic. Various races once again fought for the position of the ruler of the sea.

“It’s almost impossible for weak races like us to survive. That’s why we’re here in the coastal waters!” In order to survive, the devil killer whale told Eli everything he knew.

“I see, I understand.” Eli nodded and then fell into deep thought.

If what the devil killer whale said was true, then although the devil killer whale clan was the first to come here, they would definitely not be the last. In the future, more and more clans would leave the deep sea, and a part of them would definitely come here.

It was as if Eli could already see endless trouble.

“My Lord, can you let me go now?” At this time, the devil killer whale, not far away, suddenly spoke.

“Of course!” Eli nodded, and then the seawater suddenly dispersed.

The devil killer whale fell straight to the surface of the water, and below it was the center of the Whirlpool.

“You lied to me!”

...

As it fell, the devil killer whale shouted angrily at Eli.

He couldn’t understand why Eli would do that.

Eli had taken an oath.

In just a few seconds, the devil killer whale fell into the vortex and was turned into minced meat.

In the sky, Eli could feel that his life force had been reduced by a thousand years. His oath had come true.

“What a naive child!”

Eli shook his head and quickly left.

He had to go back and think about how to deal with future troubles.

After he left, the Whirlpool at the bottom of the sea slowly disappeared, and the surface of the sea returned to calm.

..

Soon, Eli returned to the Tower.

...

In the mage Tower, Eli called out to Aisha again.

Soon, Aisha arrived.

“Grandmaster, our people have already sensed the disappearance of those sea clan creatures. Is it Grandmaster’s doing?” Aisha asked.

“Yes.” Eli nodded and said, ” but I’m not here to talk to you about this today. It’s about the endless sea. We’re going to have big trouble soon.”

“Big trouble?”

Aisha was a little confused.

“Yes,” Eli nodded.

Then, Eli told Aisha what happened in the deep sea.

After listening, her face turned serious. She understood the seriousness of the matter.

“Increase the investment in the Marine Department. You may need some warlocks with marine bloodlines.” Eli said.

“The bloodline of marine creatures? ” Aisha frowned. This was a big problem. However, just as she was hesitating, Eli handed her a ring.

She was a little puzzled.

“This is the devil killer whale’s bloodline. It should be enough for a hundred warlocks,” Eli said calmly.

Hiss!

Aisha lowered her head to look at the ring, and her eyes lit up. With the bloodline, it would be much easier to cultivate.

“Oh, right, there’s one more thing!” Eli suddenly said.

“Oh?” Aisha raised her head.

“I remember there should be a small island near the ocean, not far from the West Coast,” Eli asked.

“Yes, it’s an uninhabited island without any special resources.” Aisha nodded.

“Develop that place. I’m planning to live there, ” Eli said.

He had already thought about it.

In the time he would be on the West Coast, he would have to conduct experiments frequently, so he naturally needed an empty and spacious place.

The endless sea was a good place.

Moreover, he was not far from the shore, so his safety was guaranteed. If a new intelligent race came, he could discover it immediately and test out some new spells.

Moreover, the Hydra also needed a large amount of flesh to advance.

It was killing two birds with one stone.

“Yes!”

Aisha nodded.
