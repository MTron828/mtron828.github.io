101 The Loot

The log was basically coming to an end.

On the other hand, Eli was a little numb!

The main thing was that he clearly knew every word in this diary, but he didn’t know how to put them together. He knew what a secret realm was, but what was the great catastrophe?

What about the new calendar? Was there an old calendar?

‘Well. At least I know what Saleen Metatrin was looking for somewhat.” Eli was helpless, but at least he knew what Saleen metatrin’s goal was.

A celestial realm with four circles.

Celestials were also known as Lords of the world. Even in the mage’s world, they were powerful. Such a secret plane was indeed enough for Saleen metatrin to pursue.

Then, he read the rest of the log.

It recorded how he came to this land, including the fact that he took in a student as a tool and the story of how he built the Empire to search for ruins but couldn’t find them until his death.

“I’m sure they’re in the area around Bryne. Maybe I’m wrong. It seems to be among the surrounding countries, so at least that’s a start.”

In the end, Saleen metatrin gave him an area which had Bryne as the center and more than a dozen countries surrounding it.

If Saleen metatrin had been able to confirm it from the start, he might have found it. Eli shook his head. It was obvious that since Saleen metatrin was still buried in Bryne, he had not found the things he was looking for.

After reading the log, Eli continued to look at other things.

Other than some experimental data and some knowledge, in the end, Eli actually found something interesting.

Saleen’s last words.

“Friend, I’m sorry. If you see this letter, I’ve failed.

“It was really sad.

“I became an apprentice when I was 22 years old and an official mage when I was 40 years old. However, when I advanced, I realized that this was a life of despair. It was too desperate. As a mage’s power increased, their life force would be consumed at a faster rate. This is the mage’s curse!

“Since you’re reading this, you must have obtained the legacy I left in the Empire, right? Haha, I forgot to tell you that the book won’t kill anyone. Only those who don’t have the talent to become a mage will die from the impact of the power.

“I’ve left everything that I had. These are all my precious treasures, and I hope you can treat them well.

“Mages are very united. Poor child, I’m sorry. If possible, you’d better walk the path of a pure Warlock.

“Mages are no longer suitable for this world.”

Saleen metatrin.

Even between the lines, Saleen’s sorrow could be felt. Eli sighed.

It seemed that there was really a problem with this world.

As a mage’s strength increased, its life force would also be consumed at a faster rate.

The reason why Saleen had advised Eli to walk the path of a Warlock was probably for the longer lifespan of a Warlock.

“What really happened?” Eli shook his head. This world had definitely experienced something, and it was very likely a great calamity.

Perhaps there would be clues in the secret celestial realm.

Was he really going to give up on the path of a mage?

Elie blinked. He was already a level 3 acolyte, and it was indeed time for him to consider advancing to a Mage. Should he walk the path of a bloodline Warlock or a Mage?

“I’m a Mage!” In the end, Eli said calmly.

It was just the consumption of life force. If it was someone else, they might care, but would Eli care? He was immortal, so he didn’t lack life force.

There was no doubt that mages were stronger than warlocks, so why did he choose a weak profession? He had to be stronger to better protect himself.

And there was one more important point.

Although he was a slacker, he was also very determined in his pursuit of knowledge.

Of course, these were only Eli’s thoughts. He would have to wait slowly for the rest.

Eli’s consciousness slowly withdrew from the crystal ball.

At this moment, Anna and the Knight were huddling to the side as though they did not dare to disturb Eli.

Seeing that Eli had woken up, Anna heaved a long sigh of relief. She walked over and asked, “Teacher, is this what you’re looking for?”

“Yes,” Eli nodded and then looked at the few boxes on the ground.

“Teacher, I’ll get someone to send you home,” Anna said again.

“Alright,” he said. He replied and then looked at the hole behind him. “Seal this place for now. I might go in to take a look in the future.”

“Alright!”

…

Saleen’s diary had a huge impact on Eli. However, he could not be bothered with it for now and returned home.

Not long after he returned, three boxes were sent back.

Looking at the three boxes, Eli didn’t open them. Instead, after placing them down, he went straight to bed. He needed to rest.

The next day.

Eli woke up.

He called for the Knight, who was already his slave, to open the boxes, and the items in the three boxes were instantly displayed in front of him.

The first two boxes were filled with all sorts of books, as well as all sorts of notes that Saleen had written in the past, as well as experiment logs. The third box contained a wizard robe, a magic staff, and a ring.

Soon, Eli also knew the function of the three items.

The wizard’s robe was a top-notch zero-circle sorcery tool. Whether it was physical defense or Magic Defense, it was top-notch. After charging, it could release a shield that could resist the first-circle spell every day.

Eli really liked this wizard robe. At his current stage, it was a life-saving artifact!

The staff was also a zero-circle magic tool, much stronger than Eli’s. It could directly unleash 150% of a zero-circle spell’s power and was a small treasure for mages at the apprentice stage.

“However, Saleen doesn’t seem to be very generous!” Eli pouted. He was already a first-circle wizard, but these were all zero-circle items. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The last item was indeed a one-circle item called the Thunder Python Ring.

The ring allowed the wearer to control two lightning pythons to bombard their enemies. The two pythons are combined to become stronger. The only pity was that it could only be used by a first-circle mage. Eli could only take a look now.

“But it’s already very good.” Eli looked at these and revealed a satisfied smile.

The wizard weapons were secondary. The main things were the two boxes of books and notes that Saleen had left behind. Those were the truly precious things. With those, Eli would be able to make up for the knowledge he had lost.

There were also some first-circle spell models among them.

As long as he had enough mental power, he would be able to break through and become a real mage.

As for what he would do after that, that would be a matter for later.

There was also the celestial ruin. That was also another matter, so there was no rush.
