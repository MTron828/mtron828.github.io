362 The Despised Alida

In the tallest building in the center of Bloodline City.

In a conference room.

The dim yellow light illuminated the faces of more than a dozen people. Everyone’s faces were filled with unhappiness and dejection. No one made any movements or made any sound except for the occasional cough or two.

“What’s wrong? Are you all afraid?”

At this moment, a voice was heard, and everyone looked over.

An old man at the head of the table spoke.

His hair and beard were all white, and his face looked very old. His pupils were a rare green color, and he wore a silver band on his head. He was wearing a wide Warlock robe. It was him who had spoken just now.

” Sir Clint, don’t joke around. We are surrounded by the Bloodline Towers. They will attack us soon. ” A Warlock sighed.

” Indeed. The Manticore Family is too powerful. How can we be their match? ” Another Warlock said dejectedly.

“Why don’t we just give them the Grassi Land?”

Bang!

The table was suddenly slammed. Glen looked at everyone, and the aura of the celestial suddenly erupted. Everyone’s breathing stopped.

He looked around and said, ” The Amina Family has given up on us, but if we give up too, then everything will be over.

“We can give them the Grassi Land, but from what I know, the Amani Family has already taken over the Mercury Family’s territory. Do you think they have only given the Manticore the Grassi Land?”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone stopped talking.

They knew very well that Glen was right.

The atmosphere suddenly became tense. A few seconds later, Glen asked, “Speaking of which, have the sub-towers been summoned back this time?”

” Sir, ” a Warlock said, ” we’ve basically finished summoning all our branches. So, eight out of ten branches in the Central continent have returned. Only one out of four branches outside the continent has returned.”

“What about those who didn’t come back?” Glen asked.

” Sir, those who didn’t come back basically refused to come back after hearing the news. They chose to wait and see. ” the Warlock said.

Glen took a deep breath, concealing the anger in his heart, and said, “Then how many people have returned from the branch tower, and what is the specific situation?”

“Sir, I’m not too sure about this, but the branches are all mixed. Basically, they have a few third circle warlocks and a dozen or fewer second circle warlocks.” The Warlock looked up at Glen and noticed that his face was a little dark, so he quickly added, “However, there are still three branches with decent strength. They are all here.”

The Warlock looked behind him and signaled with his eyes. The three Warlocks immediately stood up.

All three of them were men. One of them was tall, one of them was short and looked a little wretched, and the last one was a thin man.

” Sir Glen, I’m from the Bloodline Tower’s branch in Bloody City. This time, I have with me ten 3rd circle, 30 2nd circle, and 50 1st circle disciples. There are also a large number of acolytes. ” the tall Warlock said.

Glen nodded.

Bloody City was the closest to the Bloodline Tower, and they had always been strong. There were also many people who came back this time.

” Sir, I’m from the branch of the Joel Mountain Range. This time, I’ve brought back 15 third-circle, 40 second-circle, and 100 first-circle warlocks. ” The wretched Warlock chuckled.

Glen was even more satisfied.

The Joel Mountain Range was said to be a resource-gathering area of the Bloodline Tower. It was rich in resources, so it naturally became the strongest branch of the Bloodline Tower.

“Sir, I’m from the Silver Moon Forest branch. This time, there are only ten third-circle, fifteen second-circle, and 50 first-circle warlocks.” The skinny man seemed a little embarrassed.

“Not bad.” Glen also praised him.

“I’m very happy that you’re back. We’ll definitely win.” Glen said.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened, and a female Warlock walked in. It was Margot. She came to Glen’s side and spoke to him in a low voice.

“What? You said that Alida is back!” Glen suddenly shouted, his eyes full of surprise.

The others present raised their eyebrows when they heard this name. After all, she was Glen’s only descendant, so everyone naturally knew her.

Everyone knew that Alida had been sent away to a branch that might not even exist.

They didn’t say anything because they were all higher-ups in the Bloodline Tower. They knew that they might not be able to survive this time, so most of them sent a portion of their descendants away. Glen had also allowed this to happen. This was to preserve the future of the Bloodline Tower.

However, everyone was very surprised. Coming back at this time, wasn’t that courting death?

“Where’s Alida?” Glen looked at Magrot and asked.

At this moment, the door opened again. Alida walked in and said to Glen, “Grandpa!”

Looking at the familiar person and hearing the familiar voice, Glen covered his face with his hands.

“Alida, you shouldn’t have come back.” Glen had a complicated look in his eyes as he said the same thing.

“I completed the mission, so I naturally came back.” Alida looked at Glen and said.

Glen was speechless.

What mission?

“You mean the west coast tower is still there?” he asked uncertainly after a few seconds.

Alida was speechless.

‘So you really did it just to get rid of me. You’re too much.’

“Forget it, so be it. It seems like it’s all fate!” Glen sighed deeply again.

From the beginning to the end, he didn’t ask about the west coast tower, obviously not caring.

“Everyone, today’s discussion is over for the time being. Let’s end the meeting.”Glen stood up and said to everyone.

Everyone nodded and left.

When the wretched Warlock passed by, he glanced at Alida with a smile that was not a smile.

...

After they left, only Alida and Glen were left in the room. Margot also left.

” Alida, you’ve lost weight. It looks like you’ve suffered a lot along the way. ” Glen came to Alida’s side and patted her head.

“Grandpa!” Alida seemed a little displeased.

“Hahahaha, Alida is not a child anymore.” Glen was all smiles, and his wrinkles melted. The worries he had been feeling for days seemed to have disappeared.

Alida could not get angry in front of this familiar face.

” How was it? Did my little Alida’s trip to the West Coast go smoothly? ” Glen returned to his seat and asked.

“It didn’t go well, but the good thing is that the results are not bad.” Alida smiled.

” Sigh, it looks like the West Coast is still too close. ” Glen muttered in a low voice.

However, Alida did not seem to notice this.” Grandpa, you don’t know. When I went to the West Coast branch this time, they were really powerful … ”

Before Alida could finish her question, Glen interrupted her.”Then where are they?”

“Still on the way.” Alida replied and continued, “Grandpa, they’re really powerful. You don’t know that they actually have … ”

...

Bang!

The door suddenly opened, and Margot walked in. She said to Glen, “My lord, the manticore seems to have reached the outer forest.”

“What?” Glen suddenly stood up and looked at Alida. ” Alida, go and rest first. I need to discuss something. ”

After saying that, he left without looking back.

“I’m sorry to disturb your conversation with your grandfather, but we don’t have time.” Margot apologized and turned to leave.

In the blink of an eye, Alida was left alone in the huge conference room.

Alida bit her lip.

Whether it was her grandfather, Margot, or the others, they did not take her matter to heart at all.

Or rather, they looked down on the West Coast.

” But Sir Eli is really strong! ” Alida pursed her lips and whispered.

Then, she walked out of the room.

Just as she turned a corner, she saw a very wretched Warlock.

“Miss Alida!” The Warlock smiled at Alida, but it made her feel uncomfortable.

“And you are?” Alida frowned. She had seen this person just now, but she had never seen him before.

“I’m the person in charge of one of the branches. I just saw that Miss is very beautiful. I wonder if you’re interested in going for a drink?” The Warlock’s eyes flashed with greed.

“I don’t want to.” Alida shook her head and turned to leave.

A man’s voice came from behind.

” Miss, not all sub-towers are equal. Only those with one or two celestials can only be called branches. Those on the west coast that have not been in contact for hundreds of years are not even worthy of being called a branch. ”

Alida turned her head, her eyes filled with anger.

“Miss, you shouldn’t have come back.” The Warlock chuckled like a mouse. “I look forward to meeting you next time. I hope you won’t reject me next time. Also, your figure is very good.”

Alida didn’t expect a Warlock to be so frivolous. She exploded her second-circle aura, but it was suppressed by another aura. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Vile Warlock was a third-circle Warlock.

“Hehe.” The Warlock smiled and left.

Bang!

In the next second, he instantly knelt on the ground.

The Warlock was dumbfounded. Then, he saw Alida come to his side and slap him before leaving.

The Warlock was stunned. He had just fallen for no reason.

He looked at Alida’s back as she walked away. His anger burned, and the coldness in his eyes was even more intense than before.

….

“Thank you, Lord Hydra.”

On the other side, Alida took a deep breath and thanked her pocket after turning a corner.

It was Hydra who had made a move just now.

Hydra, who was in his pocket, closed its eyes silently. This was a mission given to it by its master. At the same time, it sent a message to Alida.

“Master will be here soon.”
