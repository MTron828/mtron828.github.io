419 Eli, Who Shouldn’t Have Appeared

Nightfall City battlefield!

At this time, after moving for dozens of kilometers, the Eight-Armed Naga Warlocks had arrived.

However, the battlefield that should have been tense seemed rather relaxed at this moment.

The Eight-Armed Naga’s side!

!!

At this moment, there were more than 20 celestials standing in the sky with relaxed smiles on their faces as they communicated.

” Sir Jesse has left. It seems that Eli has appeared on another battlefield! ” The leader of a level 3 force said.

” Indeed, we’re much safer now. If I had to face Eli, I might really be scared. After all, he was the one who killed the Radiant Sun Warlock. ” Another celestial said.

” This is great. We only need to face the remaining seven or eight celestials of Nightfall City. I don’t even know how we’re going to lose! ” A Warlock said, his eyes filled with undisguised ridicule!

Hearing the Warlock’s words, the other celestials also burst into laughter. Their laughter could even be heard in Nightfall City.

Nightfall City!

They were the true spirits of the Bloodline Tower. Some belonged to the Bloodline Tower, while others were affiliated forces.

At this moment, the expressions of the few celestials were unsightly, and they even looked a little desperate.

The opponent was too strong, so strong that they could not even raise their heart to resist!

Jess’s departure also meant that Sir Eli did not choose this side but one of the other two directions. This undoubtedly made them even more desperate!

“We’ve been abandoned!” A celestial gritted his teeth and said dejectedly.

” Our opponents are twenty-eight celestials. I don’t think we stand a chance. Why don’t we leave? ” A female Warlock gritted her teeth.

“But if we leave, what about the Warlocks here?” A celestial retorted.

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone fell silent.

They turned their heads and saw countless Warlocks waiting anxiously in Nightfall City. The despairing eyes of the city’s residents could be seen from the windows of every building. There were even countless people kneeling and praying in front of the statue of Eli in the center.

That’s right!

If they left, most of these people would die!

“Sigh, let’s each use our own methods. We’ll take as much as we can!” A celestial suggested.

When the others heard this voice, their eyes lit up.

They definitely couldn’t fight, but they could save some people!

“It’s too late!” Suddenly, a celestial spoke up. The others looked up and realized that more than 20 celestials had spread out in the sky and surrounded Nightfall City from all directions!

Seeing this scene, the hearts of the few celestials instantly sank!

“Everyone, it looks like we can’t leave today. Let’s fight!” A celestial gritted his teeth.

“We stand!”

The other celestials nodded in agreement. They had no other choice.

In the next second, the few celestials flew into the sky together while the Eight-Armed Naga’s celestials quickly surrounded them. Their goal was to kill these celestials. As for Nightfall City on the ground, they could deal with it at any time.

Looking at these seven people, a peak Radiant Moon Warlock stepped forward and smiled at them. “One-on-one or group fight?”

“In a one-on-one fight, you’ll be beaten up by me individually. In a group fight, you’ll be beaten up by us together!”

Hearing these insulting words, the few celestials of the Bloodline Tower exploded in anger. They were all celestials and had never been humiliated like this before!

A Warlock was about to curse when a voice suddenly came from behind them.

“I’ll fight all of you alone!”

A calm voice sounded. The Warlock was the first to look over, but the moment he saw the figure, his mouth was wide open and his eyes were round.

“Eli… Eli … Lord Eli!” The Warlock man found it hard to believe because this person shouldn’t be here at this time!

Hearing the Warlock’s words, the others were also shocked and turned to look. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the air, not far away, a man with black hair and black eyes stood. He was wearing a black mage robe and looked very young. He was smiling at everyone.

Seeing Eli’s smile, all the Eight-Armed Naga Warlocks’ faces froze, and their hearts trembled!

Why was he here?

Although no one had seen the man with their own eyes, they had seen his face countless times through images.

“Eli!”

After more than ten seconds, a terrified scream came from the mouth of a Celestial warlock, followed by many others.

“How could it be him? Didn’t Lord Jesse teleport away? Could it be that he deceived the lords of Radiant Sun?”

“We’re doomed. How could it be him!”

“It’s him!”

The celestials were instantly thrown into chaos. They subconsciously retreated because the man in front of them was too terrifying!

At this moment, the celestials of the Bloodline Tower were also stunned. They looked at Eli, not knowing what to say!

“We’re saved!” One of them said,

The other celestials nodded.

Yes, they were saved!

Although they didn’t understand why Daren would appear here, no matter what, they were saved.

At this moment, the ground was boiling.

...

In front of the statue of Eli, everyone raised their heads and stared blankly at the statue-like body in the sky.

” I knew that Sir Eli wouldn’t give up on us! ” An old warlock said shakily.

The others also had tears in their eyes. Other than the joy of being saved, they were extremely touched.

Countless people raised their heads and looked at Eli excitedly. They began to shout Eli’s name, shaking the clouds!

“Sir Ely!”

The cheers shattered the icy cold air, but it made all the eight-armed Naga Warlocks feel a chill run down their spines!

In the sky.

The bodies of the several dozen celestials stiffened. The Radiant Moon Warlock from before looked at Eli and begged,” Sir, we were also forced. We repent and beg Sir to spare our lives! ”

“I still prefer it when you are unruly,” Eli shook his head and added with a smile, ” As a favor, I’ve decided to kill you first! ”

The expression on the Warlock’s face froze!

The next second, his instinctive desire to live made him shout, “Everyone, don’t be afraid. He’s just one person. We still have a chance to defeat him!”

...

The celestial was smart enough to understand that escaping wouldn’t solve the problem. They had to kill Eli and the others to survive.

The others also raised their heads, their eyes flashing with the desire for life again.

Pa!

However, in the next second, everyone saw a black light fly past. With a bang, the Warlock’s head instantly exploded, and behind him, Eli’s figure slowly appeared.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s hopes were instantly shattered. There was only one thought in their hearts.

Run!

However, when they raised their heads and looked around, they realized that the area within dozens of kilometers had long been covered by shadows, blocking every direction like a birdcage.

“Come on!”

At this moment, everyone heard Eli’s voice, which sounded like a vengeful ghost!

At this moment, everyone felt as if they had fallen into an abyss!

….

Saka Plateau.

The situation was similar. When Eli appeared, all the Warlocks were stunned.

“Sir, why are you here?” Glen stared blankly at Ely, his mouth agape.

Didn’t that Radiant Sun leave? This didn’t mean that Ely should be on another battlefield.

But what was the point? Save one of the teams?

Glen’s big head was filled with big question marks.

But no matter what, he knew that when Sir Eli appeared here, the remaining Eight-Armed Naga warlocks would be finished. They might even be more confused than him!

Sure enough, when he looked over, the smiles on the faces of the nearly twenty Eight-Armed Naga Demon Celestial Warlocks in the distance had completely frozen. They were as comical as clowns.

“E … E … E …” The leading Warlock could not even complete a sentence, his voice trembling.

Eli looked at him and stretched out his right hand!

In the next second, endless darkness extended from his hand and flew into the sky. Then, it exploded like fireworks. Countless black threads flew into the distance and turned into a huge birdcage, restricting everyone in this row of areas and preventing them from leaving.

Then, he looked at the Warlocks enthusiastically and asked with concern, “One-on-one or group fight?”

The corners of the Eight-Armed Naga warlocks’ mouths twitched, but their hearts were filled with despair.

How could this be?

Why was Eli here?
