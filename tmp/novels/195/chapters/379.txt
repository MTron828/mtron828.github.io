380 Eight-Armed Naga Family

Outside the shadow barrier.

Everyone was still waiting, but everyone would look at the shadow barrier from time to time.

Although they couldn’t see through the shadows, the energy that was faintly erupting from it caught everyone’s attention.

” Conilla, the leader of the Amina family, the battle inside must be very difficult. Why don’t we try to open the shield together? ” Lobelia suggested.

” I think so. It’s only been five minutes, so it shouldn’t be a big problem. But if it’s a little longer, it’ll be hard to say. ” Selona nodded in agreement.

“Sure.” Conilla nodded.

“Alright, let’s do it then.” Seeing that everyone agreed, Lobelia turned to Liliana and said, “Stay far away. This is not something you can participate in.”

“Yes, teacher.” Liliana nodded and left quickly.

The celestials nodded in agreement and began to face the Shadow Barrier head-on.

Lobelia pointed with her finger, and a purple mark appeared on the Shadow Barrier.

“Everyone, let’s attack with all our might here.”

Everyone nodded in unison.

In the next second, a purple aura wrapped around Lobelia’s body. She stretched out her hand, and concentrated power gathered at her fingertips. A magic stone appeared in Conilla’s hand and instantly turned golden. Countless dazzling golden power gathered. Many of the Amina family’s Warlocks extended their wings behind their backs, and countless wind elements gathered in front of them.

Everyone held their breaths and focused on the purple mark, ready to attack.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, Lobelia stopped and stretched out her hand. Everyone stopped and looked at her.

“The shadow seems to be melting!” said Lobelia.

The others also noticed that the huge shadow barrier seemed to be slowly disappearing from top to bottom.

In the blink of an eye, the upper half of the shield had disappeared, and it was still melting down. Everyone slowly stopped what they were doing and looked inside the shield. In just a few seconds, everything inside the shield was revealed to everyone.

At the edge of the shadow, three figures were also looking at them.

” Conilla, Selona, Lobelia, Liliana, and everyone from the Amanah Family! ”

Eli looked at these people and blinked. He didn’t expect these people to appear here.

” Sir Eli, we are all here to support you. ” Selona said as he looked at the space behind Eli.

Where’s Jere?

Where were the enemies?

The space behind Eli was empty, except for some ” insignificant ” damage on the ground.

“Sir Eli, we are indeed here to provide support, but where did Jerre go?” Lobelia nodded with a puzzled expression.

Conilla also nodded silently.

“I see!” Realization dawned on Eli, and he replied, “I really didn’t expect everyone to pay attention to our matter. As for the battle, it has already ended. I’m sorry, everyone, you might have made a wasted trip.”

“Oh, it’s over…What?” Lobelia first nodded, but in the next second, her mouth was wide open as she exclaimed.

“It’s over!”

The warlocks of the Amina family and Mordor were also dumbfounded.

Wasn’t it only a few minutes since it started, and it was already over?!

Are you kidding me?

“What about Jerre and the others?” Lobelia asked tentatively.

“Of course, I’ve killed him. Oh, right, the Bloodline Tower will be taking over the Manticore Family. If you have a branch there, please inform us first so that we can pay attention to it!” Eli said to them with a smile.

Hiss!

Hearing this, everyone gasped.

“Dead?” Lobelia’s throat moved slightly.

That was a total of eleven celestials, and there were even three Radiant Moon Warlocks.

“As expected of the Warlock that Lord Jin Ji thinks highly of!” Mordor took a deep breath.

“Fortunately, we’re here!” Selona heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that Eli hadn’t used his full strength when he had beaten them up that day.

But in the next second, another question flashed through his mind. What if, this time, Eli still did not use his full strength?

Selona quickly shook his head. It was unlikely.

No matter how strong he was, he would be a Radiant Sun Warlock. How could the West Coast produce a Warlock more than that level?

” Congratulations, sir, for solving this problem! ” After shaking his head, Selona immediately congratulated Eli.

The other Warlocks also congratulated him, and the atmosphere was peaceful.

“Well, since everyone is here, do you want to visit the Bloodline Tower?” Eli smiled at everyone.

“Since Milord is fine, then I can rest easy. My faction still has some matters to attend to.” Lobelia nodded and pulled Liliana over. ” My lord, Liliana will be in charge of the branch of the Bloodline Tower. Please take care of her. ”

“No problem.” Eli nodded.

“Thank you, sir. we’ll leave first,” said Lobelia with a smile.

“Goodbye, my lord!” Liliana nodded and looked at Eli.

Then, the two of them left.

Conilla also left quickly after bidding farewell.

...

After everyone left, Selona asked cautiously, “Milord, we will take our leave as well.”

“Yes!”

Then, the Warlocks of the Amina family left.

After everyone left, Eli looked at Hydra and Nikola and said, “Let’s go back too.”

“Yes, my lord!” Nikola burped and nodded with difficulty.

He had just swallowed the soul of the Eleven celestials, so he was feeling a little bloated!

Upon hearing the voice, Hydra consciously came to Eli. Nikola wanted to fly with them as well, but he was flung away by Hydra’s tail and left.

“Wait for me!”

Nikola cursed and quickly followed!

…

Two hours later.

...

Eli and the others returned to the Bloodline Tower.

At this moment, countless Warlocks were still waiting. Glen and Alida were standing on the Magus Tower.

Glen let out a long sigh of relief when he saw Eli’s figure in the distance.

“My lord won.” Glen’s worried heart finally relaxed.

Alida, who was standing at the side, also smiled.

Not only the two of them but the entire Bloodline City was once again in an uproar. Many people from the nearby forces were also shocked when they saw Eli return. There were even Warlocks who were not prepared to take advantage of Eli’s death to plunder the benefits. They quietly left the city.

No one expected that Eli would actually return.

However, more people wanted to know what happened to Jerre’s party.

…

” Sir, you defeated your opponent with the help of the Amina Family? ”

Glen asked curiously in the Magus Tower.

” Yes, yes. If it weren’t for the fact that the Amina family had come out in full force, I would have been in danger. ”

Across from Glen, Eli nodded in agreement.

“I see!” Glen nodded. He looked at Nikola, who was almost stuffed to death, and the uninjured Eli. He pursed his lips. He had his suspicions, but whatever his lord said was true!

“Yes, just promote it like this.” Eli nodded in satisfaction.

“Oh right, how are the preparations for the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower going?” Eli suddenly asked.

“I don’t think they are up to my lord’s standard yet!” Glen looked at Eli.

” It’s okay. I’ll get Nikola and Hydra to help you. ”

Eli turned to look at Nikola. At the very least, after digesting this wave, Nikola would be able to reach the limit of Radiant Star. Of course, this might take a long time, but it was enough to deal with the manticore and its subordinates.

Glen nodded, but then his face turned worried. “Then, my lord, I have another worry.”

“What is it?” asked Eli.

Glen took a deep breath and said, “Sir, you might not know this, but behind the Manticore Clan is the Eight-Armed Naga Clan. Their power is much stronger than the Manticore Clan. They are on completely different levels of power.”

“I know!”

“Yes … You know about it?” Glen’s eyes widened.

“Yes, and I also know that they were the ones who caused the manticore to act this time,” Eli said.

“Ah!” Glen’s mouth was wide open. This was too ridiculous.

” The reason is that something happened in the breeding ground of the Eight-Armed Naga. The breeding of Eight-Armed Naga requires abundant life force. That’s why the manticore attacked us. Otherwise, do you think it’s worth it for Jerre to sacrifice himself for Grassi Land?” Eli explained. This was what he knew from Jerre’s soul.

Greem was now completely shocked. If that were the case, then things would be serious. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“But if we attack the manticore, will they really not attack us?”

“No, they’ll be busy for quite a while after this.”

Eli shook his head and smiled at Glen. “Inform the furthest branch to find someone trustworthy.”

“What will we do?” Glen was puzzled.

“We’ll be selling a piece of information.”
