61 Soul Imprint

It was cold and dark.

Aria Kazan took a deep breath and reached out his hand, feeling a deep sense of powerlessness and sadness.

Before he was a dilapidated hut. It was so simple that there was only a wooden bed, and the only light source was a candle that was almost burned out.

This was one of the houses in Duoling’s biggest residential area, and it was one of the few places that were safe for him.

He had spent the past three days here.

In fact, three days ago, he was going to look for his aunt because his father had given him a list of people he could trust before his death, and his aunt was one of them.

But halfway there, he decided to change locations and hide here for a while.

His aunt could be trusted, but his uncle might use this to set up spies around his aunt, waiting for him to walk into the trap.

Moreover, the person he had met three days ago was still in his mind. That mysterious person and the ” business ” they had discussed.

Now that the three days were up, would he come?

Moreover, he didn’t even have his address, so how was he supposed to find him?

“Like a magician?” The man’s elegance and calmness from that day suddenly appeared in Aria’s mind. It was as if victory was in his hands.

But to be honest, he didn’t have much hope. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He felt like he was dreaming.

“Three days ‘time is almost over. It seems that it’s wishful thinking.”

Aria looked out of the window. The sky was getting dark. He looked at the wooden door not far away. It did not move.

Suddenly, the wooden door moved.

Hearing the sound, Aria’s eyes widened, and his heart beat faster for some reason. His first reaction was not that Eli was here but that his uncle had found him. But that was impossible. This place should be safe. How could he find him?

“You look a little nervous!”

However, what entered Aria’s ears was not the rough voice of the mercenary. Instead, it was a calm voice.

“It’s you!”

The moonlight flowed in through the gap in the door. Eli was dressed in black and held a cane in his hand.

“It’s not a bad place, but it seems like you haven’t had a good time these past three days!”

Eli looked around, then said to Aria Kazan, “If it weren’t for the spiritual imprint, this place would have been hard to find! ”

At this moment, Aria was already dumbfounded. He did not expect that eli would actually find him.

Could it be that eli had actually been monitoring him these past few days?

“As promised, I’ve brought perfume!” It was as if Eli had no patience to listen to him as he threw a bottle over.

Aria was speechless.

Aria caught the bottle in his hand. There was a strange liquid flowing in the bottle.

He was stunned for a moment. Could this be the perfume he was talking about?

He unscrewed the bottle, and the smell in the bottle immediately entered his nose. as the original heir of the Kazan chamber of commerce, his ability to identify perfume was naturally good.

The smell was above average at best, but when he smelled it, he seemed to feel an impulse to inhale more of it.

Aria smelled it helplessly and was stunned. He could not understand how such a unique perfume could exist. However, he was overjoyed. With such a great perfume, he could definitely win the support of the noble in the chamber of commerce.

Once he got her support, he would be able to regain control of the Chamber of Commerce.

As for why he was so confident in the power of the noble behind him ...

This was because the person standing behind the Kazan chamber of commerce was the largest noble in the Lorraine kingdom, queen Cynthia. Only she would not even care about the profits of a large chamber of commerce.

Aria held the perfume tightly in his hand as if it was his last hope.

“Wait a minute, are you forgetting something?” Suddenly, a voice rang out. It was Eli who spoke in a low voice.

“Oh, right. I remember you said this is a deal! ” Aria also seemed to have woken up from a dream. He quickly asked Eli, “then what do you want?”

“There’s a principle in doing business, it’s called the principle of equivalent exchange. Do you know that?” Eli said as he slowly approached Aria.

“Of course, don’t worry. I’ll give you something equivalent in value to the perfume. ” Aria was stunned for a moment and quickly replied.

“No, it’s more than that.” Eli shook his head.

Aria was confused.

“You got into my car by chance, and I saved your life. So, your life should be mine. That’s more reasonable.” eli looked at Aria and smiled as he analyzed the situation.

Aria was speechless.

He was stunned.

He didn’t quite understand what Eli meant, but he generally understood that Eli was asking everything from him, be it his life or the Kazan Chamber of Commerce.

“Impossible, you’re too greedy!” Aria’s eyes widened.

“No, the deal has already begun since you got in my car. ” Eli shook his head. At the same time, the Magus’s hand appeared and grabbed Aria, who was just inches away.

Aria’s eyes widened, but he could not resist at all. He could only watch as eli slowly reached out his hand and placed it on his head.

In an instant, Aria felt as if his brain was being pricked by countless needles. An invisible but mysterious connection was formed between him and the man in front of him.

This process lasted for a full five minutes before eli finally stopped.

After all, the soul imprint was not a simple spell.

Soul imprint was a zero-circle spell. Its purpose was to engrave a soul imprint in the target’s consciousness, allowing one to completely understand the target’s thoughts and manipulate the other party to a certain extent.

[ Requirements: level 2 mage acolytes and above, the difference in spiritual power must be huge, and there must not be excessive resistance. Also, you must leave a spiritual force marker on the target three days in advance. ]

This was also the first time that eli had used this spell because the conditions for using this spell were really troublesome. Furthermore, with his current mental strength, he could only perform three at most.

The reason why he booked the carriage for three days was also because of this spell. As for when he left the mark, it was when he patted Aria’s shoulder before he left the carriage.

“What did you do to me?” At this moment, Aria was already lying on the ground, looking at Eli with fear in his eyes.

He even had a feeling that, at this moment, Eli could completely understand what he was thinking or even kill him directly.

“Haven’t you already figured it out?” Eli lowered his head and looked at Aria.

He had planned to do so from the start. After all, Eli didn’t really trust verbal or verbal promises. The ones engraved in mind were much more reliable.

“Impossible! How could there be such a method? ” Aria’s face twitched.

“Then let’s give it a try,” Eli said.

Aria’s eyes widened.

In the next moment, it was as if his brain was being torn apart, his soul was burning on one side and being pierced by countless needles on the other. Aria let out a painful howl. It was a pain he had never experienced before.

Compared to physical pain, the pain of the soul was ten times, no, a hundred times more terrifying.

The torture only lasted for five seconds, but Aria felt as if hundreds of years had passed.

“Do you still want to give it another try?” Eli asked again, but in Aria’s ears, it sounded like a demon’s whisper.

“No,” Aria mumbled.

In just five seconds, he had completely understood his situation.

He had jumped straight into hell.

“From now on, you are bound to me. Everything you have is mine. Are you willing to accept that? Of course, you actually have another choice. I can remove the seal and then kill you. You can choose.” Eli lowered his head and looked at Aria.

Did he still have a choice?

Tears fell from Aria’s eyes. He knew that he had no other choice.

He suddenly remembered something his father had once said. All the gifts had already been secretly marked with a price. He didn’t understand it before, and now he understood it, but it was a little too late.

“I’m willing!” After a few seconds, Aria finally nodded in resignation.

He chose to live.

“Very good, you’ve accepted it very quickly!” Eli said in a relaxed voice. “I’m almost 30, and you’re only 19. When I die, you and your descendants will be free.”

Aria’s eyes lit up, and he slowly got up from the ground.

“Now, that’s better,” Smiling, Eli squatted down and looked at Aria. ” Then let’s talk about the noble behind the Kazan chamber of commerce and how you plan to take back the chamber of commerce that belongs to me. ”
