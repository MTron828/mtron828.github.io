136 The Mage in the Camp?

Victor’s death had no effect on Eli.

A month later.

“Good Morning, Deputy Minister Herman!”

As soon as he stepped out of the door in the morning, he heard a crisp greeting.

He turned around and saw an unfamiliar woman standing outside Victor’s yard. She was the new tenant of Victor’s house, Tijie.

She was a zero circle sorceress with long red hair. She wore a sexy leather jacket that wrapped around her chest and a pair of leather pants that outlined her long legs.

“Good morning,” Eli nodded calmly and turned to leave.

It was better to stay away from such a beautiful woman. This woman had only moved in a few days ago, but she kept making Eli feel a little strange. Eli didn’t know where this feeling came from, but he still decided to walk further away.

Looking at the back of the man who left in a hurry, the corner of Tijie’s mouth twitched. She touched her face and started to doubt her own charm. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

According to the information, this Vice President of the potions Department should frequently go to the brothels and should be very lecherous. She had specially dressed up so beautifully in order to seduce Eli, but looking at it now, it was a little of a failure!

“Forget it. I’ll try to get close to Herman first. At the same time, I’ll get closer to the other targets.” Tijie shook her head. This time, someone had contacted her organization, so she came here first to gather information.

She pursed her lips, then turned around and walked into the room.

Just as she entered the room, a black eye in the shadow not far away also disappeared like a bubble.

“There’s a problem indeed.”

On the other side, Eli, who had already walked a few kilometers, frowned.

Since he felt that something was amiss, it was naturally impossible for him not to investigate this factor clearly. Therefore, Eli had already set up various detection methods around Tijie’s house.

After she left, tijie’s expression was one of deep thought and profoundness, which was hard for Eli to find normal.

“looks like I’ll have to pay more attention to this neighbor for a while.”

Shaking his head, Eli continued walking towards the camp.

Maintaining the shadow eye from a few kilometers away was not a problem for him now. He had made great progress compared to 20 years ago. His mental power had reached 58, and his elemental conversion had reached 50% with the help of the elemental crystals.

Of course, this progress was not considered fast, especially when compared to a top-notch genius like Rock. However, Eli was very satisfied. His own aptitude was simply too poor, and he could only rely on time to slowly improve.

This was even after he had used a middle-grade meditation technique. Otherwise, it would have been even slower.

…

Ten minutes later, Eli arrived at the potions Department.

At the door, Eli ran into Evena.

“Minister Evena.”

In the past 20 years,EIvana’s appearance hadn’t changed much. She still looked beautiful.

“It’s Herman!” Looking at Eli, Evena smiled. Anyone who had an employee like Eli would be very happy.

Furthermore, at this point, Eli had already gained the approval of both Evena and the camp.

Time was the best way to test loyalty.

“Oh, right, Herman, this is the bloodline that you bought some time ago through our internal channels.” As if remembering something, she took out a bottle of blood from her pocket.

The blood was green with a hint of red, and it exuded a ring of energy.

This was the first circle bloodline that Eli had bought some time ago. It was called the bramble Tree demon, a plant-type magic beast.

It was mainly because he considered that as an apprentice, Eli wasn’t young anymore, and it would be impolite for him to still be moving in the same spot, so he decided to ” advance ” to a first circle Warlock.

After advancing, Eli would also be able to come into contact with higher circles and items in the camp. In his current circle, the things he could obtain were really limited, so it was time for him to move up.

“Yes, thank you, Minister.” Looking at the blood, Eli accepted it with a smile.

He had worked hard for more than 20 years.

“Yes, the camp is currently short of people. When you become a first-circle Warlock, the battalion commander will definitely arrange a higher position for you. By then, there will be other benefits. It’s a pity that the positions of the Minister are full, or you could be the Minister.” Said Evena, pleased.

With Eli’s assistance, she had more free time.

“Yes, yes, I will definitely not let down the camp’s hopes.”

“Eell, that’s all I have to say. Hey, I suddenly remembered the gambling trick you told me last time. It’s really useful. Can you teach me a few more tricks? ”

After dealing with this matter, evena suddenly came over and said with a smile.

At the mention of this, Eli felt a little regretful.

Once, he and Rooney were discussing some of the casino’s techniques, and they happened to bump into evena. As a result, the Minister actually joined in excitedly, and later often asked Eli some questions.

“no, no. Minister Evena is already very good. I need to go.” Eli found an excuse and quickly left.

Evena’s ears were standing up in anger, but she still said loudly, “I wish you success in merging with the bloodline!”

“Thank you, Minister.” An echo was heard from afar.

…

The bloodline was already in his hands, and Eli was already thinking about when he should ‘fuse’ with the bloodline.

In fact, it was impossible for him to integrate with it. He already had the shadow dragon’s bloodline. He would only use this bloodline as a disguise. It would give him additional bloodline skills.

This secondary bloodline integration would take some time, but not long.

Besides, what Eli was more concerned about was who his ” beautiful neighbor ” was. What was her purpose?

He would slowly smoke her out.

…

Another half a month passed.

After some investigation, Eli did find something wrong with his female neighbor.

First of all, whenever Eli came out, she would deliberately try to get close to him, but every time he left, she would head to other places in the camp to get to know all kinds of people.

Secondly, although this woman had fused with her bloodline, the strength of her bloodline was not high. It was obvious that she had not trained her bloodline much, which was not in line with the habits of ordinary warlocks.

Lastly, there were times when Eli would sense a mysterious spiritual wave next door. Although it was fleeting, Eli guessed that it was some kind of communication tool, probably to contact the outside world. Most importantly, this kind of spiritual wave was usually used by mages.

All in all, there was something wrong with his female neighbor, and there was a certain possibility that she was a mage in disguise.

A mage-apprentice had sneaked into the warlock’s camp.

This could affect the stability of the camp, and in this regard, Eli was also very conflicted about what he should do.

But after some thought, Eli decided to approach it the most direct way.

And so, on a pitch-black night, Eli sneaked into Tijie’s house.

…

At night.

Tijie was lying on the bed in a thin chiffon dress. Her beautiful figure could be seen through the moonlight. Her eyes were closed as she was resting.

Suddenly.

“Whoosh!!!”

A huge wave of mental power suppressed her. Tijie also sensed this and opened her eyes. However, her body was completely suppressed, and a few vines were tightly wrapped around her.

She wanted to break free, but she couldn’t.

What made her even more fearful was she did not even know what had happened, but due to the immense mental suppression, she found it difficult to breathe and could not make a sound at all.

“Tell me, what is a mage apprentice doing in a Warlock’s camp?”

As soon as the voice was heard, Tijie’s body was pulled up by the vines, and a man in a Black wizard’s robe was sitting on a stool not far away.

This scene was too embarrassing, and her face turned red.

She knew that she had been exposed, but she couldn’t figure out how she had been discovered. She clearly hadn’t done anything out of line. All she did was try to get close to Eli, but there shouldn’t be anything wrong with that.

“Sir, I don’t understand what you’re saying. I’m just a little Warlock. If I’ve offended you, please spare me.” Tijie said quickly as she felt the suppression of her mental power disappear.

“Hmph!”

After a cold snort, the vines wrapped around her body and gradually increased their strength as though they were trying to strangle her to death.

Tijie found it hard to breathe. At the same time, her body was cut by the vines. The blood that flowed out was absorbed by the vines. Soon, Tijie’s dress was dyed red.

“I’ve seen everything you’ve done in the camp. Tell me, which mage organization are you from?” Eli asked calmly again.

On the other hand, Tijie, who was enduring the pain, widened her eyes.

She slowly raised her head and looked at Eli. At this moment, Eli also slowly stood up, took off his wizard robe, and said, “I’m Roland, a first-circle mage. I’m living here temporarily.”

A mage?

Tijie blinked her eyes.

But in the next second, he saw a skeleton walk out from the shadows. The burning undead flames illuminated Eli’s face slightly. It was a very handsome young man.

A skeleton.

And a Necromancer?

Looking at this scene, Tijie heaved a sigh of relief. As long as he was not from the Warlock camp, there was still hope for her to survive.

To her knowledge, no warlock knew necromancy. The man in front of her was definitely an official mage, and only an official mage could easily suppress her with mental strength.

The only thing that made her uneasy was that the man in front of her was a little rough with his methods, but she could understand it. After all, he was a Necromancer.

“my Lord, I am a mage from the irises’ mage camp. My real name is Tijie. I can tell you whatever you want to know. Can you let me go first?” Tijie spoke slowly. She knew that her fate was in Roland’s control.

Seeing that the situation was gradually stabilizing, Eli nodded and placed Tijie down before throwing a bottle of potion over.

“This is a healing potion.” yes, “Eli said.

“Yes.” Tijie nodded but did not consume it.

“Tell me. What is your purpose in coming here?”

Seeing that Tijie had calmed down, Eli also asked the question that he was curious about.
