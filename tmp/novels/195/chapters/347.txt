348 Holmes City

Holmes city.

The magnificent city in the westernmost part of the Western Region covered an area of several dozen acres. It was the only city within ten thousand miles of the Sofia mountain range. It had been standing on this land for several thousand years and was also one of the oldest cities in the Western Region.

This was proven by the fact that the city wall had been replaced many times, and the magic formation that protected the city had disappeared.

On this day, the sky had just brightened.

Klison rubbed his drowsy eyes. He was wearing silver armor and a helmet as he walked up to the city wall.

As a ” soldier ” for Holmes, his duty was to guard the city wall.

This day was also the same.

After communicating with the other guards, he arrived at his position, a tower on the city wall. This was the highest point and had the widest view.

‘the same scenery, the same boring scenery.’

Klison was guarding the city wall that led to the Sofia mountain range, and he could see the mountain scenery that had not changed for hundreds of years.

He had been here for three years, and he was getting tired of it.

After a while, his drowsy eyes suddenly widened as if he had seen something wrong.

At the exit of the mountain range in the distance, a few warlocks ran out, and they looked as if there was something terrifying.

“No, let’s observe first.” Klison instantly focused his mind.

There had been cases of powerful magical beasts invading from the mountains over the years, and every time they did, they would cause great destruction.

The cold morning air entered his windpipe, making him more focused.

“I hope not!” He looked at the mountain range’s exit, but he soon realized that more and more people were coming out of the mountain range, and they were all running very fast.

Something was wrong.

Klison knew that something must have happened inside. He immediately pulled on a rope not far away.

The rope fell quickly under the pull, and the bell connected to the tower rang.

Thump thump thump!

The bell rang from the tower, and everyone near the city wall seemed to be stunned for a second.

In the next second, countless noises were heard.

“Warning, warning!” The warlocks on the city wall shouted loudly, and the warlocks below the city wall also ran into the city.

In just a dozen seconds, the warlocks on the city wall were ready, and the city wall was filled with weapons.

On the ground, there were even more warlocks running toward them.

A Warlock shouted, “It’s a huge flying object.”

The guards did not understand what he meant, but they became more cautious. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At this moment, all the warlocks in the mountain range had run into the city, and the gate was instantly closed.

Of course, it was not just them. With this alarm, countless warlocks instantly became nervous, and the entire city was mobilized.

More than a dozen third-circle warlocks flew up in an instant, and the other sorcerers also tried to climb as high as possible.

They stared at the mountain range.

In the center of the city, there was a room in a tall Warlock tower. It looked extremely luxurious, with gold and jewels all around. In the center, a man who was missing an eye sat.

He wore black clothes and was tall. There was a scar on one side of his face that extended from his eye to his chin, like a centipede. He was the ruler of the city and the only celestial warlock.

At this moment, he was also looking out of the window with a puzzled expression.

What was happening?

…

As time passed, the guards on the city wall held their weapons tightly.

The warlocks in the city were also looking into the distance.

The sun was slowly rising, emitting a dazzling light.

A dash of silver appeared at the exit of the mountain range.

“What’s that?” Some warlocks looked puzzled.

The silver-white light slowly passed through the mountain range and slowly appeared before everyone’s eyes.

It was a huge silver-white flying object.

No, there were two more behind him.

Three huge silver flying objects flew through the mountains. They were a hundred meters long and reflected light in the air. They were surrounded by force fields, and they were flying straight toward Holmes city.

“What is this?” The young warlock had a puzzled expression.

The older or more experienced warlocks widened their eyes.

“Mechanical airship?”

They were confused. Wasn’t this thing already gone?

Although they were shocked, they also heaved a sigh of relief. At least it meant that it was not a magical beast.

He wondered where they came from.

It couldn’t be the barren land of the West Coast.

…..

...

“Is this an airship? This is the first time I’ve seen it.”

“It’s not just you. It’s also my first time.”

In an open space outside the city gate, an old Warlock and a young Warlock squatted at the side, looking into the distance.

Three huge airships were standing on the ground. The fine metal patterns on them made their eyes light up.

It wasn’t just them. At this time, there were also many people here who were observing, each with different thoughts.

Alida looked at the group of warlocks outside the window and covered her face.

She had never expected that the three airships would cause such a huge commotion and even attract the attention of these warlocks.

It had been like this since they landed here an hour ago.

As for all of them, they were ordered to stay on the airship. As for Eli, he was invited to a banquet by the City Lord.

…

At this moment.

...

On the second floor of a building in the city center.

The lights were bright, and melodious music was playing. Dozens of people were neatly dressed in twos and threes. Some were chatting, while others were looking at the center of the banquet. A few people were chatting.

There were four people in total, three men and one woman.

The woman was a beautiful lady with dark purple eyes and a good figure. She wore a long purple dress, revealing her long, white legs. She was full of charm. One of the men had a scar running through his face, indicating his identity. The other was a middle-aged man who looked very large.

And the last person, the most curious person, was also the host of this banquet.

He was a young man who looked elegant and easygoing.

“let me introduce myself. I’m Amanta, the City Lord of Holmes city. I’m a four-circle celestial Warlock.” Amanta looked at Eli, then pointed at the two beside him. “this is Ms. Liliana from the charm mansion, and this is Ian, the person in charge of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce in Holmes city.”

“Hello, you can call me Eli. I’m a four-circle micro-star Warlock from the West Coast.” Eli looked at the three of them and introduced himself.

He did not expect that an airship would attract so much attention.

As soon as they landed, the mayor of the city came up to them and invited Eli to the banquet.

Since he was going with the flow, naturally, Eli did not reject him. Of course, he was the only one. Nikola and Hydra were hidden in the airship, concealing their auras.

It was his first time here, so he had to be more cautious.

He looked at the three people in front of him. Besides Amanta, who was a celestial Warlock, the other two were only third circle.

As for the organization that the two of them belonged to, there was no need to elaborate on the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. There were many stories that happened between Eli and the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. Eli also knew about the other charm mansion. It was also an organization that provided services and was extremely powerful.

Warlocks had a weakness that could not be hidden compared to mages, and that was that they would be affected by their bloodline. The baser desires were amplified. Things like lust and violence were featured more often. It was why the charm mansion was born.

To a certain extent, the Charm Manor was this world’s red light district. However, they had also absorbed many powerful warlocks, as well as their affiliated and cooperative forces. It was a powerful force.

It seemed that this banquet was his first obstacle in his Journey to the West Coast.

Eli observed the three of them, and the three of them were naturally observing him as well.

“A celestial who is alone!”

Amanta looked at Eli, his eyes were deep, his thoughts unknown.

‘A celestial that seems to be from the West Coast. He shouldn’t be a force on the continent. Maybe I can take him into the organization.’ Liliana’s eyes glittered.

She had only come because she had heard that a celestial from an unfamiliar area had come to the city.

“Eli? It doesn’t seem to be Herman.” The fat Ian shook his head.

He had also heard that it was a force from the West Coast, so he had attended the banquet as quickly as possible.

The branch in Holmes city had a different mission from the other branches, and that was to wait for a man named Herman, who belonged to the West Coast.

Unfortunately, he would not be able to complete the mission this time.

It was a small banquet, and everyone had their own thoughts.

After the introduction, Liliana looked at Eli and asked, ” my Lord, you are from the West Coast. Since you are a celestial, you shouldn’t be affiliated with any faction, right? Why don’t you join our charm mansion? Our influence is spread all over the central continent. We can provide you with the best conditions.”

The other two also looked at Herman. They were curious about what choice Eli would make.

Generally speaking, very few forces would send their celestials to a place like the West Coast. In addition, Eli had brought quite a number of people with him, so they guessed that it was probably a force that wanted to move the central continent.

“I’m sorry!” Eli shook his head.

Liliana blinked her eyes and understood that he was a Warlock who was preparing to build his own force.

“Milord might not know the situation in the Western regions, but at the moment, every piece of land in the Western regions that can be used to establish a faction is occupied. It’s not an easy task to establish a new faction, and you’ll have to obtain the recognition of other factions, which is even more difficult.” Liliana reminded.

“Of course, I know.” Eli nodded.

This was also the reason why he was prepared to go to the bloodline tower.

It would be troublesome to establish a force in the central continent.

“In that case, why don’t you join us, my Lord? you might not know us, but the charm mansion is one of the most powerful guilds in the world.” Liliana invited again.

Wild celestials like Eli were rare.

If she could invite him to join, it would be a great contribution.

“I don’t need to.” Eli shook his head and then said, “There’s something I didn’t tell you. I’m from the bloodline tower’s branch on the West Coast.”

Liliana blinked her eyes in confusion.

Bloodline tower?

Ian’s eyes lit up as if he was very sensitive to this word.
