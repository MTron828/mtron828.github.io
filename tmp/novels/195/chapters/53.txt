54 Departure- Lorraine Kingdom

There were still three days left.

Hence, there was plenty of time for eli to prepare.

He was not in a hurry to go back. Instead, he left after drinking the good tea. Scholar Clement was happy, so he didn’t say anything and even asked him to drink more.

After finishing the tea, Eli immediately left the library and headed for the market.

After all, he was going on a trip, so he had to bring some things. Otherwise, it would be very inconvenient. From simple toiletries to some materials that he might need, he bought a lot.

Of course, considering the problem of weight, he was also very moderate.

But for some of the materials, Eli was ready to go to Roland.

After all, it was really troublesome to have no channels.

As Roland’s rose chamber of commerce was on the street next to the market, Eli chose to walk there. Coincidentally, he had also made an appointment with Roland a week ago, and it was today.

However, when Eli arrived at the Rose Chamber of Commerce, he realized that the entrance of the Chamber of Commerce was already full of people.

“What about Roland? He has to give us a guarantee!”

“Get Roland out!”

“We must see Roland today, or we won’t leave.”

At that moment, a group of merchants in luxurious clothes blocked the entrance of the rose chamber of commerce. A group of people wanted to squeeze in, but they were blocked by a group of guards.

“What happened?”

Eli was puzzled.

He had even looked for Roland once three months ago. At that time, Roland was in high spirits. At that time, because of the king’s influence, the Rose Chamber of Commerce had taken on many big orders, and its influence had directly surpassed many established Chambers of Commerce.

However, it seemed that the situation had changed today.

“Mr. Eli!” Just as Eli was feeling puzzled, a voice came from behind him.

He turned around and saw a man. Eli had some impression of him. He seemed to be someone close to Roland.

“Eh, Chris, what’s going on here? Did something happen to Roland? ” Eli asked.

“Mr. eli, something did happen. ” Chris didn’t expect Eli to remember his name and was a little touched, but then he frowned and said, ” Mr. eli, it’s complicated. It’s not something I can explain clearly. You should talk to the boss. The boss is worried that something might go wrong with you coming here today, so he asked me to wait here. Come with me. ”

“So, Roland isn’t here!” Eli also understood that something must have gone wrong, or it would be impossible for even Roland not to dare to come to his Chamber of Commerce.

After Chris finished speaking, he walked towards the street not far away, with eli following behind.

Soon, Eli met Roland in a private room in a Tavern.

However, Rowland seemed to be a little drunk at this time. He was leaning on the sofa with a bottle of rum in one hand, and his face was a little red.

“Eli, my friend, you’re here!” he said. Roland wobbled and raised the bottle with his right hand.

“What happened?”

Chris left the room, leaving the two behind.

Roland burped at first and then said, ” Eli, my Chamber of Commerce might be finished. I might not be able to provide you with materials in the future.”

“What happened? did the chamber of commerce run out of funds? I can help you if you need it. ” Although the materials were more important, Eli was also very concerned about the state of his few friends.

” Haha, thanks. I knew you were rich, but this time, it’s not something that can be solved with money. ” Roland shook his head, poured himself a glass of wine, and finished it in one gulp.

“As you know, due to the expansion of the Chamber of Commerce, I’ve encountered many competitors. The biggest one is the cross Chamber of Commerce. They played a dirty trick and directly cut off our domestic suppliers. However, due to the previous contract, I still have a huge amount of medicinal ingredients to deliver in batches. I can’t back down now.”

“Then how long can you guys last?” Eli knew that he really couldn’t help at the moment.

“At most, half a year. After half a year, the large number of orders will directly crush me. You should have seen the group of merchants.” Roland grinned, full of self-mockery.

“I’ve already sent you the materials.” Roland stood up and said, ” you don’t have to worry about me. maybe things will turn for the better in half a year. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Don’t underestimate me. I’ve already sent people to the big chambers of commerce in the surrounding countries to seek cooperation. Maybe there will be a turn for the better. ” Roland seemed to have recovered a little and said with a smile.

“If you need anything, you can find me anytime,” Eli said without any nonsense.

True friends didn’t need to talk too much.

“I will. You are the person I can’t understand the most. You are two years younger than me, but you always give me a sense of mystery. ” Roland nodded.

“I won’t stay any longer. You might need some private space now. Also, don’t drink too much. It’s not good for your health. Anna will be unhappy! ” Seeing this, Eli knew that Roland needed some time alone, so he prepared to leave.

Anna was Roland’s current wife, and they were married a year ago.

“Get lost!” Roland scolded jokingly. “Also, you’re already 25, and you’re not married yet.”

“I’m not in a hurry!” eli smiled as well and left the room.

He was really not in a hurry.

With regard to Roland’s matter, Eli could not help.

But when Eli answered home, he realized that there was already a huge pile of materials in the house, three to five times more than what he usually bought, all of which were gifts from Roland.

“Really, he should look after himself first!” eli looked at the materials in front of him and shook his head, his emotions a little complicated.

Putting away the materials, Eli returned to his room.

In his heart, he was prepared to see if he could do anything during this trip to the Lorraine kingdom.

...

Three days later.

It was a sunny day.

A huge convoy had already gathered in a manor in the suburbs. Just by looking at it, it was estimated that there were more than a hundred people. The carriages were parked in a random and orderly manner, and some of them belonged to various forces.

Not far away, there was a large number of carriages pulling unknown goods.

Knights and grand knights were riding on horses, giving off powerful auras. There was also a group of soldiers who were ready to set off at any time.

The carriage in the lead belonged to Alina’s family. The count was dressed in noble clothing and was standing at the very front of the group, a person reporting something to him.

“Is everyone here?”

“Lord marquis, everyone has arrived.”

“Then let’s go.” the marquis nodded and got into the carriage.

After receiving the order from the marquis, the moment they left, someone started to direct them. In just a few minutes, a long line of carriages started to move, turning into a long dragon and moving towards the main road.

And off they went.
