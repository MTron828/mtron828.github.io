66 Ruins of the Empire

“The Empire’s ruins?”

Even when Eli heard the news from Clement, he still found it strange.

There was actually a scholar who specialized in researching and looking for the location of a ruin.

“Don’t be so surprised. This Empire’s ruins are not simple.” In the carriage, scholar Clement glanced at Eli. The two of them were on their way to the research team.

Scholar Clement had gotten some information from his old friend in advance and knew some details. The master and disciple were randomly assigned to a research group about the ruins of the Empire.

The main purpose was to find and verify the authenticity of the Empire’s ruins.

Speaking of these ruins, it wasn’t that long ago, about two hundred years ago, but it had a very long History. At that time, the Lorraine Palace wasn’t the Lorraine Kingdom yet, and it was occupied by an Empire called the Olisen Empire.

Later on, the kingdom was destroyed by bryne. Before its destruction, the king of the Olisen empire had hidden most of the empire’s treasures and treasures.

As for where it was hidden, not many people knew. This was also the mystery of the ruins.

It was only after that that the Lorraine Kingdom was established and continued to this day.

This research project was founded by a Grand scholar of the Lorraine Empire more than a decade ago. At that time, the Queen also paid a lot of attention to it. Scholars from all over the country, historians, and even geographers participated in it.

It caused a huge sensation in the Kingdom’s academic world. At that time, there were hundreds of people participating in this project at the same time. Every year, the Empire would also provide a large amount of financial support.

“What did they find?” After getting a general understanding of the subject, Eli asked curiously.

“What do you think?” Scholar Clement rolled his eyes at him.

Eli also patted his head. What a stupid question. If he really found it, why would there be a research project? Was he infected by Herman?

“Speaking of which, when my friend told me about this, he said that it would definitely be a surprise for us!” Clement added, a little curious.

On the other hand, Eli had a faint feeling that something was wrong.

“We’re here, scholars!” The carriage stopped as well. Eli and scholar Clement exchanged a glance. Scholar Clement stepped out of the carriage first, and Eli followed closely behind.

The two of them got off the carriage and looked at the scene in front of them. Then, they fell silent at the same time. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They were no longer in the city but on a small, isolated road in the East of Duoling. There were low-rise buildings everywhere, and the highest was only two stories high. Most of them were in bad shape.

They were left on this Street, in the middle of the road. Looking around, there was no so-called project team.

Scholar Clement looked at the ground, which was mixed with stone and mud, and asked, “Where is the project team?”

“Teacher, over there!” The sharp-witted Eli had already discovered the target of their trip.

A worn-out sign hung between the walls of two nearby buildings. A hemp garment waiting to dry was hung on the sign, and through the garment, one could faintly see a few large words on it.

The Empire’s Ruins.

Clement and Eli looked at each other and understood what the surprise was.

“Let’s go and take a look. Maybe it’ll be much better inside.” The corner of scholar Clement’s mouth twitched as he consoled himself.

The two of them walked into the alley and tried to ignore the garbage and the running rats. At the end of the alley, they saw a passage that led underground.

Without a doubt, this was their destination.

As a student, Eli politely gestured for the teacher to enter first.

Scholar Clement took a deep breath and strode into the narrow and dark entrance.

Inside, it was a small basement with dim lights. There was a huge table in the middle, surrounded by bookshelves with all kinds of maps and documents.

As for the researchers, there were three of them.

One of them was buried in a pile of maps, looking for something. Another one was lying on the mountain of books, studying something with his head lowered. The last one had his eyes closed as if he was thinking about life.

Eli and scholar Clement looked at each other again.

This project seemed to be a little unabandoned. It was a little unreliable.

“Wow, finally a new person? ”

Suddenly, as if he had heard a sound, the man, with his eyes closed, opened them. When he saw Eli and the other man, his eyes lit up instantly, and he got up in an instant.

“Hello, I’m the person in charge of the Empire’s ruins. Welcome, welcome!”

The man held scholar Clement’s hand and said excitedly.

“Uh, we’re from the bryne empire. we’re here for scientific exchange.” Scholar Clement smiled with difficulty and explained.

“Oh, I remember now.” As if he had thought of something, the man revealed a look of sudden realization.

“Wait a minute. I’ll get you a glass of water!” The man explained, then immediately ran to a shelf and looked left and right. After a few minutes, he walked back awkwardly.

“I’m sorry, but we don’t seem to have any extra cups here. If you don’t mind, you can use my cup.” The man was a little embarrassed.

“It’s fine.” the corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. It seemed like this project team was even less important than he thought.

“You guys don’t seem to be in a good situation!” Eli looked around. There was almost nothing new, not to mention the two workers who didn’t even raise their heads.

“Indeed, ever since the kingdom thought that it was a stupid and wrong decision to spend time and energy on this, we have not received a single cent. Scholars also need money, and now, there are only three of us left.” the man shook his head and explained sadly.

” Oh, right, you can call me Ake, a natural scholar. He’s Arthur, a scholar who studies history. This is Vera, a scholar who likes to study maps. But they’re both fanatical, so they might not like to talk and communicate. ” Ake stood there and pointed at the other two as he spoke to Eli and Clement.

That was true. The two of them had been in here for so long, but they had no reaction at all.

“Arthur, Vera!” Ake couldn’t stand it anymore. He finally ran over and pulled the two up.

Arthur was a thin man with dark circles under his eyes, while Vera was a freckled lady. Although she didn’t dress up, her facial features were decent.

“Welcome, welcome.” The two of them were pulled over to greet Eli and Clement.

“I’m eli. This is my teacher, scholar clement! ” Eli introduced as well, and the group got to know each other.

“Welcome to the team!”

After getting to know each other, a smile appeared on Ake’s face while Arthur and Vera returned to their work.

On the other hand, Eli and Clement felt like they had been scammed.
