548 Eli in Action, Alida’s Shock

” No, Sir Eli, spare my life!”

“You can’t kill me, I’ll come back!”

“What’s wrong with me? I just want to live!”

“Eli, you will die one day. I look forward to meeting you again. No, how is that possible? How did you find my phylactery? No, no, spare me!”

Every time Eli walked past a place where the Liches were wreaking havoc, he would hear similar wails, and the Liches soon realized that Eli seemed to be able to find their phylacteries!

..

“How is this possible? Are you sure what you said is true?”

In the bloody city, on an altar, Ruber looked at the Lich in disbelief!

This was Sauron City, one of the cities near the north of the central region. Ruber was once the ruler of this area, a four-circle Radiant Sun Warlock. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

For the sake of his life, he did not care about the law. A few days ago, he had also performed a blood sacrifice to transform himself into a Lich. He had planned to strengthen himself here for a few more days, but he realized that many Liches had fled from here as if they had seen a ghost.

In his bewilderment, he stopped a fleeing Lich.

“That’s right, my lord. Eli has made his move. You should hurry up and run.” The third circle Lesser Lich looked at the four-ringed Lich before him. His body trembled, but his head did not stop looking back.

“You’re lying to me. Eli is alone. How is that possible…” Ruber’s soul fire flickered.

“Sir, have you forgotten that Sir Eli has legendary clones? The continent was now filled with Elis. If an ordinary Lich were to encounter them, they would have no chance of escaping!” the third circle Lich said quickly.

Clone?

Ruber was stunned. It seemed like there really was such a saying.

But it was so exaggerated. How many clones were there that covered half of the continent?

” But you don’t have to be so scared, do you? With the phylactery, you can just commit suicide even if you’re caught. At most, you can spend some time to recover. Why do you look like you’re dead?” Ruber asked again.

“Sir, you don’t know!” The Lich trembled as he said, “Eli actually has a method to counter the phylactery. As long as you are attacked by him, even your phylactery will be found and your original soul will be destroyed!””

“What?!” This time, Ruber was no longer calm.

Not dying was one of the reasons why he had not panicked, but how could Eli have a way to deny that?

Ruber did not stop him. If what the Lich said was true, then he should leave.

But he still couldn’t understand how Eli could find the phylactery!

Even the Warlock Alliance had no way to deal with this!

“Is this Eli’s power?” He shuddered and prepared to leave.

Ah!

However, at this moment, he heard an ‘ah’.

Looking up, the flying third circle Lich in the distance had been covered by a golden light. It was enveloped in it, and its body swayed as it wailed.

In just a few seconds, it completely melted into nothingness.

What made Ruber even more uneasy was that he had a vague feeling that the Lich was gone. In the truest sense, it was gone. The true soul had been destroyed!

How was this possible?

He widened his eyes and turned around, only to find a figure not far away.

“Sir Eli!” His entire body trembled!

However, that figure merely glanced at him, and a ray of golden light flew over. Ruber’s body trembled as he felt his body rapidly being destroyed.

Even with the strength of the Radiant Sun, he couldn’t take it?

He fell into the darkness in despair.

When he woke up again, he was already in an underground area.

Looking at the darkness around him, he knew that he was in a phylactery!

“Eh? It seems to be fine. No, what is this black fog? No, no, no, spare me, spare me, Sir Eli, I was wrong. Please spare my life. I was bewitched!”

A wail sounded, but it quieted down a few seconds later and finally disappeared.

The entire phylactery shattered inch by inch!

Eli stood on top of the city, looking down at the bloody city. He raised his head and looked into the distance. Ten thousand meters away, there were bone wizard towers. He was at the edge of the Lich Tower territory.

” Almost 95% of the Liches have been dealt with. All the Liches above the fourth circle have been wiped out. Only a small number of low-level Liches have escaped. It’s almost over!” Eli’s gaze was calm.

After his hard work, the Lich’s deception was almost over.

However, the impact was too bad. The death toll was probably in the tens of millions.

“But looking at the time, the Lich Tower should have absorbed the occupied land by now. I wonder if I scared you guys?”

Eli shook his head and looked ahead. Then, his body shattered inch by inch, turning into countless specks of light and disappearing into the void.

..

” How is this possible?!”

At this moment, in the Bloodline Tower, Alida was looking at the Warlock with bloodshot eyes.

The Lich Disaster had caused a lot of trouble for the Bloodline Tower these days. She hadn’t slept for a few days. Of course, this didn’t affect a celestial, but the huge pressure gave her a headache.

They had no way to solve it.

Even if the Liches were killed, they would still be reborn in the phylactery. Even if they were much weaker after being revived, they would still cause trouble many times.

The trouble they caused was not any less than when they took back the Warlock Tower!

But just a moment ago, the news about Eli finally came back.

“Milord can restrain liches. Even if they hide in their phylactery, it’s useless.” Alida was excited.

Although she didn’t understand how Eli did it, it was really too shocking.

After all, a Lich’s phylactery was the Lich’s most advantageous method. It had tormented the Warlock Alliance for over a hundred years, but Sir Eli actually had a solution. It was simply ridiculous.

“And he has almost a hundred clones, each of which is no weaker than the fourth circle Glorious Sun. Just how strong is Milord?”She pursed her lips and realized that this was beyond her understanding.

Eli was always refreshing her understanding of the fifth circle.

“As expected of His Excellency!” She sighed deeply.

However, after the shock, her brows gradually furrowed.

Without a doubt, this was just a test by the Lich Tower!

Would they make a move next?

” Not necessarily. Knowing that Sir Eli has a way to restrain them, will they really dare to make a move?” Alida suddenly thought of this and raised her eyebrows.

That’s right. The Lich Tower should be afraid!

Knowing that they had a way to restrain the Lich, the Lich Tower was probably in a mess.

Even the Lich King would not be so calm.

Alida thought!
