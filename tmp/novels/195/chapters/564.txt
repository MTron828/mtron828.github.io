565 Eli’s Power, Changes, and David

“The Bone Dragon Lich is dead!”

“Are you kidding me?”

“Uh, I was just distracted for a moment. What exactly happened?”

On the ground, countless Warlocks were stunned.

The strength of the Bone Dragon Lich had been proven by countless Warlocks with their lives. It was at the peak of the fifth circle and the powerful combat power of a Magus of laws. Even they didn’t expect Sir Eli to defeat it so easily.

At the very least, he would have to experience a difficult battle.

But now?

A few seconds?

Was it over just like that?

It was a little too ridiculous.

Just how strong was he?

“Dead? Is it over?”

“Eh? It must be fake. My eyes must be playing tricks on me.”

On the other side, the Liches were completely shocked. They were confident that they could break through one checkpoint after another. They thought that they could turn the Bloodline Alliance into a flat ground. But it was over before it even started?

How could Eli be so powerful? It was simply illogical!

“It seems that we have underestimated you, sir!” In the distance, a fifth-circle warlock sighed. Everyone nodded in agreement.

When they thought of what they had said earlier, they felt extremely ashamed.

And those who ran away were probably regretting it to death.

Everyone turned their heads and saw that Nikola was controlling a few fifth-circle warlocks, many of whom were stronger than Nikola. However, they did not dare to move at all in his hands. At this moment, they were all dumbfounded!

Eli’s strength had actually reached such a level. Had he been hiding his strength?

After all, he wasn’t this strong decades ago!

He hid it too deeply!

Although they had been captured, they knew that they would be punished in the future. However, they were much happier now. After all, the Bone Dragon Lich was already dead.

Just because they ran away didn’t mean that they wanted to see the Bloodline Alliance get destroyed.

As for the other enemy, what was the point?

If the Bone Dragon Lich was killed so easily, how could the Calamity Lich escape?

Thinking of this, everyone looked towards the battlefield.

..

At the center of the battlefield.

Eli stood calmly in the sky, looking at the slightly trembling Calamity Lich.

“You, you, how can you be so powerful? Who are you?” His voice trembled. He even felt that Eli was no longer Eli but an old monster wearing his skin.

“I am naturally me.” Eli smiled, but his gaze was not on him. Instead, he was constantly sensing his surroundings.

Just as he had guessed, the Lich King was still fine. He might be hiding in the surroundings or even among a group of Lesser Liches.

The six-ringed Eye of Mercury swept across the Liches. Eli looked around and completely ignored the Calamity Lich. This completely infuriated the Lich.

His face was filled with anger as he stared at Eli. “You are very strong, but you look down on Liches too much.”

“Hmm,” Eli answered, but he was still searching.

His gaze swept across the surrounding tens of thousands of meters. Finally, he found a small change in the space 50,000 meters away from the battlefield, verifying Eli’s thoughts.

After finding the enemy, he relaxed a lot. He looked at the Calamity Lich again, but he saw that the Lich was still motionless.

“Aren’t we going to fight?” Eli smiled faintly.

“Hmph, why do you suddenly care?” The Lich took a step back.

What a joke. Words spoken in anger were words spoken in anger. He was definitely not a match for Eli in a fight.

After all, his strength was about the same as the Bone Dragon Lich. How could he be a match for Eli? Running away was the right choice. At least there was hope for survival.

Therefore, in the next moment, he turned around and ran into the distance.

“Trying to run? Hmph!” Eli grunted coldly, and a transparent layer of dimensional power extended for thousands of miles, enveloping the Lich. The Lich only felt that he was running slower and slower. When he finally reacted, he realized that he was actually closer to Eli.

In the next few minutes, the Lich tried all sorts of ways to escape, but to no avail.

This undoubtedly made him despair.

The Liches on the ground looked at this scene and felt bitter.

In the end, the Calamity Lich gave up on escaping. It turned to look at Eli and sighed, “Eli, kill me. You win. I admit defeat!”

The Lich of Calamity admitted defeat and gave up resisting!

Countless Liches and Warlocks watched this scene with mixed feelings.

No one had expected the war to end like this!

Eli’s strength was beyond everyone’s imagination.

Had the Liches lost in the end?

In a secret space, David watched the scene, but he was not angry at all. There was even some anticipation on his face. “It’s over. Kill him, kill him.”

He looked down and saw a wriggling curse that looked like a worm in his hand. It was the remains of the Bone Dragon Lich after its death.

These curses would return to the Lich King after he died.

He could even directly control the life and death of those with the fourth circle and below. Only those with five rings were a little troublesome and had to be killed. That was why he allowed the two Liches to attack him and even pretended to be seriously injured to escape!

As for why he wanted them dead, that was another question.

“It’s over!”

A cold smile appeared on his face, ignoring the howling of someone inside him.

But the next second, his smile suddenly disappeared!

..

In the sky!

The Calamity Lich was surrounded by countless shadows.

Just as everyone thought that he would be killed, rays of light like stars suddenly bloomed in the shadows. A large amount of space began to seal, and Lich’s body gradually shrank as if it was being frozen. In the end, it turned into a small bone statue that looked like amber.

He was sealed!

All the Warlocks present were dumbfounded.

He could have easily killed him, so why did he need to seal him?

” David “, who was hiding in the corner of the space, was also stunned.

How could this be?

How could he seal the Lich of Calamity?

Did he notice? Impossible! Could it have been a coincidence?

He looked at Eli, only to find that Eli was also looking at him. The faint smile on his face worried him that he had been discovered.

“Have we been discovered?” His eyebrows contracted.

He took a step forward and was about to leave, but he stopped.

“No, what if this is a trap?” He shook his head. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

..

“Still not coming out?”

Eli raised his eyebrows. Did he really think that he didn’t see him?

Since that was the case, he would call it out.

He waved his magic staff, and a shadow gradually appeared in his hand. Then, it turned into an arrow and flew into the distance, leaving a black scratch. Then, it pierced into a certain space, producing a violent explosion!

All of this happened in less than a second!

Countless Liches and Warlocks looked over in shock.

They still didn’t understand what had happened!

Looking in the direction of the explosion, a figure slowly appeared from the shadows.

He was covered in white bones, but he was seven to eight meters tall. He wore a gorgeous coat that looked like bear skin, a crown on his head, and rings on his hands.

The liches looked at the figure and were all shocked.

Because this was the former king of the Liches, David.

At this moment, the Lich King’s gaze was fixed on Eli in the sky. He slowly flew toward the battlefield, his voice hoarse, but everyone could hear him.

“Hehe, isn’t this my good teacher, Eli?

“Long time no see!”
