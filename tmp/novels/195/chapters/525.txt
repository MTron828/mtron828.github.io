526 Blood Bamboo Flower Advancing to Fourth Circle

Three hours later.

Eli heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Hill reborn from the withered tree.

At this moment, Hill had completely transformed. However, compared to before she advanced, her height had increased by nearly 400 meters, reaching a height of 500 meters. She was like a tall mountain.

Her branches were dozens of meters thick, and her skin was a faint brown. Wisps of life force were emitted from time to time. On the crown of the tree, countless strips of paper hung down, embellished with green leaves, like a green sea of stars.

The countless life force in it had almost turned into a thin mist that lingered around the surroundings, making it look like a paradise on Earth.

“It’s clearly only a fourth-circle creature, but even I can’t compare to its vitality. What kind of creature is this?” Beside Eli, Phoenix blinked in shock.

When he turned around, he saw a five-headed snake glaring at him.

This aura had reached five rings and actually contained five elements: shadow, fire, water, wind, and rare lightning. It also shocked him.

What kind of strange creatures were around the person he was relying on?

“They’ve all advanced!” Eli glanced at Hill, then at Hydra.

Hydra had gained an additional thunder attribute this time. Its combat strength was not bad at the initial assessment. Once it advanced, it should not be too weak in the budding stage.

As for Hill, she couldn’t be judged by common sense!

“Father, Hill can now give plants below the fourth circle the potential to advance to the fourth circle!”

At this moment, a silver bell-like sound entered Eli’s ears.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Eli’s breathing became heavier and heavier, and the light in his eyes became brighter and brighter.

..

Ten minutes later!

“Father, are you sure you want me to upgrade this to four rings?” Hill looked at Eli curiously.

At this moment, he was holding a bead-like creature in his hand. There was even a blood-red flower growing on it, emitting a bloodthirsty aura. However, it was held in Eli’s hand and did not move at all.

“Yes!”

Eli nodded.

The plant in front of him was the Blood Bamboo Flower, which he had obtained from his travels in the human world more than 2,000 years ago. It helped him a lot during his second circle period.

It had already been bred for countless generations. Eli had once wanted to nurture it to the fourth circle, but its biological shackles had prevented this experiment from succeeding.

Today, Hill had advanced, and he was finally going to fulfill his dream.

Of course, what Eli cared about wasn’t the advancement of the Blood Bamboo Flower. He simply felt that if the Blood Bamboo Flower advanced, the devouring rune would definitely undergo unexpected changes. It might be of great help to him in comprehending the laws!

“Let’s begin,” Eli said directly.

“Alright, then, Father, move back a little,” Hill replied.

Eli retreated.

In the next second, Eli saw Hill slowly hang down a branch. The end of the branch gradually began to change, and a drop of extremely dazzling green liquid slowly condensed.

Eli looked at this scene in a daze.

In the green liquid, he could sense the ultimate life force. It was something stronger than pure life force as if it had endless power.

Was this the power of its transformation?

Drip! Drip!

In the end, the liquid still fell and dripped onto the Blood Bamboo Flower.

Rip!

In an instant, the originally calm Blood Bamboo Flower instantly struggled crazily. Its roots stabbed deeply into the ground, and its height rapidly increased.

Three meters!

Five meters!

..

Ten meters!

In the blink of an eye, the Blood Bamboo Flower grew to a height of ten meters. At the same time, spots gradually appeared on its bamboo-like body. The flowers shrank, and the petals gradually darkened from a faint red color to a blood-red color.

Its aura was gradually rising from the limit of the third circle to the fourth circle.

Eli waited quietly while Hydra and Phoenix waited at the side.

The change lasted for half a day.

Half a day later.

The Blood Bamboo Flower had already advanced to the fourth circle. However, what surprised Eli was that its appearance had gradually returned to the past, but the color of the flower had become much darker.

Of course, Eli didn’t care what it looked like.

He plucked the blood-colored flower in a rude manner, and the silver-white eyes in his eyes lit up in circles, helping Eli see through the phenomenon and see the intrinsic runes inside.

He just stood there motionlessly.

All the creatures were also quietly looking at him without moving.

This change lasted for an entire day, but there was still no change. During this time, Nikola arrived at the Grassi Land and was also surprised, so he waited with the others.

Two days later.

Vivika also joined the team.

Ten days later.

“Ten days!” Vivika muttered to herself as she looked at the statue-like Eli.

“Our Lord must have comprehended something. We don’t want to disturb him!” Nikola glanced at Eli, then at Hydra beside him with hatred. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This fool had actually advanced to the fifth circle before him.

“Comprehension?” Vivika looked into the eyes of the Eli, only to discover that there seemed to be something brewing in them apart from the silver-white light.

It was a thick shadow and a vortex that seemed to devour everything.

“What’s that?”

She blinked her eyes and was about to say something when she realized that the light in Eli’s eyes was getting brighter and brighter, and Eli’s body was moving bit by bit.

“I understand, I understand!”

A murmur came out of Eli’s mouth, and his expression gradually recovered. A ball-like object that was mostly dark but with traces of black fog on one side was taken out.

“Shadow Law!”

Not far away, Phoenix blinked. He did not understand why Ely would have such a high-level item. What was he doing with it?

His mouth slowly opened wide, and his eyes gradually widened.

Kacha!

A crisp sound rang in everyone’s ears.

They stared blankly at a gap in the shadow law, and Eli had just swallowed that part of the shadow into his body as if he had entered a black hole.

” He’s devouring the laws?”

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air as they watched this scene in a daze.

However, they did not dare to stop him. They could only watch as Eli devoured the shadow law bit by bit. He only stopped after devouring almost half of it.

At this moment, a huge tree of laws appeared in everyone’s eyes.

One side of the tree was blurry, but on the other side, countless shadows pervaded the air. Shadow leaves grew like pine trees after a rain. In the blink of an eye, they grew from five to six leaves to dozens, then a hundred…In the end, it grew to a thousand pieces.

“A Thousand Leaves?”

Nikola looked at this scene in a daze.

Even if he hadn’t advanced to the fifth circle, he had heard from Eli that the standard for a thousand-leaf level was 1,000 leaves of the law!

Therefore, at this moment, Eli had already reached the level of a normal peak Thousand Leaves Mage.

And in less than an hour!

Gulp!

He could not help but feel his throat trembling. He turned around and saw that Phoenix was just as shocked as him.

“Who is this person?”

Phoenix mumbled. At the same time, he suddenly felt that he might have been a little hasty in signing the contract.

Was this person in front of him really human?

At this moment, Eli was also gradually waking up. Looking at the shadow law at the side and his own hand, he was a little confused.

“I’ve advanced to the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm just like that?”
