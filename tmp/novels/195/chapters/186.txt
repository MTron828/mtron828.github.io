187 Second Seal

The iris campsite was not a small campsite. Naturally, there were facilities such as prisons. They were usually used to imprison mages who violated the rules or caused major damage.

Very quickly, Tijie brought a mage to Eli.

It was a mage with a long face and an aquiline nose. His face was full of wrinkles, and he seemed to be very old. His head was lowered, and he didn’t say a word. This was normal, but what surprised Eli was that he was a first-circle mage.

There were only a dozen first-circle mages in the camp, and there was one in prison.

“What did he do?” Eli asked curiously.

“my Lord, his life is almost at its end. He sacrificed the apprentices in the camp and a large number of civilians in the kingdom not far away to extend his life. We almost let a few Warlock forces discover our existence, but it also brought huge trouble.” Tijie explained.

“I see!” Eli understood, and this was one of the important reasons why mages were not welcomed in the current world.

Some mages would use all kinds of means to extend their lives, whether it was large-scale soul sacrifices or other bloody means. They would use any means possible, which gave mages a bad reputation.

This bad reputation also influenced warlocks. Therefore, for the warlocks, mages were like the parasites of this world. Therefore, whenever mages were discovered, they would usually be eliminated directly.

This was also the reason why Eli had to hide his identity.

Once his identity as a mage was exposed, just being an honorary representative wouldn’t be enough to protect him. It wasn’t just the White Tower, but many other forces. They wouldn’t let a mage control a Warlock force.

“Then you go first.” Eli signaled that he understood and dispersed Tijie.

As soon as she left, the old man looked up at the young Eli and said slowly, ” you must be the actual master of the camp, Roland.”

“Yes.” Eli didn’t expect the man to speak suddenly.

“Haha, as far as I know, you’re a second-circle mage now, but it’s been at least a hundred years since you last appeared. A second-circle mage’s lifespan is only three to four hundred years. How long do you have left? ” The old man’s eyes were burning as he looked into Eli’s eyes. “I have many ways to offer sacrifices and even other ways to prolong your life. Although the process may be a little bloody and violent, I don’t think a real dark mage would care about these things.”

The old man’s voice was soft and slow as if he was trying to tempt him. If Eli was an ordinary Mage, he might really be tempted.

Eli looked calm and even wanted to laugh.

He stood at the side, quietly watching the old man jabbering on about his life-prolonging plan. His tone was sometimes intense and full of madness, even dancing with joy.

A few minutes later, the old man raised his head and saw a calm-looking Eli with a surprised expression.

That shouldn’t be the case!

According to his estimation, Roland had at most a hundred years to live. Was he not in a hurry at all?

“Sigh, you’ve already deviated from the path of pursuing the truth.” On the other hand, Eli looked at the old man with a face full of pity. His excessive pursuit of extending his lifespan had already caused him to lose his original path.

Fortunately, it had nothing to do with him. He could understand the sadness of the mortal species, but he could not empathize with them.

It could only be said that everyone had their own sob story.

With a calm expression, Eli stretched out his hand. The man, who had long been under his control, could not resist at all. He could only watch as his head was pinched in his hand.

The second black ring on his arm lit up.

“Ah!”

In an instant, the man let out a scream. He could feel his soul or mental power being worn away at a terrifying speed, or rather, being absorbed.

“How is this possible?”

The man’s will was gradually disappearing. He couldn’t speak and could only look at Eli with a despairing and almost pleading gaze, but to his disappointment, Eli didn’t react at all and even seemed to … Was he intoxicated?

Eli was indeed intoxicated.

As he devoured the man’s mental energy endlessly, Eli could feel his spiritual energy rapidly increasing. It was a wonderful process.

120.

121.

..

125.

A 1st circle mage had increased Eli’s mental power by 5 points. He was now a 2nd circle mage, and even a bottle of blood bamboo flower potion didn’t have such an effect!

It was simply terrifying.

The man was already dead. His face was still filled with fear as if he had seen an evil ghost in the world.

“It’s so ugly!”

Eli thought for a moment, then threw the man into the arcane realm, into the blood bamboo flowers that were crying for food. He would treat it as recycling waste. After that, the bones would become skeletons to fill his army, not wasting a single bit.

‘The actual effect is about 20 to 30 percent better than I thought,’ Eli thought.

So, what Eli had to do next was very clear, and that was to keep absorbing mental power and then increase his own strength, growing in secret.

With that thought in mind, Eli pushed the door open. Tijie was waiting by the door. As she watched the old man disappear, she didn’t ask. As Eli’s slave, she had already guessed the effects of the curse.

“Take me to the prison!” said Eli directly.

“Yes!”

“Yes.” Tijie lowered her head respectfully.

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Within three days.

Eli devoured all the prisoners directly, and his mental power had now reached 135 points. It was not a lot, only an increase of 10 points, but it had only been three days, and there were still a bunch of apprentices left inside.

If he had enough resources, he could even directly increase his strength to the limit of a second-circle Mage.

“Terrifying!”

Eli sucked in a breath of cold air. This demonic method was simply ridiculous. Fortunately, it was his.

...

However, it seemed that the resources in the camp had been used up. After all, this was only a small force, and resources were limited.

There were more people in the White Tower. Perhaps he could think of a way. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although a Warlock’s mental power wasn’t as strong as a mage’s, it was better than nothing. The other problems weren’t a problem. As long as he had it all the time, it wouldn’t be a problem.

He would have to wait until he returned.

Speaking of which, Eli still needed to deal with something.

The second-ring undead, Nikola, was a spirit released by his old friend. A large number of spirits had gathered under Nikola, wreaking havoc in the human countries. To Eli, who had a wisp of Nikola’s soul, this was a huge resource.

The undead were creatures born from a special end with mental power and soul power, which made them the perfect material to be devoured.

When he was done with the camp, he would go to him.

..

The scale of the camp was no longer small, and the problem involved many aspects. Naturally, it was impossible for Eli to manage everything. He only dealt with some core aspects.

The direction of development was one of them. Before he came, Eli had already thought about what to do. His idea was to hope that the camp could gradually move closer to the North.

...

Whether it was to spread or to get in touch with the wizard forces in the North, Eli had to find out the situation of the mage forces in the north first.

As the White Tower grew, there would definitely be friction with other forces in the future. It could be 50 years or even 100 years. It was better to get information as soon as possible so that Eli could make a judgment based on the information.

He had to kill pabulo this time because he had no other choice, but he might not be so lucky every time. Information was of utmost importance.

Tijie naturally followed this order. On the other hand, there were some mages who opposed it, and Eli also showed them who the boss was in a kind way.

Eli’s will was quickly executed one by one, and in the blink of an eye, it was the day of his departure.

“My Lord, aren’t you going to stay for a few more years?” Tijie looked at Eli.

If it weren’t for her master, there wouldn’t be the campsite today, and she wouldn’t be here.

“No. You’ve managed the camp well. These are for you to protect yourself.” Eli casually tossed a few pieces of wizard equipment to Tijie. These were the ones that he usually made when he had nothing to do.

“Thank you, my Lord.” Tijie lowered her head respectfully.

When she looked up again, Eli had already left.

Tijie sighed and wondered when they would meet again.

She might not even be able to live to that time.

“If I want to be valued, I have to do something valuable. I have to work hard to complete my lord’s orders.”

Looking into the distance, she returned to the campsite determinedly.
