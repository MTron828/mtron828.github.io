496 Shock, Completely Ended

Outside the battlefield!

“Lord Eli has lost!”

“How is this possible? How could Milord lose?”

“Is this the end? But we’ve already arrived at the City of Dawn, the final battlefield, and we’ve lost just like that. Did the Heart of the Abyss win this war?”

Hundreds of thousands of Warlocks looked up at the bound body in the sky and felt despair. Some of them even couldn’t help but tremble.

They had never thought that Eli would lose!

But this time, the truth was right in front of their eyes. They had to believe it.

“It’s over.” Vivika, who was standing in the distance, was not too worried. She knew that it was just a clone of Ely. Instead, she should be more worried about her own safety.

“Vivika, if there is a pursuit later, I will take you away.” Nikola looked at her and said.

Vivika nodded.

“It’s over!” At this moment, a murmur was heard. They looked over and saw Luo Ye in a corner not far away. His eyes seemed to have lost hope.

The two of them looked at each other helplessly!

Luo Ye’s goal was undoubtedly to avenge his teacher, but now that Eli had ” died ” before he even met Nero, there was naturally no way he could take revenge. Furthermore, Luo Ye still did not know that this was Eli’s clone, so he must have felt even more despair.

In the end, Nikola hesitated for a moment and decided to go over and comfort him.

Just as he took a step forward, a cry of surprise came from behind him!

“What’s that!”

“What happened?

He turned his head to look at the battlefield and was also stunned.

At this moment, the trapped Eli suddenly turned into countless destructive light spots and flew toward the City of Dawn in the distance. At the same time, a blood-red light flew out, and all the light spots fused with it.

At the same time, countless shadows turned into thousands of huge shadow hands and flew directly toward the demons in the distance, emitting a cold aura!

The shadow covered the sky and covered the earth. Everyone’s vision turned black.

When they opened their eyes again, all the demons were already firmly bound in the shadows. They struggled crazily and roared with bloodshot eyes, but they couldn’t move.

Bang!

“They’re dead. All the half-step fifth-circle warlocks are dead!”

“What happened?”

“How is this possible?”

Countless Warlocks were shocked by this sudden turn of events.

“F * ck!” Even Vivika and Nikola were gaping in shock. Looking at the familiar blood-red light, the two of them looked at each other and vaguely understood something!

Eli’s main body was there!

At this moment, countless people on the ground were still looking up at the sky. They were waiting for the blood light to be revealed. At this moment, they were also guessing the owner of the blood light, but they did not dare to confirm it because it was too ridiculous and shocking.

“Just right!”

Eli calmly looked at the hundreds of thousands of people on the ground and smiled.

The bloody light around him slowly dissipated, revealing himself. He used the shadow tentacles to pull Nero’s corpse out, and a screen of light that reflected the two of them appeared in the sky.

In an instant, everyone within a few dozen miles could clearly see Eli and the dead people around him.

Eli spoke directly, his loud voice reaching everyone’s ears, “Nero, the original leader of the Heart of the Abyss, colluded with the Abyssal Demons and attempted to break the seal of the Abyss. He sacrificed tens of millions of residents of the City of Dawn to create temporary half-step fifth-circle demons in an attempt to stop me. However, he was eventually discovered by me and killed in the City of Dawn.

“Nero’s crimes were heinous, and the Heart of the Abyss could not escape punishment. Therefore, I, as the Bloodline Tower representative, Eli, will take over all the territories and resources of the Heart of the Abyss to ensure the safety of the Abyss.

“At the same time, this was also a just war, a war to defend the Western Regions!”

With that, Eli flew directly toward the airship at the center of the city.

Everyone stood rooted to the ground as they watched Eli leave. They were still immersed in what they had just heard and the shocking truth.

“So it was Sir Eli who killed Nero and discovered his scheme!”

“That was a clone of the Lord. So the Lord has already infiltrated the City of Dawn. But is a clone that ridiculous? How terrifying!”

“As expected of my lord. He must have encountered a lot of difficulties to have dared to take such a big risk to sneak into the City of Dawn.”

“By the way, is it over just like that? Nero is dead, we won, and the Bloodline Tower won.”

Everyone had different thoughts. They were happy after surviving the disaster, shocked by the victory of the war, afraid of the conspiracy of the Heart of the Abyss, or sympathetic towards the dead humans in the City of Dawn…

But in the end, it all turned into one emotion.

“We won!”

Countless people shouted as tears of excitement flowed out of their eyes!

Eli flew into the central airship.

“Brother Eli.”

“My lord!”

Vivika, Nikola, and many other celestials and warlocks lowered their heads humbly, expressing their respect and deep shock for Eli.

“Get up.” Eli waved his hand and smiled.

However, at this moment, a figure suddenly flashed out from afar and knelt down in front of Eli.

Bang!

Luo Ye’s knees and skull hit the ground at the same time. Tears flowed down his face as he cried, “Thank you, sir. From today onwards, I will follow you!”

At this moment, all of his pain was released. It was a feeling of gratitude towards Eli for avenging him.

Eli gently waved his hand, and Luo Ye was helped up.

He patted his shoulder and said, “You should have your own life. However, the Bloodline Tower’s territory will be very large in the future. I might need some people to help me manage it. Are you willing?”

“I’m willing!”

Luo Ye nodded heavily.

Eli smiled, and so did everyone else present.

After today, the entire Western Region would be in the hands of the Bloodline Tower. Compared to the past, the Bloodline Tower was completely different. It could be called a true first-class force!

Eli looked at the City of Dawn in the distance and sighed.

The war had ended, but there were still many things that needed to be done. The harvest, eliminating the impact of the war, as well as dealing with the relationship with the Warlock Union, digesting the harvest, all of these had to be done one by one!

“It’s over, but it’s also a new beginning!” Eli chuckled and returned to his room to rest.

..

“Damn it, Eli!”

A painful shriek rang out as the Demon Heart Queen tore everything in the hall into pieces in anger. A terrifying aura seeped out of the palace and killed all the demons within a hundred miles!

“You ruined my plan and didn’t even let me speak.”

Demon Heart Queen felt her heart throb. This was the first time she had felt such pain in thousands of years.

“I will definitely go back, definitely.”

She gritted her teeth and said angrily, “Next time, I’ll squish your head and finish what I’m about to say!”

“Aaaaaaah!”

“How can this be!”
