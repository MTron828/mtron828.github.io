The Sofia mountains.

Located on the west side of the coast was the largest mountain range in the vicinity. There was no other mountain range like this one. The continuous mountain range rose and fell as if there was no end to it. It was said that after passing through this mountain range, one would be able to reach the core of the warlock world, the most prosperous area, the central continent!

Above the mountain range was a boundless sea of clouds, a vast expanse of white.

At this moment, a five-meter-long Giant Eagle was flying in the boundless sea of clouds.

Suddenly, it seemed to have sensed something and turned its head back.

The next second, the giant Eagle let out a cry of horror and quickly descended to the ground!

Behind him, the sea of clouds churned, accompanied by a buzzing sound.

A huge creature flew out of the sea of clouds.

The creature had the appearance of a whale, but its size was at least several times that of an ordinary adult whale. It was more than 100 meters long, and there were many exhaust holes on the outside of its body. Its body was green on the top and white on the bottom.

At this moment, streams of air spurted out from the row holes on both sides, stirring up the sea of clouds.

Even a single hole was much larger than the giant Eagle.

The giant Eagle descended rapidly, its eyes fixed on the huge creature.

It had never seen such a huge creature in his life.

There seemed to be something on it, and the Eagle decided to take a look.

It increased its speed, distancing itself from the enormous creature, but its altitude was still rising. After a few kilometers, it was finally at the same level as the whale.

There was a castle on top of the whale.

It was a magnificent black stone castle with a Gothic appearance. The tip of the castle was high and inserted into the sea of clouds. The tower was connected by dozens of chains, which were connected to the whale’s back!

There seemed to be someone inside!

Suddenly, it saw a stream of Fire Fly out from the castle. The scorching flames contained explosive energy, and in an instant, the second circle Giant Eagle disappeared in flames.

“Ah, so boring!”

Luo ye watched the Eagle disappear, and the flame on his fingertip slowly disappeared.

He was on the balcony of the castle. There was a table and some delicious food on the balcony.

“Luo ye, it won’t be boring when we reach the West Coast.”

In front of him was an old man who was currently holding his beard.

“I hope so.” Luo ye stretched his body.

He didn’t look old at all. Instead, he looked like a young man. He had black hair, but his eyes were red as if they contained explosive flames.

“Well, since you’re the one who requested this operation, we’ll be responsible for protecting you. I hope we won’t come back empty-handed this time!” Hall continued to stroke his beard and said calmly.

“Yes, I also found this map in a mechanical relic. I think it will definitely be useful.” Luo Ye’s eyes were serious as he took out a map.

The yellow map seemed to be in ruins, but some places were still clearly recorded on it.

“according to the records, the sky City and the city of machinery seemed to be in contact, and then the city of machinery transported something to the West Coast. I think there’s a high possibility that they are connected.” Luo ye said.

“I hope so. Otherwise, we’ll have to waste a few more years on this mission!” Hall said with a smile.

This time, in order to protect this genius, the Holy tower had sent dozens of third-circle warlocks, including a few half-step celestial.

“It won’t!” Luo ye shook his head. He would not have come here if he was not confident!

He looked back and saw dozens of third circle warlocks in the castle. With these people, the journey should not be too difficult.

“Oh, right. Have you contacted the Holy tower branch here?” He suddenly turned his head and asked.

“Not yet, but I contacted Woox more than ten years ago. Everything is normal.” Hall said.

“That’s good!” Luo ye nodded. “It’s just a dozen years. Nothing will happen.”

“Hey, I got a message!” Suddenly, Hall took out a crystal ball.

“What?” Luo ye raised his head.

“The Holy tower is ready to welcome the arrival of the Lords!” Hall said with a smile.

Luo ye also smiled.

He slowly stood up and looked forward.

“speed up. I hope we can arrive as soon as possible!”

“Alright!”

A few seconds later, with a cry, the huge sky cloud whale sped up and flew forward.

..

The bloodline tower.

In the meeting room!

Eli, Vivika, Alice, and Udo sat together in a circle with serious expressions.

“Udo, tell us the situation,” asked Eli as he looked at Udo.

Udo took a deep breath. He was currently in charge of the Holy tower’s area, but this incident had really left him a little confused.

The Holy tower branch had just been destroyed, and then the higher-ups of the Holy tower came!

What the hell was this?

“My Lord, the person who came this time is called Luo Ye. It is said that he found a relic in a ruin. After studying it, he found a map of the West Coast and is ready to explore it! Wu duo said.

“Luo Ye? The top genius?” Eli raised his eyebrows.

“It’s said that Luo Ye is very extraordinary. It’s said that he fused with a top-tier four-circle bloodline, the high-grade bloodline of the lava Fire Monkey, the Hellfire monkey. He’s very talented and is now at the limit of third circle. He’s not far from breaking through to the celestial realm and has the potential to inherit the position of the Holy tower’s master. Of course, he’s still far from my Lord!” Udo looked at Eli and said.

“Did they say how many people they had?” Vivika asked.

“About thirty of them, but the weakest one is at the late stage of third circle. There are three or four half-step celestial warlocks among them. I heard that Luo ye’s combat power is comparable to a half-step celestial!” Udo was under a lot of pressure.

If this group of people came and discovered that the Holy tower had been destroyed, then wouldn’t he be finished?

“It seems like the central continent is indeed stronger!” Eli sighed.

The people who came this time were almost comparable to all the top combat forces on the former West Coast, and this was only a part of the combat power of the main force!

“Sir, this is a map projection. They asked us to look for it first!” Udo suddenly took out a branded map.

Looking at the map, Eli and Vivika both had subtle expressions on their faces.

Because this map was exactly the same as Eli’s.

“Teacher …” Vivika said with a frown. She looked at Eli, but he actually smiled.

...

“It’s the same!” Eli chuckled. He was just worried about who would be the scouts for him, and these people had arrived.

They were just a bunch of third circle warlocks, and there was no need to panic.

However, he still had to think about how to deal with this group of people. After all, the Holy tower had just been subdued by them!

He fell into deep thought. Ten seconds later, he raised his head and looked at Udo. Udo’s head was lowered, and his forehead was covered in sweat!

“Udo, you seem to be very worried?” Eli said.

“My Lord, please don’t joke around. How could I not be nervous? After all, the Holy tower has been destroyed!” Udo raised his head, his expression bitter. He still didn’t know what to do!

“Was it destroyed? Don’t we still have you, the tower master of the Holy tower?” Eli looked at Udo.

“Me, the Holy tower’s master?” Udo blinked, not understanding what he meant.

But Vivika, who was beside him, already understood. She looked at Eli and asked, ” could it be that teacher wants Udo to simply pretend to be the Holy tower’s tower master and deceive that group of people? ”

“What do you mean?” Eli’s tone was strange. “Didn’t Udo take over the position of the Holy tower’s master after Woox died of natural causes?”

Upon hearing this, Udo’s eyes widened.

He seemed to understand Eli’s meaning.

This was going to be a big show, and his role would be the Holy tower’s tower master.

“It seems like you understand what I mean!” Eli looked at the few of them and said, “when the time comes, you can place these people in a certain area. Now, I will temporarily modify the memories of the people in this area!”

Eli pursed his lips, and a silver-white light flickered in his eyes.

This kind of thing was not very difficult for him at the moment.

The other three looked at each other. He had altered the memories of hundreds of people.

Was this something a Warlock could do?

However, it was Herman. That seemed reasonable!
