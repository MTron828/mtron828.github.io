51 List

On the other side, when marquis Alina got home, he lay on the sofa. Although he had recovered from the poison a few years ago, he had some minor problems, such as getting tired more easily than before.

“Father, this is the name list given by the king!”

At this moment, Alex walked in. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Compared to more than three years ago, he was also more mature. He was much older than Eli, already 26 years old, and was already engaged to another Marquis’ daughter.

Actually, many of the people that eli knew were engaged or even married. Kurt got married when he was nineteen, and Eli wasn’t even invited.

Herman and Alex were also about to get married. Even Klein and Alice, whom he had met once before, were already married. Of course, they didn’t invite Eli to their wedding.

Speaking of which, scholar clement had told eli many times to find a girl to marry, but it seemed like eli didn’t have that plan.

There was also Rias, who seemed to be single at the moment. She had left the library and returned to the Gimori family. It was said that she would leave Junlin and head to the fief given to her by the count.

“Oh, is it the list of people who will be coming with?” Asked Marquis Alina.

At the moment, Alex had already taken over many of the family’s businesses, and Alina was also working hard to groom Alex into an outstanding heir in his remaining time. As such, there were many things that Alex was actually doing for him.

” yes, the king just sent it over. ” Alex nodded and handed over a document.

Marquis Alina took the document, opened it, and took out a few pieces of paper. On the paper was a list of the trip.

[ nobles: marquis Alina, count Ivan, count Gimori ]

[ Knights: great knight Haworson (Imperial Knight Academy), great knight Leighton (Imperial Royal Knights Regiment), great knight…, great knight Abaddon (Imperial Knight Academy) ]

[ other members: Robert (Imperial monastery, doctor), Hila (Imperial Library, scholar) ]

With just a glance, there were dozens of main members. if these people also brought students, followers, and the like, there might be more.

“There are too many people.” marquis Alina shook his head. If things went as they were now, there would probably be hundreds of people. They were going on a diplomatic mission, not to fight a war.

“Get rid of these people.” He was also the screening staff and removed some unnecessary personnel.

“Then, father, do you want to change some people? The manager of the cross Chamber of Commerce wants to participate in this event, and he has paid a lot.” Alex said.

“Alright,” he said. Marquis Alina nodded and added one more person.

Alex was going to be the leader of the family in the future, so he didn’t mind giving him some authority.

He was very clear that although it was diplomatic relations, the benefits involved were too great. Among the characters he had just deleted, who knew how many of them he had already offended by removing them?

How many people still wanted to squeeze in?

“Oh, right.?” as if he suddenly thought of something, marquis Alina picked up a pen and deleted Hila (imperial library, scholar).

“Father, Hila seems to be the youngest scholar in the empire at 26 years old. She has also made several suggestions for this mission. She is knowledgeable and has a certain reputation. It is not good to delete her like this. ” Alex said.

Upon hearing this, Marquis Alina glanced at him and said, “We’re going to make a diplomatic trip. The situation outside is complicated, and she’s too young. We need an experienced old scholar.

“Do you understand?”

Alex was about to say something, but he suddenly thought of something, and he paused for a moment before saying, “I understand.”

“Then who do you think is the most suitable?” Marquis Alina asked again.

“In terms of qualifications, I think scholar Clement is very suitable.” this time, Alex said firmly.

“yes, you’re right.” marquis Alina pretended to think for a moment and then agreed.

With a few words, the two of them deleted a famous scholar in the empire and replaced him with scholar clement.

As for a reason, there was naturally no need to explain.

So what if there was nepotism?

The king had already given him the power anyway, so it was up to him to do what he wanted.

As for who Hila was, it had nothing to do with him. She was just a scholar who did not meet his requirements.

…

Naturally, Eli didn’t know about the conversation between Marquis Alina and Alex.

As usual, he was preparing for the upcoming learner’s test.

“Four years, and another four years. This time, I must become a learner.” Eli walked on the road.

He didn’t really want to become a scholar, but if he could become a scholar, he would have an additional five days of leave every month, half of his workload, and a salary increase.

How could he reject this?

The test was naturally a cinch for Eli. When the time came, he would probably just casually do it, and he would be done for. There was not much difficulty, to begin with.

“It’s Herman who’s in trouble this time.” Eli shook his head.

Herman had only started learning from his teacher a year earlier than eli, and it had been almost nine years since then. He was 25 years old, the same age as eli, and the average age to become a learner was actually 30 years old. This also showed how amazing it was for hila to become a scholar at 26 years old.

Even now, eli still remembered that scholar clement had said that he knew Eli would become a scholar within four years. It was only later that he found out that he had said the same thing to Herman and Kurt. The man said the same thing to every one of his students.

“A peaceful life!”

Eli sighed.

In fact, his life was really very plain. His main life was work and experiments.

…

The news that the marquis had confirmed the list quickly spread.

As the name list was submitted, some people already knew who was on the list. Many people felt heartache when they saw it. They had clearly spent money, but they still did not get on the list.

At the same time, in a villa, a woman was looking at the letter in her hand, her eyes full of surprise.

The woman was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old. She had a good face and was wearing a black scholar’s uniform. Although it was large, it was not difficult to see the curvaceous figure under it.

At this moment, she was sitting in the living room, which was filled with all kinds of books. It was like a sea of books. When the woman sat in it, she had a fusion of knowledge and sexy beauty.

However, the beauty was frowning at the moment.

The letter that had just arrived told her that she had been squeezed out of the tour and that she had been replaced by an unknown scholar.

It was worth noting that the imperial library involved more than just librarians. Some scholars did not necessarily work in the library. They might work at home, as vassals of the nobles, or even in the palace.

“Scholar clement? Who is this?”

The empire’s newly promoted scholar, Hila, frowned and asked.
