301 Vivika Departs

A year passed in the blink of an eye.

To Eli, this year had been uneventful.

In the past year, Eli had learned a lot of mechanical knowledge from Doggo, and his reserves in this area had rapidly increased. Also, because of the things he had discovered in the ruins regarding the study of souls, he had also made some progress in his preparations for the soul runes. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Relying on this, Eli created a new spell.

Great soul imprint.

Once it was engraved into the soul, no matter how far away they were, they could still communicate. As long as the soul was still there, the incantation mark would not dissipate. It could be considered as the sublimation of Eli’s soul brand that relied on the past!

Eli branded Vivika and Nikola with this spell.

In the past year, Eli and Luo ye had sent several messages inviting him to the Holy tower headquarters, but he was rejected every time. After that, he never mentioned it again.

And from Luo ye’s words, it seemed that the box had caused a lot of trouble!

..

In the central continent.

The central continent was divided into five main regions: the eastern region, the southern region, the Western Region, the northern region, and the central region.

And the one closest to the West Coast was the Western Region!

The bloodline tower’s main tower, the Holy tower, and many other forces were located here.

At this time, in the Holy tower headquarters, on a huge mountain, a negotiation was going on.

“Everyone, I don’t think my harvest this time has anything to do with you. If you want to take a share, then you’ve provoked the wrong person!” Luo ye said as he looked at the crowd.

The moment he returned, the news was somehow leaked, and almost at the same time, many forces came to him.

“Ah, young tower master Luo ye, you know very well that if all of this is really related to that Mage tower, you can’t keep everything to yourself!” A Warlock stood up and looked at Luo ye.

“Indeed,”

“That’s gray Mage Tower!”

The representatives of the various forces discussed animatedly and were overbearing.

“Detestable!”

Looking at this scene, Luo ye gritted his teeth, and anger appeared on his face.

They were too f * cking shameless!

At this time, a person suddenly ran over from a distance and came to Luo ye’s side. “Lord Luo ye, the tower master asked you to share the box. All the forces will study it together!”

Luo ye’s face darkened. He knew that his teacher must have made some deal with these forces, and his teacher probably didn’t think that his harvest could really have anything to do with the gray Wizard Tower.

But he really felt that he might be able to gain something this time.

However, since his teacher had spoken, there was no need for him to insist.

“Alright, I’ll share it with everyone!” Luo ye didn’t say anything and directly threw the box in the center of the field.

Looking at the box with three locks, everyone’s eyes lit up.

“However, this box requires at least a level 3 mechanic knowledge to open. I don’t have any other ideas. Which of you has a way? ” Luo ye’s voice came.

“Leave this to us!”

One of the representatives chuckled.

Luo ye’s expression was ugly.

In the blink of an eye, a week had passed, and that clamoring force had actually found a mechanical Alchemist. It was said that they had paid a huge price.

Soon, The Alchemist arrived.

The Alchemist spent ten days opening the lock, and in these ten days, everyone stayed here, anxiously waiting to open the lock. Even Luo ye was no exception.

Soon, with a click, the third lock was opened.

Everyone’s eyes were focused on it, and they saw what was inside.

A stone.

Everyone’s eyes widened when they saw the stones inside.

What was going on?

Why was there a stone in the box?

“Holy tower, you actually deceived us? ” A Warlock looked at Luo ye angrily and shouted.

The others also raised their heads, revealing angry expressions.

The Holy tower was treating them like monkeys!

Luo ye looked at the things inside, and his heart skipped a beat!

Stone?

How could it be a stone?

Luo ye looked at the crowd with great confusion and said, ” I don’t know what happened, but I brought this box back from the West Coast!”

“Hmph!” One of the warlocks sneered and turned to leave.

The other warlocks didn’t say anything good either. Luo ye had completely taken them for fools.

Since the Holy tower had such an attitude, there was no need to talk!

..

...

“What? There’s a war in the Western Region of the central continent?!”

It was a year later when Eli received another message from Luo ye.

From the letter, he learned that because of the box, many forces felt that they had been fooled and even felt that it was an insult, so they started a big war with the Holy tower.

In this war, the Holy tower suffered heavy losses.

However, Luo ye later proved that the box he brought back was true. He confirmed it through some method, and many forces believed it.

However, the commotion caused by this was not small.

For example, many forces decided to give up on the exploration of the West Coast.

They believed that after this exploration and the efforts of the past few hundred years, the possibility of finding clues here was extremely low. Moreover, due to some previous incidents, the losses of various forces were not small, so they decided to take back their forces.

They would still be stationed on the West Coast, but they wouldn’t pay too much attention to this place. If anyone in the branch was willing, they could even apply to go back to the headquarters in the central continent!

However, when they contacted their respective forces, they realized that the West Coast was different from what they had expected.

Most of their forces had actually disappeared, leaving behind only a few small forces.

...

And during this process, Eli received Luo ye’s invitation again.

He was invited to go to the central continent.

This time, there was no reply from Eli.

He realized that the West Coast might be changing soon.

But what Eli didn’t expect was that the first one to find him was Vivika.

..

“Teacher, I’m preparing to leave the West Coast and head to the central continent!”

Vivika looked at Eli, her eyes filled with determination.

“Sure. What’s your plan?” Eli looked at Vivika.

Because of her bloodline, Vivika still looked as beautiful as ever, but it could be seen that her demeanor was far from what it used to be. If you think about it carefully, she was nearly 800 years old!

“Teacher, my lifespan is reaching its limit. Other than breaking through, I have no other choice!”

Vivika looked at Eli and said.

“I understand. You can go.” Eli looked at Vivika, indicating that he understood.

On the West Coast, Vivika probably wouldn’t have a chance to break through, but if it was the central continent, there might be a chance. Even if the chance was small, she still wanted to fight for it.

“Thank you, teacher!”

Vivika gave a deep bow to Eli and then took her leave.

Looking at her back as she left, Eli was also filled with emotions.

She had finally reached this step!

..

As time passed, the bloodline tower changed. Vivika’s student Aisha gradually took over Vivika’s position, and Vivika began to prepare.

But what surprised Eli was that this time, apart from taking some resources with her, Vivika was also taking the descendants of Bryne’s family, who seemed to have been moved to the bloodline tower area by Vivika a long time ago.

Eli was a little confused too, but he didn’t ask.

After all, who didn’t have their own secrets? Vivika was his student, not a slave!

A year had passed.

An airship took off from the bloodline tower, bringing Vivika and a large number of people away from the West Coast, heading for the center of the world, the central continent!

Eli didn’t send Vivika off.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to, but Vivika didn’t seem to want to be sad to part with Eli, so she left in secret.

But she left a letter to Eli!
