Chapter 49: Crushing

On the other side, Herman and scholar clement had already left, and eli had returned to the library alone.

In the previous interrogation, as well as the evidence left in her body, he was very certain that Windsor was a liar, a repeat offender at scamming money.

There was naturally a reason why he had given a warning instead of directly attacking.

First, they were in Jun Lin city, which was a little inconvenient. Also, if someone died, it would be too cruel for Herman, and he was sure that she had accomplices, which would be even more troublesome.

!!

Secondly, her goal was money, so Herman would be fine for a while.

“Let’s see if she knows what’s good for her.” Eli shook his head.

The best-case scenario would be for Windsor to leave on her own.

Of course, if she really didn’t want to leave and did something irrational, eli wouldn’t mind doing something.

Following the path, Eli quickly returned to the library.

On the second floor of the library, in the office, Eli saw the teacher, but not Herman.

However, when he saw scholar Clement’s speechless expression, he knew what had happened.

” Herman left, but he still thought that he had found his true love! ” Scholar Clement said, speechless.

“Oh.” Eli nodded. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Eli was already very sure, but scholar Clement probably had his own thoughts as well. After all, he was shrewd. Scholar Clement was almost 60 years old, so he was naturally someone who had seen many storms.

“The Imperial Police Department is closed today. I’ll look for her myself tomorrow!” As a teacher, Clement naturally wouldn’t let Herman enter the fire pit.

As for the empire’s police station, it was similar to a police station.

“Mm, don’t bother about this matter. If something really happens, there might be someone else behind this Windsor. You won’t be able to handle it!” scholar clement added.

Eli nodded.

“Don’t worry. We didn’t provoke Windsor. They won’t make a move for a while, so we still have plenty of time!” Scholar Clement comforted.

…

That afternoon, a cry of surprise came from scholar clement’s office.

“What? Herman is missing?”

In the room, scholar clement looked at the library staff in front of him in surprise.

It turned out that Clement was still worried, so he sent someone to look for Herman in the afternoon. However, after searching the whole house, he still couldn’t find him.

“The Imperial Police are already off work at this time. They definitely wouldn’t send out people for someone who’s not sure if he’s missing.” Clement mumbled.

The truth was that the people couldn’t rely on the imperial police.

“No, I have to do something.” Scholar Clement seemed to have realized something and immediately walked out of the door.

Among the people who cared about Herman, scholar Clement was definitely one of the tops.

But before he could walk out, he turned around and said to Eli, who was raising his head not far away, ” Eli, you go back first. Go back and wait for the news.”

Eli was there to help with work.

However, he also had a strange expression on his face at the moment.

He had warned her in the afternoon, and now she was taking action in the afternoon. She looked down at him.

Or did Herman volunteer himself to her?

“Alright, teacher!” But Eli still said to Clement.

As he spoke, Clement had already left the room, and so did Eli.

As he walked out of the door, he closed his eyes and tried to sense Windsor’s location.

When he returned in the morning, it wasn’t really just a warning. Similarly, without making a sound, he also left a spiritual imprint on Windsor so that it would be easier for Eli to find her.

At this moment, she was in a house in Jun Lin city.

She had completely ignored his warning.

He was a little angry.

…

In the Western part of Junlin city.

This was a slum area that was about to be abandoned. It was said that it was going to be demolished and rebuilt, so there was almost no one here at the moment. There were dilapidated houses everywhere.

At this moment, there were three people in a relatively intact courtyard.

However, two of them were standing, while the last one was unconscious and tied to a chair.

” David, is this really okay? I really feel that something is wrong,” Windsor said to David with a conflicted expression.

After hearing Eli’s warning, she was really scared, so she returned to the tavern and informed David to get ready to leave. Although David was upset, he agreed to leave.

However, they didn’t expect Herman to show up just as they were about to leave.

Perhaps due to his ferocity, David actually suggested tying Herman up and demanding he gives up the proof of ownership. He would then sell the proof to the black market before leaving.

“Don’t hesitate. We’ve already done it. As long as we get the deed, we’ll kill this guy and sell him. We’ll leave after that. I’ve already contacted the black market.” David said. After all, he was the backbone.

“But who would dare to take it?” Windsor hesitated.

“Hmph, who do you think is behind the black market? they don’t care.” David snorted coldly.

Upon seeing that David was a little unhappy, Windsor didn’t dare to say anything.

“Don’t worry. We’ve done this seven or eight times, and we’ve never failed. Just a warning and you’re so scared. Hmph, it’s just that that man is not here. If he were, I would’ve killed him!” David seemed to like Windsor as well, so he consoled her.

Windsor nodded and stopped struggling.

“oh? Who would have you killed?”

Suddenly, a voice rang out in the quiet courtyard.

David and Windsor froze at the same time and turned to look.

Not far away from the broken gate, a man in black clothes and holding a cane slowly walked in.

“Eli!” Windsor’s eyes widened as if she couldn’t believe that she was seeing this person.

David, on the other hand, looked at eli cautiously as he walked in, his eyes wandering in other directions.

“Not a bad place, a good place to do bad things,” Eli commented on the small courtyard as if he didn’t see the two of them.

“How did you find this place?”

At some point in time, David had already picked up the Knight’s longsword that he had brought along in advance and was looking at Eli with a serious expression.

“You’re nervous? Don’t be nervous. I’m alone.” As if seeing David’s tensed muscles, Eli smiled.

David felt wonderful at that moment.

At first, he was still very nervous, but when he saw that Eli was really alone, his mood became a little better. However, he found it strange that Eli was so calm.

‘you’re just an ordinary person. Who gave you the courage to come here?’

David also knew that he had no other choice but to kill Eli. Therefore, he got ready without any hesitation or nonsense. His muscles tensed up quickly, and he held his longsword tightly in his hand.

The next second, he suddenly attacked.

He stomped on the ground, and the terrifying power directly caused a small pit to appear on the ground. He brandished his longsword and slashed at Eli. He had used this attack to cut off the heads of many enemies before.

Today was no exception.

“Go to hell!” David grinned.

But the next second, he was stunned.

Just as he was a few meters away from Eli, a wall of wind suddenly appeared, blocking his longsword. Then, he saw the man pick up his cane and glance at him.

Then, as if his head had suffered a heavy blow, he instantly felt dizzy and was directly thrown into the air by the wind wall.

He couldn’t do anything at all in the sky, and he was also in a dizzy state.

However, when he finally regained his consciousness, he saw that a wind blade had already kissed his neck.

In an instant.

Blood splattered all over the sky, and in a daze, David saw his body separate.

“Am I dead?” David’s vision gradually fell into darkness.

With a bang, the two halves of the body fell to the ground.

On the other side, Windsor was already dumbfounded as she watched the scene with her mouth agape.

Was this a demon?

Was there such a power in this world?

Was this the power of a Grand Knight?

Fear instantly enveloped Windsor, and she collapsed to the ground.

“spare me!”

Upon seeing David’s instant death, Windsor begged while trembling.

However, it seemed like Eli didn’t intend to answer her. Instead, he sent a wind blade flying over.

Blood splattered again.

“I’ve given you a chance, and there’s only one chance. ”

Eli walked over slowly, looked at the corpses in front of him, and sighed.
