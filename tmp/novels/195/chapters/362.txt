363 Surrounded the City

After leaving the meeting room, Alida was finally sent back to her own room, which was located in a mage tower in the core area of the city.

She lived on the third floor, while her grandfather lived on the top floor.

However, she did not see Glen until the next morning.

In the morning, she woke up on the familiar bed and felt extremely comfortable. She had lived here for a long time, but there was no joy on her face. There was only worry.

!!

Walking barefoot on the floor, she came to the window and looked outside.

The tall walls of Bloodline City were built on top of the buildings. Warlocks were standing on the walls, each of them wearing tight armor or Warlock leather armor. They held weapons in their hands, and their gazes were serious.

Further out were the Bloodline Tower Warlocks on the plain, with rings and rings of fences.

“The situation is more serious than I expected. “Alida gritted her teeth and left the room. She had to tell Grandpa about the situation in the branch.

She quickly put on her clothes and pushed open the door. She walked out and quickly headed towards the mage tower from yesterday.

Along the way, there were patrolling soldiers everywhere, and more than half of the shops were closed.

Seeing this scene, she felt a little uneasy and sped up.

Soon, she arrived at the wizard tower from yesterday. After showing her identity, she went all the way up.

It was still the same conference room, but this time, it was empty.

Alida’s heart skipped a beat. She ran out of the tower and bumped into someone.

“Margot!” She looked up and saw a familiar face.

“Oh, I finally found you.” When she saw Alida, Margot seemed to heave a long sigh of relief. She held her hand and walked out.” Alida, come with me. Your grandfather wants to see you. ”

Hearing that it was her grandfather who wanted to see her, Alida let Margot hold her hand and asked, “Mag, what happened?”

” Just an hour ago, Jalin of the Manticore Clan arrived. The people of the Manticore Clan are also approaching Bloodline City. ” Margot answered quickly as she walked.

“Is the situation already that bad?” Alida was shocked. The situation was worse than she had expected.

“Yes, your grandfather has already gone to give instructions. We have to hurry.” Margot said.

“Ah, this!” Alida was shocked and said to Margot anxiously, “Then hurry up. I have to see my grandfather as soon as possible. Otherwise, it’ll be too late.”

Margot did not answer this time. She only brought Alida through the crowd, one street after another, at a very fast speed.

“Where are we going?” Alida suddenly said.

As she moved forward, she suddenly realized that not only was she not approaching the city wall, but she seemed to be advancing toward the mountain range behind her.

She immediately broke free from Margot’s hand and looked at Margot seriously, taking a deep breath.

In this situation, perhaps Margot was not trustworthy anymore.

Feeling her hand let go, Margot looked at Alida and said helplessly, “Miss, I’ve watched you grow up. Do you think I’ll harm you? In fact, this is your grandfather’s idea.”

Alida, “…”

“Your grandfather tried his best to send you out, but who knew that you would come back? He knew that it would be difficult for him to survive this time, so he asked me to bring you to the secret passage and leave this place.” Margot said.

Alida was shocked as if she couldn’t imagine being deceived by Margot.

“We can’t win.” Margot bit her lip and looked at Alida.

Their eyes met, and Alida shook her head.” Margot, I understand my grandfather. I really can’t leave this time. I brought reinforcements this time, enough to save the Bloodline Tower. I have to find him immediately. ”

With that, Alida turned to leave, but she was stopped by Margot.

She held a greatsword in her hand and looked at Mag with a serious gaze. “I’m a late-stage third circle warlock. Do you think you can leave this place? This is the last mission that your grandfather and my teacher gave me. I promised my teacher that I would take you away.”

Obviously, Margot didn’t believe Alida’s words.

“Margot, I’m sorry.” Alida gritted her teeth and charged at Margot.

Seeing Alida charge at her, Margot was surprised, but she still held her greatsword tightly with a serious look in her eyes.

Since Alida was disobedient, she would knock her out and take her away.

She swung her sword horizontally and charged at Alida. She raised her sword and slashed down.

However, it was as if Alida didn’t see it. She continued to rush out. Just a few seconds before the collision, she shouted, “Lord Hydra.”

As if sensing that Alida was about to encounter danger, Hydra suddenly opened its eyes, and a shadow instantly surrounded Alida. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The giant swords collided, but the shadow was unharmed. However, Alida had already broken through Margot’s defense.

She took one last look at Margot and left quickly.

Margot stood there in a daze, watching Alida leave without giving chase.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t catch up.

Margot’s hands trembled slightly as she recalled the power just now.

There was no mistaking it. That was the aura of a celestial.

“Alida, what did you bring back?” Margot looked at her back and gritted her teeth.

She recalled that from yesterday until today, it seemed that Miss kept saying that she had brought back reinforcements.

Could it be true?

Margot gritted her teeth.

After hesitating for a moment, she followed. She chose to trust Alida for once.

On the other side, Alida was running when she suddenly saw a figure beside her. It was Margot. Alida was shocked.

” Your grandfather isn’t there. I’ll bring you to him. ” Margot said straightforwardly while Alida smiled.

...

Once again, they were pulled in another direction.

” Miss, ” Margot suddenly said, ” I believe you this time. I hope this isn’t a joke. ”

“I’m telling the truth,” Alida replied solemnly.

She knew why Margot came back. She didn’t want to see the Bloodline Tower destroyed.

Margot nodded.

…..

Soon, they arrived at the city wall of Bloodline City.

Passing through a large group of Warlocks, they arrived at a small tower behind the city wall.

“Your grandfather is among them,” Margot said to Alida.

“Thank you, Margot.” After Alida finished speaking, she walked towards the entrance of the tower but was stopped at the door.

“Sir Clint is discussing something inside. No one is allowed to enter.” Two long swords blocked his path.

...

“I’m Alida, Glen’s granddaughter. I have something important to report. “Alida said.

“Wartime alert, it doesn’t matter who it is.” The Warlock was still determined, and the two Warlocks were actually second-circle Warlocks.

Alida gritted her teeth. At this moment, a huge sword slashed over and knocked the two guards unconscious.

Alida was shocked, but she instantly understood who did it when she saw the greatsword.

Turning around, it was indeed Margot.

“Let’s go in,” Margot said.

There were no more obstacles in the way. Alida pushed open the door and walked in.

There was nothing on the first floor after entering. Alida quickly ran up and soon arrived at the third floor.

There was only one room on the third floor, and she could vaguely hear the noise inside.

She gritted her teeth and pushed the door.

The door opened, and Alida looked inside.

There was a rather large space inside the door. The bright oil lamp lit up the space. There were only about ten Warlocks inside, all of them wearing battle attire. Not far away, Glen seemed to be saying something, but as the door opened, everyone looked at Alida.

“Alida!” Glen was surprised to see Alida. His mouth was wide open as if he was asking why she was there.

The others were also puzzled. This was not a place Alida should be.

“Grandpa, I think there’s something I have to tell you. “Alida said seriously.

“You shouldn’t have come here!” But this time, Glen’s expression was extremely serious as he spoke.

“I know. I also understand that the enemy is coming soon, but I have something to tell you, Grandpa.”

“Go ahead.” Glen sighed deeply, seemingly exhausted.

Alida took a deep breath and said, ” Grandpa, it’s about the west coast branch. The West Coast there has real … ”

Weng! Buzz!

Before Alida could finish, she heard a deafening buzz from outside.

The expressions of the others instantly changed.

The sound meant that the enemy was coming.

Even Glen’s expression changed instantly. He shouted, “Get ready for battle. Go to the city wall!”

Glen walked out and said to Alida, “Protect yourself.”

Glen walked out first, and the others followed closely behind.

Alida closed her eyes in despair. Couldn’t he just let her finish?

“Miss, protect yourself! “A voice came, and Alida saw a figure pass her.

It was the unfriendly Warlock from the other day. He was smiling as he watched Alida leave.

Alida ignored them and quickly followed them out.

Glen flew up the city wall while Alida took the stairs.

As soon as she got to the city wall, she could hear countless noises. The Warlocks were all ready to fight. They were looking into the distance with serious expressions.

Alida followed their line of sight.

In the forest in the distance, Warlocks walked out one after another. There was no telling how many of them there were, like a black ocean.

In the sky, there was a huge Sky Cloud Whale. Its body was more than 100 meters long, floating in the air.

There was a black dot on the huge cloud whale. There were more than a hundred people, and each of them emitted a powerful third-circle aura. They were all standing at the back. At the front of the cloud whale were three Warlocks, one female and two males.

The three of them were led by a female warlock. The woman wore a tight-fitting white robe and a purple gauze hat. She had a slender figure. Although she was far away, Alida still felt an inexplicable pressure. Alida knew who she was. It was the Radiant Moon Warlock of the Manticore Clan, Jalin.

As for the other two Warlocks, one was wearing a grey Warlock robe while the other was wearing a black Warlock robe. They both gave off the same aura of celestial and were Star Warlocks.

“This…” Alida’s throat moved slightly, and her body trembled.

The manticore Family had sent three celestials, including a Radiant Moon Warlock.

The reinforcement wasn’t here yet, so how could they fight?

She glanced at the others not far away.

Her grandfather also had a serious expression on his face, while the other ordinary Warlocks had looks of despair on their faces.

…

On the other side of the Cloud Whale, Jalin calmly looked at the city wall in front of her.

” What a beautiful city. What a pity. ” Jalin said calmly.

” If you like, you can come here often. After today, this place will be ours. The Bloodline Tower will become history. ” The gray-robed Warlock laughed.

“Indeed, what a pity.” The black-robed Warlock nodded.

Jalin looked at the two of them and said, ” Vya, you are a Star-ranked Warlock. Later, you will deal with Glen. Arona will attack the other Warlocks. After the battle is over, go help Arona kill Glen. ”

“Yes.” The gray-robed Vya and the black-robed Alona said at the same time.

At this moment, the Warlocks underground had basically assembled, numbering more than ten thousand people. Among the Warlocks, there were also many large-scale throwing weapons used for long-range attacks. Of course, flying magical beasts were also indispensable.

This time, the manticore was determined to get rid of the Bloodline Tower in one go.

Looking at the team that was ready, Jalin’s eyes were calm, her lips moving slightly.

“Attack!”
