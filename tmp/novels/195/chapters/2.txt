Chapter 3: Quick Memory

Translator: Lonelytree

Eli was stunned for a moment, and it took a few seconds for him to find the relevant information from his memory.

Although the original host of the body was a librarian, he did not seem to be an official librarian. He was just a temporary worker. Every year, the library would recruit many such people and then test them all to keep the suitable ones.

During this time, their salaries were not much.

“There’s still an internship period in this world too?!” This was something that Eli didn’t expect.

After browsing through the memory, he realized that the test was to test some common knowledge and some questions in various aspects. The difficulty was not low, and there was a lot of content. The overall difficulty was quite average.

However, the problem was that the original host had only been in the library for less than a month.

He only knew the general text and had no understanding of the more esoteric things. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In other words, he would definitely be eliminated!

Looking at Eli’s frowning expression, the corners of Kart’s mouth could not help but curve up. He raised his head, and his golden hair fluttered behind him. He said in an extremely despondent manner, “Yes. This time, only two will remain. In the past, three would stay. The test will be difficult. I wonder if I can pass. If I can’t, then I’m done!

“What to do?”

Kart’s tone was worried, and the corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

‘You call that worried?

‘I can’t see any worry in your eyes. It’s clearly joy with a little anticipation and even a little excitement.’

However, this fellow did seem to have the right to say that. In Eli’s impression, Kart seemed to have the most knowledge out of all the temporary librarians, and he always scored first in class.

Although Kart was annoying, it was time for Eli to consider the test.

If he didn’t want to lose this decent job, he’d better pass this test.

As long as he became a full-time employee of the Imperial Library, he might not be able to live a luxurious life, but it would be enough for him to move out of the narrow and dilapidated slum.

However, in just three months, considering that he still had to work every day, as well as other things, it was by no means an easy task to accumulate enough knowledge to pass the test in this period of time.

As for the books, he could only read them occasionally during his breaks in the library. Apprentices like him could not simply ask to borrow books and take them home. The book he had taken home earlier was completely an accident.

‘Wait, there’s a zero-circle spell in that book called Quick Memory.’ Eli suddenly recalled.

According to the notes, if one advanced to a Level-1 apprentice, one could start learning spells.

Quick memory was one of the most basic zero-circle spells in the apprentice stage. It allowed people to memorize knowledge quickly and was one of the basics for sorcerers to learn and master a large amount of knowledge.

On top of that, there was also the 1st rank barrier-free reading, 2nd rank soul reading... And most importantly, this spell was very simple, almost one of the simplest spells. As long as you advanced to a wizard apprentice, you would be able to master it quickly.

The only obstacle was that Eli needed at least half a month to finish reading all the texts for the test. In other words, he only had two and a half months left to become an apprentice.

After becoming an official librarian, he would be very stable. As long as he didn’t commit any crimes, he would almost never be fired. It was very suitable for Eli, who was focused on developing himself.

“So, I’ll advance to a level 1 mage first.” Eli looked at the bookshelf in front of him and made up his mind.

It was almost eight or nine o ‘clock in the morning, and the library’s door slowly opened.

One by one, the gentlemen and ladies walked into the library in neat clothes. Most of them were gorgeous. They had much better clothes than Eli’s linen clothes.

In this era, reading was a luxury. The poor did not have the energy or the money. Only the rich gentlemen and ladies knew how to read.

As for the nobles, they usually didn’t come here. They usually had their own library and would only come here when they wanted to read some books that they didn’t have.

On the other hand, seeing that there was no reaction from Eli after listening to his words, Kart seemed to be a little disappointed. However, when he saw that the library’s door had opened, he could only helplessly give up on the idea of continuing to chat with Eli and turn to leave.

...

Time passed by as people flipped through the book.

The gentlemen who were reading looked at the setting sun outside the library and knew that it was about time. One by one, they handed their books to the librarians around them and left one by one.

Watching them leave one by one, the corners of Eli’s mouth curled up into a smile.

It was a smooth day.

He had done it according to his memory, and there were no mistakes.

Just as he was about to take off his clothes and leave, suddenly, there was a tapping sound. Eli looked over and saw a man in a black robe walking in.

Scholar Clement was the person in charge of the librarian in the library.

He had long brown hair and black pupils. He was holding a thick book in his right hand.

“The temporary librarians, please stay.”

As he spoke, most of the librarians in the library slowly left, leaving only a dozen or so to gather around scholar Clement, including Eli and Kart.

“Yes.” Scholar Clement nodded in satisfaction and said, “In three months, we will test your abilities. The top two can continue to stay here, while the rest will have to leave. After that, you will be rewarded with a silver Tarl.”

The Byrne Empire’s currency was divided into gold tarls, silver tarls, and copper tarls, and each increment was 100 to the next tarls.

A silver Tarl was the amount of money a normal laborer could earn in a month. As for Eli, his monthly salary was 50 copper tarls, just barely enough for him to survive.

As for official wardens, they earned a total of five silver tarls a month, not counting the tips that the gentlemen and ladies might give. This was also one of the important reasons why Eli was determined to stay here.

The librarian was a highly paid job.

Hearing scholar Clement’s words, everyone’s eyes lit up. However, when they thought about how they might not pass, their hearts sank again, and the atmosphere became a little strange.

It seemed like Clement had only wanted to make an announcement. He turned around and left, leaving only a few dozen temporary workers standing there.

Eli looked around. Most people were discussing in groups of twos and threes, and the most ” pessimistic ” one was undoubtedly Kart, whom he was more familiar with.

At this moment, he was standing in the middle of a few people and sighed. “It’ll so difficult this time. I feel that I’m in danger too. The library only needs two people. Actually, one silver tarl is also good ...”

As if sensing Eli’s gaze, Kart looked up and scanned his surroundings. He saw Eli’s gaze coincidentally on him. His eyes lit up, and he walked towards him.

When Eli saw this, he immediately pretended not to see it and quickly returned to the changing room. He didn’t need to hear the same boasting again.

After changing his clothes, Eli walked out of the library.

On his way home, Eli looked at the Silver Moon in the sky, the passing carriages, and the poor people in linen clothes. It was only then that he realized that everything had changed.

“Don’t be reckless. We’ll talk about other things when we’re strong enough,” muttered Eli as he looked at the silver moonlight.

He did not forget that there were extraordinary powers in this world.
