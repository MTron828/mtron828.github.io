159 A New Chapter

“I haven’t seen you for such a long time, but your aura has grown very quickly!”

In a room, Kratos was holding a cup of coffee and looking at Eli with a smile.

“Sigh, I’ve been training while we were waiting,” Eli replied. Compared to ten years ago, he was much stronger. Currently, he was only at the middle stage of the first-circle.

“Well, this is a good thing. After all, you’re the eighth representative of the White Tower, so strength is still important. However, with me here, I will also protect you.” Kratos nodded.

“Of course. After all, I’ve been following sir for years.” Eli replied.

It was a conversation but also a test.

Hearing the satisfactory answer, Kratos nodded in satisfaction. This answer was enough.

“Yes, relax. In terms of status, we’re all a part of the Parliament. Everyone’s status is the same. Moreover, the White Tower has just begun, and the main conflict is with the outside world. You just have to take care of yourself.” Kratos nodded.

“Yes.”

“But congratulations, the eighth representative Herman. If you have any questions, you can ask me.” Kratos smiled and patted Eli’s shoulder.

“Um, Sir, I really do have a question.”

“Oh?” Kratos was curious.

“My Lord, I would like to ask, how do warlocks break through to the second circle?” Eli asked Kratos. This was also the purpose of his return.

“Breaking through to the second circle!” Kratos thought for a moment and then replied, “For most warlocks, it’s still a matter of bloodline.

“The bloodline level determines the upper limit of some warlocks, just like the shadow lizard warlocks. The basic limit is the second circle, but you have a first-circle bramble tree demon. This might be very difficult.” Kratos pursed his lips and said, “Of course, it’s not impossible to break through the bloodline, but it’s very difficult. This requires your bloodline to be extremely dense. Dig deep into your bloodline and break through the limits of your bloodline to find a deeper connection.”

“What if the level of the bloodline source is sufficient?” After all, the shadow Dragon had a four-circle bloodline.

“Of course, that is another story. This information is very precious, but I’ll tell you directly.

“Since it’s a breakthrough, then I have to mention the difference between the first and second-circle warlocks. A second circle Warlock is divided into three stages, the early, middle, and late stages. Every stage requires the warlocks to condense a bloodline core.

“There are two ways to form a bloodline core. One is to increase the quality of the bloodline and then naturally form a bloodline core. The other is to rely on the accumulation of a large amount of blood.”

“Accumulation?” Eli was puzzled.

“That’s right. It’s to accumulate. As long as there’s enough blood, you can slowly condense a bloodline core. However, this requires too much blood, so most warlocks still choose the first path.” Kratos explained.

“I see,” Eli said.

It seemed that the difference between a two-circle warlock and a one-circle warlock lay in the bloodline core.

“Yes, after forming the first bloodline core, you can be called a two-circle Warlock. At this point, the power of a Warlock’s bloodline is highly concentrated. Whether it’s explosive power or control, it’s on a completely different level from a first-circle Warlock. But why did you suddenly think of this?” Kratos took the coffee and asked curiously.

“It’s nothing. I’m just curious,” Eli mumbled.

As the two of them chatted, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Kratos said.

The door opened, and two familiar people walked in. They were Rawls and Evena, whom Eli had not seen for many years.

They didn’t change much except for a scar on Rawls’ face.

“Sir Kratos,” The two of them said to Kratos.

Kratos nodded, then turned to look at Eli and said, “Now that you’re responsible for so many things, of course, you have to have subordinates. I’ll leave Rawls and Evena to you. You can order them as much as you want.”

Rawls, “…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In fact, he had already heard about what Eli had done when he was out on a mission. At first, he wanted to work hard to surpass him, but as time passed, the gap grew bigger and bigger, and he had to accept his fate.

This was especially true when he knew that Eli had become a representative. Today, it was Kratos who called for him. He never thought that he would be Eli’s subordinate.

How could he not feel aggrieved?

“Yes, my lord.” On the other hand, Evena agreed without any awkwardness.

“Rawls, why don’t you speak?”

“Fine,” Rawls gritted his teeth and said.

“Well, you’re already very familiar with each other, so I won’t say anything more. You can assign their own work after you leave.” Kratos nodded.

“Mm, then I’ll take my leave, Milord.”

Soon, Eli left the room with Rawls and Evena and then did a simple assignment.

With Evena in charge of potions and Rawls in charge of magic plants, the two of them had returned to their old jobs.

As for what Eli was doing?

Of course, he was slacking off. Anyway, he already had free subordinates, so it would be a waste not to use them.

And the path that Eli was about to take was obvious.

That was to hide in the White Tower, keep a low profile and make himself stronger and stronger, and collect mage items. As for the rest, he would leave it to fate.

Besides, Kratos had also told Eli how to break through his bloodline. Since a warlock could not break through in a short time, it was better to let his bloodline go further and raise his upper limit first instead of constantly making up for his shortcomings.

As for the two ways to break through …

The first option was not bad, but it was not suitable for Eli. After all, it would take him too much time to study his bloodline. He needed to devote his time to studying mage knowledge.

The second path was just right for Eli. He could use the devouring power to accumulate the power of his bloodline.

As for the blood, he would have to rely on the mage camp to collect it slowly. All he had to do was sit in the White Tower and wait. He would go there once in a while, but of course, it might take some time.

But Eli was very patient, and he would take it slow.

…

Three years later.

Eli sat in the office in the White Tower, looking at the majestic development of the forces outside the window, and took a deep breath.

His bloodline compatibility was already at 91%.

In reality, 90% was enough to break through, but later on, Eli realized that the bloodline compatibility’s limit seemed to be 95%. It was just that most people would choose to break through at 90% because, after 90%, every 1% increase would be much more difficult than before.

So, Eli chose to continue waiting.
