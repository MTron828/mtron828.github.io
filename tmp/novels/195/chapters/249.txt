250 Change in the Situation

Even though he was cooped up in the bloodline tower, the news from the ruins still reached Eli’s ears a day later.

“Many forces suffered heavy casualties, but due to the killing of four of the heart of darkness’ third circle warlocks by an unknown person, the temporary Alliance formed by the Holy tower and the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce also had a brief respite and held on until the reinforcements arrived!”

Vivika reported to Eli in the wizard Tower.

“An unknown person?”

Sitting across from him, Eli found the news rather funny.

He had never thought that his actions would inexplicably cause the heart of darkness to fail. This was rather surprising. They probably hated him to death.

“Teacher not only saved me, but you also made a great contribution to the stability of the West Coast.” Vivika looked at Eli and said with certainty. If it wasn’t for her teacher’s arrival, not only would she have died, but the entire expedition team would probably have had no chance of surviving other than the people from the heart of the darkness.

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. If it weren’t for you, he wouldn’t be there.

“Hmm, what about after the expedition ended? how did everyone react?”

The matter was over, but Eli was still more curious about what happened after that.

“The Holy tower lost two late-stage third circle warlocks this time. It could be said to be a heavy loss, so their peak third circle leader was furious. It was said that he directly attacked the heart of the darkness that day, killed two third-circle warlocks, and then left.

“They also declared war on the heart of the darkness and joined forces with the unicorn warlocks to fight against the Academy.” Vivika sighed.

“It’s the same for the heart of darkness. They also issued a war warning that day. It’s said that their ambush was so smooth because of the help of helwall and the heart of thorns. They’re also on the heart of darkness ‘side.”

Eli shook his head. It seemed like the heart of darkness had been planning this for a long time.

Although it was only a warning, Eli had a feeling that this war would most likely break out because the heart of the darkness had planned for so long, it was impossible for it to be done carelessly.

But if that were the case, then this peaceful environment would start to become chaotic again. This was really f * cking frustrating!

“Eh, what about the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce?” Eli realized that he did not seem to have heard of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s name. It was a major force on the West Coast.

“Sir, they have always been a neutral force!” Vivika thought for a moment and said, ” according to my former tower master, Natasha, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce might not be as powerful as the heart of the darkness and the Holy tower on the West Coast. However, in the central continent, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce is a real power.

“Even the heart of the darkness and the Holy tower did not dare to provoke them easily. This was only one of their branches. Although they came here partly because of the ruins, the more important reason was that this was once the territory of the dark Magi, and there were still some resources worth recycling!

“It’s impossible for them to join those forces. In fact, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce rarely gets involved in the wars of other forces.”

Eli understood now. As a Chamber of Commerce that did business, there was indeed no need for them to get involved in this matter. They would just sit back and watch the Tigers fight. No matter which side won, it would not affect them at all.

As expected of a businessman!

“What about the Harpy?” Eli continued asking.

“They are currently the same as us. They are neutral!”

Vivika thought for a moment.

“understood, ” Eli said.

There were now two sides. On one side, the heart of the darkness was the leader, they had the support of the heart of thorns and helwall. On the other side, there were the Holy tower and the unicorn Warlock Academy. Lastly, the neutral sides are the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, the bloodline tower, and the harpies.

As for the West Coast treaty, it only existed in name.

“Then, teacher, what should we do next?” Vivika still subconsciously asked for Eli’s opinion.

“Maintain the status quo!”

Eli said calmly.

If the heart of darkness were to wipe out all the other powers in ruins, it would likely lead to the heart of darkness’s rapid expansion, and the situation would only worsen.

However, it was still fine now. At least, Heart of Darkness’s plan wouldn’t be realized in a short period of time!

Therefore, maintaining the status quo was the best choice for the bloodline tower.

Not only for the bloodline tower but also for Eli.

Let’s talk about it after he broke through to the middle stage!

..

At this time, in a meeting room of a Wizard Tower far away from the bloodline tower.

The meeting room wasn’t very big, only about 100 square meters. It was supported by pillars and covered with patterns of night demonic wolves. The walls were also engraved with a large number of Heart of night patterns.

A huge round table was placed in the center, and more than a dozen warlocks sat around it. No one spoke, and everyone remained silent.

Suddenly, the Warlock on the main seat raised his head.

He had a head full of white hair and black eyes. He looked to be in his thirties or forties and exuded the might of a third-circle soul master at the peak of the late-stage, but his eyes were dark.

He looked at the Warlock at the side, who was also the late-stage third circle warlock, Luo Fu, who was the leader of the group in the secret ruin. He asked,

“Tell me, Luo Fu. This plan is so detailed, how could it have failed?”

“Mr. Sergei, we didn’t expect it to be like this. Everything was going well, but a wizard suddenly appeared out of nowhere and killed three of our third-circle warlocks. We didn’t have enough people, and our plan went wrong!” Luo Fu lowered his head and explained.

Although he was also a third-circle later-stage warlock, Mr. Sergei had been at the limit of a third-circle later-stage warlock for a long time.

“Hmph, a failure is a failure!” Sergei snorted and smacked the table to show his dissatisfaction.

“This plan had been prepared decades ago, and now you’re telling me that it was destroyed by accident? how could I accept this? it’s ridiculous!”

Furthermore, the current situation was a mess, which made him even more upset.

“F * ck!” Sergei vented his dissatisfaction and asked, ” then, does anyone know who the Warlock who suddenly appeared is? ”

“Uh, Rodin went, but he didn’t seem to have found him!” Luo Fu looked at an old Warlock with white hair not far away.

Everyone’s gazes were focused.

Rodin’s mouth twitched when he felt the leader’s sharp gaze. After a few seconds, he slowly shook his head and said, “When I went there, they had already left. There was no one in the direction I went!”

What a joke. He did see the three of them at that time, but how could he dare to say it? if he did, wouldn’t he expose the fact that he had escaped from fear of losing? It was not appropriate.

...

As an outstanding old Warlock, he knew how to seek good fortune and avoid disaster.

“Alright,” Luo Fu sighed.

They were too careless this time. Not only was their plan ruined, but they didn’t even know who the instigator was. That was really F * cked up!

Sergei was also speechless.

“Then forget it. Let’s put an end to this matter. As for who that bastard is, send someone to investigate!”

In the end, he decided that since they had already failed, there was no need to be too demanding.

“Yes!”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

“Milord, there seems to be another suspicious point in this matter!”

Suddenly, someone spoke.

“Oh?” Sergei looked over.

...

“my Lord, according to the time, Vivika of the bloodline tower seems to have broken through the ruins ahead of time, and the bloodline tower has also left Silvermoon town ahead of time. I think this may be related to them!” A third-circle warlock said.

“Oh?” Sergei’s eyebrows rose.

The bloodline tower wasn’t that powerful, so he didn’t really care.

Could it really be related to them?

“Then who’s interested in going take a look? it’d be best if it’s a late-stage third-circle warlock.” Although the focus was on the battle with the Holy tower, he also hated the person who ruined their plan to the bone.

“Rodin, why don’t you go?” Luo Fu looked at the old Warlock in the distance.

Ah?

Rodin glared at him. Asking him to go? what a joke.

He had seen the Warlock with his own eyes. He should not be a match for him.

“Eh? What do you know?” Looking at Rodin’s unusual behavior, Sergei questioned.

“no, no. It’s just that I’m in charge of the dispatch of supplies, right? I might not have the time.” Rodin forced a smile.

“hehe, I think he’s just a coward. Indeed, the older he is, the more useless he is!” Suddenly, another Warlock not far from Rodin spoke and looked at Rodin with hostility.

Rodin’s eyes widened, but he immediately laughed.

“Noah, since you’re so powerful, why don’t you go? you’re stronger than me, and you’re a late-stage third-circle veteran. You’re indeed more suitable than me!”

“Hmph!” The Warlock snorted.

The two of them were old rivals.

“Indeed, Rodin is in charge of the dispatch of supplies. The war is coming soon, and this is more important. Noah, you can go.” Hearing their argument, Sergei suddenly said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The old man’s eyes lit up.

“Alright, Sir. I’ll just make a trip there. If you asked me, Rodin probably abandoned his duties back then. People are weak when they’re old. When they can’t do anything, it’s time for them to give up their positions,” Noah said confidently.

He was a veteran of the late-stage of the third-circle. It was just a small bloodline tower and killing it was easy. If it were not for the West Coast treaty, they would have destroyed this force long ago.

And it was said that the tower master of the bloodline tower was a beauty.

He didn’t have many hobbies, and women were one of them, but he hadn’t tried someone like Vivika yet. He believed that it would be good!

Thinking of this, Noah’s lips gradually curved up.

Not far away, the old man took a deep breath. He had dodged a calamity.

As for whether Noah could beat him or not, it was none of his business. He was just relieved it was not him. He believed Noah couldn’t be the match for the warlock he saw that day.

“Alright, Noah will go to the bloodline tower to take a look.” Sergei decided.

“Meeting dismissed!”
