506 Grim Reaper

While Eli was meditating.

He didn’t know that as he advanced, the strongest people in the world also noticed this change.

In the outer layer of the Mage World, in some hidden spaces, Warlocks opened their eyes one by one.

“The power of rules. Someone has advanced to the fifth circle. I don’t know which faction it is from. Send someone to investigate!”

“It’s been a long time since I’ve seen someone ascend. I wonder if it will have any impact on the world. I feel like calling my family and asking them to pay attention.”

“I hope it’s a human’s and not a marine race’s. Otherwise, it’ll be troublesome in the future!”

“Send someone to investigate!”

The old faces opened their eyes one by one, and their expressions were all different!

Advancing to the fifth circle meant that they were standing at the top of the world. Each of them was an amazing warlock, and they might have some changes in the situation.

Therefore, it was still very important to know who this person was.

Therefore, under the orders of the various old leaders, all the forces began to move. Even the Warlock Union was no exception. In other words, most of these old guys belonged to the Warlock Union.

However, after a full month, they still found nothing.

They sighed and instructed their people to be on guard.

In the extreme north.

The Lich King also woke up in the wizard tower, but he was frowning.

“I hope the fifth circle warlock won’t affect me in any way.”

For a force that was currently fighting against the Warlock Union, there was no need to talk about their strength. Although advancing to the fifth circle would definitely have a huge impact, what made him frown was another matter.

“However…”

“Why does this aura feel a little familiar…”

A rare trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

The Kings of the Deep Sea woke up one after another and looked at the land with a hint of fear in their eyes.

“Has another fifth-circle human been born?”

“Hahaha, it doesn’t matter. So what if he has a fifth circle? In the future, we will definitely turn this world into a blue color.”

The Kings of the Deep Sea communicated with each other and soon cut off contact again.

The instant he broke through, Ely entered the vision of the entire world’s top level!

Although it wasn’t exposed, countless eyes were already focused on him.

..

Eli didn’t know about this.

At this moment, he was still immersed in the fragments of time.

Meditate, meditate, meditate!

Dazzling timeline lightning crackled, and the shadow law was also brought along by him. This allowed his understanding of the law to rapidly deepen, and the tree of law also began to slowly grow!

For Eli, such closed-door training was just perfect.

Ten years later, in the outside world.

As the power of laws flashed in the depths of the time fragment world, the entire time fragment world was first filled with endless time flow, followed by a thick ink-like shadow!

It was only after a few days that everything ended!

In the depths of the fragment, Eli took a deep breath and looked into his body.

Compared to the Tree of Law from a thousand years ago, the Tree of Law was now many times larger. The once thin and weak tree had now changed greatly. Its thick roots pierced into the void and continuously absorbed power. Its strong trunk was also many times stronger than before.

If the Tree of Law was once in its seedling stage, the Tree of Law now had entered its growth stage. It possessed the characteristics of a tree, but of course, its branches were still bare.

“I’ve advanced to the second stage of the fifth circle Divine Tree Mage. I’m much stronger than before.” Eli felt his own strength.

A thousand years of loneliness made him stronger.

“However, it’s still not enough. The Warlock Union and the Sea Tribe definitely have more powerful forces.” Eli put away his pride and entered the depths of the secret realm again.

He was stronger and could withstand a stronger flow of time.

A hundred times!

..

110 times.

120 times!

..

150 times

In the end, he stopped at the 150-fold time flow and entered meditation again.

Compared to loneliness, he could endure it. Moreover, the feeling of becoming stronger was really comfortable!

Time slowly passed.

Ten years in the outside world.

In the dazzling time fragment world, Eli stretched his body and felt the Law Bending Power that was already at the peak of the Divine Tree in his body.

“It’s about time. Focus my consciousness on the clone and go out for a walk!”

Eli knew that he would not be able to break through in a short period of time, so he prepared to go out and relax.

..

At this moment!

Central Region, Hamis City!

As the main city of the Hamis family in the Warlock Union, Hamis City was the core city in the western part of the central region. Every day, millions of Warlocks came and went, making it very lively.

However, at this moment, in the center of the city, in a tall white tower.

The room was silent, and the low pitch buried the entire place!

The room wasn’t big, and there weren’t many Warlocks inside. There were only three of them.

Azak sat on a chair, and in front of him were two warlocks in black warlock robes with their heads lowered.

“Sir, we’ve already investigated. The matter regarding the Mage Tower seems to have nothing to do with the other families of the Warlock Union. With the help of the war that Sir had specially started, we gathered enough information during the chaos. In the end, we confirmed that the ruins should have fallen into the hands of Eli!” A black-robed warlock lowered his head. They were the two people from decades ago, and they were also the trusted aides of Azak!

“So it’s Eli!”

Azak narrowed his eyes, and a glimmer of light flashed in them.

After spending so much effort, he finally found it.

Moreover, over the years, they had secretly cracked the document and learned more. Compared to that person’s son, this person called Dylan seemed to have followed Gray to the battlefield in the end.

However, he died in the warlock world. This was very strange!

Therefore, they were certain that there was something on this person!

” But that’s Eli…” He pursed his lips!

For those in the fifth circle, anyone below the fourth circle was nothing. Their family had people at this level, but they had no reason to attack Eli.

After all, this matter had to be kept secret!

Ugh!

For a moment, he fell into deep thought.

A few minutes later, he opened his eyes and said, “Since we can’t make a move, let’s ask the Grim Reaper to make a move.”

“Ah, the Grim Reaper?”

“The only fifth-circle assassin on the continent, a Germinal Warlock.”

The two of them were shocked.

“Then what reward will we give, sir? After all, he’s a fifth-circle warlock.” A Warlock asked.

“Heh, although the Grim Reaper is the number one assassin organization on the continent, and the second is the Death Mandala Flower. Although Mandala Flower doesn’t have a fifth circle, it’s already a threat to their position. I heard that they’ve been looking for Miya recently. I know that she’s been in the Western Region recently. I’ll provide them with her location and let them help me kill Eli.” Azak revealed a cruel smile.

Just because they couldn’t make a move didn’t mean that they didn’t have other methods.

As for Eli, no matter how strong he was, he was a fourth-circle warlock. It was impossible for him to survive against a fifth-circle opponent.

“Yes, sir!”

The two of them nodded in unison.

..

Three days later!

In the grassi land.

Eli opened his eyes and stood up.

Walking out of the Magus Tower, he looked at the lively environment outside and the warm sunlight. He immediately felt relaxed. Not far away, Hydra, who had already advanced to half-step five-circle, had his eyes closed. Further away was Dylan, who was at the peak of the Radiant Sun.

After occupying the resources of a region, a few of them also advanced.

They were also surprised to see Eli. Eli had been in seclusion for decades and was finally willing to come out. However, it was not a big deal. To people of this level, decades were nothing!

Therefore, they continued with their own business.

“It feels good!”

Eli narrowed his eyes, enjoying the most ordinary yet precious thing.

At the same time, a black shadow appeared outside the Grassi grounds.

His cold eyes looked at Eli.

It was ready to go.
