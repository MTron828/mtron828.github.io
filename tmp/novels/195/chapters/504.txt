505 Advancing to the Fifth Circle

Boom!

A mountain-like aura spread out, and the eternal Celestial Great Sun began to slowly sink in, while the Seed of Law became even more dazzling, as if something was brewing inside!

Eli’s consciousness sank into his heart, sensing the changes.

At this moment, the Seed of Law was like a black hole, absorbing all the accumulation of his power in the past. It could even faintly carry bloodline power, and the power of the Celestial Great Sun was also surging into it.

Advancing to the fifth circle was a process of jumping from the previous foundation.

In the end, the Seed of Law would continue to grow and eventually grow into a sapling of the Tree of Law. Therefore, among the fifth circle and sixth circle, the first realm was called the Germinal Realm, also known as the Germinal Mage!

“However, my body and soul won’t be able to withstand such a large amount of absorption!” Eli evaluated his own situation, his eyes slightly narrowed.

The next second, Eli opened his eyes.

The other two spatial rings opened, and countless soul crystals and magic crystals instantly spread out around Eli like a dazzling galaxy, burning at the same time.

Boundless soul power burned brightly, and the Celestial Sun in his body caved in faster, but the pressure on his body and soul also increased.

In response, Eli opened another ring.

The rainbow light marrow was swallowed by Eli. In an instant, Eli’s soul and body seemed to have a thin layer of membrane, preventing him from suffering the pain of his celestial body being caved in!

The breakthrough continued.

“Everything is normal!” Eli watched the whole process calmly.

In order to advance to the fifth circle, he had spent thirty years adjusting and taking into account all kinds of situations. Now, all he had to do was wait for his celestial to be completely consumed and then hatch his seed of law.

With his accumulation, there would not be any accidents at this step!

Soon, the flames of celestial burning around the Celestial Great Sun disappeared bit by bit. The illusory Great Sun also began to dim, and the Seed of Law also began to tremble slightly, starting to crack a little!

Eli could feel the aura of the shadow.

If there were no problems, his Law Tree should be a Shadow Tree with the Law of Shadow as its main branch.

“There should be no problem… Wait, what is this light?”

Suddenly, Eli felt that something was wrong. He felt a white glow appear in his spiritual space!

“What is this?”

Elu’s eyes widened. The light had messed with him when he advanced to the Celestial Realm, and now it was messing with him again.

In the next second, he saw the white light become even more dazzling. At the same time, his Law Seed began to change. A translucent aura began to brew within it.

Along with this change, Eli could even feel the environment outside changing abruptly. The originally sparse timeline lightning seemed to have found its target. Hundreds of lightning bolts appeared at the same time and hit Eli’s body.

Eli was shocked. So many? Could he take it?

However, what he did not expect was that the lightning did not affect him at all. Instead, they swarmed into his body and entered the Seed of Law. The originally weak time aura instantly increased!

At this moment, Eli was already numb!

As everyone knew, one nomological law would only grow into one nomological tree. Then what was going on with him? Could it be that he would grow two nomological trees? That would be awesome!

Moreover, he was also facing a new problem. With the addition of a new law, this meant that the burning speed of magic crystals and soul crystals was also rapidly increasing. It took him a second to consume hundreds of thousands of magic crystals and soul crystals. With his current celestial storage and the burning soul crystals and magic crystals around him, it was definitely not enough!

“Forget it,” Eli cursed and took out more magic crystals. He even took out all kinds of magic crystals that could recover one’s body.

Everything started to burn. Eli was going all out! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Burn!”

With a large number of resources burning, Eli felt the process accelerate again.

A full day passed.

Eli had almost burned out everything that could be burned in his interspatial ring. Thousands of years of accumulation had almost been exhausted in one day, but he did not feel any heartache. Instead, he felt a burst of joy.

“Just right!”

Eli looked haggard as he observed his body. At this moment, the gap in the law seed was slowly cracking open. At the same time, a small tree gradually drilled out of the law, emitting a unique power.

It was a strange little tree. Its roots were derived from the branches and rooted in the spiritual space. The main trunk was bare, but what was unique was that after extending for a short distance, the small tree suddenly turned into two branches. One side was like a transparent crystal, and the other side was a dark shadow.

This was Eli’s Tree of Law!

This proved that Eli had finally succeeded in breaking through.

Fifth circle!

“But why are there still two branches? So I finally broke through to the fifth circle with two laws?” Eli’s mouth twitched as he stared at the small tree.

Although his body’s instincts told him that he had succeeded, he felt that it was unreal!

A normal Tree of Law had one branch, but he had two. Was this considered a Twin Tree of Law?

However, Eli didn’t have any other emotions. After all, ever since his second circle, he had never been able to advance normally. It was normal for him to have some accidents. The most important thing now was to check on the changes after advancing.

“First, there’s power. My power hasn’t changed, but I can transform it into the power of laws. It’s a completely different level from the power of celestial.

“Also, the evolution of the laws has made my devouring ability even stronger. I can even devour the power of others. Of course, it will be very difficult to convert them. As for time, my time domain can probably expand to dozens of kilometers. Moreover, I have new abilities.” Eli carefully sensed the changes in his body and became more and more shocked.

Whether it was strength or level, it was a completely different concept from the half-step fifth circle.

Moreover, he discovered that his time law had a new ability.

“Time Reversal!” Eli pursed his lips in surprise.

If one said that the Time Domain’s essence was to speed up or slow down time, the essence of time was still moving forward. However, the Time Reversal ability was a little ridiculous. It could reverse time and cause it to flow back.

“Impressive!”

Eli sighed deeply. The sudden change had brought him more benefits. It was even stronger than a normal fifth circle. After all, he had one more branch!

“However, I still need to properly control this power. After all, I’ve just advanced, and I’m only at the first level of the Laws. Perhaps I can stay here forever and wait for me to become stronger before leaving.” Eli pursed his lips and pondered.

The fifth circle was different from the fourth ring. It was divided into six levels, namely the Germinal Realm, the Divine Tree Realm, the Thousand Leaves Realm, the Ten Thousand Flowers Realm, the Fruit of Law, and the Nirvana Realm. Compared to the fourth circle, each level had a greater possibility of growth due to the growth of the Tree of Law.

Every level was a leap in class.

What Eli was thinking was that he could ” quietly develop ” here for a few hundred years and then break through to become stronger before showing his face. Wouldn’t that be even better?

“I originally wanted to go out and find a fifth circle warlock to fight, but now it seems that I should just quietly develop. I’ll go out when I’m stronger. It’ll be safer then.”

As a firm bully, Eli would not be so reckless as to fight the fifth circle!

It was better to wait for him to become stronger.

Thinking of this, Eli opened his eyes, looked around, and walked deeper into the time fragment.

Now that he was at the fifth circle, he was able to withstand even more.

In the end, he stopped at a spot where the time flow was a hundred times faster.

The augmentation of the Time Rule allowed him to adapt to time even more.

Pa!

Eli sat down and began to comprehend the law.
