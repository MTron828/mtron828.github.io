460 Dragon King Awakens

Time went back to a day ago!

Thank you readers!

Green Field, Dragon Clan’s territory.

The Blue Dragon King, Sayis, had his eyes closed as he slept in the huge forest lake, immersed in it like a dazzling sapphire!

Roar!

Suddenly, a distant dragon roar sounded. Under this dragon’s roar, the surrounding air rippled in all directions!

!!

Sayis suddenly opened his eyes, and his huge body instantly broke out of the water. His dragon head looked towards the depths of the dragon race not far away, and his face revealed an excited expression.

“The Dragon King is awake!” Sayis’ eyes lit up, and the dragon wings that glowed with blue light spread out from his back. He flapped them gently, and his huge body soared into the air, flying toward the source of the sound.

He was not the only one. At this moment, the sky was filled with dragons, one after another. Just like him, they were all flying towards the source of the sound.

Sayis increased his speed. In the blink of an eye, he had crossed this area and entered a barren area. The air here was extremely hot, and the core of this hot area was a huge mountain. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The mountain was thousands of meters tall. Even in the green fields, such a mountain was rare. The mountain was covered with reddish-black cracks. Even the rocks had melted, forming a huge lava lake around it!

However, after Sayis arrived at this area, he did not pay any attention to this. Instead, he stared at the huge figure entrenched on the mountain.

It was a giant dragon that was over a thousand meters long and covered the entire mountain peak. Its huge dragon wings were hundreds of meters long, like wings that covered the sky. The scarlet scales on its body flickered with a unique luster, and each scale was several meters long.

At this moment, this giant dragon was standing on a tall mountain. Its crimson eyes were calmly looking at the ground. It looked at the thousands of giant dragons on the ground. These were all the members of the giant dragon race.

Sayis was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the foot of the mountain and came before the dragon. He lowered his head and said, “Master Giovanni, you’re finally awake!”

Seeing Sayis, Giovanni looked down at his loyal subordinate, but then he showed a puzzled expression and asked, “Where did Ortiz go?”

“Ortiz?”

Upon hearing this name, Sayis was stunned. Then, he realized that he hadn’t seen this guy for almost 50 years!

“My lord, I have been in a deep sleep, so I don’t know. But the last time I saw him was fifty years ago, and he didn’t seem to have come.” Sayis looked around but did not see that familiar face!

Upon hearing his words, the body of Giovanni, who was called Dragon King, quickly burned with a layer of scorching flames. Even Sayis could not stand it. He knew that this was part of the fire laws that his master had comprehended after advancing to the half-step fifth circle. It was completely different from ordinary flames.

‘What’s wrong?” Seeing the Dragon King like this, Sayis obviously realized that something was wrong. Ortiz had another identity, and he was the son and only descendant of this lord in front of him!

“I can sense that he is currently being imprisoned. He seems to be in the south of the green fields!” Giovanni closed his eyes and sensed for a moment. The next second, he opened his eyes. There seemed to be flames burning in his eyes!

Imprisoned?

Sayis was also shocked, and his mouth was wide open.

“Then what should we do, Milord?” Sayis quickly asked, but he was still a little flustered!

After saying that, Dragon King Giovanni flapped his huge wings. With two gusts of wind, his huge body soared into the sky.

On the ground, all the mature giant dragons let out dragon roars. A hint of excitement flashed in their eyes, and then they flew up one by one. Among them, there were more than a hundred fourth circle giant dragons, and the lowest was the third circle.

Blue Dragon Sayis looked at all of this in a daze. After hesitating for a moment, he quickly followed!

Nearly 500 giant dragons spread their wings and flew like a natural disaster. Under the leadership of the thousand-meter-long giant dragon, they left the dragon territory in a mighty manner!

South!

…..

“What? The dragon race is heading south!”

In the Tower, Ely raised his eyebrows. He heard the news that Vivika had just told him. It was from the Green Field!

“Yes, it was discovered by the Amina family. They discovered that the dragons in the depths of the green fields were in a riot. They were led by a thousand-meter-long dragon to the south.” Vivika said straightforwardly, but she still managed to remain calm.

“A thousand-meter-long dragon!” Eli’s throat moved slightly. This length even surpassed Ortiz’s. This couldn’t be a fifth-circle dragon, right?

He immediately took out the dice and rolled it once. The dice rolled and finally stopped at the position of seventeen!

Seventeen?

Half-fifth circle!

Seeing the number, Eli relaxed a little and gave up on the idea of escaping immediately!

However, a half-step fifth-circle dragon heading south meant that this matter was definitely not trivial. However, it was also an opportunity for him. It just so happened that his experiment had reached a bottleneck, and he needed more dragons to do the experiment. It was also a good opportunity to verify the difference between a half-step fifth-circle dragon and his peak fourth-circle dragon!

Two birds with one stone!

Of course, all of this had to be within the range of the Bloodline Tower. With the help of the power of faith, he could ensure that he could suppress the dragon 100%.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve taken action personally. Moreover, the scene is so big. I’m afraid I can harvest another wave of Faith Points. The fourth mark isn’t full yet!!”

Eli stretched his body, revealing his pearly white teeth. He was even looking forward to it!

Seeing the look of anticipation on Eli’s face, Vivika’s expression was strange. Shouldn’t he be worried at this time?

“Pass down my order. Tell Amina not to stop them. I’ll deal with it myself!” Eli said to Vivika.

“Yes, sir!” Vivika nodded. It was only then that she realized that Eli wanted to fight personally.

It had been a long time since she had seen Eli fight.

She was also very curious about how strong Brother Eli was.

….

As the two of them were discussing in a laboratory not far from Grassi Land.

The dragon Ortiz suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, there were dozens of tubes inserted into his body, and scarlet blood was flowing in them. However, he had no time to worry about these at this moment. He was only trembling with excitement!

He sensed it.

His father had woken up and was flying towards him at high speed.

“There’s hope!”

Tears welled up in Ortiz’s eyes, and he felt that he was getting closer and closer to freedom!

Dragons would never be slaves!

Not even food and accommodation!
