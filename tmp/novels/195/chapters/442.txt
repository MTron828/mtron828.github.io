443 Demons Appear, Warlock Alliance!

Shua!

In the Grassi Land, in the Mage Tower, Eli suddenly opened his eyes. Then, he tidied his clothes and walked out!

He walked down the stairs all the way to the bottom of the tower, pushed open the door, and walked out.

At this moment, two figures were already waiting at the door. They were Nikola and Glen!

“My lord!” The two of them bowed respectfully at the same time.

“Come in together.”

Eli turned around and walked toward the upper level of the wizard tower. Glen and Nikola looked at each other and quickly followed.

Soon, everyone arrived at a reception room. Ely sat on one side, and the two of them sat on the other.

“Tell me, what happened?” Eli asked.

At this moment, Glen also had a serious expression on his face as he directly said, “Sir, you know that we are in the northernmost part of the Western Region. The western part is the Soya Mountain Range, and the eastern part is the other second-class forces, the ones near the Central Region. However, the southernmost part is the Heart of the Abyss.”

“Are you saying that there’s a problem with the Heart of Abyss?” Eli raised his eyebrows. He had been confused by this name recently! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

” It’s not my lord. The problem is in the East. It’s a second-class force called the Saka clan! ” Nikola said.

The Saka Family?

Ely knew about it. It seemed to be a force not far from the Holy Tower. Its bloodline was a type of winged Dawn Python. It had a peak four-ring bloodline and was a second-class force that was not inferior to the Holy Tower. It should be one of the top ten forces in the Western Region.

Was this incident caused by the Saka family?

Eli looked at Glen with a puzzled expression, waiting for his answer.

Nikola took a deep breath and said, “Sir, you might not know, but just yesterday, the Saka clan perished! ”

“What?!” Even Eli couldn’t keep his calm. His mouth was wide open.

That was a second-class force. Even when they had exterminated the Eight-Armed Naga, it had taken them a few months. In the end, they suddenly told him that a second-class force in the same area had disappeared just like that. How could he not be surprised?

“What exactly happened? Tell me everything at once!” Eli looked at him with a serious expression.

Glen nodded and said, “Milord, it’s like this. Yesterday, a spatial rift suddenly appeared in the Saka clan’s territory. The location of the spatial rift is in the core area of the Saka clan. In just a few minutes, tens of thousands of demons descended on the Saka clan’s territory. What followed was a brutal massacre and bloodshed.

“In the next two days, the demons covered most of the Saka clan’s territory with the flames of war.”

Eli gasped.

DemonsA spatial riftCould it be that the Abyssal World had once again opened the door to the Warlock World and was about to start a world war?

NoIf it was really the Abyssal World, how did they pass through that world fragment layer Could it be through the World Teleportation Circle that was once connected to the Warlock World … It was even more impossible. This was only a spatial rift, not a teleportation array at all

All sorts of thoughts ran through Eli’s mind. A few seconds later, Ely suddenly raised his head and looked at Glen. “Is this spatial rift supposed to be protected by the Heart of the Abyss?”

“Eh, how did you know?” Glen was a little surprised. This was information that he had paid a considerable price to obtain. He nodded and replied,” Sir, you’re right. From the looks of those demons, they seem to be demons from the bottom of the abyss, and that spatial rift seems to lead to the abyss world! ”

“As expected!” Eli nodded, but then more questions arose.

Why would there be a spatial rift, and what role did the Heart of Abyss play in this matter?

” As soon as this happened, the Heart of the Abyss announced that they knew nothing about it. This was the behavior of the demons in the depths of the Abyss. It had nothing to do with them! ” Nikola said again.

What a good answer!

” What about the Saka Family’s territory that the demons have invaded? ” Eli raised an eyebrow.

” Sir, after the demons slaughtered the Saka clan, they didn’t attack again. Instead, they began to expand the range of the space or even completely fuse the space. At this time, the second-class forces in the east have already contacted each other. They are preparing to attack, and they have also contacted various forces in the western region, hoping to lend a helping hand! ” Glen sighed.

“Then send some Warlocks.” Eli nodded. This matter was indeed quite serious.

“Sir, I’ll be the one providing support this time, along with the other Warlocks!” Nikola said.

“Sure.”

Eli agreed. Nikola was almost at the peak of Radiant Moon, and he had the ability to do so.

At this moment, Eli finally understood why Glen wanted to wake him up. This was indeed a matter that shook the Western Region and might even affect the Central Region. If it became serious, the flames of war might spread to other places!

“How many people did the Heart of Abyss send out?” Eli was still thinking about the Heart of the Abyss.

“Ahem.” Glen coughed and said awkwardly, “Sir, the Heart of the Abyss said that because of this incident, they have to be more cautious about the Abyss and have decided to strengthen their guard over the Abyss. This rift breach will be handed over to the other forces in the Western Regions to deal with!”

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched!

As the number one faction in the Western Regions, they actually chose to give up!

What about the responsibilities of a major force?

Suddenly, Eli felt that there was something wrong with the Heart of the Abyss.

“Okay, then you guys make the arrangements first.”

Eli nodded.

“Yes, sir!”

The two of them nodded!

…

Three days later!

Weng!

Several huge Sky Cloud Whales hovered in the sky, and thousands of Warlocks stood on them, waiting to set off.

In the sky not far away, Nikola looked at Eli and said with a smile, “Sir, there’s no need for you to send me off. There won’t be any problems.”

Eli smiled, and a wooden carving appeared in his hand. He handed it to Nikola.

...

“Sir, this is?” Nikola was puzzled!

” A small statue of faith can help me determine your location and sense the situation around you. Bring him along! ” Eli said.

“Yes, sir.” Hearing that it was related to Eli, Nikola’s eyes lit up, and he took it.

” Then let’s go. This time, our opponents can destroy a second-class force in less than three days. Don’t relax. Go. ” Eli patted Nikola’s shoulder and reminded him.

“Yes, my lord. ” Nikola nodded and flew towards the Cloud Whale.

Very quickly.

As the few Sky Cloud Whales buzzed, Ely was filled with emotions.

If the Abyssal Demon really made a big move, it would probably have a huge impact on his stable life. Therefore, he gave a statue to Nikola in case of a rainy day!

If he really had no choice, he would make a move!

This time, he really had to multitask!

‘I hope there won’t be any problems!’

...

….

At this moment.

In the Mountain Giant World Fragment, Eli had easily killed a celestial giant. Then, he looked at the medium-sized mineral vein that they had discovered not far away.

The four people behind him looked at him with respect.

” Deal with it. Be careful that the giants hear the noise and come over! ” Eli reminded.

“Yes, sir.” The few of them hurriedly nodded and began to extract the mineral vein out of the earth vein.

Three hours later.

After dividing up the ore veins, Eli assessed his surroundings and chose a direction to continue moving forward. The others followed suit.

Gade followed behind him and looked at Eli’s back, thinking to himself, ‘Eli is too strong. I heard that Eli could split himself into two. I wonder if I’ll have the chance to see it on this trip! ‘

Of course, he only thought for a moment before shaking his head and continuing to follow quickly!

Fortunately, he had invited Eli!
