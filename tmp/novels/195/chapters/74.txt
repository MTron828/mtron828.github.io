75 The Death of a King

He pushed the door open.

It was a very large room.

It seemed to be more than 100 square meters in size, and there were shelves on both sides. On the shelves were all kinds of strange things. There were strange branches, stones that emitted strange colors, and some ancient books.

However, this was not what surprised him. There were two glass columns on both sides of the center of the room, in which a monkey and a Wolf-like extraordinary creature were floating.

“How is it? Do you like my collection?” Suddenly, a voice was heard.

It was only then that Eli saw a large table not far away. At this moment, a man was standing beside the table, his hands spread out as he smiled.

The man looked to be in his fifties. His hair was half white, and his face was square but filled with determination. His eyes were very bright and full of vigor. His body was very strong, just like a bear.

This was the head of the library?

Eli felt that he would believe one if one said he was a general who charged into battle.

“These are the collections I collected from various kingdoms. I spent a lot of effort on them!” The man slowly approached and smiled at Eli.

“Hello, I’m Seviro Mesa, the current head of the library!”

“Hello, director. I’m Eli Lucifer. Your collection is indeed very good. It’s just that ...” Eli bowed and looked at the collection around him with a strange expression.

“Haha, don’t mind me. Many people think I’m weird!” The chief laughed, but then his smile faded. “but they don’t understand anything. they’re just a bunch of frogs in a well.”

“You must know that this world is very vast.”

Eli nodded, confirming that the director in front of him was indeed a little strange.

“Then do you know why I’m collecting these things?” The curator looked at Eli and asked.

“Um, I don’t know.” Eli felt that it might not be just a simple conversation today, and the director probably had other motives.

“Yes, indeed. Unfortunately, you don’t know anything. This world is very complicated. You may not know, but there is another kind of power in this world. They control a kind of power called mental power. I have been searching for them, and these are all that I found in the process of searching. ” The chief said with a smile.

There was no change in Eli’s expression, but his heart was already in a state of shock.

Did the director know about mages?

“Ah? Isn’t a knight the only force in this world?” Eli widened his eyes and asked doubtfully.

“Of course not. Let me tell you. The first king was the one who had this mental power. I only found out by chance. I’ve been searching for this power, but I only know that they were called mages.” The chief seemed to know a lot and said regretfully.

“Then why are you telling me all this?” Eli didn’t seem to understand.

“Clement told me about your performance in the Lorraine Kingdom, and I think you and I are the same kinds of person. Everyone knows that I have a good memory, but very few people know that I used to suffer because of it. I can see things that ordinary people can’t see, such as some colorful light spots floating in the air, but I don’t even know what they are. I didn’t understand what they were until I became a Grand Knight!” The chief sighed.

Light spots? Elements?

His spiritual power was so high that he could directly sense the elements, or he should have a special talent. This was a sign of a mage’s talent!

“You can tell the connection between so many books in such a short time. You must have the same feeling, right?” The curator looked at Eli with a passionate expression.

Eli finally understood why the director wanted to see him. he wanted to find his own kind!

However, he didn’t want to expose it, so he frowned and said, “Director, I don’t quite understand what you’re talking about. What light spot? I’m just a little better at analyzing than normal people!”

“Is that so?” The chief’s expression collapsed, and he sighed. “Sigh, forget it. It seems that I’ve found the wrong person again.” The chief shook his head.

The pursuit of becoming a mage had always been his goal.

However, only he knew how difficult it was to do it alone. He wanted to find someone like him to help him, but he was disappointed every time.

“Forget it. Let’s talk about other things!” The chief sat back in his seat and said. “Your performance in the Lorraine Kingdom this time has been very good, and you have greatly demonstrated the ability of our library. I heard that you missed the learner test because of this, so the library has decided to directly grant you the title of honorary learner. Are you willing?” The chief asked.

“I’m willing!” Eli nodded.

He knew that honorary learner were of the same rank as learners, but they could only be awarded directly with special contributions. Eli had no reason to refuse.

“Well, that’s good. When the time comes, we’ll announce it. Then, your learner’s robe and identification will be sent to you.” The chief continued, but he was obviously not as excited as before. “Mm, that’s all I have to say. You can leave now.” the chief continued.

“Then, Director, I’ll take my leave first!” Eli nodded, then walked out of the room.

He really didn’t expect the director wanted to be a mage.

He should know a lot, and his talent should be quite good. Unfortunately, he was born in this kingdom of Knights, so it was almost impossible for him to become a mage.

It was a pity.

However, Eli had no intention of telling the head of the library that he was a mage. Who knew what would happen?!

According to what he said, he had gone to other countries to find traces of mages, but he did not seem to find them. It seemed that there were no mages within a certain distance, or they were very hidden.

Eli guessed that there might be mages in the East since Weiss was brought here from the East. When he advanced to a level 3 acolyte or an official mage, he might be interested in looking for it. But for now, it was better for him to stay in the kingdom.

Furthermore, Eli predicted that he would be mainly staying in Bryne for quite some time, and he had yet to find Saleen metatrin’s purpose in coming here.

Eli was also very curious about what Saleen Metatrin was here for!

“We have plenty of time!” Eli shook his head. He could take it slowly. There was no rush.

After leaving the room, Eli went to find scholar Clement. He didn’t ask anything, and the two of them prepared to leave.

But just as he walked out of the building, the huge bell chimed like it was mourning, and it circled the entire Jun Lin.

The bell was deafening, and it rang nine times.

Eli and scholar clement looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.

Nine chimes were only used when a King died.

Bryne the sixth was dead.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
