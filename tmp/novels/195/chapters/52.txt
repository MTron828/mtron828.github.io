53 The Confused Hila

Hila left, her eyes blank.

...

In the carriage, Hila had even forgotten how she had opened the door, how she had come down from the second floor of the library, and how she had entered the carriage.

She sat in the carriage, took a few deep breaths, and clutched her chest.

She wasn’t angry, but she was a little confused!

“How did this happen?” Hila took off her veil and pinched her beautiful face, doubting her life.

This was the first time in her life that she felt defeated in terms of knowledge.

She closed her eyes and tried to recall what had happened in the library. It was as if every scene was still clear.

At first, she had asked with the intention of testing him, and then she had asked some random questions that were actually quite difficult. she didn’t expect ” clement ” to answer all of them and even give some details that she hadn’t noticed.

This also triggered Hila’s competitive spirit.

Gradually, the two of them went from asking questions, to discussing, to arguing, and finally to silence.

As for why she was silent, it was because Hila was asked a lot of questions that she was also puzzled by. Then, the two of them retorted, but every time they argued, she found that Eli was right every time.

Thus, Hila fell silent.

“Fortunately, it didn’t blow up this time. I was too impulsive.” hila shook her head self-deprecatingly. she had always thought that she would be one of the top scholars.

But today, her confidence was completely shattered.

Furthermore, clement was so low-key that hila had not even heard of him. However, Hila felt that this unknown scholar’s knowledge was not inferior to that of the grand scholar.

It was too shocking.

This reminded her of what her teacher had once taught her: a true scholar should always be humble and have a heart for learning.

In the past, she didn’t quite understand this sentence, but now she seemed to understand.

Scholar Clement was the best embodiment of this sentence.

As for herself, the youngest scholar, the most beautiful scholar, and the lady who might become the Empire’s first female Grand scholar ...

She thought of all the glory she had in the past. It turned out that it was just fleeting clouds.

“Next, I’m going to settle down and focus on myself.” hila clenched her right fist and looked out of the carriage, which was gradually moving away from the library. In her mind, she thought of ‘clement’.

“Clement, I will definitely surpass you.”

Facing the rising sun, hila said with certainty.

...

” She’s finally gone. ”

In the library, Eli stretched his body, skillfully took out Clement’s cup, and poured himself a cup of tea.

Such a beautiful lady. How could she be so pushy?

The questions came one after another, making it a little troublesome for him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Whoever marries her will be in deep trouble!” Eli clicked his tongue.

He had thought that it would only be a few questions, but he didn’t expect this woman to ask him for almost half an hour. Moreover, the woman would always argue until her face was red and then lower her head in shame.

As for the woman’s question, Eli didn’t really feel anything.

If one could basically read all the books in the library, one could easily answer all the questions. Of course, this might require a bit of memory and the ability to link the knowledge together.

It just so happened that Eli had that ability.

However, she was really quite beautiful, just a little stupid. She always had to think for a long time to solve some problems.

Who knew what Hila would think if she knew about Eli’s evaluation?

...

“Is that Hila? Why is she in the library? ”

Just as the carriage left, a plain and ancient carriage slowly stopped in front of the library.

Scholar Clement got off the carriage with a happy expression and saw Hila, who had just left. He could not help but feel a little confused.

He knew Hila, but she probably did not know him. He had once seen this famous new female scholar at the Grand Scholar’s Banquet, and she was indeed very attractive.

He felt that he was inferior in some aspects.

However, why would this scholar come to the library? Was she here to look for information?

Clement was a little confused, but his confusion only lasted for a few seconds before he was buried by another matter.

He quickly walked toward the library and entered it.

“It seems that the beautiful lady has missed him. Will she come again? ” When the guard saw Clement, he guessed that Hila had not found scholar Clement and had missed him. He wondered if he would be able to see that beautiful lady again.

However, since he had not found her, why did Hila still go up for more than half an hour, and when she came out, she seemed to have lost her soul?

This made the guard a little puzzled.

...

Clement entered the library and quickly went up to the second floor.

He went straight to his office and pushed the door open without even checking if there was anyone inside.

Then, he saw eli holding his cup and drinking his tea.

If it was any other time, he might have said a few words, but today, he was not in the mood for that.

“Eli, go back and pack your things. In three days, we’ll set off for the Lorraine Kingdom!” clement said quickly.

Eli was confused.

At this moment, Eli was holding his teacher’s teacup and enjoying his high-grade tea leaves. When he heard this news, he was also dumbfounded.

Pack up?

The Lorraine kingdom?

What was he doing?

“Teacher, what happened?” asked eli as he put down his teacup.

“Hmph, you don’t know this, but I’m actually on the list for this visit. Sigh, as expected, my hard work over the years has been seen. I heard that even the famous female scholar of the Empire, Hila, was not selected. As expected, your teacher still has a status.” Clement said proudly as if he hadn’t been this happy in a long time.

Eli raised his brows. ‘he actually got chosen.

‘When did reality become so magical?’

“Who is the Marquis leading the team this time?” After some thought, Eli asked.

“It’s marquis Alina.”

Well, the case was solved.

Eli immediately understood what was going on.

Alina was friends with his teacher.

“As expected of you, teacher. This is the Empire’s recognition of you!” Of course, Eli would definitely not tell the truth. Instead, he just flattered him.

“Of course.” upon hearing this, scholar clement was obviously happier and said, “I’ll give you a day off today. Go and pack, but don’t bring too many things. ”

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

He had been thinking that there were no foreign materials, but here he was.

Moreover, they would be following the Empire’s patrol team, so their safety was very guaranteed. They could also go to foreign countries to experience the local customs and broaden their horizons, and it was for a public fee.

He had no reason to refuse such a good deal.

The experience was also very important to a wizard.

Moreover, he should go out and take a look.

For more than eight years, he had never left Junlin for more than a few kilometers. It was time for him to go out.

He had immortality and he wasn’t going to coop up in Junlin for a few hundred years. That would be too boring.
