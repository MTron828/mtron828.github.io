322 Bloodline Avatars

Moore City!

A city at the border between the hourglass and the bloodline tower. Other than being used to collect nearby resources, it was also used as an outpost to monitor the hourglass.

Today was a very ordinary day. All the guards stood on the city wall and looked into the distance, even feeling a little sleepy.

Suddenly, a dark cloud in the distant sky dispersed.

In the dark clouds, countless thunderclouds rolled. A huge Thunder Eagle flapped its wings, carrying a storm and lightning, flying over like a god.

Even though it was a few kilometers away, everyone could clearly see its 300-meter-long body. The pressure it brought about made everyone’s breathing quicken.

“What’s that?”

“Oh my God! How can there be such a huge lightning Eagle!”

“I’ve seen a third circle creature like this before, but it was only a few dozen meters long. Could this be a fourth-circle creature? And it’s coming from the direction of the hourglass. Could it be theirs?”

One by one, the guards instantly woke up. Their eyes were filled with the sight of this enormous body.

Was this the first time they had seen such a powerful creature?

The people in the city also saw this huge body. Many warlocks immediately looked over. All of them were nervous and excited.

But a few seconds later, their excitement turned into fear.

“Oh my God, it’s flying in our direction!”

A Warlock’s eyes were filled with fear.

The giant lightning Eagle in the distance flapped its wings and flew over.

“Run!”

In an instant, many warlocks who were watching the show immediately understood the severity of the situation. One by one, they jumped off the building and ran outside. Some hid in the basement.

However, before they could run, they suddenly realized that the ground under their feet had turned black.

When they looked up, the huge Eagle had already arrived outside the city.

However, to everyone’s surprise, the eagle did not stop.

With just a flap of its wings, countless lightning bolts gathered automatically. Thousands of lightning bolts were already smashing toward the city, instantly turning the city into a sea of lightning.

The lightning wreaked havoc, and hundreds of warlocks who were struck were turned into ashes. Buildings collapsed one after another, and the ground was charred black.

Countless spells were used, but they were of little use.

With just one attack, nearly a thousand people in the city had died!

Fortunately, the giant Eagle did not seem to have any intention of stopping. It continued to fly south after a casual attack.

As the lightning Eagle flew away, the warlocks in the ruins climbed out and looked at the city, which was almost destroyed.

“We’re finished!”

A Warlock knelt on the ground and immediately sent a message to the bloodline tower.

A fourth circle lightning Eagle!

This is bad!

..

Soon, the news of a 1000-feet-long giant Thunder Eagle flying toward the South reached the bloodline tower.

Aisha, Nikola, and the other bloodline warlocks were all shocked.

After that, they instantly guessed the giant Eagle’s identity. It wasn’t a 4th-circle magic beast but a 4th-circle celestial warlock’s bloodline avatar.

For a time, everyone was in a panic.

In the bloodline tower.

Dozens of people were sitting in a circle and discussing!

“What are your thoughts?” Aisha looked at the crowd with a serious expression.

“I feel that we can’t do anything in front of a celestial. And looking at that form, I’m afraid that this Gaido is not a new celestial.” One of the warlocks said through gritted teeth.

“Furthermore, even the headquarters didn’t manage to kill him back then. I’m afraid he has other powerful means!”

The warlocks all had fear on their faces as if Gaido had already arrived.

“My Lord, may I ask you a question?” A Warlock suddenly asked.

“Speak!”

“Lord Herman, is he a celestial or not?” The Warlock asked cautiously, and the others also looked over curiously.

After all, other than the crater, there was no direct evidence to indicate Eli’s identity. Furthermore, he had never revealed his strength, which made them a little uncertain!

“Yes!” Aisha said straightforwardly.

Upon hearing this, their faces seemed to relax a little, but they were still a little worried.

“I’ve already reported this to my Lord. I’ll leave the rest to Lord Herman. We can’t interfere in this matter. Let’s end the meeting.” Aisha shook her head, indicating that everyone could leave.

The crowd nodded.

Indeed, they had no choice but to believe in Sir Herman.

..

“So soon?”

In the secret realm, Eli put down the information in his hand and stood up. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

...

“Milord, what happened?” Doggo came over and asked curiously.

“The celestial warlock of the hourglass is here!” Eli said calmly.

“What? Celestial?” Doggo was shocked. He walked left and right anxiously. A few seconds later, he said, “Eli, why don’t we run? you just advanced after all!”

Eli, “…”

He kicked Doggo lightly and said angrily, “Are you that unconfident in me?”

“No.” Doggo got up, but he was still a little worried.

After all, Eli was his only support and it would be completely gone if he died.

“Don’t worry, he’s injured. He’s not my match.” Elie said.

Doggo heaved a sigh of relief.

Not far away, Hydra opened its eyes and looked at Eli, as if it was asking if he needed his help.

“This time, I alone am enough!” Eli shook his head.

...

Hydra was definitely at the top of the 3rd circle, but Eli wanted him to stay away just in case he was killed by the warlock. It was a pity that he did not have anything suitable to help the Hydra level up.

“This is a perfect chance to test out my bloodline avatar!”

Eli stretched his body, then closed his eyes and adjusted his state.

..

The huge lightning Eagle streaked across the sky above the West Coast.

Countless cities along the way suffered heavy losses because of its casual attack and panic spread.

Under the intentional promotion of the hourglass, the entire West Coast already knew the identity of the giant Thunder Eagle. Moreover, Gaido seemed to be deliberately flying in more places, not directly towards the bloodline tower.

The purpose was obvious, it was to create momentum.

Gaido wanted everyone to know that they had returned.

Many people also understood that after this war, there would only be one force left on the West Coast. It would either be the bloodline tower expanding its territory, or West Coast would return to the hourglass.

For Gaido, the journey took less than half a day, but he flew for three days.

..

Three days later.

Bloodline tower’s West Coast headquarters.

After hundreds of years of development, the buildings here stretched for miles and were divided into inner and outer layers. The inner layer was the former Urban area, and the outer layer was the vassal forces and institutions.

At this moment, there were thousands of warlocks and tens of thousands of ordinary service staff.

Suddenly, at a certain moment, there was a thunderous sound.

Everyone looked up.

Thunderclouds rolled in the sky, and a huge Thunderbird flew slowly. Its huge eyes stared at the bloodline tower in the distance with a cold gaze.

Countless bolts of purple-green lightning surrounded him as if the end of the world had arrived.

After a few days of ” demonstration, ” Gaido finally came to find Eli for the final battle.

Looking at the huge bird in the sky, everyone was dumbfounded.

The suppression made everyone fall silent, their hearts beating rapidly. Everyone felt a chill in their hearts, no one knew what would happen next.

However, all of a sudden, everyone felt a wave of fluctuation sweep through the entire bloodline tower, and the original suppression was swept away.

They looked up.

A person was flying in the sky far away.

In front of him was a huge Thunder Eagle, and behind him was a large area of thunderclouds and lightning. Even the surrounding 100 meters were filled with lightning, but his eyes were calm.

A large shadow behind him spread out like thick ink as if it was going to dye the sky Black. In the shadow, countless tentacles wriggled as if there was something terrifying inside.

The black shadow gradually covered the man, and when it disappeared again …

A huge Shadow Dragon appeared in the sky.

It was a typical Western Dragon-type creature. It was more than 1000 feet long, covered in pitch-black scales, and its golden vertical pupils exuded a breathtaking dragon’s might. It had two huge black wings on its back, and as it flapped, shadows followed it like shadows.

And around him, there were countless shadows intertwining.

The moment he appeared, the sky behind him turned black.

The shadow and the lightning separated the two sides of the sky.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Another celestial warlock!

And why was his body so huge?
