117 A Sudden Change

Rob was dead!

…

Just as the three of them entered.

Eli was also observing from the outside through his spiritual force seed. Actually, he wanted to communicate with them, but it seemed like they were not in the same dimension, so they could not communicate at all.

“David is in the garden, and Vivika seems to be in prison. As for Rob, he’s in a garden.” Eli observed three directions at the same time, memorizing everything.

However, at this moment, he realized that there seemed to be a problem on Rob’s side.

Rob was currently running around the Botanical Garden in a frenzy. He was surrounded by a large number of vines. Rob kept attacking his surroundings, but the vines were in hot pursuit.

A large number of vines?

Eli was stunned when he saw this scene because it was actually very rare for plants to have consciousness. Most plants did not have consciousness at all, even if it was high-level plant.

The vines seemed to be creatures from zero circle that had completely occupied the area.

As he watched Rob escape frantically, Eli’s mood relaxed.

First of all, he could rule out that the Botanical Garden was safe.

After all, it was impossible for other creatures to exist in a place occupied by the zero circle vines on such a large scale. As he watched Rob being swallowed by the plants, there was nothing he could do to help.

If he was a level 2 wizard apprentice, he might have a chance, but a level 1 wizard apprentice would never have a chance.

In just a dozen seconds, Rob’s connection was cut off.

Rob was the first to die.

On the other two sides.

David seemed to be in trouble.

…

“Damn it, damn it!”

In the small path, David frowned, unable to find his way.

He had been walking around for half an hour, but he was still there. He had no choice but to stop. What was wrong?

David’s mental power slowly quieted down, and a faint power began to emit. This was a mental detection technique that he had created himself, which allowed him to see many things that he could not.

Suddenly, he realized that a translucent object was following closely behind him.

Undead?

David was stunned, but he quickly recognized the creature.

The undead wasn’t much of a threat to an official wizard, but to an ordinary apprentice, it was deadly. It would be very dangerous for an ordinary apprentice to encounter the undead.

However, he still had his ways…

David took a deep breath and instantly pounced forward.

At the same time, a fireball flew straight at the spirit.

Bang!

The flames exploded.

The undead was instantly enveloped in flames, and David was also blown away by the impact because he was too close!

Painful howls were heard, and the undead let out shrill cries. David tried his best to cover his ears, but he could not help but bleed. It was really difficult to withstand the mental attack.

Fortunately, the undead was still a zero-circle creature. Otherwise, his head would have been blown off.

However, David was not in the mood to pay attention to this at the moment. He stared at the undead, wanting to see how it was doing. However, as the flames dissipated, he saw that the undead was only a little illusory.

The fireball did almost no damage.

David sighed.

In fact, ever since he became an apprentice, he had discovered that he had a special talent, which was that his mental strength naturally had a very strong sealing ability. However, he had never revealed it.

Today, it seemed that he had no choice but to reveal it.

David sighed and then opened his arms.

When the spirit saw him like this, it seemed to be even more excited. It howled and attacked him.

The sharp, translucent claws approached David as if they were going to tear him apart in the next second. However, in the next second, a special rune appeared in David’s eyes. At the same time, the air around him became illusory, and everything began to distort.

A run appeared and covered the spirit in an instant. Then, in the blink of an eye, the spirit disappeared from his sight.

Sealing the undead seemed to have taken a lot of his strength, and he fell to the ground, unable to move.

However, with the disappearance of the undead, the path in front of them was finally clear, revealing a Castle not far away.

“What is this?”

…

“Is that an ability rune?”

On the other side, Eli’s eyes widened as he witnessed the scene just now.

The ability rune was a very special type of rune. Some extremely talented Magi might have it, and it often had power that far exceeded ordinary runes. Every ability rune was extremely precious.

Saleen metatrin’s books mentioned that the number of mages who possessed ability runes was one in ten thousand.

He did not expect David to have such a talent.

Eli was a little envious. After all, it was a precious thing.

However, it was better to wait for David to come out first.

Of the three, Vivika was the luckiest. She didn’t encounter any danger along the way and walked straight out.

What was more interesting was that she saw David lying not far away as soon as she came out.

The prison was right next to the garden.

“It seems that the danger here is very low!”

Outside, Eli shook his head. Although the three of them looked like they were in danger, if a first circle Mage went in, there would be no danger at all.

The vines could be dealt with a fireball, and the spirits could be dealt with easily.

If there really wasn’t any danger, then Eli really didn’t know what to say. After all, before entering, no one knew what was going on inside. It was just a coincidence that the two students were safe.

So he wasted ten years. That was nothing.

…

“David, are you okay?”

When David woke up, he saw Vivika beside him.

“That was close.” Seeing that it was Vivika, David shook his head to relieve the intense pain in his head. The seal just now had exceeded the scope of his ability. If there were any other undead, he would be dead.

David took a moment to recover, then got up on his own and saw the castle not far away.

“What is that?” David asked.

“I don’t know. I saw the castle when I came out of the prison. I don’t know what it is!” Vivika shook her head, and then asked with concern, “David, are you okay?”

“It’s fine. I’ll go there and take a look after I rest for a while.” David shook his head. He knew that everything was being seen by Eli.

Up until now, how could they not understand why Eli was taking in a disciple? However, they did not have any complaints. After all, if it weren’t for Eli back then, they might not have been able to live until now.

Half an hour later.

The two of them looked at each other and then walked towards the castle.

The journey was relatively smooth, and the two of them soon arrived in front of the castle.

This was an ancient castle that occupied a large area. What was even more outrageous was that the door was open, and there were some other things placed in the ancient castle.

A huge photostone was placed in it.

Through his spiritual force seed, Eli saw this scene and was also stunned.

If he was not mistaken, the items in the castle were books and some black stones, which should be magic stones, the currency of the mages.

“What’s the meaning of this?”

Even Eli was stunned.

However, it wasn’t just Eli who was dumbfounded. David and Vivika were also in a daze.

Shouldn’t the path ahead be filled with danger? They should have gone through many dangers to get what their teacher wanted, but now, it seemed that everything was in the castle.

What was the meaning of this?!

At this moment, he seemed to have felt something.

The photostone suddenly flashed, and an illusionary scene slowly appeared.

An old man slowly appeared on the screen. He was wearing a gray mage’s robe, and there was no light in his eyes as if his life was coming to an end. In his right hand, there was a magic staff.

He looked ahead as if he was lamenting and sorrowful.

Then, he glanced at Vivika and David, who had arrived, and frowned in dissatisfaction. However, he seemed to have sensed the mental energy seeds in their heads.

His eyes immediately lit up.

At the same time, Vivika and David felt dizzy. When they came back to their senses, they had already returned to the valley. There was nothing in front of them, not even the bronze door. Even their teacher, Layton, had disappeared.

Vivika: “…”

David: “…”

The two of them looked at each other. What had happened? How did they get out?

And most importantly, where was their teacher?

…

Just a few seconds ago.

Eli was originally watching this scene through his spiritual force seed, wanting to see what it was.

Suddenly, he saw the old man on the screen glance at him, and then his eyes lit up.

Eli was shocked because he had a strange feeling that this old man seemed to be looking at him.

Eli felt that something was amiss and immediately prepared to cut off the connection, but in the next second, the bronze door was instantly activated. Eli did not even last a second before he was sucked away by the bronze door.

So, when Eli felt a dizzying sense of spatial transfer, his mental strength stabilized, and he found himself standing outside the castle, where Vivika and David were last seen.

At this moment, the old man in the image on the photostone finally smiled.

“Hello!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

“Hello!” The old man in the photostone replied with a smile.

He looked harmonious, but Eli took a deep breath. This time, he might have seen a ghost.

A photostone was a common item used to store images in the mage’s world. Generally speaking, it was not very precious, but it was rare to see a photostone as big as this one.

A photostone was mainly used to record stuff but what was the old man recording?

Could this be the original owner of the arcane realm, the great celestial sorcerer? Eli suddenly felt that he was not cautious enough. He didn’t enter the secret realm, but he was sucked in instead.

“Hello, I’m the master of this place, Nick Zimerman, Five-circle celestial sorcerer.” The old man spoke again.

Eli was numb!

What’s going on? Is the celestial mage still alive?Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
