Chapter 7: Suggestion

Translator: Lonelytree

“The timing is just right!”

Eli panted heavily as he came to the library’s changing room.

A weak body was an inevitable weakness of a mage in the early stages. Although the apprentice stage could also increase one’s physical strength, the increase was relatively limited. There was still a certain gap between them and the Knights.

There was a magic potion in Saleen Metatrin’s notes that could directly raise a wizard’s physique to that of a high-level Knight, but most of the ingredients were things that Eli had never even heard of before, let alone concocting.

He didn’t even have the most basic crystal ball for the Wizards.

He was probably the poorest wizard in history.

‘When I have money, I’ll definitely make a good crystal ball for myself first.’ Eli fantasized.

However, he could only think about it for now. After all, the price of crystals was not low.

“Eli, you were almost late.”

There were other people in the changing room. Roland, a handsome 16-year-old boy with black hair and blue eyes, was his new friend of Eli. He was also the nephew of a Baron, and his father was a small businessman.

“There was a slight delay today,” Eli said with a smile.

Roland had only arrived last month, so he was not a competitor to Eli at all. In addition, Eli was rather gentle, so their relationship was naturally not too bad.

“that’s good. I was worried that something had happened to you.” Roland was relieved to see that, and then he came over and asked, “How are your preparations for the test?”

There was a test every six months, and he had to take it a few months later, so he was more concerned about this.

“It’s alright. I’m still quite confident.”

Although that was what Eli said on the surface, in reality, his progress was probably the slowest out of everyone. After all, meditation took up most of his free time, so he naturally did not have much time left for learning.

Therefore, in the next half a month, he would reduce the time he spent meditating and shift his attention to studying.

“Good luck then.” Roland encouraged him and walked out.

Although he felt that Eli was a good friend, in terms of the knowledge he had, he didn’t seem to be that good. There was a high chance that Eli would be eliminated.

It was a pity.

Looking at the complicated expression in Roland’s eyes, Eli naturally understood what it meant.

It couldn’t be helped. He really didn’t know much before coming to this world.

‘I’ll work hard for half a month. I want to stay at the Imperial Library!’ For some reason, Eli thought of this sentence and smiled.

Half a month’s time was enough.

After changing into a red vest and black pants, Eli stood in front of the mirror.

In the mirror, there was a handsome young man with black hair and eyes as deep as the night. Although his facial features were not particularly outstanding, he looked very comfortable.

After briefly tidying up his appearance, Eli walked out with a smile.

Today, he didn’t need to be in charge of receiving people outside. He only needed to organize the bookshelves.

The work in the library wasn’t difficult, but one had to have certain qualities. Otherwise, the gentlemen and ladies would only think that this place was too low-end and wouldn’t come here.

Time always passed quickly at work.

In the blink of an eye, it was afternoon.

The orange setting sun shone through the glass dome, dyeing the library red. Together with the sculptures and murals on the walls, it was as beautiful as a painting, which was one of the features of the Imperial Library.

Eli stretched his body, looked at the neatly arranged bookshelves in front of him, and smiled.

The working hours of an official administrator were usually only half a day, but part-time jobs like theirs were all day long. However, seeing that the test was about to begin, scholar Clement allowed them to stay in the library after the afternoon to read until the library closed.

“What should I study?” Eli was in a difficult position.

The Imperial Library was the largest library in the Bryne Empire. There were more than tens of thousands of books in the library. They were as vast as the stars, and there was a variety of books. From music to mathematics, from the ocean to astronomy, from history to the human body.

The host’s knowledge about the test was limited. He was not familiar with the test because he was too focused on becoming a mage. It would be difficult to find a suitable book to read from the hundreds of thousands of books.

Just then, a man in a black robe walked out of a room dozens of meters away. It was scholar Clement.

Eli’s eyes lit up. Wasn’t this the best person to ask for advice?

He immediately walked over with small steps. Scholar Clement also saw him and stopped. He asked curiously, “Do you need something?”

The library was a relatively independent Department compared to the Empire. Scholar Clement relied on his knowledge step by step to reach his current position, so he was not as arrogant as the nobles.

“good day, scholar. I’d like to ask what I should study for the test. ” Eli asked directly without beating around the bush.

“Eh?”

Scholar Clement looked at Eli with a strange expression.

Although he didn’t announce it, he was actually one of the question-setters. So, at this moment, Eli’s question was like asking the answer from the examiner, so it was no wonder his expression was strange.

“What’s your name?” Clement asked curiously. It was not a secret, so he was not very strict.

“Scholar, my name is Eli Lucifer.”

‘Eli’ was just his name. The full name of the original host was ‘Eli Lucifer’.

“That’s a good name,” Clement nodded. “you can read on history and heraldry. These are very popular topics recently. There is also some general knowledge that you should read.”

“Yes, thank you, scholar.” Elie nodded in thanks.

“You’re welcome. Good luck.” Scholar Clement encouraged him and quickly left.

He couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He really wanted to laugh. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He had been a scholar for many years, but this was the first time someone had asked him directly.

In the state of mental power, Eli looked at the scholar’s slightly shrugging shoulders and the slightly upturned corners of his mouth, not understanding what had just happened.

‘He must have thought of something funny.’

However, this was not important. Knowing what to learn was just the first step. In the next half a month, he would have to absorb all the knowledge.

” The history of the Empire”, “the geography of the Empire”, ” heraldry of the nobles,” and “world encyclopedia.”

Soon, Eli found the right books, and after reporting, he brought the four books into a small reading room in the library.

In the reading room, Eli lit up a candle and put it on the lampshade, then began to read.

The candles were provided by the library, so it would be a waste not to use them.

Under the bright candlelight, Eli took a deep breath and quickly constructed the spiritual model of the Quick Memory Spell in his mind.

A few seconds later, a glimmer of light flashed through his eyes. He lowered his head, flipped open the book, and began to read.
