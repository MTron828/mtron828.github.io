389 Four Things

Achoo!

In the Grassi Land, Eli rubbed his nose.

” Eli, what happened? ” Doggo asked.

“I don’t know!”

Eli shook his head. At his stage, such basic life signs shouldn’t appear on his body. This time, perhaps someone was really talking about him.

“It should be the Eight-Armed Naga family!” Eli shook his head. As the news spread, the Eight-Armed Naga would not have time to pay attention to him for the time being.

At this moment, aside from Hydra, who was outside, Doggo, Nikola, and Hill were all in the Grassi Land.

Eli was in the mage Tower, and he could see Hill from afar through the window. She was emitting a faint life aura, and even the life aura of the Grassi Land had become much denser.

Looking at this scene, Ely felt relieved.

During this period of time, he had constantly been solving problems with various factions. Now, he had finally settled down.

He could also do his own things.

“Four things!” Eli pondered.

The first thing was naturally to increase his strength. This had always been the core.

He needed a new potion formula. He had a few, but they weren’t suitable for him. He would have to go to the Golden Cicada Trade Union to buy them. He believed that there would be a lot of things in this area. With the formula, he might be able to rely on Hill to increase his strength.

Of course, the power of faith could also increase his strength. Speaking of which, Eli’s power of faith had been restored really fast recently. Following the conquest of the Manticore family, Eli’s name spread rapidly. A portion of it had provided new power of faith, and the second one was almost full.

Even without the magic potion, his strength would not increase too slowly, but Eli gave up on this idea.

Although the power of faith was useful, he felt that the potential of the power of faith was far more than that. He wanted to see if he could research something new or perhaps some power that belonged to him alone.

This was also the second thing that Eli wanted to do.

The third matter was about Vivika and David.

There was no need to say anything more about Vivika. Her soul contract was still there, and Eli could sense that she was within the range of the Bloodline Tower.

However, Eli was puzzled about David.

David, the first student who had followed Eli back then, was also Vivika’s senior. He was extremely talented.

When he left with Vivika and entered the West Coast, the two of them split up. One chose the path of a warlock, while the other chose the path of a mage.

According to time, David should have died. If he had chosen the path of a mage, he would never have reached the fifth circle, and he would not have been able to live until now.

But the problem was that David’s mark was still there!

However, Eli could not sense his aura. He could only sense that the soul was very cold and even chaotic. Eli even felt that David was no longer human.

” It seems like something happened! ” Eli shook his head. He wasn’t even sure if David was still alive!

He would send someone to investigate, but there was a high chance that there would be no clues. After all, if David were still around, he would be more than two thousand years old.

“This is getting interesting!” Eli shook his head and didn’t care.

However, no matter what, the mark was still there. Even if David really appeared in front of him, he was not afraid at all!

He even looked forward to that day.

Of course, he did not know if that day would come.

Eli shook his head. All of this was too far away. He had to focus on the present. When he found Vivika, he proceeded with the fourth task, which was also very important to him, which was to modify the Bloodline Tower.

To the Mages of the past, every Mage had a huge organization supporting them, providing them with assistance!

The Bloodline Tower was only a Warlock force, so he planned to spend some time making the Bloodline Tower a Warlock force that could serve him. In the long run, this was even more important than the first three tasks.

After all, there were so many things that Eli needed the help of others.

“There’s still a long way to go! “Eli sighed.

He was also very curious about the future of a Warlock force that had been transformed into a Mage and what kind of sparks would erupt with other forces?

This was an interesting proposition.

Of course, this required a lot of resources. Coincidentally, the resources sent by the Amina family last time could be used.

However, before that, Eli had to find Vivika while he had time. He was also curious about Vivika’s current state.

Thinking of this, Eli walked out of the Grassi Grounds. Doggo followed and asked, “Eli, where are you going?”

“Picking up an acquaintance!”

Eli replied softly and flew out.

“Acquaintance?” Doggo blinked his mechanical eyes in confusion.

In the distance, Nikola narrowed his eyes.

Acquaintance? Who could it be?

…

But what he did not expect was…

Half a day later, Eli returned with a child.

“Sir, is this the acquaintance you mentioned?”

Nikola stood in front of Eli and looked at the girl in front of him!

The girl was about seven or eight years old. She had black hair, round eyes, and a chubby face. She looked very cute. At this moment, she was hiding behind Eli’s body timidly, as if she was a little afraid.

Nikola was a little confused.

...

This was the acquaintance that Eli had mentioned?! How could he be familiar with a seven or eight-year-old girl?

“This child comes from a small family in the Bloodline Tower, the Anas family. This family was the family Vivika chose when she came to the Central Mainland.” Eli said to Nikola as he patted the girl’s head behind him.

“Vivika’s family?” Nikola’s eyes widened. He obviously didn’t expect this.

” Is this little girl a descendant of Vivika? ” Nikola wanted to get closer, but the girl held on tightly to Eli’s pants and retreated a little more.

“Barely,” Eli replied.

The speed of a celestial was extremely fast, so it only took Ely an hour to reach the area where the soul brand had sensed and found Vivika.

However, Vivika’s situation was completely different from what Ely had imagined. Her soul had indeed existed in her bloodline and had continued until now, but it seemed that only her soul essence was the same. There was nothing else related to Vivika.

To be specific, it was equivalent to reincarnation.

In a sense, they could even be considered two people.

Of course, it wasn’t like she didn’t bring anything with her. At least the girl’s soul had been passed down from generation to generation, and she was very talented. However, there were some things that Eli wasn’t sure about, so he still brought the child back.

As for the patriarch of the Anas family, when he heard that he was Eli, he naturally agreed. He was just short of kneeling on the ground. After all, Eli was a fourth-circle big shot.

...

“Barely?” The corner of Nikola’s mouth twitched. That was an ambiguous answer.

“Then what is this child’s name?” He asked curiously again.

“Vivika.” Eli glanced at him and turned to look at the little girl.

He still remembered that she had met this little girl in a dilapidated wooden house. Her parents had long died. If Ely hadn’t gone, this child might have starved to death in a few days. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was very normal. Even the Warlock family could not escape from the fate of poverty. There were also many who starved to death.

This was also the reason why Eli wanted to transform this force. Ely hoped that with the help of the mages, at least everyone would not starve to death.

This girl did not seem to have a name, so Eli still called her Vivika.

Eli squatted down gently and looked at the little girl in front of him. He asked, “From now on, you’ll be called Vivika. Follow me, okay? ”

“Okay!” The girl blinked.

Even though she hadn’t had any contact with this stranger, she felt an instinctive sense of security when she saw him.

In the distance, Nikola took a deep breath.

If this girl had nothing to do with Vivika, then he would not be an undead!

“Nikola!” Suddenly, Eli turned around.

“My lord!” Nikola was surprised.

“From now on, I’ll leave you to take care of Vivika’s daily life.” Eli stood up with a smile.

“Ah!”

Nikola opened his mouth wide.
