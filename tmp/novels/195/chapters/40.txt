Chapter 41: The End

The shed skin of the hundred transformation beast!

Saleen’s notes recorded this item. It was an item left behind by a creature called the hundred transformation beast after it had grown naturally. Although this magic beast was not very powerful, it was very difficult to capture because it had extremely strong concealment and transformation abilities.

It was the same for its shed skin, which had the same extraordinary characteristics.

This might just be what Eli needed.

Ever since he found out from Saleen Metatrin that the first king might be a wizard, Eli felt that he needed to improve his hidden abilities. After all, he did not want his identity as a wizard to be accidentally exposed one day.

This thing was destined to be his.

After deciding on the first item, he continued to move deeper into the warehouse, picking through the marquis’ collection one by one.

Ignoring the non-magical items, Eli’s eyes were like torches as he searched for the items he might need.

However, the final result was a little disappointing for Eli. Other than the shed skin, there was almost nothing else that was of interest to him. This was normal. After all, the empire was only a kingdom of knights, and the things of the wizards were relatively rare.

He could only pick two that were barely acceptable.

Finally, Eli walked out of the warehouse with the three items.

They were the shed skin of the hundred transformation beast, a material that could match the shed skin and the spiritual wood that he first saw.

He planned to use the first two to create a concealment Wizard, and he planned to craft a magic staff out of the wood.

As Eli came out, he explained to the Butler what he had taken away. The Butler only memorized it and didn’t say anything. After all, it wasn’t his.

” yes, count Gimori is already waiting for you on the other side. I’ll take you to him. ” The Butler said politely.

“Alright!” Eli nodded and followed the butler.

After a few hundred meters, Eli saw a carriage from afar. It was the carriage that count Gimori had brought him in. count Gimori was standing to the side, and beside him was another person that Eli had not seen for a long time.

“Eh, Eli? You’re here?” Alex was chatting with count Gimori when he saw his butler walking over with Eli, and a surprised expression immediately appeared on his face.

“I came here with the count,” Eli replied in surprise, not expecting to run into Alex.

“Yes, I did bring him here.” Count Gimori laughed as he spoke.

Alex was immediately confused.

Coincidentally, he had come to his family’s manor today. On the way, he ran into count Gimori, who had saved his father’s life. Naturally, he could not pretend not to see him, so he took the initiative to talk to him and thank him.

But when he asked the count’s purpose, the count just laughed it off and said that he was there to see the marquis. Alex did not manage to get any details.

Now that he had encountered Eli, he was a little lost.

In his impression, Eli was a student of scholar Clement, who was extremely good at dancing and seemed to be very good at taming horses. He had a good impression of Eli, but why would he appear in their family’s territory?

He couldn’t figure it out at all!

“Well, since Eli is here, we’ll take our leave.” count Gimori said to the bewildered Alex before taking the lead to board the carriage.

“Goodbye!” Eli also smiled at Alex, then got into the carriage.

Then, the coachman whipped the horse, and the carriage left along the road.

Alex stood where he was without moving as if he were contemplating the entire situation.

“Butler, do you know what count Gimori and Eli were here for? ” Alex asked.

“Young master, I don’t know either. If you want to know, I think you can ask the old master!” The Butler reminded him with his signature politeness.

‘Should he ask his father?’

Alex felt that this shouldn’t be a big deal, but if he didn’t get to the bottom of this, he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night, so he turned around and headed back to the castle.

Not long after, he arrived at the castle, the place where Eli and the Marquis had been chatting.

“Father.” In the room, Alex saw his father.

“what are you doing here?” marquis Alina asked in confusion. He had just been treated and seemed to be feeling much better.

“Father, I have something to ask you. ” Alex didn’t try to hide anything and directly asked the question he had just been wondering.

Alex waited for his father’s answer, but the marquis didn’t seem to have any intention of answering him. Instead, he stood up from his chair and walked to the window.

“Son, you’re the future head of the family. I shouldn’t say this, but I think you should have the ability to think for yourself.” marquis Alina looked at Alex with a meaningful expression.

Alex furrowed his brows, not quite understanding.

” let me tell you something. The person I just met was Eli, not Count Gimori. ” marquis Alina sighed and said.

Alex was truly shocked this time, and he was about to ask, but Marquis Alina waved his hand, signaling him to leave.

“I’ve already said a lot. You can think about it yourself.”

helpless, Alex could only leave.

Alex’s brows furrowed as he pondered over his father’s words while walking along the castle’s long corridor.

Was it a special meeting with Eli? at this time?

As he walked, Alex’s eyes suddenly lit up, and his mouth gradually fell open. He seemed to understand why his father wanted to see Eli, but this was a little too shocking.

“ridiculous!”

Alex took a few deep breaths before calming down. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

To think that he had been thanking count Gimori for so long. no wonder he kept smiling when he heard it. It turned out that the person who had saved him was not Count Gimori, but Eli.

He finally understood.

“my silly son!” On the other side, Marquis Alina could see the departing carriage of Eli and the others through the window, and then he sighed deeply.

This son of his was actually already very outstanding in all aspects, but he was still lacking in one aspect. He was balanced but not outstanding, and he did not have the ability to think independently.

When he thought of Eli, who had just chatted with him, he suddenly felt a sense of disparity. He sighed. “looks like I’ll have to send Alex to the mine for a while to train.”

Poor Alex didn’t know that his question had given him a lot of work.

…

On the other side.

After the carriage sent Eli home, it left with count Gimori.

Eli looked at his house in front of him with mixed feelings.

He had gained a lot from this trip.

It was not just those few items. More importantly, he had obtained information about Saleen Metatrin from Marquis Alina. This wizard might have been the first king of the Bryne Empire.

In the eyes of a Magus, the power of authority should have been of no value to Saleen Metatrin, who was at least a level three apprentice or even an official Magus and above. However, he had established this country.

All that just to find something?

Eli was also a little interested in the thing Saleem was talking about.

However, there was no other information for the time being, and he did not have any clues either. Eli decided to put this matter aside for the time being and wait until he advanced to a level 2 apprentice.

The problem of the purple iris flowers had been solved, and he could continue with his magic potions. He also needed to refine the item he had obtained from the marquis into a wizard tool.

“I’ll be busy from now on, but fortunately, I’ll be on my own.”

Shaking his head, Eli walked into the house.
