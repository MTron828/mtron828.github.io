318 Collina’s Despair

The Roya mountains.

It was a huge mountain range that stretched for hundreds of thousands of miles. The peaks gathered in the middle of the mountain range, and the end of the mountain range could not be seen. There were many magical beasts and other intelligent races that were left behind from the mage era. It was dangerous. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was also the boundary that separated the central continent and the West Coast. If one wanted to reach the central continent, one would have to pass through this place. Unless they took an airship or other items, ordinary warlocks would not be able to pass through it.

At this moment, at the edge of the mountain range.

A figure trembled as he walked out.

His hair was messy like weeds, and he was wearing a golden Sorcerer’s robe. There were several big holes in the robe, which could only cover his private parts.

His body trembled as he walked out of the mountain range. His face was filled with unconcealable joy.

What was even more shocking was that he was a Warlock at the peak of his third ring.

“I’m finally out!” Collina pushed aside his hair, which had not been washed for years, and looked at the sky.

Ten years!

A full ten years!

Ten years ago, he had taken an airship to the West Coast. After communicating with Herman and obtaining the magic potion to remove the curse, he returned immediately. However, he did not expect that on the way, he would be attacked by an intelligent race in the Roya mountain range. They destroyed the airship and then captured and imprisoned him.

This imprisonment lasted for more than nine years.

A few months ago, they had tried to attack the passing airships again.

But who would’ve thought that there would be four half-step celestial warlocks in the ship? They failed, and he finally took the opportunity to escape. He then spent a few more months trying to escape.

“No, I have to hurry back.”

Collina took a deep breath and touched his abdomen. There was a hard object inside. It was the crystal that he had hidden in his body to avoid being searched.

Herman said it could remove the curse.

He naturally understood the importance of this.

“But …” Collina’s body was trembling.

It had already been ten years!

Who knew what had happened in the past ten years? he didn’t even know if Lord Jin Ji was dead or alive. He had nothing now and couldn’t contact him.

If Jin Ji died, then he was the culprit!

“Let’s go back first.”

He gritted his teeth and quickly set off towards the nearest city.

Three days later.

He finally saw a city!

“Holmes city!”

He raised his head and saw a city not far away. It was surrounded by a Black Wall that was nearly a hundred meters tall. There were faint red bloodstains on the wall, and below it was a huge city gate.

Outside the city gate, two first-circle warlocks were wearing black armor and silver helmets like Knights. They also had long swords at their waists.

Outside the door, warlocks and humans were coming in and out. Most of the warlocks were wearing leather armor and holding all kinds of close-range weapons in their hands. They were not covered by any spell formations.

Seeing this scene, Collina only pouted slightly and said, ” it seems like the factions here have adapted to melee weapons.”

In his opinion, this was the regression of time. Before he came here, people still wore wizard robes and the like, but now they were wearing leather and armor.

Without alchemy techniques, these weapons were indeed more powerful in defense.

He walked directly towards the city gate, and the people on the road all moved away when they saw him.

When he arrived at the city gate, the two guards saw him.

“Two magic stones to enter the city!” One of the guards said.

Magic stones?

Collina was penniless at the moment. Where would he get magic stones?

But he couldn’t force his way in!

Collina hesitated. Suddenly, someone stepped forward and placed four magic stones on the table.

“I’ll pay for this, Sir!”

Collina turned around. He was a young man with black hair and black eyes. He was dressed plainly, and the only thing that stood out was his bright eyes.

He was a little surprised.

However, after paying, the guards urged the two to hurry in.

The two of them quickly walked in.

“Young man, thank you. I will return your magic stones, but I am in a hurry now. I don’t have time. If you need help, come to the headquarters of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce in the Western Region. Remember, my name is Collina.”

Collina quickly said to the young man and left.

What he lacked the most right now was time.

The young man seemed to be excited as he watched him leave. He found the Warlock’s robe a little familiar. He had seen the upper echelons of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce wear it by chance, so he was ready to take a gamble.

It seemed that he had made the right bet this time.

..

On the other side.

As soon as he entered the city, Collina ran straight to the branch of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce.

...

Soon, he arrived at his destination.

After showing off his strength and name, the middle-aged store manager immediately made arrangements for him to change his clothes and other things.

“Arrange an airship for me to the headquarters in the Western Region!” Collina said.

“Yes, my Lord.” The middle-aged store manager nodded. He looked at the third circle warlock who had just finished washing up and asked tentatively, “Sir, are you Sir Jin Ji’s man?”

Collina’s eyes widened, and his third-circle aura burst out. “What do you mean by that?”

The store manager hurriedly waved his hand. “Sir, I don’t have any ill intentions. It’s just that I remember that Sir Jin Ji seems to be dying. Is he about to be abandoned? Why are you here at this time?”

“What!”

Collina’s eyes widened as he exclaimed in shock.

..

Three hours later.

An airship took off from the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce and flew away.

...

In the airship, Collina was extremely anxious.

After the exchange, he completely understood Lord Jin Ji’s situation. The curse from back then was getting stronger. Now, it was almost impossible to awaken Jin Ji’s bloodline and he was about to become a cripple. Although he was very talented, the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce was about to give up on him.

“I hope master Herman didn’t lie to me.” He touched the hard crystal on his stomach and prayed.

This was his last hope.

Of course, he also hoped that Lord Jin Ji would be able to hold on.

He felt a little depressed at the moment, so he silently went to the window of the airship.

He looked down.

At this moment, they were flying on a desolate land.

On the ground, there were huge towers as high as 100 meters. One could be seen every ten miles, which was once the way of long-distance communication in the mage world.

As for now, apart from a small number of forces that communicated with each other through things from the mage era, the rest basically relied on walking.

On the way, Collina saw a volcano covered by a huge mage weapon. It was now abandoned and used to change the weather. Huge mechanical dolls had collapsed on the ground and were corroded into rust. The floating city that had fallen on the ground was used as a gathering place …

There were so many of them, and Collina could only sigh as he looked at them.

They were regressing.

After a thousand years, the Mage world would most likely become a Warlock world!

How sad!

Five days later, Collina finally arrived at his destination.

It was a city located on a floating island, but the floating island lacked the coverage of a spell formation. At this time, it was laughably inserted into the ground. This was the headquarters of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce in the Western Region, the City of Gold and silver!

After entering, Collina got off the airship.

He quickly moved forward on the familiar road, ignoring the bustling streets on both sides. He soon arrived at the villa area in the center. Jin Ji used to live here.

There were guards here, and outsiders were not allowed to enter.

The guards were two first-circle warlocks, and they were standing outside with worried expressions.

Collina walked over and coughed twice. The two guards looked up.

“Lord Collina,” The guard looked at the person who had arrived and was extremely shocked.

“It’s me!” Collina nodded and said, “Take me to see his Excellency.”

“yes, but it seems like someone from the headquarters is coming. The guard hesitated for a moment.” They didn’t know where Jin Ji’s trusted aide had gone during the ten years he had disappeared.

“The headquarters?” Collina blinked.

..

In the end, the guard still led Collina to see Jin Ji.

After passing through a few roads, the group came to a villa area.

“This is the place where Lord Jin Ji is resting.” The guard said.

“It’s so lively!”

Collina squinted his eyes. There were dozens of people standing in front of the villa, many of whom were high-level officials of the Western Region branch and many of whom he didn’t know. Some of them should be from the headquarters.

Suddenly, the door of the villa in the distance opened.

A man walked out.

The man had golden hair and golden pupils. He was wearing a red-gold warlock’s robe. His body was round, and he looked like a typical Golden cicada sorcerer. However, his face was dark at the moment.

It was a golden-red Sorcerer’s robe.

Collina was a little shocked. In the Golden Toad Chamber of Commerce, only celestial warlocks were qualified to wear Warlock robes of this color. He could also imagine that such a person must be here for Lord Jin Ji.

But his expression was so ugly.

Could it be that his lord was already gone?

His body trembled as he slowly walked toward the villa.
