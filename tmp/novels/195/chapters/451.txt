452 The Shock of Gade and the Others

In the Golden Shrine!

Thank you readers!

The Mountain Giant King sat on the divine throne, but whether it was his hands that were tightly clenched on both sides of the throne or the deep shock in his eyes, it showed that he was not calm at the moment.

He even moved his body forward slightly, but after hesitating for a few seconds, he returned to his original position.

It wasn’t until Eli left his sight that he seemed to have let go. He sat down on the throne again and sighed deeply, “Forget it. It’s none of my business.”

“Let’s leave everything to time.”

..

On the other side.

Outside the giant city, Gade and the others were still waiting when they were suddenly woken up by a loud rumble!

The few of them reacted very quickly. Almost instantly, they determined that the sound came from the vicinity of the Golden Shrine and turned their heads to look.

“How is this possible?”

” F * ck, the giant tree in the mountain range has been pulled up. It’s still shrinking and flying toward the temple. ”

“Is Eli okay?”

The few of them were dumbfounded. The giant tree that was thousands of meters away suddenly left the ground and flew toward the Golden Shrine.

This was a terrifying creature that had surpassed the fourth circle realm, yet it was so defenseless. What exactly was in that temple?

And what had happened to Eli?

Are you alright?

The few of them looked at each other, not knowing what to do next!

However, in the next second, everyone saw a golden light flying towards them. Their eyes lit up.

“Eli!”

In the next second, they only felt their vision go black, and then they felt a powerful impact. When they woke up again, they found that they had already left the Mountain Giant World Fragment and were in outer space of the World. They were even dozens of kilometers away from the World Fragment!

“Sir, this is?” Gade shook his head. He was still confused!

The others were also confused.

Eli did not answer after bringing them out. He only looked at the world fragment in the distance.

Three minutes later!

Everyone could only see cracks appearing on the World Fragment in the distance. The surrounding space was also collapsing bit by bit, like a black hole. In the blink of an eye, the World Fragment shattered into thousands of fragments. Black fog spread out, but they were all melted in the spatial annihilation!

In between, Eli also saw a faint yellow color. Eli knew that it was the Mountain Giant King.

“Maybe I should ask for a name!”

Eli felt a little regretful!

At this moment, the others were all stunned. Their mouths were wide open as they watched this scene!

Even though they were experienced and knowledgeable, this was the first time they had seen a world fragment collapse again!

” There was a small accident. The exploration is over! ” After sighing with emotion, Eli turned to look at the few of them!

The few of them looked at each other again. In the end, Gade said, “The exploration is over. It’s indeed time to leave.”

Then, Gade handed the Flower of Eternal Night that Eli had left for him to keep.

Eli took it, then looked at everyone and said goodbye, “We’ll meet again if fate allows it. If you need help, you can find me at the Bloodline Tower!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Eli turned into an arc of light and disappeared from everyone’s sight, leaving behind a few people.

The few of them looked at Eli’s back as he left. After a few seconds, Stacy said slowly, “Everyone, don’t you want to know what happened in the temple? And what happened to the giant tree in the mountain range?”

Stacy narrowed her eyes and looked at them as if she had some thoughts.

“Stacy, I advise you not to have any evil thoughts. We’ve already gained enough this time. If it weren’t for Eli, you wouldn’t have gotten so many resources!” Gade said bluntly.

“That’s right. You can’t be too greedy.”

” Indeed, at least I didn’t have the courage to cross the giant trees in the mountain range! ”

The other two smiled and denied what Stacy said subconsciously!

Stacy’s mouth twitched, but she didn’t say anything. She just sighed slightly!

A few minutes later, everyone separated and returned to the warlock World one by one, returning to their own forces!

Gade was the first to return.

Just like last time, he flew directly to the mage tower in the center and saw the familiar butler again.

“Sir, while you were away, another big thing happened!” the butler said respectfully.

“Oh?”

Gade was also puzzled. Why did things always happen when he left? It was really strange.

“What happened?” He asked calmly as he walked.

“Sir, some time ago, there seemed to be some problems in the Heart of the Abyss, a first-class force in the Western Region. The abyss they guarded seemed to inexplicably lead to other regions in the Western Region, causing the invasion of the Balor tribe. The three second-class forces in the Western Region joined forces to destroy it, but they encountered an ambush. The Balor tribe formed an ambush consisting of a total of nine peak Radiant Sun demons!”

“What?!”

Before the butler could finish, Gade turned around and asked anxiously, “So, what’s the situation now? So, a large part of the Western Regions has been occupied by the demons? ”

It was no wonder that he was worried. The forces that were mainly close to the central region were all important partners of the Thousand-Eyed Tree Demon!

” Don’t worry, my lord. On that day, the clone of the Bloodline Tower of the Western Region, Eli, descended and killed a few Balors in a crushing manner before leaving! ” the butler said.

“Eli? A clone?”

Hearing the butler’s words, he could not remain calm even if he tried his best to overcome the storm. After all, he was still exploring the mythical realm with Eli a few days ago!

However, from what the butler said, they might be exploring with a clone.

But even if it was a clone, it was still too exaggerated!

“What a f * cking monster!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In the end, Gade’s mouth twitched as he said this. Damn it, are all clones so strong?

While Gade was still in shock, the others who had returned at the same time also heard the news.

Stacy took a deep breath and felt extremely lucky. She covered her chest and relaxed.” The Mountain Giant World Fragment has come to an end. Nothing happened. It’s just an ordinary exploration. ”

Karel’s mouth twitched as he sighed, “It really is a clone? This is too exaggerated.” Karel was silent for a long time, and then he returned to his room. He needed time!

…..

On the other side.

A day later, Eli returned to the Grassi Land and gave everything to his main body before turning them into the power of faith.

Eli then began to take stock of his harvest. In fact, it was mainly the most precious materials, some of which were difficult to find in the Warlock World, as well as the specialties of the Mountain Giant World. Eli carefully kept these resources. Who knew if they would be used one day?

After packing up, Eli took out his two most important gains.

One was a shadow wrapped in black fog, and the other was a beautiful flower with leaves that were like the starry sky.

” A law that was corrupted, and the Flower of Eternal Night that I need! ”

Eli lowered his head to look at the two items. The laws seemed to be illusory, but even with just a glance, Eli could still see endless darkness, corrosion, changes, and so on. That was the shadow itself. With just a few glances, Eli felt that his understanding of shadows had increased by a notch!

This was the law.

Of course, because of the black fog, Eli could only sense a portion of it. Even so, it was still an extremely precious item to Eli at this stage!

” Looks like I’ll have to comprehend a law for three hours every day in the future. Of course, I’ll have to consider whether I can expel the black fog! ” Eli pondered.

Since the Mountain Giant King said that the fifth circle was related to the laws, Ely felt that it was necessary to comprehend them. Moreover, since the purification power was useful, it might be able to help him get rid of the black fog’s pollution. Of course, the current level of purification power might not be possible, and this would require Eli’s efforts in the future!

Eli planned to make it one of the two main goals to be completed in the future!

As for what the other one was, there was naturally no need to mention it.

Eli looked at the Flower of Eternal Night.

At this moment, all the materials were prepared. He could prepare to break through to the Radiant Sun!
