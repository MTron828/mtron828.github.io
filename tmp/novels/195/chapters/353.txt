354 Plundering Resources

In the airship where Eli was.

” I knew he could do it. He’s really too strong. ”

” That old man is really ridiculous. Tower Master Eli is too violent, but I like it. ”

” I suddenly feel that the Central Continent is just so-so! ”

!!

Many Warlocks had witnessed the brutality of Eli in the Sofia Mountain Range after their flight, but they were not celestials, so they did not have a direct understanding of it.

However, it was not until today that they realized how powerful Eli was.

As the Warlocks chatted, the door of the cabin suddenly opened. A Warlock ran out and shouted excitedly,” Everyone, get ready. We’ll be landing in the Four Seasons in a while. When the lord gives the order, take away all valuable items, especially magic plant resources. Everyone can keep 30% of what they get. ”

“What?”

All the Warlocks looked at the Warlock at the same time, their mouths wide open.

A Warlock could not hide his excitement and said, “Are you saying that we’re going down later to plunder resources?”

“Milord said it’s to get compensation!” the Warlock replied.

It was no longer important whether it was compensation or looting.

No one was a fool, so they naturally understood what he meant.

” Praise Lord Eli! ” A Warlock said as he took out his weapon.

The others also praised Eli.

A few minutes later, all the Warlocks were fully armed and stood at the exit, feeling excited.

The same thing happened in the other two airships.

…

Three hours passed in the blink of an eye.

Three enormous airships were parked on the ground outside Four Seasons Garden. Not far away was the Potion-growing area of the four seasons, and further away was the main city of the four seasons.

At this moment, in the magic herb field, Anli carefully collected a magic plant and put it aside.

He raised his head and saw countless Warlocks from the Four Seasons Garden gathering magic plants. The magic plants were transported to the airship not far away and piled up like a small mountain. Beside the small mountain, Eli was tidying up the magic plants.

Seeing this scene, Anli was both angry and helpless.

Eli did not kill them. Instead, he asked them to help collect resources in exchange for their lives.

They were the ones in the magic herb fields while Eli’s men were gathering resources in the city. There were hundreds of Warlocks.

When he saw those Warlocks come down, he realized that the force from the sub-tower was quite powerful.

Of course, there was resistance. However, Eli only sent a wave of mental power across the city, and basically, everyone fell unconscious. They allowed Eli’s men to plunder the resources without any resistance. The only thing that was worth rejoicing about was that Eli’s men did not kill anyone.

“Damn manticore.” Anli cursed in his heart.

If it weren’t for this higher-up faction, they wouldn’t have ended up like this.

With their celestial dead and their resources plundered, their situation would be even worse.

A branch?

Anli felt that this was a joke.

He glanced at Eli. The powerful four-circle celestials and the Warlocks from the Bloodline Tower were also returning. The proportion of third-circle Warlocks was also very high, and there were also three high-level mechanical airships.

You call this a sub-tower?!

He even felt that this was a plot by the manticore to get rid of them.

…..

” The Central Mainland is indeed different. I’ve never seen many magical plants before. ” Elsewhere, Eli smiled as he looked at a large number of magical plants.

The West Coast was once the territory of the dark Magi compared to the Central Mainland. In terms of the cultivation and planting of magic potions, the light Magi were slightly better. Thus, the magic potion resources in the Central Mainland surpassed the West Coast.

It had been a long time since his Potionology skills had improved. With this batch of potions, he might be able to improve further.

Of course, other than him, the others had also gained a lot. He believed that after this plunder, many people’s strength would increase.

At this moment, Oscar walked over from not far away and handed a ring to Eli.

“Milord, these are the items from the Four Seasons Garden’s secret vault. They are all in this ring!”

“Secret vault!” Ely was slightly interested.

He opened the ring. The space inside was smaller than he had imagined. It was about 5x5x5, but there were quite a lot of resources inside. There were about a few hundred high-grade magic crystals, some bloodlines that had been stored in advance, some books, and some Warlock weapons.

In the end, there were about three items that interested Eli.

A few books on Potionology, two feathers, and a pair of goggles.

The Potionology books were something that Eli hadn’t thought of, but considering that the Four Seasons Garden was a faction related to magical plants, it seemed reasonable. These books were mainly related to the cultivation and planting of plants, so they could be considered as a supplement to Eli.

The two feathers were nearly a meter long. The inner part was white, while the outer part was green. When Eli touched them, he could even feel the sharp wind element. The quality of the feathers was not low either. Eli guessed that they were feathers dropped by fifth-circle magical beasts, but he did not know where Four Seasons Garden had obtained them.

Eli planned to use it as a foundation to refine a fourth-circle mage Tool to increase his mobility.

As for the goggles, they were more interesting.

This was a fourth-circle mage Tool, but part of its runes had been damaged. It should be able to be used once it was repaired. It should have been collected by the Four Seasons Garden. After all, a fourth-circle mage Tool required a high amount of mental strength, and it was not something a Warlock could use.

Of course, Warlocks might not be willing to use it now. They paid more attention to the cultivation of their own bloodline and their own weapons.

“It seems that the quality is not low. Let’s leave after repairing it.” Eli made a last-minute decision.

This time, his harvest was not small, and the other Warlocks’ harvest was also not small. After all, these were the resources of a celestial-level force. Although it was only a main city, they only had a few hundred people. Even if each of them only got 30% of it, it was still a huge amount.

...

They needed some time to digest it.

“Oscar, make the arrangements. We’ll set off in three days.” Eli said.

“Yes, my lord.” Oscar nodded.

At this moment, Alida, who was not far away, walked over with a smile on her face. It was obvious that she had gained a lot.

…

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli repaired the goggles.

The name of the goggles was Pioneer Goggles. Its effect was to strengthen one’s sight, and it could also help mages maintain clarity and calmness in any environment. The effect looked ordinary, but it was actually quite good.

In these three days, the late-stage second-circle Alida reached the peak of her second circle.

There were also five people with second circle who advanced to third circles, and twenty people with first circle who advanced to second circle.

This was normal. After all, they had plundered a warlock base. Most of the resources that they had obtained this time could benefit Warlocks. Those who could board the airship were basically the elites of the Bloodline Tower. Many of them were at the limit of breaking through, and many of them lacked resources.

...

The plunder this time also made all the warlocks’ frustrations that had accumulated over the past year disappear. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Even Eli could feel that these people’s faith in him had increased by a few hundred units.

Eli understood. Who wouldn’t like a boss who brought everyone benefits without any risk?

After collecting all the resources, Eli waved his hand.

“Let’s go!”

On the same day, with the sound of the airship starting, the three airships set off again.

Meanwhile, in the Four Seasons Garden, the Warlocks who had regained their freedom looked at the chaotic territory and cried out in pain.

They were all crying.

A wrong choice caused the Four Seasons Garden to be doomed.
