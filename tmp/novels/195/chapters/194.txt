195 Canyon

Eli, who left the Black Tower, had a smooth journey. He passed through a large forest and arrived at the front line two hours later. However, he didn’t get close but flew further into the distance.

After flying for another half an hour, he chose a canyon to land.

On both sides were rock walls that towered into the clouds, and at the bottom was a wide road. Here, Eli stopped and began to set up a spell formation. After setting it up, he closed his eyes and rested, waiting for the arrival of the people from the black Isotta Alliance.

Time passed quickly, and an hour had passed in the blink of an eye.

“They’re here.”

In the canyon, Eli opened his eyes. His gaze was calm.

..

Five minutes ago.

On a grassland, a group of eight people, five men and three women, were moving forward quickly. They all wore the same Black Warlock robe with the symbol of the Black Isotta.

The group moved forward quickly when a man suddenly spoke.

“Speaking of which, after we deal with the White Tower, we will deal with the house of the undead. I wonder how black Isotta will deal with this force. Nikola is very powerful.” It was a tall man who asked the group.

“Hmph, Nikola is indeed powerful, but as long as we unify the South of the West Coast, his power will not matter. After all, it’s just an undead. It’s just that everyone is too busy and has no time to deal with him.” A plump woman answered.

“Indeed,” The other man agreed.

“I’m a little tired. Hurry up. I’ll have a good rest after dealing with this.” A man with a weak face said indifferently.

“Hahaha, Andal, you’re looking down on the White Tower.” An old man beside the weak man said with a smile.

“Ha, Modi, don’t tell me you don’t think the same way.” Said Andal as he glanced at the old man.

The old man didn’t say anything, but the smile on his face showed his thoughts.

There was really nothing much to say. The gap between the weak White Tower and them was too big. They didn’t think there would be any accidents. The only embarrassing thing was that the previous few had exposed their assassination operation, and it might be a little troublesome.

However, it was a small problem. If there were any danger, they would wait for the main force.

The group of people looked at each other. They were once old rivals and knew each other very well. However, things were hard to predict. Now, they had actually become teammates.

“There’s a canyon ahead!”

Suddenly, a man at the front said. His eyes were pure white due to the bloodline he had fused with. At this time, his eyes seemed to be able to see through a few kilometers and see the canyon in the distance.

“Oh, is there an ambush?” Someone asked in surprise.

“There seems to be someone there.”

“How many people?” The voluptuous woman frowned. This was probably not a good place to set up a battlefield.

“Uh …”

However, to their surprise, the white-eyed man fell into a long silence as if he didn’t know what to say.

“Crow, don’t waste time.” Suddenly, a middle-aged Mage spoke. He had a cold expression, and his aura was the strongest among them. He was also the leader of the team.

“I don’t know if I’m seeing things …” Crow hesitated for a long time before turning her head and saying, “But from what I can sense, there’s only one person. He doesn’t seem to have the power of a second circle.”

“One person?!”

The few of them spoke at the same time, their eyes filled with surprise.

How could it be one person?

Did he think that he could stop them alone? Everyone’s eyes were filled with laughter and ridicule.

They had eight peak second-circle warlocks, even if Nikola were here, he would not be their match. So who in the White Tower had such confidence?

Such arrogance.

“It seems like someone is seeking death!” A few seconds later, the leader showed his white teeth.

“That’s true. According to Lorant, who wants to join us, there aren’t many strong people in the White Tower. We only need to pay attention to one of them, Herman. I heard he was very strong a hundred years ago.”

“Sigh, this will end quickly.” The old man was also very certain.

“Then, everyone, let’s go and see this brave warlock.” The leader smiled, but his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Everyone laughed and continued to move forward quickly.

Within a few minutes, everyone could see the canyon.

The tall canyon stood on the ground, and both sides could be seen at a glance. It was impossible for an enemy to hide, and at the bottom of the valley, a figure could be vaguely seen.

It really was just one person.

Everyone smiled and walked into the valley in a line.

If they were still afraid, then they would have lived their lives in vain.

Very quickly, they saw this person.

It was a well-proportioned man with black hair and black eyes. He was wearing a Black robe and holding a thick staff in his hand. He had a handsome face and was looking at them calmly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“This is … Herman?” The captain said with uncertainty.

“According to Lorant’s information, this is indeed Herman.” The old man took out a crystal ball and confirmed it.

“Oh, he’s really nice, but it’s a pity that I already have 15 husbands, so I don’t have any plans for now.” The voluptuous woman covered her mouth and chuckled, her body trembling.

“Don’t be careless. I can already feel his power.” One of the men glanced at the woman’s cleavage, then laughed at Eli.

The group of people each expressed their opinions as if they didn’t care about Eli.

If they were a little worried before they came, they were now relaxed.

“Lorant has betrayed us?!”

...

The crowd was in a heated discussion, and Eli suddenly spoke.

“I thought you were mute. That’s true. Lorant has joined us. It can’t be helped. White Tower is too weak, and we’re more suitable for him.” The captain said calmly.

“It seems that I have to get rid of him when I get back.” Eli looked at him and nodded.

The team leader was speechless.

He looked at Eli’s serious expression and couldn’t help but twitch his mouth. Get back?

Do you think you can still get back?

What do you take us for?!

“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid that your idea can’t be realized. You only have one choice now, either die or join us like Lorant, and we can spare your life.

“What’s that important about White Tower? Staying alive is the most important thing.” The captain stood out and said to Elie.

“The White Tower is indeed nothing.” Under the captain’s gaze, Eli shook his head and said, “however, it’s still one of my resources. Furthermore, there’s actually a third option.”

“A third option? ”

...

The eight of them were puzzled. What was Herman talking about?

“I can kill all of you.”

“Hahaha!”

Everyone burst into laughter. At this moment, they couldn’t hold it in any longer. No one had expected that Eli would say something so funny.

“Did you hear that? He’s going to kill us!” The old man frowned and laughed in a strange way.

“Haha, I can’t, I can’t.” The voluptuous female Mage laughed so hard that her body shook.

“Wait, something’s wrong.” Suddenly, the expression of the man who had rolled his eyes seemed to change.

“What’s wrong?” The captain was puzzled.

“I can feel a large amount of energy in the surroundings. It seems to be a little like a skeleton army but also like something else. There are many, many, many of them.” The white-eyed man broke out in a cold sweat.

The white-eyed man had fused with a bloodline with an extremely strong observation ability. His observation ability was the strongest among the group. Therefore, his words made the others serious.

Everyone looked around, but there were no skeletons.

How did he sense the skeleton?

“When did the sky go dark?” A man turned and frowned.

“No, it’s a shadow!”

At this moment, everyone looked around and suddenly realized that the other side of the canyon had been sealed off. Countless shadows blocked the way, and a large number of shadows surged out from other directions, blocking the way.

Everyone was dumbfounded and subconsciously formed a circle. At this time, they also faintly felt that the development of the matter didn’t seem quite right.

Everyone looked at Eli. He was still standing there, but he had already transformed. His pair of golden vertical eyes looked at them with a faint smile as if he was disdainful.

On the other side, a few of them also understood where the cracking sound came from.

One by one, skeletons emerged from the shadows and occupied the entire canyon in an instant. First and second-circle undead could be seen everywhere, and there were even a few five to six meters tall skeletons. Some of the skeletons were even wielding shadow weapons.

The quantity …

Probably a few tens of thousands?

Everyone was dumbfounded. They looked at each other, the sea of undead that had surrounded them, and Herman, who was holding a staff. Then, a huge fireball flew at them.

Everyone was silent.

There seemed to be a third possibility.
