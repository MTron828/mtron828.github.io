260 Shadow Dragon’s Breath

The forty-five warlocks quickly withdrew and flew towards the Warlock, who shouted. He was from the heart of darkness.

At this moment, he was the direct commander of the battlefield.

He looked at Eli with a calm gaze and said, “You are strong, but you came to the wrong place. If you were like master Sergei, it would be fine, but unfortunately, not every Warlock has the same bloodline and talent as master!

“As warlocks, although we have lost much of the power of the mages, we have also gained something else because of our bloodline.

“that is the connection that our bloodline gave us.”

The Warlock had an insolent smile on his face, and his body began to emit moonlight.

The 30 warlocks behind him also extended their hands, and at the same time, moonlight bloomed in the sky. Although it was still daytime, everyone could feel the chill of the moonlight.

Under the cold moonlight, many apprentice-level warlocks shivered, and some even felt stiff.

They raised their heads.

They looked at the sky.

The moonlight around the Warlock stretched out its tentacles and connected with the moonlight of the people behind him. Then, everyone’s bloodline power rapidly weakened, but the Warlock at the front was strengthened.

Ice shards slowly appeared in the surrounding air, and a crescent moonlight appeared in the sky, emitting a bright light. It was ready to attack.

On the ground.

Udo’s throat moved slightly, and his eyes were filled with fear as he watched this scene.

Bloodline combination skill!

This was a new power after the demise of Mages and the rise of warlocks. By combining the bloodlines of the same race, they could burst forth with a majestic power that was far stronger than their own. It was the warlocks’ most powerful technique in war!

He even felt a little short of breath.

Would Eli be able to block it?

It would probably be very difficult!

“My benefactor!” He wanted to make a move, but he didn’t have the courage!

His strength was meaningless under such an attack, which was probably one of the reasons why Sergei was so at ease.

“This is finished!”

Further away on the mountain, Simona shouted, ” shit!”

Such a f * cking terrifying attack. Even Eli couldn’t possibly withstand it!

Could this be the reason why she had a bad feeling?

Killed in the aftermath?

Even the two third-circle warlocks had such a reaction, not to mention the warlocks on the ground. Each and every one of them had their mouths wide open and their eyes wide open!

They had never seen such a powerful force.

So, warlocks could be so powerful?

The war should be ending soon!

..

“Hehe, I think I know your name!”

Holding the ten-meter-long crescent moon in his hand, the Warlock looked at Eli arrogantly.

“you must be Herman, right? The only one on the West Coast who has such a shadow force must be Herman from the bloodline tower. No wonder you’re so powerful. You killed Noah, right? ”

He looked down on Eli like a god looking down on mortals.

“Herman!”

The people on the ground were confused. Herman from the bloodline tower?

Was there such a person?

Herman wasn’t very famous, but after today’s incident, his name would definitely resound throughout the entire West Coast. Unfortunately, it was just a fleeting meteor.

There was no way he could have survived that attack!

Eli was speechless.

Looking at the proud Warlock, Eli was baffled.

Why are you so proud?

Wasn’t it just combining the bloodlines? Was this very special?

Was this ability something to be proud of? Compared to the mages in the past, this was not that impressive. Anyway, when Eli looked at these warlocks, he felt disappointed.

So they had fused their bloodline power. One must know that the power of nature was many times stronger than the bloodline.

“Then let’s show them the true power of a mage.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

A shadow core gathered in his hand and began to spin like a storm. In time, it was as if an endless devouring power had surged the surrounding elements into it.

It wasn’t just the natural world. The tentacles of the shadow attracted all kinds of forces.

In the blink of an eye, a millstone-like shadow appeared in front of him.

“A waste of time!”

On the other side, the Warlock snorted coldly.

“Crescent moon of death!”

In an instant, a ten-meter-long crescent moon flew out. Its cold light drew a trail behind it, and ice and frost condensed like an ice River in the sky.

...

Everyone looked at this scene.

The shadow in Eli’s hand also flew out.

Looking at the exaggerated size comparison, everyone’s mouth twitched!

How could they f * cking compete?!

The warlocks from Heart of Darkness started to smile, not feeling surprised.

“Huh? what’s that?” Suddenly, a Warlock looked at the shadow.

The others looked over.

The shadow swept across the sky, and the space and time in the surrounding shadow gathered toward it. It was not only absorbing the power of the bloodline but also beginning to use the power of the outside world.

In just a few seconds, the millstone-sized shadow began to expand again. A shadow wave that was over a hundred meters tall appeared in the sky like a huge mouth!

Then, it swallowed the moonlight!

That’s right, swallow it.

...

The moonlight entered the shadow like a snack, and then there was no reaction at all. Everyone only saw a little bit of moonlight coming out of the shadow, and the shadow trembled.

“What the hell is this?”

At this moment, the warlocks were dumbfounded.

They looked at this scene in shock.

What was this person’s bloodline? the shadow itself?

This was illogical!

So many of them had to come up with that crescent moon, but Herman neutralized the attack so easily. Were you still a Warlock?

“Who the hell are you? You can’t be Herman!” The Warlock shouted loudly. He trembled as he saw the shadow getting closer and closer!

He had not expected the enemy to be so terrifying and powerful.

However, the shadow had already arrived. The huge shadow was like a wave, instantly drowning everyone in the shadow. It hung high in the sky like a black curtain.

The huge crescent moon of death was only able to hold on for a moment, let alone these warlocks!

The shadow did not even move. It was like water flowing into a stream, not causing any changes.

There was no struggle, no roar, because the moment the warlocks entered the shadow, they died.

In the sky, Eli shook his head as he watched this scene. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Warlocks relied on their bloodlines, but they were also restricted by their bloodlines. They would only have the power of their bloodlines in their entire lives, and nothing would change.

Just like how Knights relied on vitality, didn’t warlocks rely on their bloodlines?

Compared to a Mage, they were far too weak!

“Then, it’s the people underneath’s turn next!”

Eli lowered his head and looked. With a hook of his finger, countless giant shadow snakes slithered out of the waves and flicked their tongues at the ground. Their dark eyes were completely cold!

..

“What’s this? The masters are gone just like that?!”

“Please, that’s more than 40 third-circle warlocks. This is crazy!”

“Harman is a Warlock as powerful as Mr. Sergei. My God, I can’t believe there’s such a terrifying person on the West Coast. The bloodlines tower is hiding too well!”

On the ground, the warlocks on both sides were deeply shocked.

No one had expected the warlock in front of them to be so cunning.

But looking at the shadow pythons that filled the sky, the heart of the darkness’s warlocks and the Holy tower’s side felt their hearts tighten because no one knew which side this man was on.

The Holy tower could not find such a strong helper!

The shadow Pythons fell to the ground.

Each of the huge pythons was at least at the level of one circle. The appearance of thousands of shadow pythons directly changed the situation and launched an attack on the heart of darkness’ warlocks!

At this time, the warlocks of the Holy tower also heaved a sigh of relief.

So they weren’t the target.

Udo also took a deep breath. Luckily, Eli was here to help them.

Looking at a large number of the dead heart of the darkness warlocks, he felt a wave of shock.

He knew that Eli was strong, but he didn’t expect him to be this strong.

Suddenly, he felt a wave of elemental fluctuations. It was coming from the direction of silver Moon Lake!

A Warlock from the heart of darkness stood on the northern side of the lake, holding a gem in his hand. He glanced at Eli, and without any hesitation, he threw the gem into the lake.

“The element’s heart!”

Udo was shocked. When did this happen?!
