457 Vivika’s Return, Barrier-Breaking Stone!

Green Field, Dragon Clan’s territory!

Thank you readers!

The Red Dragon Ortiz stretched his body and shook off the gold coins around him. He looked at the cave and then stepped on a large number of gems as he walked out. Although these were very ordinary, he liked these shiny little things very much and collected a lot!

Walking out of the cave, the warm sunlight shone on his body, making him feel comfortable!

“Why don’t we go out for a walk? Ever since I was accidentally drawn blood by a human, I haven’t gone out for hundreds of years. Now that I’m at the peak of Radiant Sun, I should be fine!” Ortiz revealed his pearly white teeth, then looked around before flying out.

Soon, he flew out of the dragon clan’s territory.

Looking at the strange yet familiar environment around him, Ortiz felt extremely relaxed.

It’s been a few hundred years, and he’s finally out again. Unfortunately, Blue Dragon definitely won’t come out!

“What kind of accident could happen? ”

Ortiz looked at the sky and smiled, but he suddenly realized that it was a little dark in front of him.

“It’s dark…Wasn’t it daytime…There was a problem…Ah!”

Bang!

Eli looked at the dragon in front of him and blinked. He had thought that he would need to spend a long time looking for an opportunity. Who would have thought that he would find it so easily? It was even a high-level Red Dragon. How lucky.

“But why does this thing feel a little familiar?” Eli looked at the unconscious dragon in front of him, and the light in his eyes became more and more strange.

“No way, it’s still that one!”

A few seconds later, the corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

What kind of ill-fated fate was this?

The giant dragon in front of him was actually the one he had seen in the Western Regions!

“Fate!” Eli smiled, then wrapped him up in the shadows and left quickly!

Because the red dragon had left without permission, no one had noticed. Even the blue dragon was only confused why the red dragon had not come to find him recently. For them, it was normal to not see each other for decades!

Just like that!

Eli had successfully returned to the elven territory!

“Sir Eli, did you go out today?” Elven Queen Erwin asked curiously as she walked over in a white gown.

“Yes!” Eli nodded. This clone was permanently stationed here. Eli would not even use it normally. He would only descend when he needed it!

“I’ve already dealt with it. In a while, I’ll need to use some teleportation arrays that can directly teleport to the Grassi Land!” Eli said.

“Alright, I’ll order the elves to activate the teleportation array now. Is your clone about to leave again?”Ivan asked.

“No, I’ll stay for three days!”

Eli smiled at Erwin, and she lowered her head shyly. If other elves saw her like this, they would be shocked because she always had the image of a confident and arrogant queen. How could she show such a shy expression?

“Yes!” Erwin whispered.

“See you tonight!” Eli gently caressed Erwin’s face and carried her into the treehouse not far away!

A day later!

In the treehouse, looking at Erwin’s snow-white skin, Eli gently covered him with a blanket and walked toward the distant teleportation circle. After confirming that it was safe, he threw the red dragon in and activated it. The red dragon disappeared from the teleportation circle, and Eli returned to the treehouse.

It was a rare occasion.

Three days was a piece of cake!

…

On the other side.

In the Grassi land.

Eli looked at the teleportation circle in front of him and the red dragon that was hundreds of meters above him with a smile.

“Now that we have a living body, the experiment can continue!” Eli did not expect it to be so easy this time!

However, just as he was about to move the red dragon, the red dragon in front of him began to move as if it was waking up.

“Are you awake?”

Eli blinked!

Ortiz blinked. He felt an excruciating pain in his body as if he had been washed by sulfuric acid. His consciousness was also in a daze.

‘What happened… I think I’m going out…’ Then, when he went out, he was covered in shadows…. Then, he lost consciousness!

‘No, I think I was knocked unconscious!’

As if realizing something, Ortiz suddenly opened his eyes and saw everything clearly.

An unfamiliar valley, an unfamiliar environment, and an unfamiliar place… It was a familiar aura!

“Long time no see!”

Eli smiled kindly.

Ortiz’s smile instantly froze. This feeling reminded him of an unpleasant memory. He remembered that 800 years ago, he had definitely seen this human. At that time, he was only a 1,600-year-old young dragon, but a human had extracted hundreds of liters of blood from him, and he became a joke of the dragon race. Now that 800 years had passed, he was already a mature dragon, but this time, he seemed to have met this demon again!

Run!

Ortiz’s muscles tensed up as he prepared to escape. However, when the human in front of him smiled again, he felt the aura of death.

If he ran, he would definitely die!

“Long time no see!” Ortiz had a long face, feeling that the future was bleak.

Why?

800 years had passed, and this human was even stronger than before!

“Draw blood? How much do you want this time?” His eyes were filled with tears as he said aggrievedly.

“No, no, I don’t need blood this time. I just need you to cooperate with me for an experiment. If it goes well, it might end in a few decades. If it doesn’t go well, it might take even longer.” Eli said kindly.

Ortiz really wanted to refuse, but when he saw Ely’s kind smile, he fell silent.

After a few minutes, he looked up at the sky and sighed. “Good!”

What could he do? He was also in despair!

Seeing the red dragon’s ” voluntary agreement, ” Eli nodded. A cooperative living creature and a non-cooperative living creature were two different concepts. Moreover, they could recover on their own. This living creature was enough!

“Alright, you’ll stay here for the time being. I’ll call you when I need you later!” Eli said and walked out.

The Red Dragon Ortiz was also stunned when he saw Eli’s unguarded actions.

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll run away?” He blinked his eyes in joy!

“If you run away, I’ll bring you back!”

Before walking into the tower, Eli suddenly turned around and gave him a kind smile again.

Ortiz’s gaze froze, and the light in his eyes slowly disappeared. He felt that Eli had the ability to do so.

He was already at the peak of combat power, but he had no ability to resist at all. The Dragon King was asleep, and there was really no one left in the Dragon Clan who could match this human.

“Hey!”

In the end, he sighed deeply and chose to lie flat.

Come on.

The next time he went back, he would never go out again. Why was his life so miserable?

As he thought about it, a little tear fell.

Je felt wronged.

…

Another month passed.

The Bloodline Tower Warlock team guarding the Abyss had returned, and so had Vivika!

Eli welcomed Vivika in the City of Bloodline and smiled at her valiant and heroic appearance.

When Vivika saw Eli, tears flowed out of her eyes, and she ran over to give Eli a hug!

” I missed you so much, ” Vivika whispered.

Eli gently patted Vivika’s back and said nothing.

After more than ten seconds, Vivika finally let go of her hand and wiped her tears away. She seemed a little embarrassed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s go. Someone has been cleaning your room!”

“Yes!” Vivika looked at Eli and whispered, “Brother Eli, I’ve also recently found out something about the Heart of the Abyss. You should be interested.”

“Oh? You secretly investigated the Heart of the Abyss?”

Eli raised his eyebrows. He really didn’t know about this. After all, he couldn’t give this mission to Vivika. It was too dangerous!

“Hehe. Don’t worry. Aren’t I still fine?” Seeing the change in Eli’s expression, Vivika smiled!

“Alright, I hope there won’t be a next time!” Eli said helplessly. Everyone had their own ideas, and it was always possible that they would follow his lead!

“Tell me, did you find anything?” asked Eli.

Vivika straightened her body and said, “Brother Eli, after a year of investigation, I’ve discovered that there’s indeed something wrong with the Heart of the Abyss, especially in terms of personnel deployment. It seems that although there are many demons in the territory of the Heart of the Abyss, it’s not worth mentioning at all. In fact, because there are fewer demons, they once again proposed to reduce external help. They can easily deal with it themselves!

“There are others …”

Vivika spoke with confidence, telling him all the information she had gathered!

Eli didn’t disturb her and just listened quietly!

Most of them were useless, but when he heard one, his eyes widened!

“Also, the Heart of the Abyss seems to have secretly collected a batch of resources in the central region before transporting them to the Saka clan,” Vivika said.

Upon hearing this, Ely suddenly thought of Gade from the Thousand-Eyed Tree Demon family in the central region. He had once said that the Heart of Abyss had bought a batch of Barrier-Breaking Stones from them just before the incident with the Saka family’s head.

Barrier Breaking Stone…Items with spatial effects…Other than refining interspatial rings, it could also cause a certain amount of interference to space… As long as it was suitable, it could break through space…. If that was the case, perhaps the spatial rift was not caused by demons…

It was the Heart of the Abyss!

Eli’s throat moved slightly, and he closed his eyes. At the same time, his clone in the underground cave opened his eyes and began to search everywhere!

Vivika saw the stunned expression on Eli’s face and stopped as well, waiting quietly.

Five minutes later, Eli opened his eyes again and looked at Vivika with a complicated expression.

“Vivika, you did well this time!” Eli praised.

“Did something happen?” Vivika was still confused and asked subconsciously.

“No, I just found something interesting!”

Eli smiled, but his consciousness was multitasking. At this moment, his clone was staring at a corner in the cave.

In the cracks of the rocks.

There was a flash of light.

It was the reflection of the light from the cave by the broken Barrier-Breaking Stone. It was as bright as a diamond!
