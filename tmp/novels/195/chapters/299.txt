300 Doggo

A dark blue light shone from the mechanical head’s eyes.

Eli could sense that the mechanical head had awakened!

It wasn’t the kind of awakening that was similar to turning on a computer, but rather the awakening of some kind of soul.

A weak soul essence slowly spread out, and the surrounding air seemed to be flickering. A mental force extended out from the mechanical head, then probed towards Eli.

“Do you want to communicate?”

Mental power was harmless. Without any hesitation, Eli extended his mental power as well and fused with it.

“Who are you?” Eli asked directly.

The mechanical head seemed to be in a daze. After a few seconds, it sent a consciousness over.

“I’m Dylan!”

“Oh? Dylan?”

It wasn’t gray!

Eli pouted. He was hoping it would be Gray.

But who was Dylan?

“Then who are you?” Eli continued asking.

“I forgot. I seemed to have only transmitted one consciousness into this mechanical body. Whether it was the memory modules or the various modules, there were huge problems. I even forgot. I seem to have another body, but I don’t seem to be able to sense it. However, I vaguely remember that I seem to be a general!” A mechanical voice sounded. It seemed that Dylan was also in a dazed state.

Eli fell silent!

He had thought that he would gain something, but it seemed that he would be disappointed!

Then again, maybe there were clues in the body he lost.

“Are you related to Gray?” This time, Eli asked directly.

“Gray? What a familiar name.”

It was just a voice. The robot seemed to have fallen into a state of thought.

It lasted for more than ten seconds, and the mechanical head was even starting to smoke before it spat out a sentence, “I’m sorry, I really don’t remember. But can you help me get a body? I can trade with you!”

“Of course.” The next second, his tone became strange. “What do you have in exchange?”

“high-level machinery knowledge!” Dylan’s eyes flickered. “Although I seem to have lost a lot of things, there seems to be a lot of mechanical knowledge stored in my current brain. I can exchange it with you!”

“Oh? “Eli’s eyes lit up.

“Alright, I can give you a body. I’ll make it myself! A few seconds later,” Eli said.

At this moment, he had already realized that this mechanical head was definitely not simple.

It contained high-level knowledge of the fourth circle and above and a mysterious origin.

With that in mind, Eli continued, “then what are you going to do after you have a body?”

“I’m going to look for my body. I feel like I’ve stored something very important there. I think I’ve stored it in the central continent. But before that, I have to find a high-level mechanical Mage!” He said. Perhaps it was because Eli had awakened him, he didn’t hide anything!

“A high-level mechanical mage? What about me?”

Eli asked the mechanical head.

“No, you’re too weak!” Dylan said.

Eli, “…” Your requirements are too high. I don’t think there are mages above the fourth circle.

However, he had to keep the mechanical head first!

Eli’s eyes darted around, and a few seconds later, he slowly said, “It seems like you’re not familiar with the current Mage world.

“If you go to the central continent like this, you might not be able to find any mage and be destroyed by those warlocks. I forgot to tell you, you might have been asleep for a long time. There is no Mage in this world that meets your requirements!”

“What?” Dylan’s voice trembled violently. This was the first time he heard about this.

He didn’t seem to know the current situation.

“But you’re lucky to have met me, the only third-circle mechanical mage in the world today!” Eli looked at Dylan and said.

“You’re lying to me!” Dylan said.

He didn’t believe it!

Although he had lost many of his memories, the power of a Mage had been imprinted in his soul. How could such powerful Mages disappear?

“Then I’ll create a body for you, and then you can go to take a look at the outside environment for now.

“If I’m not lying to you, then you’ll stay by my side!”

Eli’s unyielding words seemed to have made Dylan hesitate.

Could it be that what Eli said was true?

The light in Dylan’s eyes dimmed for a few minutes.

A few minutes later, a voice was heard. “Alright!”

“Hehe, then I’ll create a body for you first.” Eli looked at the head and smiled.

Dylan’s eyes flickered, and he seemed a little uneasy.

..

Half a month later.

In the Tower, Dylan’s head was on the table, and his new body was on the ground.

...

But …

Dylan’s Blue eyes looked at the ground with a faint gaze.

On the ground, there was a body about one meter long. It was silver-white in color and had a complete mechanical structure. It seemed to be of good quality, except for the head.

The problem was …

“Eli, I need a human body!” Dylan said.

The mechanical dolls on the ground were indeed not bad. The only problem was that they looked like dogs!

He could wave it and call it a Wolf, but what was the difference? There was no difference at all!

“As I’ve told you, the outside world is very dangerous. This is a very good disguise. If necessary, you can directly turn into a dog. It’s safe and reliable!” Eli revealed a kind expression.

Dylan was silent.

“Impossible. I can’t use this body!” Dylan’s deep voice was filled with suppressed anger!

“It’s up to you!”

...

“This is your last chance!”

Eli left the room immediately. It seemed that Dylan still didn’t understand the current situation.

He needed time to calm down.

Three days later, Eli stepped into the room again.

“I agree!” Dylan said.

“That’s more like it!”

A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

Soon, Eli placed the extremely resistant Dylan on the head of the mechanical dog.

As soon as the connection was made, the skin of the robot dog started to change. In the blink of an eye, it really turned into a Husky.

“Let’s go, Doggo. I’ll take you to see the world today!”

“I have a name, not Doggo!”

“Alright, doggo!”

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

In the past three days, Eli brought Doggo around the area.

He finally understood what the world was like today.

And Eli might really be the only third-circle mechanic Warlock!

Of course, there might be some in other places, but they would definitely be difficult to find.

Moreover, it seemed that Herman was very close to the celestial realm. Perhaps he would have a chance to find a body for him in the future.

In the end, he promised to stay by Eli’s side until he found the body. In exchange, he paid with his own knowledge. Before the body was found, he would give Eli the necessary mechanical assistance!

..

Just as the agreement between Eli and Doggo was established!

Time slipped by.

Anderson passed through one Wizard Tower after another and arrived at a Wizard Tower.

The wizard Tower was located at the back of the city, but this Wizard Tower was different from ordinary wizard towers. It meandered downward as if it was an upside-down Wizard Tower.

“We’re here!”

Anderson took a deep breath and entered.

There was a spiral staircase inside, and he walked down step by step.

Soon, he arrived at the bottom of the Tower.

The bottom of the Mage tower was very spacious, more than a hundred square meters. There was nothing in the surroundings except for a vertical coffin in the center!

The coffin was still emitting cold air, and there was a faint powerful aura coming from inside.

Just by sensing this aura, Anderson found it difficult to breathe.

“Sir, I’m Anderson, the person in charge of the time hourglass!” Anderson humbly lowered his head.

After Anderson said that, the coffin began to move slowly.

The lid of the coffin slowly moved open, revealing the scene inside.

Anderson looked up and saw a white-haired old man in the coffin. His hair was as dry as weeds, and his face and body were wrinkly and extremely pale. However, he exuded a powerful aura that far exceeded that of a third circle warlock.

Gulu!

Anderson’s throat moved slightly as he looked at the legendary figure in the hourglass of time.

Gaido Mista.

He’s a four-circle celestial, but he almost died in a battle with the celestial of the central continent. He had to go into a deep sleep to survive.

Now, several hundred years had passed, and he had finally awoken!

Anderson looked at Gaido, and suddenly, Gaido’s eyes slowly opened.

It was a pair of eyes with dark purple pupils, and there seemed to be traces of lightning gathering in them. However, what was puzzling was that there was another kind of black as if it was corroding the lightning.

“Cough, cough!” Suddenly, Gaido coughed twice.

Anderson was about to say something, but Gaido had already spoken.

His voice was very hoarse, like sandpaper rubbing against a cement road.

“I’ve been in a deep sleep for a long time, and my injuries have yet to recover. The injuries that celestial left on me back then were too severe. Give me another 150 years, and I should be able to fully recover. Anderson, I need you to collect a large amount of blood for me!”

“Yes, my Lord!” Anderson said.

“What’s the situation outside?” After Gaido woke up, he was also very curious about the situation outside.

“my Lord, the environment outside has changed greatly in the past few years!” Anderson quickly told Gaido about the situation in the past few hundred years, especially the rise of the bloodline tower, as well as Herman and the recent arrival of the Holy tower.

“Is that so?”

After hearing this, Gaido fell into silence. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He didn’t expect that so many things would happen here while he was asleep.

A few seconds later, he calmed down. “be steady. Since the bloodline tower and the Holy tower are connected, it means that the situation here might be different from what we thought. Let’s wait until I’m fully recovered.

“I’ll deal with these forces once I’ve fully recovered my strength.”

Gaido decided to play it safe. It had only been a hundred years, so there shouldn’t be any major changes.

When he fully recovered, he would have nothing to fear!

In reality, he wasn’t afraid of anyone on the West Coast, but he had to consider the bloodline tower and the Holy tower’s unknown attitude.

He was determined not to be reckless!

“Yes!”

Anderson expressed that he understood.

Since his lord wanted to wait, then he would wait.
