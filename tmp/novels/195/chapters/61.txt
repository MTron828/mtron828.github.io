62 Seed

“As expected, Queen Cynthia is behind the Kazan Chamber of Commerce.”

On the way, Eli thought about his conversation with Aria.

Because of the soul imprint, Aria had told him everything, including the biggest aristocrat behind the Kazan Chamber of Commerce and the cards he had up his sleeve.

According to Aria, only one-third of the people in the Chamber of Commerce were his uncle’s men. One-third of them were people who were still on the fence. The remaining one-third were people he could trust.

Furthermore, his father had also told him about some reliable channels to contact the nobles behind the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Queen Cynthia.

In other words, as long as Aria delivered the perfume to Queen Cynthia and revealed his identity as the rightful heir, there was a 90% chance that he would receive Queen Cynthia’s support.

As for why it was 90%, it was because Eli felt that there was nothing in this world that was 100% certain. To be able to reach 90% was already a very high level.

It was worth a gamble for Elie.

As long as he obtained the Queen’s support, the Kazan Chamber of Commerce would also be indirectly under Eli’s control.

“But now it’s Aria’s time to work.” Eli thought to himself in a relaxed manner while walking.

Before he left, Eli gave Aria some gold coins. This was also the last investment Eli gave him. After that, it would all be up to Aria Kazan. Eli would not make a move again.

If Aria was still unable to succeed, it would only prove that Aria did not have the ability. Even if Eli helped him, the merchant Association would not be doing well in the future.

It could be said to be a test for Eli.

His first priority was not to expose himself. From the looks of it, no one could link him to Aria. Their only contact was at the entrance of Camellia Lane, but no one cared too much.

As for whether he would succeed or not, if he succeeded, then he would obtain huge benefits. If he failed, then he would pretend that this had never happened. After all, he had only spent three days.

There were still many more three-day in the future.

As for helping Roland, it might not be of much help, but this would at least keep him alive. after all, he really had few friends.

Today was a secret operation, so Eli didn’t call for a carriage and walked back.

As there was a huge market right next to the slums, Eli decided to take a look and see if he could pick up anything.

After a few rounds, Eli didn’t find anything good, but he did gain a lot of knowledge, so it wasn’t like he didn’t gain anything.

“It’s time to go!” After strolling around for a while without any results, Eli was ready to leave.

Suddenly, when he turned a corner, a stall caught his attention.

This was a stall in the corner. There was an old man in linen clothes. One of his legs was disabled, and the bottom of his pants was still stained with mud. He looked very unkempt.

In front of him, there was a piece of cloth with various seeds on it. It seemed to be a stall that specialized in selling various crops and other seeds.

Naturally, these were not the things that attracted Eli. Instead, there was a dark green seed in the center. It was covered in green patterns, and it seemed to be exuding elemental power. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although Eli didn’t know what kind of seed it was, he knew it was definitely not simple.

He immediately walked over. No matter what it was, he would buy it first.

“Hello, what kind of seed is this?” Walking to the stall, Eli pointed at the seed and asked the old man.

Seeing that there was business, the old man immediately perked up and explained to Eli, “Sir, I picked this up on the way here this morning. I don’t know what kind of seed it is, but I guess it must be the seed of some precious crop. Otherwise, how could it be so big?”

Indeed, this seed was the largest among them. It was the size of a peach, so big that it didn’t look like a seed.

“How much is it?” Eli asked directly, not bothering to waste any more time.

“Um, Sir, this is very expensive. This seed ...”

“How much is it?” eli asked again.

“One silver tarl, no, no, it’s five silver tarls.” The old man seemed to hesitate for a long time. He first called out a high price, but seeing that the gentleman in front of him seemed to be quite extraordinary, he decided to call out a higher price.

The heavens pitied him. Five silver tarls were already the highest price he could think of.

“Alright!” Eli nodded and gave the money to the old man.

Although he knew that the old man had raised the price on purpose, he knew that these people were struggling. Five silver tarls was his monthly salary, but it was only a fraction of the amount of money he managed to earn on the gambling table.

“Thank you, sir!” The old man was also stunned. He didn’t expect the gentleman in front of him to actually pay directly.

This was five silver tarls. In fact, the base price in his heart was fifty copper tars.

He stood up in a hurry, his crippled leg almost causing him to fall, but he still immediately put away the seed and handed it over to Eli, afraid that the latter would go back on his words.

Eli took the seed, and the transaction was completed smoothly.

In fact, it was just a seed. How could anyone pay attention to him? it was impossible for a noble young master to come to such a place, and there were no Knights who would fight with him for the seed.

Although Eli was in the noble circle, he really didn’t have any enemies, nor did he have anyone who hated him to the core. In fact, many people might not even remember him.

This was the norm for Eli.

“Take care, sir.” After purchasing the seeds, Eli left immediately, and the old man’s respectful voice came from behind.

Five silver tars might not even be enough for one of Eli’s experiments, but to the old man, it was enough for him to find a place to sleep, buy some black bread, and live for a few months.

On the way out of the market, Eli checked the seed briefly. The dark green seed exuded a strange life force. Eli was sure that it was something he didn’t understand, so he put it away and headed back to the hotel.

He would observe it carefully when he returned. For now, he should go back first.

Soon, Eli returned to the hotel.

Perhaps it was an accident, but this time, they happened to run into the returning diplomatic team. Their leader, Marquis Alina, had a dark expression. Needless to say, the negotiations were probably not going well.

‘It seems like this Queen Cynthia isn’t a simple character!’ Eli shook his head, turned around, and went up to the second floor.

He was just going on a tour, and he had nothing to do with Foreign Affairs.

Instead of thinking about this, his time was better spent thinking about Aria Kazan and what the hell was that seed just now.
