183 Permanent Seat

“The black Isotta?”

“You don’t know who we are?” Simon also seemed to be surprised.

“Why would I want to know about you?” Eli found it strange.

It had been a long time since he had paid attention to the outside forces. From the man’s words, it seemed that this black Isotta force was very famous.

“Haha, that’s understandable. After all, this is the southernmost part of the West Coast. We should be a force in the central region, and there are many forces in between.” Simon was taken aback, but he still smiled.

“Um, what’s your purpose?” Eli frowned.

“Haha, as you can see, I was originally sent by the black Isotta to help the Blood Alliance, but it’s obvious that you’re very strong, so they failed.” Simon looked at the defeated Blood Alliance and said indifferently. “I would like to invite you to join our black Isotta. Black Isotta is one of the two largest forces in the central part of the West Coast. If you join us, not only can we give you the information on breaking through to the third circle for free, but we can also provide you with other help.

“As far as I know, the forces in the South of the West Coast don’t have the knowledge to break through the third circle. This is all blocked.” Simon smiled and said patiently.

Information on breaking through to the third circle?

“Oh? ” Eli frowned as if he was pondering it.

As for joining the black Isotta?

That was impossible. How could he allow others to enter his territory? Moreover, he felt that there was a loophole in the Warlock’s words, which was worth pondering over.

He didn’t know much about the central part of the West Coast, but he knew about the South. There were five to six Warlock forces North of the blood Alliance and the White Tower, which were much larger than the White Tower. However, as long as the White Tower absorbed the forces of the blood Alliance, it would not be too bad.

So they were at least separated from this black Isotta by four to five Warlock camps, so why did this force run so far to support Blood Alliance?

“Haha, actually, we’re in a very fierce battle with another force, so we need to find a way to break through from other places. However, those forces are all in the central region, so it’s not very convenient. Therefore, we thought of breaking through from the South first and then gradually returning.” Simon seemed to have noticed Eli’s confusion and asked.

“Oh? What’s the name of that force?” Eli asked.

“Bloodline tower!”

Simon said word by word.

A strange light flashed across Eli’s eyes.

..

“Herman, are we just going to let him go?”

An hour later, on top of the White Tower, Eli and Kratos stood side by side.

In the distance, Simon, who was wearing a black robe, quickly left.

“Yes, let him go. He’s a second-circle Ultimate Warlock from black Isotta. He can’t die here.” Eli turned his head and said to him.

“The black Isotta?” Kratos ‘eyes widened.

At this time, the people from the Blood Alliance had basically been killed, and the rest had been captured. Therefore, Kratos was free at this time. However, he was still a little shocked when he heard the name.

“What’s their purpose?” Kratos asked tentatively as if Eli was the higher-up.

“It’s to recruit me but I refused,” Eli said.

“Oh, sure.” Kratos nodded, but in the next second, he seemed to realize that something was wrong. He seemed to be the chairman. Simon from the black Isotta Warlock Academy was looking down on people too much, directly looking for Eli and skipping over him.

However, he didn’t have any thoughts about it. If it weren’t for Eli today, the White Tower would have disappeared.

“Hmm, what identity do you plan to use next, Herman? ” Kratos asked.

“Me? I’ll do the same as before, but tell the White Tower warlocks to keep my identity to themselves,” Eli said after some thought.

“Alright!” Kratos nodded and said, “there were only dozens of warlocks before, and they are all our most loyal members. You don’t have to worry about that.

“Alright, then I’ll take my leave.” Eli nodded, turned around, and left.

Kratos, on the other hand, looked helpless.

After all, they had broken through a major faction’s surprise attack. But Eli felt so relaxed.

“However, the same as before?” Kratos muttered and then shook his head. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

That was what Eli said, but he couldn’t do that.

When he was done with some matters, he would propose something new in the next meeting.

The next day.

After a night of purging, all the invading warlocks of the blood alliance had been dealt with, and the masses had basically been appeased. Kratos had also informed the Parliament members to hold a small meeting.

It was still the same meeting room, but it was very different from the last time.

Last time, there were fifteen people here, but this time, there were only nine.

This included Jesse, the Deputy Speaker of the second circle, several warlocks of the second circle, and several warlocks of the first circle. The others were all dead, but Ross and Rawls were alive.

They sat in the conference room in bits and pieces, not saying a word. There was even the smell of blood from yesterday on their bodies, which made the atmosphere a little cold and heavy, but everyone would glance at Eli from time to time.

Everyone still remembered the terrifying scene that happened last night. Pabulo, the strongest person in the Blood Alliance, was killed in one blow. It was like a dream.

It was too ridiculous.

Rawls was sitting at the side, looking at Eli as well. He no longer had any thoughts of wanting to win. There was no helping it. When the gap was still visible, there was still motivation to work hard, but now, it was so huge that it could not be seen at all.

Ross, on the other hand, looked at Eli in admiration, muttering in his heart, ‘as expected of my Lord!’

Facing this scene, Eli was helpless, but he didn’t care. This was inevitable.

“Well, since everyone is here, I won’t waste any time. There are only two things.” Sitting in the main seat, Kratos said, “the first thing is the defeat of the blood alliance. We must quickly take over the territory left behind by the blood alliance. This must be done quickly, so everyone may have to work hard for the rest of the time.”

Everyone smiled when they heard this.

Although they had suffered heavy losses this time, they had also gained a lot.

At this time, the combat power of the higher-ups of the blood Alliance had almost disappeared, leaving only a few small fish and shrimp. For them, this was a huge cake.

...

Once it was fully digested, not only would they obtain a large number of resources, but it would also allow the White Tower’s power to more than double. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the White Tower.

“Hmm, then I’ll quickly tell you everyone’s mission arrangements!”

Soon, Kratos assigned the tasks, and Eli was still in charge of logistics.

“Now, let’s move on to the next topic. It’s about our Deputy Chairman, Herman.” Kratos looked at the crowd and then at Eli.

The others also sat up straight, ready to hear Kratos’ thoughts.

“As the speaker, I propose a motion.

“First, add the word ” honorary ” in front of Herman’s position. No matter what position he held, as long as he wanted to, he could hold it forever. For example, now he is the Deputy Chairman, he is an honorary Deputy Speaker and can hold it forever.

“He has the chairman’s right to veto and approve and may veto and approve any motion.”

Kratos said calmly while the others gasped.

Although there wasn’t much content, it was still very important!

Once this motion passed, although Eli was not the chairman, he was still at the top of the White Tower’s authority. He might even be more impressive than the chairman because even the chairman would not have permanent power.

...

“Everyone, please vote,” Kratos said directly without any nonsense.

The warlocks below looked at each other, then raised their hands.

To the current White Tower, Eli was their strongest member so of course they had to hold onto him.

“Yes, the motion is passed.” Kratos nodded and confirmed the proposal.

On the other hand, the corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. Then again, he was basically gifted power. So why wouldn’t he accept it?

“then this meeting is over. Everyone, let’s go.” Kratos stood up and looked at the crowd. “White Tower will become even stronger after this trial. Meeting adjourned.”

Everyone got up and left quickly. It was not the time to rest.

On the other hand, Eli returned to his Tower unhurriedly. He was not in a hurry.

..

A day later.

In the Tower.

Eli took out a strand of hair in his hand. It was left behind by Simon by accident.

This batch of warlocks had no concept of protecting their own information.

Simon couldn’t die within the White Tower territory but what if they died outside of White Tower?

Therefore, Eli still had to wait for a few days, until Simon walked out of the White Tower’s range.

Since he had failed, he had to bear the price of failure.
