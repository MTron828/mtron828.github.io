291 The Key and The Map

Countless gears fitted together, and the box slowly opened.

Eli also saw the scene inside the box.

The bottom of the box was laid with a dark silver memory metal, and in the metal, there were two things. One was a sealed scroll, and the other was key.

The scroll was brown in color and had a delicate feel to it. There seemed to be something drawn on it, and it was wrapped in a translucent crystal-like Amber.

This was a precious crystal that was usually used to store documents. One would not have to worry about being damaged even after thousands of years in this crystal.

Other than the scroll, the only other thing was the key.

It looked no different from an ordinary key, but its surface was extremely smooth. There were no depressions, but from time to time, a trace of veined pattern would flash.

Eli understood that this was definitely the key to some kind of mechanical lock.

A key and a scroll.

Eli had a strange look on his face. The things inside were not quite what he had imagined.

However, the key might be related to the scroll.

“Let’s take it out and have a look.” Eli shook his head and took out the key first. The key felt normal to the touch, but it was clear that it was made of precious metal.

Other than that, there was nothing special about it. After all, it was said to be key, so its function naturally went without saying.

“Next up is the scroll!” Eli took out a scroll, and the elements in his hand vibrated. The crystal immediately began to crack.

A few seconds later, the crystal detached, and Eli took the scroll.

Without any hesitation, he opened it.

The scroll was unfurled, but the contents of the scroll left him stunned.

“Is this a map?” Eli was puzzled.

On the scroll, there were some mountains, rivers, and some terrains. What was interesting was that there were even labels on the scroll, and one of them was even specially marked.

“Black Isotta, Alice Mage Academy, storm elemental mage Academy …”

The first thing that Eli noticed was the names of the factions on the map.

They seemed to be mage forces.

It seemed like this map had a long history. After all, the mages had left for a long time.

“But is this the West Coast?” Eli tried hard to determine the similarities between the map and the West Coast.

“This is definitely the Sofia mountain range. The map is exactly the same as the one I’ve been to.” Eli looked at a horizontal mountain range on the map, and his eyes lit up.

After confirmation, this should be the map of the West Coast.

In that case, these mage forces should have been the forces of the mage world in the past.

“there’s a key, a map, and a specially marked place.” Eli looked at the two items. They were too straightforward, and he could clearly understand that the key should be the key to open the place marked on the map.

Of course, it might not be the case, but there was a high probability that it was.

But …

Eli’s gaze was calm.

Since he had a map, he definitely had to explore this.

However, this map was obviously a little outdated. After all, it had been thousands of years. The changes in the terrain were still not small. If he followed the map, it would be very difficult to find it.

Even for him, it would probably take a few years to find it.

“I won’t need to find it myself!”

What a joke. The bloodline tower’s influence was spread all over the West Coast, and there were tens of thousands of warlocks. They were more familiar with the terrain than Eli, and there was also some information that could be searched.

“I have to go see Vivika!”

Eli pouted.

..

The next day.

Eli saw Vivika, who was in the bloodline tower.

“Help me find the thing on this map and keep it a secret!” Eli took out the map and handed it to Vivika as if it was a brand.

“Okay, teacher.” Vivika nodded. “But what is this, teacher?” She held the map and asked.

“I took it out from that box,” Eli said directly without hiding anything.

“What? the box left by the tower master Natasha? ” Vivika’s eyes widened.

She originally thought that it was just a normal map, but she didn’t expect it to be taken out of the box. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, she finally noticed that the map was not ordinary. This map only showed mage forces, not Warlock forces. This meant that this was a map from the mage era.

No wonder her teacher wanted her to help look for him.

“yes, teacher, I understand. I’ll be quick!” Vivika held the map and nodded solemnly.

“Be careful. Find someone you can trust!” Elie said.

“I understand!”

Vivika naturally understood.

“don’t worry, teacher. I’ll be in charge of this personally. I should be able to find it in three months at most.”

“Alright, I’ll be waiting for your good news!” Eli nodded.

...

It was indeed much better to have a map as a reference.

After that, Vivika chatted with Eli about the bloodline tower for a while before leaving. Eli also returned to the Wizard Tower.

He was currently living in the bloodline tower.

..

Two months passed in the blink of an eye.

One day, Vivika came to visit Eli.

“Teacher, we’ve found the place!” Vivika seemed a little excited and said quickly.

“Oh?”Eli’s eyes lit up.

“Teacher, you might be familiar with this place!” Vivika smiled and slowly spat out a few words.

“Forest of death!”

..

...

Forest of death!

This was the base camp of the house of the undead that Nikola had created. Now that Nikola had left, this place had been abandoned. However, because of the remnants of the undead aura, there was still much wild undead.

On this day, Eli, Nikola, and Vivika returned here.

In the forest of death.

The three of them stood side by side and looked down.

“Vivika, you said there’s a ruin here?” Nikola was confused.

“Yes.” She nodded and said to Eli, who was beside her, “Teacher, the bloodline tower searched for dozens of days and finally determined that this should be the place marked out.”

“En!” Eli replied casually, but the silvery-white eye in his eyes had already been activated.

The silver-white light gathered and looked down at the forest.

He really did find something interesting.

There seemed to be a huge underground cave about a hundred meters below the ground of the forest. There was also a barrier like thing that seemed to prevent him from peeking.

“Alright, this should be the place.”

A smile appeared on Eli’s face, and he even had the thought of immediately going down to take a look.

However, after hesitating for a moment, he still took out the die to check if he would encounter any danger.

Five points!

Looking at the number on the die, Eli frowned.

It seemed that this ancient remain was not as simple as it seemed.

Five points were already very high. The risk was too great.

Moreover, this was the West Coast, where most of the factions were dark Mages. There might even be some dark Mages’ remains, and as everyone knew, the things left behind by dark Mages were usually not good.

If it were a curse or something, even he would not be willing to face it.

“My Lord, what’s wrong?” Nikola asked as he saw the change in Eli’s eyes and his furrowed brows.

“I’m fine!” Eli shook his head. He was only thinking about how to open these ruins or who should bear the risk!

“Teacher!”

Suddenly, Vivika spoke.

“Oh? “Eli turned to look.

“Teacher, Aisha sent a message. In the South of the West Coast, near the mountains, a huge sky cloud whale is approaching the West Coast. The Holy tower also received the news that a top genius from the Holy tower of the central continent is coming here. It is said that it is related to some clues.” Vivika raised her head and looked at Eli.

“What? ” Eli blinked as if he didn’t expect such a thing to happen.
