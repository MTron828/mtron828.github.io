530 Shadow Dragon

Holy Sword City!

This was a majestic city located in the eastern part of the Western Region. It was also the core of the eastern part of the Western Region. It was under the charge of the former Holy Tower Warlock, the Radiant Sun Warlock of the Bloodline Tower, Luo Ye.

However, the city had almost fallen.

The sounds of slaughter, flames, and wails entered Luo Ye’s ears. He was standing on the tallest tower in the city, holding a weapon in his right hand, and his left hand was long gone.

At this moment, his body was covered in blood, and the bloodline in his body was almost exhausted.

When he lowered his head, he could see countless Warlocks under his command dying under siege. When he raised his head, he could see countless celestials fighting in the sky. Further away, there was an old man wearing a cloud-white Warlock robe.

He remained in midair, but he felt a wave of fear.

More than ten minutes ago, it was this fifth-circle warlock who killed more than ten fourth-circle warlocks with one strike. Then, he easily broke through the city’s defense and even uprooted the city!

“The fifth circle and the fourth circle are two completely different worlds. Why do we have to face such a monster?” Luo Ye’s body trembled as he wailed in grief.

It was this howl that caught the Warlock’s attention.

“The strongest warlock in the city?” His eyes flickered as he raised his hand.

In the next second, a highly concentrated wind element instantly condensed and flew toward him.

Boom!

The wind element was about the size of a finger, but it brought up a hundred feet of wind and waves, letting out a terrifying cry.

“We’re done for!”

Looking at the wind element, Luo Ye felt a fatal feeling. He couldn’t dodge it no matter what.

“However, it’s good that it ended like this. It should have ended long ago!”

He closed his eyes in despair.

But in the next second, he realized that he was not dead.

When he opened his eyes, a shadow entered his sight. The wind element fell into the shadow and was devoured as if it was unobstructed.

Shadow? Sir Eli?

Luo Ye’s eyes widened. He turned his head abruptly and saw a figure shrouded in light.

His scarlet sorcerer robe was fluttering in the wind, and one of the mercury blades was swimming around his body. He held a sorcerer staff in one hand and an ancient sorcerer book in the other. There was also a small snake on his right shoulder.

Luo Ye’s eyes gradually lit up!

“Don’t…Ah!”

Suddenly, he heard a painful cry.

He turned his head and saw that the Sorcerer in the distance had already been swallowed by an Undying Bird wrapped in black fog. He did not even have the ability to resist.

After swallowing the Warlock, the giant bird slowly shrank and flew towards Eli, stopping on his left shoulder.

“Sir Eli!” Luo Ye shouted at Eli.

Eli flew towards him and threw him a bottle of potion.

“This can heal your injuries!” Eli said.

“Thank you, sir.” Without hesitation, he opened the bottle and swallowed it. He immediately felt much better.

Then, he looked at Eli again, only to find that Eli was standing on the Magus Tower, looking calmly into the distance!

“What are you looking at?” He was puzzled.

Just as he was feeling puzzled, the Warlocks on the ground also noticed this sudden change. They raised their heads and looked at Eli in shock.

“Is Sir Eli here?”

“We’re safe!”

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower were already in despair, but when they saw Eli, a ray of light lit up in their hearts.

The Warlocks of the Warlock Alliance looked at Eli, and everyone silently retreated, quickly leaving the city.

Soon, the Warlocks of the Warlock Alliance left the city, but Luo Ye found that Eli was still looking into the distance.

“Sir, what are you looking at?” he asked curiously.

“They are here!” Eli’s calm voice entered his ears.

They are here? Who was coming?

Luo Ye was stunned and looked in the direction of Eli’s gaze.

At the end of his field of vision, eleven figures were flying in his direction. Each of them had a much stronger aura than the white-robed Warlock. Streams of bloody aura wrapped around them, setting off elemental storms.

“All fifth-circle warlocks? And they are all divine trees and above.”

Luo Ye’s eyes widened, and his mouth slowly opened.

In the distance, two Warlocks were flying in front of the eleven people. One was fat, and the other was thin. One was from the Yunge family, and the other was from the Dylo family!

Yunge Warlock looked at Eli and shouted, “Little thief Eli, today is the day you die!”

Roar!

Under Luo Ye’s shocked gaze, the blood aura around the fat Warlock at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm surged, and countless storm elements began to gather towards him.

In the next second, with the roar of the wind element, a Storm Warlock that covered the sky flew over quickly. In the middle of the storm, a huge butterfly-like creature appeared.

Its body was about 500 meters tall as if it had fused with the storm. However, its wings were thousands of meters long. They were silver and green, like blades of the storm that could cut through dimensions.

Six-ringed bloodline, World Extinguishing Wind Crystal Butterfly!

“Not a bad bloodline!” Eli raised his head. The Tree of Law in his body also began to move along his limbs and bones. A bloodline that had been sleeping for a long time was awakening.

Shadow Dragon!

Roar!

Countless shadows intertwined, and the 10,000-meter-long shadow dragon appeared in the sky again. Its huge wings spread out, dragging the space of tens of thousands of meters into darkness.

With a terrifying roar, the shadow dragon raised a shadow of tens of thousands of feet and flew toward the Yun Ge Warlock, who was at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm.

In the blink of an eye, the shadow collided with the storm!

Boom!

A loud explosion made everyone cover their ears.

Then, a strong shockwave instantly covered ten thousand miles. Luo Ye found it difficult to breathe, and countless Warlocks were lifted up, especially in the sky. The sea of clouds instantly turned into shadows and green, and the elements were in turmoil!

Luo Ye raised his head and looked at the center of the collision.

“What?”

His eyes widened when he saw the scene in the sky.

In the sky, the shadow actually suppressed the storm. The huge shadow dragon’s claws had already grabbed the wings of the World Extinguishing Wind Crystal Butterfly, and the Wind Crystal Butterfly was struggling crazily!

Hiss!

Blood splattered like a waterfall. One of the Wind Crystal Butterfly’s wings was torn apart and swallowed by the shadow. The howling World Extinguishing Wind Crystal Butterfly was directly thrown to the ground by the claw!

Bang!

A huge pit instantly appeared on the ground, and a large amount of blood dyed the ground red.

In the first instance, a peak Thousand-leaf Warlock was severely injured by Eli.

“This is Sir Eli, so strong!”

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower on the ground were extremely excited and cheered. The Warlocks in the distance were stunned, especially the ten Warlocks behind them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just a few seconds?

Wasn’t this too exaggerated?

Many of the fifth-circle warlocks looked at the group. They were suddenly not as confident in this battle.

Meanwhile, Eli turned his head and looked at these people with his golden dragon eyes. It was as if there was an inextinguishable flame burning in his eyes.

He opened his mouth, and his voice swept away layers of shadows.

“Come!”
