509 An Old Friend’s Date

Miya was frantically fleeing between the mountain ranges!

Her injuries were very serious. A wound that was half a meter long extended from her shoulder to her abdomen, and purple-red blood kept flowing out. It was a symptom of poisoning.

Moreover, it was not a simple element but a poison that contained a weak law!

If she was willing to spend some time, she could cure it, but the four people chasing him would never give her that time.

At the thought of this, she turned around and looked behind her.

In the sky, not far away, four figures were chasing him closely. Three men and one woman. Each of them wore a warlock robe with bloody handprints on it. They wore masks on their faces, revealing only their cold eyes.

Seeing Miya turn around, the voices of a few people entered her ears.

“Miya, you’re seriously injured. We’ll catch up to you in half an hour at most, and this is no man’s land in the Western Regions. Where can you run to?”

“Lord Dani will be here soon. Even if you dodge our attack, we have already planted our aura on you. When Lord Dani arrives, even if you have a backup plan, what’s the point?”

“Damn it!”

Miya gritted her teeth and cursed. However, her mood became even more depressed as she felt the wounds on her body.

That’s right, being chased by four assassins of the same level while being seriously injured, even though she didn’t think she had any chance!

However, she would never surrender!

“Then we’ll talk when you catch up to me!” Miya cursed and threw a black ball behind her. The ball turned into a thick smoke cage, trapping them. Then, she ran forward.

“Break the prison!”

The corners of their mouths twitched, but they still attacked.

A few minutes later, the prison was broken, and a few of them continued to chase in one direction!

Miya had their mark on her, so they didn’t have to worry about not being able to catch her!

Soon, they caught up to Miya again and started to attack her. Miya had to dodge left and right as she ran. New wounds appeared on her body.

A large amount of blood dyed her clothes red. Not only did this drain her stamina and energy, but it also drained her bloodline power and slowed her down.

Finally, a few minutes later, Miya had to throw out another smoke bomb. She quickly hid in the mountains and a valley. She used all kinds of methods to hide.

In the valley, Miya was gasping for breath. However, she was desperate.

Even she did not seem to believe that she could escape this time.

Sigh!

Miya took a deep breath and leaned against the wall. She opened the ring and took out a crystal ball. A picture appeared on it.

There were three of them. On the left was a woman with long sky-blue hair. Her figure was slender and as cold as a mountain. On the right was another man with black hair and black eyes. He looked so ordinary.

Between the two was a girl with blue hair but a smile.

However, in this picture, there was a crack between the two women. It was a picture that Mia had pieced together.

” Mother, Father!”

Miya looked at the drawing with a pale face. A trace of confusion flashed in her determined eyes!

As a half-step fifth-circle assassin, she could no longer remember how many people she had killed. However, how many people knew that she had become an assassin to avenge her mother?

She had taken revenge a long time ago, but her mother had already died!

“What a heartless man!” She glanced at the man, but there was no hatred in her heart. It was not only her mother who used her father back then, but her father, Udo, had also done many things. He had also paid for everything before leaving the Western Regions.

He still remembered the man’s pitiful but doting voice.

“Miya, if you encounter any danger in the future, go to the west coast’s Bloodline Tower and ask for help. For my sake, he might be able to take you in!”

“Idiot!” Miya smiled.

Putting aside the fact that a place like the West Coast could produce any powerful beings, more than a thousand of them had already passed. The Herman that his father had mentioned was probably long dead.

“However, perhaps I should have left with him back then!” Tears flashed in Miya’s eyes.

“Found you!”

Suddenly, a sparse sound came from the valley in the distance.

Miya was stunned. She quickly put away the crystal ball and hid to the side. She covered her wound while looking at the entrance of the valley.

Crack!

After the tree branch was broken and the four of them appeared in the valley, Miya’s mood fell to the bottom.

“Come out!” At this moment, one of the four looked in her direction with a faint smile.

She was still discovered!

Miya sighed and slowly walked out of the darkness.

“Didn’t I say you can’t run away?” The masked Warlock giggled. He glanced at the others, and they quickly surrounded Miya from four directions.

Looking at the four people surrounding her, especially when they took out their weapons and activated their bloodlines, Miya’s mood fell to the bottom of the valley. She was already seriously injured, but now her internal injuries were triggered. She spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Looks like we’re redundant. Perhaps you won’t be able to live until tomorrow even if we don’t chase after you!” Seeing Miya like this, they all sneered and approached her slowly.

Miya closed her eyes in despair, ready to accept her fate!

“Fortunately, I flew fast. Otherwise, I’m afraid it would have been too late!” All of a sudden, the voice from the valley came again. People looked over. Miya opened her eyes.

At the entrance of the valley, a man wearing a scarlet warlock robe slowly walked out. He had black hair and looked young, but his eyes were exceptionally bright, like the stars.

“Eli!”

Everyone’s eyes widened when they saw the person who had just arrived, especially the four-man assassin team.

As an assassin, they were naturally well-informed. Before entering the Western Region, they must have seen a portrait of Eli. He was known as the number one person under the fifth circle!

However, this wasn’t what surprised them. They were shocked, but why would Eli appear here? Whether it was the Death Mandala or the Grim Reaper, they had nothing to do with him.

Moreover, from his words, there was no doubt that he was prepared to intervene in this matter!

“Eli, this is a private matter between the Grim Reaper and the Death Mandala Flower. It’s best that you don’t interfere. Moreover, our Lord is right behind us and may come at any time.” One of the Warlocks stood up and looked at Eli.

“I’m sorry. I promised some people something. If you kill Miya here, I’ll go back on my word!” Eli smiled at them.

Hearing Eli’s words, everyone looked at each other. Even Miya was surprised. She seemed to have figured out how she could be in contact with this big shot from the Western Regions.

“Our lord, our lord is at fifth circle…” The Warlock continued to threaten.

Bang!

A corpse slowly appeared on the ground.

They looked over.

Instantly, everyone’s eyes widened.

“Lolo… Lord Dani!” A voice rang out in unison. Everyone looked at the familiar corpse in shock. He was wearing a blood-red sorcerer robe and had a pair of dead fish eyes. Who else could it be but Dani?

“This guy is the most incompetent killer I’ve ever seen. He actually took the initiative to fight me, but I killed him!” Eli shook his head in disdain.

Hiss! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The few of them shifted their gazes, and the way they looked at Eli had completely changed.

Dani was a fifth-circle warlock. How could he die? This could only mean that Eli was a fifth-circle warlock!

“Are you a fifth-circle warlock?” A warlock looked at Eli with fear in his eyes. The others were also in disbelief.

Amongst them, the eyes of Miya were also wide open. She stared blankly at the body on the ground. It was the body of Dani, the number one assassin organization in the world!

“Fifth circle!” She knew what this meant, but it made her even more confused.

She had no connection with this person…No, it seemed like someone had hired the Grim Reaper to assassinate Eli…Could it be because of this? That was too ridiculous.

Gulp!

At this moment, they were already dumbfounded and did not dare to move.

“Forget it, I’ll send you on your way.” Seeing this scene, Eli waved his hand. Countless shadows instantly appeared and swallowed them. They wanted to resist, but when the shadows passed, they instantly let out painful wails and disappeared in the shadows.

Was the crisis over?

Seeing the four of them disappear in a flash, Miya no longer had any doubts.

The person in front of him was really in the fifth circle.

“My, my lord!” Miya looked at Eli, but her mood relaxed a little.

“Don’t worry, I’m not a bad person!” Eli approached with a smile.

In the next second.

Thud!

“She’s unconscious.” Looking at Miya, who had fallen, Eli blinked.

When he looked again, he instantly saw the poison all over her body, as well as her injured body.

“It’s quite serious.”

A shadow flashed past, and Miya was sucked into it.

Eli took a glance and left.
