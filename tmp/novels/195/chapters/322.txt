323 Crushing

“That’s Sir Herman!”

Suddenly, someone shouted.

The others finally understood the identity of the shadow dragon. It was the bloodline tower’s final support.

Everyone hid in the building and looked up at the sky, silently praying for Eli. They didn’t want him to fail because if he failed, then Gaido would kill everyone here.

..

In the sky, the huge Thunder Eagle and the shadow Dragon were confronting each other.

“Herman?”

Gaido looked at Eli, his eyes filled with surprise.

The shadow dragon’s bloodline was a fifth-circle bloodline. Where did he get it from? The troublesome part was that Herman’s body was almost half the size of his. This didn’t seem like a newly-advanced celestial!

Or maybe Eli had accumulated a lot of souls, but it shouldn’t be to this extent.

At this moment, he actually felt a little uneasy.

“I’m Herman. You must be Gaido, right? you’re more impatient than I thought. You can’t even withstand that little curse.”

His body was more than 1000 feet long, and his blood flowed like a river. The scales on his body gave off a cold light. He looked at the people on the ground as if they were small black spots.

Was this the shadow Dragon form he was in?

It was truly terrifying!

On the other side, when Gaido heard what Eli said, his eyes widened and he cursed, “So it was you!

“I’m going to kill you!”

Eli’s words had completely infuriated Gaido. He had worked hard for over a hundred years to recover, and yet he was cursed by Eli to such a state. How could he not be angry?

In an instant, the lightning around him bloomed. Countless bolts of lightning were like hundred-meter-long sharp blades, flying towards Eli with a terrifying sound of tearing through the air.

Seeing this, the people on the ground held their breaths and focused.

“Good luck, my Lord!”

“Grandmaster, good luck.”

In the highest Wizard Tower in the distance, Aisha prayed while watching Gaido’s attack. Even if it were just a lightning bolt, it would be enough to kill her easily.

..

“Not bad!” Eli looked at the lightning that filled the sky, his gaze calm.

Although he had just advanced 30 years ago, it would be a big mistake to treat him as an ordinary celestial. Although he had a bloodline avatar, he still had the celestial body that was unique to mages in his consciousness.

Come on!

This would be another test of his strength.

Roar!

In the sky, the huge Shadow Dragon flapped its wings, and countless shadows emerged from the void, turning into curtains that blocked in front of Eli.

The next second, the lightning struck.

“Go to hell!” Gaido shouted angrily. It was as if he could already see the scene of lightning piercing through the shadows and tearing Eli apart.

Thousands of purple lightning bolts struck the shadow curtain.

The next second, the angry voice stopped abruptly.

Although each shadow collided with the shadow, each collision only tore a small hole. It was impossible to break it. What was even more ridiculous was that every time it was torn apart, more shadows would gather in the next second and complete it.

“How is this possible?” Gaido could not believe it, his huge eagle eyes were filled with disbelief.

How could a newly ascended celestial be at this level?

This is bad!

His heart skipped a beat.

If Eli was at this level, could he really beat him in his current state?

He felt like retreating!

He wasn’t very courageous, to begin with. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have hidden for hundreds of years just to be safe when he woke up. Moreover, he had almost died once, so he was even more cautious.

Although this attack was only a probe, it still contained 70% of his power.

All in all, he was a coward.

His huge body waved his wind and thunder as if he was preparing for more attacks. The people on the ground waited, but in the next second, they saw him change direction as if preparing to leave.

The people on the ground were all stunned.

On the other side, the corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“But since you’re already here, don’t leave!” His eyes gradually turned cold, and his golden vertical pupils emitted a cold light.

His huge wings flapped, and countless shadows followed him. Blood burned, and Eli’s speed reached its peak in an instant as he chased after Gaido.

Burning blood secret skill was still very powerful, but it consumed more lifespan.

In the blink of an eye, he had already arrived behind Gaido.

Its huge body was above Gaido’s body.

The dragon’s huge claws grabbed onto the eagle’s wings and gave it a hard swipe.

In an instant, the giant Eagle was filled with blood. One of its wings was torn open, and blood sprayed onto the ground like a waterfall. The giant Eagle let out a long cry of pain.

...

After the first attack, the two separated again.

“Herman!”

At this moment, Gaido was dumbfounded. He turned his head.

He couldn’t understand how Eli could catch up to him.

The heavenly lightning Giant Eagle was a creature that specialized in speed, to begin with, so how could it possibly be caught by the shadow Dragon? however, when he saw the blood aura that surrounded Eli, he seemed to have a vague understanding.

“The fuck? A secret technique that burns life force?”

Gaido was stunned.

He felt like he had met a lunatic today.

What would Eli lose if he left? Was there a need to sacrifice his life for this?

However, he also understood that today’s battle might be inevitable.

“Herman, you’ve gone too far!”

...

Gaido shouted. In the next second, countless bolts of lightning flew toward Eli.

Eli laughed, and with his body wrapped in shadow, he also flew over.

The giant Eagle and the shadow Dragon, two creatures that were hundreds of meters long, were fighting in the sky. The fierce battle made everyone feel afraid. Occasionally, the aftermath of the battle was enough to tear a mountain or destroy an area.

During the Battle, Eli deliberately allowed the battle to take place outside the bloodline tower.

As a result, the other warlocks of the bloodline tower just watched the battle between the two behemoths from afar.

This was the first time they had seen a celestial level battle, and it might also be the last.

“Is Grandmaster that strong?”

Aisha stood in the wizard Tower, looking at the sky in a daze.

In the sky, the shadow Dragon and the heavenly lightning Giant Eagle were fighting. Every time they clashed, huge waves would be set off, and the clouds would be riddled with holes. The only elements in the surroundings were shadows and lightning.

However, what shocked her was that the dragon was suppressing the Giant Eagle.

Every once in a while, Eli would deal damage to the heavenly lightning Giant Eagle.

There were more than a dozen wounds on the Eagle’s body. The biggest one was more than 20 meters long, and one could see the wriggling flesh and lightning inside, but there were also shadows covering it, preventing it from recovering.

Although the heavenly lightning Giant Eagle was huge, the shadow Dragon was even bigger. It was almost 1.5 times the heavenly lightning Giant Eagle.

It was like an eagle catching a Sparrow.

It could be seen that Gaido could not hold on for much longer.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up. There seemed to be a new change in the sky.

..

In the midst of the brutal battle, Eli once again found an opportunity.

This time, he directly grabbed onto the joint of Gaido’s wings, causing Gaido to lose control of his balance and sway left and right.

Eli quickly opened his mouth and countless shadows quickly gathered.

A black ball was brewing inside.

Shadow dragon’s breath.

This time, it was an all-out attack.

In the next second, a black light with a radius of tens of meters flew toward Gaido. The black light pierced through the clouds and lightning, directly hitting Gaido’s body.

Bang! Bang!

Gadio’s body crashed to the ground, followed by a terrifying explosion.

As a Black Wave of air swept across a radius of a few miles, a huge pit of a few hundred meters appeared on the ground, and Gaido’s body was embedded in it.

At this moment, Gaido’s eagle eyes had already turned white, his wings were torn, and who knew how many feathers had been broken. There was even a wound on his abdomen that was almost pierced through. He was in an extremely sorry state.

He wasn’t dead yet, but if he didn’t get treated as soon as possible, he would be dead.

With this attack, his bloodline avatar disappeared bit by bit, leaving the heavily injured Gaido lying on the ground. His arms had disappeared, and there was a wound on his chest.

He struggled to stand up in the deep pit, staring at Eli in the sky.

Eli slowly descended, and he removed his bloodline avatar.

He slowly arrived at the deep pit where he was.

He hoped that he had also suffered some injuries, but they were far from Gaido’s level.

“Herman, you’re very strong!”

Meeting him, Gaido stared at Eli. At this moment, the flesh on his shoulder was recovering rapidly, and it quickly turned back into a white arm, but this was only a temporary recovery.

He looked at Eli with fear.

He didn’t think that Eli would be so terrifying.

This didn’t seem like a newly advanced celestial at all!

Of course, he knew that the most important thing right now was to save his own life.

He moved his hand to his chest and pulled off a necklace. Then, he took out an hourglass with transparent mysterious particles flowing inside. It looked very mysterious!

As he held the hourglass, he looked at the approaching Eli and said, “Herman, let me go!”

“Oh, on what basis?”

Eli looked at him, his gaze fixed on the hourglass.

He felt the power of time.

“This is the treasure of the hourglass. There are time grains inside. You should understand that once you come into contact with the time grains, you will lose at least a hundred years of your life. If you come any closer, I won’t hesitate to break this and die with you.

“On the contrary, as long as you let me go, everything can be discussed. I even promise never to enter the bloodline tower’s territory on the West Coast!” Gaido’s body trembled as he looked at Eli.

He was afraid!

“The time grains?”

Eli’s eyes narrowed slightly. It just so happened that his Eli staff was lacking some materials. This was a very good material, and it was also a top-grade one. As for the threat that Gaido mentioned, Eli laughed.

Of all the threats, you chose the most useless one.

“I’m sorry.”

Eli shook his head and continued to approach.

Gaido’s eyes widened. He didn’t expect Eli to be so brave!

However, he was already at the end of his rope. Once Eli came over, he would really be dead.

“Don’t come over. If you come over, I’ll really use it.”

Eli walked over step by step, and Gaido retreated step by step with the hourglass in his hand.

But Eli didn’t seem to be afraid at all as he strode forward.

“Eli, you’re forcing me to do this!” Gaido trembled.

In the next second, one side of the hourglass suddenly opened up, and the sand that filled the sky flew toward Eli. They flickered with the unique aura of time surrounding every direction of Eli.

“Hmph, you’re courting death!” A smile appeared on Gaido’s face.

With such a range, Eli was dead for sure. It was just a pity that his sand particles were wasted.

But the next second, his smile stopped.

With a wave of his hand, the sand particles in the sky gathered in Eli’s hands. He didn’t even use a special bottle to protect the time grains.

The thing that others couldn’t even hide from was nestled in Eli’s hand.

Gaido was stunned.

“Thank you for your gift.” Eli looked at the sand in his hand and smiled.

He took a few steps to Gaido and directly grabbed his neck.

Then, he exerted force.

Ka!

In the next second, Gaido’s neck tilted, and the celestial died in Eli’s hands with a confused expression.

He didn’t understand even when he died.

Why did the sand of time not work on Eli?
