“Key?”

Vivika’s eyes lit up.

“Dylan and I will go in later. You and Miya stay here!”

“Ah?”

Hearing this, the two of them were stunned, and Vivika pouted!

“There’s no room for discussion!” Eli was also very determined. He couldn’t bring two burdens with him.

“Alright then!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Vivika knew that she couldn’t get in this time, so she nodded unhappily. Miya didn’t have many thoughts, but she was a little regretful that she couldn’t get in.

Ten minutes later!

In the sky.

Eli and Dylan looked at each other and took out the keys.

As the key emitted a wave of fluctuations, the space in front of him rippled like water. In an instant, the spatial rift slowly opened as if it was connected to a certain place.

Eli and Dylan stepped in without hesitation.

Then, the spatial rift slowly closed.

On the ground, the two of them hid in the shadows and waited silently.

..

Weng!

When Eli opened his eyes again, the scenery in front of him had changed.

In front of him was a starry sky, and specks of light that came from nowhere illuminated the place. There were a large number of meteorite fragments floating around, including all kinds of flying war mage tools. Eli even saw several damaged Sky Castles.

Eli’s gaze only focused on these for a few seconds before he turned his gaze to a place not far away.

In the empty space, an enormous ‘planet’ appeared!

It was a silver-white planet. Its huge size was comparable to the moon of the warlock world. It was probably not much worse than the Earth in the past. On it, Eli saw countless mechanical products.

The entire surface of the planet was covered by huge weapons that looked like a steel forest. Eli saw fusion element cannons that were tens of thousands of meters long and elemental energy lakes that looked like oceans.

Of course, that was not all. There were three huge rotating rings around it, covered with countless runes. There were spatial runes, and there were also runes that stored power and burst out. Eli did not know the function of this thing, but his instinct told him that if he used it, even the world would be torn apart!

“Is this the Gray Mage Tower?” Eli took a deep breath, feeling deeply shocked in front of this huge ” mage tower.”

“That’s right.” Dylan nodded and looked at Ely. “Those three rings are called the Rings of the Stars. Firstly, they are a device that drives the Magus Tower to move through space. Secondly, they are offensive devices. The attack of the first ring is comparable to that of the seventh circle, and when the three ring explodes together, the power is enough to destroy a Middle World!”

Hiss!

After hearing his description, he took a deep breath.

One ring compared to the seventh circle, three rings destroyed a world!

He couldn’t even destroy a world fragment, let alone a world.

“As expected of the Mage World’s Ten Great Tools!” Eli sighed. On the other hand, he was even more interested in this Mage Tower. If he could grasp it, then in the current Warlock World, it would indeed be a huge aid.

“Then, Milord, let’s go in.” Dylan urged.

“Don’t be anxious. Let’s talk about the dangers inside first.” Eli turned to Dylan and asked.

“Dangers?” Dylan frowned.” Master, the key itself, has a certain level of authority. Although it can’t let you directly control the mage tower, you don’t have to worry about the mechanical attacks from it. You can also leave the secret plane at any time. The only thing we need to worry about is that there might be some of the creatures left behind by the Invading Paragon from the war. We might need to be careful!”

Oh?

Upon hearing this, Eli looked towards the wizard tower and found that there were indeed some faint black spots on the silver-white ” planet “, as if they were still moving.

“Then we really have to be careful!” Eli said.

With the key, he could move freely and avoid most of the dangers here. However, the black fog creatures would not care. After all, they were mortal enemies with the mages back then!

“However, it’s different this time. The Warlock Alliance will help us explore.” Eli smiled.

“Oh, right, Sir has the key. When we land, we should be able to obtain some basic authority, such as monitoring authority or controlling some basic mechanical items!” Dylan seemed to have thought of something and suddenly looked up.

“Oh, that’s interesting. Let’s go down directly!”

Eli nodded and flew secretly toward the Mage Tower with Dylan.

The huge star ring did not move at this time, but when Eli moved closer to examine the three star rings, he was still extremely shocked. In front of these behemoths, they were as small as ants, and their size was not even bigger than a rune on them. It was hard to imagine how the mages built these creations.

The closer they got to the ground, the more different the observations were.

He found that the planet seemed to be filled with metal. Dylan’s explanation was that the Mage Tower itself was actually modified by a metallic lifeform. It was the body of a ruler that was accidentally killed by the Mage World. Of course, it had lost most of its powers, but it still retained some special features, such as the ability to repair itself!

So, in fact, the surface of the planet was still very neat, and only the mage’s creations were damaged. In fact, after the war, plus thousands of years of no maintenance, 95% of the mage’s creations were damaged and needed to be repaired before they could be used.
