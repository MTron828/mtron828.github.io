277 Hydra

The battle between the Holy tower and the bloodline tower was in full swing.

It was peaceful among the irises.

For a Mage force, as long as they were a little sneaky and hid in some hidden places, the danger was actually not that great. Not to mention, the resources of the irises were greatly related to the White Tower and the bloodline tower, so the danger was even less.

As for the other mage organizations, he didn’t need to worry about them.

Other than the iris, there was no other Magus force on the West Coast. It was not that the iris flowers had taken over too many Mages, but that the Mages were slowly disappearing with the passage of time!

In the blink of an eye, it had been almost 4000 years since the mages left.

That was 4000 years, not 40 years or 400 years. 4000 years was enough for a civilization to develop from a backward civilization, and it was also enough to make the traces of Mages disappear bit by bit!

With Eli’s help, the iris flower was still alive and well. He just didn’t know what the mages in other parts of the world were like. Eli could only hope that it wasn’t all gone!

“Forget it. I’d better think about my chimeras.”

Eli shook his head and put aside these random thoughts.

He was in the laboratory.

The table was filled with a large number of items, which looked like a small mountain.

“The core of the elemental giant, elemental binding potion, a large amount of flesh and blood elements, some minerals, and …” Eli kept on counting these things.

It was his first time making chimeras, so he had to be careful.

Not to mention the elemental core, which was at the peak of the third circle, even the other materials, none of which were lower than the third circle, had been collected by the bloodline tower for hundreds of years!

If it weren’t for the fact that he had a huge force behind him, it wouldn’t have been easy to collect them.

The materials were only one aspect. He had also done a lot of preparation in other aspects. His original idea was to transfer the devouring curse to the chimeras ‘cores. For this, he had designed for decades before he was confident.

“Then let’s start!”

With a snap of his fingers, all the doors of the laboratory closed, and all contact with the outside world was cut off.

Eli began the synthesis!

..

In the blink of an eye, a year had passed!

Outside the laboratory, with the sound of the door opening, Eli slowly walked out of the door.

Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something and turned around.

The door opened, revealing the laboratory inside.

“Hydra!” called Eli.

Suddenly, a black shadow flashed by the side of the door!

Then, a figure slowly appeared.

It was a small snake!

It was a small black snake covered in black scales. Its eyes were black, like shadows. If you looked carefully, you would find that its scales were not normal scales but made of shadows.

This was a half-elemental creature, and it was also the result of a year of hard work from Eli!

“Hydra!” Eli called out, and the little snake quickly came to the bottom of his pants as if it had received an order. Then, it followed the bottom of his pants and came into his hand.

Looking at this little snake, Eli revealed a happy smile.

Hydra was the name that Eli had given it, and it was also Eli’s first Chimera!

“I still need it to grow from the first ring!” Eli sensed the little snake’s level.

However, even though it only was at first circle, due to the grade of the materials and the buff of its devouring rune, as long as it devoured enough things, it could quickly reach the third circle.

Devour!

This was its most special feature!

Eli looked at his arm. The brand that was originally on his arm had already disappeared because he had already transferred it to the core of the Hydra.

He pondered and suddenly lowered his head.

At this moment, Hydra’s Black eyes were looking at Eli. It opened its mouth, and one could even see a black core inside its body. The devouring rune was imprinted on it.

“Are you hungry?” Eli smiled and took out a shadow attribute ore!

The ore was the size of a basketball, but the Hydra’s pitch-black eyes seemed to light up, and it let out a whimpering sound. It then opened its mouth wide, and as if there was a shadow vortex in its mouth, it directly swallowed it.

Looking at this scene, Eli laughed heartily.

This feeling was like watching a small snake swallow an elephant.

After swallowing the ore, the Hydra closed its mouth and let out a loud Gada sound as if it had burped. Its eyes flashed with a black light, and it was very satisfied!

At the same time, the aura of the Hydra also rose slowly!

“Interesting, interesting!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

Hydra climbed up his arm and onto his shoulder, and Eli left the secret realm.

After leaving the secret realm, Eli met Nina.

“Did something big happen this year?” Eli asked.

“Milord, nothing has happened. The current situation seems to be very stable!” Eli nodded and then said to Nina, ” Nina, help me gather more resources of the shadow element!”

“Alright!”

...

He then returned to his residence!

..

Another three years!

In the laboratory, Eli looked at Hydra.

At this moment, the Hydra’s body was already as thick as a thigh, and its aura had also reached the limit of the first circle, only a step away from the second circle.

“Just a little more!”

Eli took out a shadow element core and handed it to the Hydra.

Hydra swallowed it in one gulp.

After a few seconds, the Hydra’s aura started to rise slowly.

Half an hour later, his aura reached the second circle.

However, what surprised Eli was that as the Hydra grew, the back of its original body actually began to split apart slowly, and another snake head slowly appeared.

...

However, this time, it was different from the black eyes before. This one was red, like a ruby!

“Eh?”

Eli looked at this change and pursed his lips!

This Chimera of his seemed to have undergone a different change due to the devouring rune that he had integrated into it. It seemed to have another attribute, the fire element. Of course, it might also be related to the core of the elemental giant!

This was interesting.

After Hydra broke through, it slowly crawled over and slowly approached Eli. It rubbed against the leg of Eli’s pants and made a ‘kada kada’ sound.

“Come, let me see your transformation!” Eli started to sense the changes in the Hydra slowly.

The fire element was only one aspect. Very quickly, Eli discovered the uniqueness of Hydra. In the snake head of the fire element, it seemed that the consciousness that existed was still the Hydra, but it had split its main soul a little.

“I see. Interesting. I wonder if there’ll be a third head when you reach the third ring!”

After learning some more recent information, Eli returned.

There were still no major changes, but the Holy tower had recently taken out a lot of mage resources, which changed the situation a little, but it did not affect the overall situation.

They had yet to make a move that could change the situation.

..

Five years later.

Eli looked at Hydra, who had grown a third snake head with blue eyes.

At this moment, the Hydra’s body was as thick as a water bucket, and its body had also reached a few dozen meters, just like a giant beast. However, because it was an elemental creature, it could still shrink to an extremely small size.

“You’ve reached the third circle!”

He turned his head and looked at the Hydra that was on his shoulder!

Gada!

It was still the familiar voice, and Hydra was rubbing against Eli’s neck.

Eli smiled.

It’s still fine for now, but recently, Hydra’s appetite has been increasing, and the iris couldn’t satisfy Hydra’s appetite anymore.

Where could Eli find large amounts of food and resources?

Eli thought!

The next second, his eyes lit up.

The battlefield!
