479 The Crushing of Technology

Weng!

In the night, the coated airships were like ghosts in the sky, heading towards their predetermined destinations. Inside were Warlocks.

The Warlocks each had their own duties and were in an orderly manner.

In one of the airships, Vivika, who had taken the initiative to participate in the battle, stood at the front of the airship.

“How far are we from the target?” Vivika asked the Warlock beside her.

!!

“There’s still an hour left!” the Warlock reported.

“It’s too slow. Speed up and order the team to fly higher. Don’t be discovered.” Vivika frowned.

“Yes, madam!”

The Warlock nodded and immediately contacted the other airships.

“There are still two hours before the joint attack.” Vivika estimated the time. Although the team was scattered, everyone’s tentative timing was the same.

Compared to magic beasts, airships that were tens of thousands of meters high were almost undetectable.

“I wonder how strong this big guy is!” She patted the silver cabin wall at the side and felt a lot more at ease when she felt its solid touch.

Although she had never seen its actual combat strength, she believed that it would not be bad.

Time passed by slowly. An hour later, the airship arrived at its destination, one of the core cities of the Heart of Abyss in the south. It was a very important node!

“Hide and wait for the general attack!”

Vivika reached out her hand and signaled for the airship team to stop.

Soon, the airship stopped in the air as if it had stopped moving. The Warlocks were ready for the first round of attacks. They were all piloting the airship with nervous expressions.

The atmosphere in the airship suddenly became tense. Even Vivika was affected. She looked at the alchemical clock at the side from time to time, watching the time pass.

Drip, drip, drip. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Suddenly, Vivika spoke up as she spun once again.

“Time’s up. Lower the altitude and attack!”

Weng!

The taut strings suddenly relaxed. In the next second, a commotion sounded.

Like mountains or seas.

Earth-shattering!

..

At this moment, in the city on the ground.

On the city wall.

A group of Warlocks stood guard on the tower.

Suddenly, one of the Warlocks said, “Did you hear something?”

“Is there any sound?” The Warlock beside him yawned and looked at him in confusion.

The others also glanced at him. Some of them even ran to the front and activated their owl-like bloodline. They looked into the distance and the sky for a few hundred meters, but there was nothing.

“No. There’s nothing.” After the investigation, the Warlock turned around and said to these people.

“Then it’s fine.” The Warlocks relaxed.

Ever since the Bloodline Tower had initiated the war warning, not only was the city under curfew, but it had also entered a state of war alert. There were always people patrolling and observing.

Everyone settled down.

Buzz!

However, in the next second, everyone stood up at the same time because they also heard the buzz.

“Something’s wrong!”

A Warlock shouted and ran outside.

Walking out of the tower, he realized that the city had been completely awakened. Countless lights illuminated the city, and Warlocks stood outside, looking at the sky with serious expressions.

Was there anything high up in the sky?

The Warlock was stunned. He raised his head and opened his mouth.

“You must be joking!” The Warlock’s voice trembled.

In the sky, dozens of airships occupied the entire sky and were gradually descending. They were only a dozen kilometers away from the city.

It was in the middle of the sky. No wonder they didn’t notice it.

The Warlock’s throat moved slightly.

He stood there in a daze and looked at the sky. He was curious about what this was and how they should deal with it.

“How dare you! This is the territory of the Heart of the Abyss!”

In the distance, more than ten third-circle Warlocks flew into the sky.

“The lords of the Third circle have made their move.” The Warlock’s eyes widened as he watched this scene.

Kakaka!

What was that sound?

Hearing the sudden sound, the Warlock looked at the airship. Suddenly, the coating of the airship cracked open. Mechanical devices moved one by one, and countless elemental cannons were exposed. The largest one was nearly seven to eight meters in diameter!

“F * ck…”

The Warlock widened his eyes.

He was not the only one. The other Warlocks were also staring blankly at this scene.

In the next second, the birds and beasts scattered. The Warlocks activated their defenses one after another, and the dozens of third circle Warlocks immediately stopped moving upwards. Instead, they changed directions and fled into the distance.

“Too late.”

In the airship, Vivika ordered.

“Fire!”

A large amount of energy reserves were consumed, and the elements within a few kilometers were instantly sucked dry. Countless elements surged into the elemental cannon like light spots.

There were hundreds of such cannons in dozens of airships.

In the next second, light bloomed, and rays of light wreaked havoc on the ground.

“Ah!” The Warlock’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. In the corner of his eye, the dozen or so third circle warlocks melted into the light like the first snow. They did not even struggle much.

Then, there was a thunderous boom that sounded like an earthquake. The entire city was instantly under bombardment. Countless light elements were gathered by the elemental cannons and exploded with the strongest power. The light emitted even caused the entire city to instantly fall into daylight.

Even from tens of kilometers away, the light could be seen.

The Warlocks in the city also tried to resist, but they were unable to organize effective resistance. Of course, the city had also deployed flying beast groups in advance.

However, the Warlock only cast a glance and saw the Magical Beast Army in the distance, which was already in a mess amidst the rumbling sounds. It was almost impossible to command the Magical Beast Army, let alone hope to resist.

The Warlock was hiding in a corner, and his body curled up in fear.

For the first time, he felt that they were being crushed.

This was not something they should face!!

Everyone is using flying beasts. How can you use airships? What a bully!

As time passed, the attacks gradually slowed down. At this moment, almost half of the city had been destroyed. Tens of thousands of people had died in this round of attacks, but they could not even compare to the power of the sky. They could only take the hits passively.

“Is it over?”

The Warlock heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the rumbling around him gradually fade away.

He was lucky that he was not attacked.

Weng!

However, when the buzzing sound came again, he raised his head and saw another round of accumulated light from the elemental cannon. His expression slowly froze, and the despair in his heart quickly accumulated.

“What a bully!”

The Warlock cursed.

Boom!

In the next second, a white light suddenly descended and wiped the Warlock out.

The elemental cannons once again wreaked havoc in this dilapidated city!

And it wasn’t just here. The same light shone in dozens of places in the Western Regions. It was like a grand fireworks display.

Countless forces were shocked.

Every battlefield had a crushing advantage. When the airship suddenly descended and the Elemental Cannon was set up, even a third-circle warlock would not be able to resist it. This was a true large-scale war mage weapon, a butcher of flesh and blood!

As for the Bloodline Tower.

Eli stood on the wizard tower, observing everything through space with his silver eyes.

Seeing that everything had settled, he smiled.

He had thought that it would go smoothly, but he didn’t expect it to go so smoothly.

In just a few rounds of attacks, these territories were almost completely lost.

This also meant that the first round of attacks had ended, and they only needed to wait for the ground forces to occupy these areas.

Of course, there was another matter that had to be thoroughly publicized.

“Declaring war!”

Looking at the moonlight, Eli laughed and returned to the mage tower.

This was just the beginning!
