115 The Three Apprentices

The valley was actually very safe. Otherwise, how could this Kraken have lived here for so long? moreover, it had been thousands of years. Even if there were any traps in this place, it would have probably rotted away long ago.

This spell formation was practically useless.

He walked into the valley.

It was only then that Eli realized that the inside was much bigger than he had imagined. He could only see a small part of the entrance, but the inside was very large. However, there were rocks everywhere, and only the middle area was an empty space.

At this time, in this empty area, other than some young Kraken snakes, there was only a large number of white bones and corpses piled up on the white ground. At this time, a giant snake at least 15 meters tall was waiting for him.

A Snake King at the limit of zero-circle.

However, Eli wasn’t too concerned about him at the moment. His gaze was completely focused on the huge rock wall behind the giant snake.

On the smooth rock wall.

A bronze door was embedded in it, and all kinds of complicated runes were carved on the surface of the door. A faint spatial fluctuation was emitted from it as if it was not in harmony with this world.

Eli guessed that this should be the entrance to the secret plane.

Anna’s judgment was right. This was a Mystic realm. Thinking about how he was close to a celestial ruin, even Eli had to take a deep breath to remain calm. Putting everything else aside, just the mystic realm alone was already worth the heavens.

Not to mention the items inside.

Eli looked around before walking towards the bronze door.

The Kraken Snake King, “…”

‘Am I air?’ He completely ignored me and wriggled his body. He felt like he was being provoked. In the past, he would ruthlessly wrap his prey in such a situation and then slowly crush them to death.

Hiss!

The snake’s tongue streaked through the air, and the Snake King’s muscles instantly tensed up. Then, it flicked its tongue at Elie.

‘Damn human, go to hell!’

The giant snake exuded an instinctive malice and quickly glided towards Eli. He then saw Eli cast him a glance and raise his right hand. The giant snake saw a ring on the man’s ring finger as if something was brewing.

The Snake King didn’t quite understand what it was, but he still felt his heart palpitate instinctively. He immediately stopped and wanted to Dodge, but the ring seemed to have finished storing power. In the next second, two dazzling lightning pythons appeared and came to him in an instant.

Lightning filled the air, and the Snake King was instantly reduced to ashes.

Even the Snake King died in the end, not understanding what it was! Eli only felt that he had wasted the ring to deal with the Kraken King.

…

After casually testing the effects of the lightning Python ring, Eli stepped on the charred Snake King and came to the metal door.

The bronze door had a special texture to it, and upon closer inspection, Eli realized that the door was probably just an entrance.

He definitely wouldn’t have been able to enter when the Celestial was still there, but now that the Celestial had long passed away, he should be able to enter as long as he stimulated a certain amount of mana.

“Do I need to go in?” Eli looked at the door calmly and turned to leave.

It was too dangerous!

This was a celestial realm, and he was only a small mage. If there were any traps inside, it was not something that Eli could deal with. This was really inappropriate. In fact, even a small trap could directly kill Eli!

He shook his head. It was too dangerous.

“Let’s think of something.”

Although he didn’t plan to enter the secret realm for the time being, how could he give up? This was the legacy of a celestial. He couldn’t give up on this place.

However, entering the secret plane required mana, which one had to be a mage first.

But other than Eli, were there other mages?

“Where?” Eli shook his head, but he suddenly thought of Weiss.

Weiss?

This guy was also an apprentice, but he was also from this area.

Eli pursed his lips. He seemed to have thought of a way.

Since he wasn’t going to enter by himself, why didn’t he train some students and let them in? whether it was to wait until the search was over to take the harvest or to explore the danger and enter directly, both were good methods.

“Let’s do this!” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

It was impossible for Eli to train people to become official mages, but he could easily take on apprentices.

Furthermore, it wouldn’t take long. At most, it would take ten years to train a few students. It would be very easy.

Safety was still the most important.

He walked out of the valley.

“Teacher, how is it? did you find it?” Anna was the first to run over and asked.

“Yes.” Eli nodded. “seal this place first, then set up a spell formation to hide this place. We can’t explore this place for the time being. We need to make some preparations.”

“How long?”

“I don’t know!” Eli shook his head. “send the whole troop of this excursion to me. I can’t reveal that I’m a wizard yet!”

The warriors were loyal but it was better to brand them with soul imprints.

Anna followed Eli back to the chariot.

“Also, collect some blood from children aged 8 to 12 in Junlin city, no, all the cities near Junlin. I need some students.” Eli ordered again.

“Yes,” Anna said.

At the moment, everyone who knew about Eli’s uniqueness was his servant, so he could be a little more unscrupulous. However, he decided to be more cautious in taking in students. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After all, being a sorcerer was different from the others, and it did not seem to be a righteous profession in the current world.

…

Very quickly.

Under Eli’s orders and Anna’s command.

Soon, they had collected the blood of all children of age in the nearby cities for Eli.

As for Eli’s goal, it was to test if they had the talent to become a wizard.

Soon, out of the 10000 portions of blood, Eli had also successfully found three talented children.

And soon, Eli found out about the three children’s information.

One was a beggar, one was a daughter of a noble family, and the last was a thief who had just been caught and sent to prison.

Of course, status didn’t matter. To Eli, he only wanted a few tools. As long as they were useful, he didn’t care about their looks. As for what would happen after the tools were used up, that was another matter.

He immediately ordered the three children to be brought back.

Something else happened in the process.

…

In a small city a few kilometers away from Jun Lin city.

In the slums.

A group of children was beating up a child.

“Hand over the money, or we’ll beat you to death!” A tall child kicked the child under his feet and scolded loudly.

“I won’t!”

The one who was beaten up was a boy. He was curled up, holding five copper tarls in his hand. A week ago, there was a blood collection in the city. As long as a child went to donate blood, they could get five copper tars. Then he went too and got the money.

However, the other children found out and came to snatch it.

His parents had died a long time ago, so there was no one to help him.

Seeing that they couldn’t get the money, the other children began to pry open his fingers, wanting to take out the money.

“My money!” The boy was desperate and helpless.

Bang!

Suddenly.

A group of people suddenly ran over from a distance. One of them pointed at him and said, “It’s him.”

A group of Knights immediately ran over.

When the children saw this, they dispersed. The boy was also very confused. However, when he saw the five copper tarls in his hand, he smiled. They weren’t snatched away. He kept them and then fainted on the ground.

The unconscious boy was carried by the Knight to the carriage and left.

…

In another city.

In a Castle, a fat man with a big belly sat on a chair. He looked at the little girl opposite him and said in a heavy tone, “daughter, the count likes you very much. I was forced to send you there. Why did you come back?”

Opposite him was an eleven-year-old girl in a white dress. She was crying pitifully.

Last night, when she went to the count’s house to attend a banquet, her father actually threw her to the count of his own accord. If she had not taken advantage of the lax security and run out, who knew what she would have gone through that night?

She was already twelve years old, and she understood many things.

Moreover, she was not the biological daughter of the aristocrat but a stepdaughter. She had suffered all kinds of injustice at home. Although the man in front of her was his father in name, she would rather he die.

“I’m telling you, Vivika, this is not up to you to decide.” The Viscount looked at the crying girl and slammed the table in anger.

Vivika bit her lips.

She wanted to resist, but she didn’t have the ability.

Bang!

Suddenly, the door in the distance was pushed open.

“It’s her!” Another person pointed out.

“yes. Hello, Viscount Christie. We need you to cooperate with us on something. We need to take your daughter away. We will explain to you later.” The Knight was also very direct.

“get lost. You know that my daughter is the private property of count Corona. You can’t take her away.” The Viscount was also stunned, but he still tried to find a higher noble to suppress him.

“Count Corona? Then tell him to come to us.” The cavalryman laughed.

He slowly walked to the girl’s side and said softly, ” “Little friend, are you willing to come with us?”

Vivika’s tears were still flowing. She had just heard her father’s words, so she said, “I’m willing to.”

“That’s good.” The Knight nodded and was about to leave with the girl.

“Damn it, reis!” The Viscount was furious. He was beyond furious.

He had an advanced Knight with him.

Ries, who had been following behind, rushed out. However, when he saw the man holding the girl’s hand, he was stunned.

Grand Knight. The whole group was comprised of Grand Knights.

“Go!” The Viscount continued to shout.

Ries’s throat moved slightly.

Just like that, the girl was taken away.

…

And in a certain prison.

A 12-year-old boy who had just been arrested was suddenly released. He was also taken out of the prison and headed to Jun Lin.

In the future, they would become Eli’s students.

After becoming an apprentice, they would explore the secret plane for Eli.
