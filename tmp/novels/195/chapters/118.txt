119 Shadow Dragon

Mental power transmission was the fastest of all transmissions. It could completely transmit the original owner’s perception, understanding, and knowledge to the other party, but few people would use it because it would damage the receiver. However, Nick didn’t care about that at the moment.

The first thing that was transmitted was a meditation technique.

The tidal sea meditation technique.

The intermediate-level meditation technique was bound to be of a much higher quality than the basic meditation technique.

A basic meditation technique could only be used up to the second circle because its simple structure could not support a large amount of mental power. The better ones were the low-level, medium-level, and high-level meditation techniques.

Normally, intermediate meditation techniques wouldn’t be taught to outsiders, but since the world was already in this state, Nick made an exception.

Eli quickly checked this new meditation technique, even if it was just a rough estimate, it was at least twice as fast as before.

That was why knowledge was the source of power.

After the transmission of the meditation technique, it was time for the special knowledge that Nick had mentioned.

Life extraction or transcendence extraction.

This was the unique knowledge that Nick had combined with his own studies. By using a special structure, one could fully stimulate the vitality of plants or the characteristics of extraordinary materials. It was the dream of alchemists.

Nick was just unlucky. If he had made this discovery when the mage world was still around, he would have been famous.

There was a lot of content in this part, and it took Nick half an hour to finish transmitting it.

At this point, all of his core inheritances had been transmitted.

After the transmission, Eli opened his eyes again half an hour later.

He had no choice, the aftereffects were too strong.

Looking at Nick again, he was also much weaker.

“there’s no need to look over there. It’s just some useless things. Some magic crystals, some first circle Books, and some materials.” Nick continued when he saw that Eli had woken up.

In fact, he had almost used up everything and only had some leftovers.

As for why there were only books of the first circle, it was mainly because he felt that there was a high chance that the people who would come here would be first circle mages, so he didn’t prepare any other books.

From his point of view, once a person became an official mage, one had to rely on oneself. Only by constantly pursuing the truth would one be able to obtain true power.

As soon as Eli recovered from the transmission, he was slightly disappointed.

But fortunately, this time, Eli had already gained a lot, and he wasn’t that greedy.

Meditation techniques, life extraction, secret manuals, and wealth.

Such a harvest was a lot for a Mage.

“Yes, my aura is about to disappear, so after I die, the ruins will be yours.” Nick’s aura dissipated bit by bit, but he glanced into the distance and smiled. “Goodbye.

“Mages will never die because the truth is eternal. It’s a pity that I won’t be able to see the day when the mage World returns.” Nick said with a sigh.

Eli also felt a wave of sadness.

Nick’s aura also started to disappear bit by bit, and in just a few seconds, he was gone without a trace.

“Even the final celestial mage is gone?” Eli sighed.

However, at this moment, a Dragon’s Roar suddenly came from the distance.

The terrifying sound seemed to come from underground, and it was a little dull.

Eli’s heart skipped a beat.

The aura of a second circle?

He looked toward the source of the sound. If he remembered correctly, it should be the location of the prison.

…

At this moment, in prison.

Bang!

As Nick’s spirit disappeared, countless shadows appeared at the bottom of the prison. A dragon-like creature slowly stepped out of the shadows.

It was a typical Western Dragon-type creature. It had a body of pitch-black scales, golden vertical pupils, and two huge wings on its back. Around it was countless shadows intertwining and blending.

“I, Shadow Dragon Chris, have returned.” The shadow roared and stood in prison.

In the next second, countless shadows rushed toward the cage. With a bang, the cage was instantly broken open. Chris took a look and flew out of the tower.

After waiting for a few thousand years, he finally got the chance.

“Let’s kill a bug to liven things up.”

He flapped his wings and flew into the sky. Then, he glanced at the prison behind him and roared again.

Looking around, he saw Eli at the castle Gate.

Like a bolt of lightning, the shadow Dragon flew towards the castle.

The sudden attack sent shivers down Eli’s spine. The gigantic Shadow Dragon should be a second circle being, but its massive aura did not seem like one at all.

Under such circumstances.

All he could do was activate all his defenses.

1st circle spell-Elemental Shield, 1st circle spell-thorn shield, 1st circle spell-wind wall, 1st circle spell-gentle water mist

In the blink of an eye, seven or eight shields had already been placed on the outside of Eli’s body. Layer after layer, they directly covered his body.

Chris’s dragon eyes were also stunned by this scene. Why would a first-circle sorcerer learn so many defensive spells?

However, Eli was still not his match.

He let out a roar and then accelerated again. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

In mid-air, he clawed.

The sharp dragon claws cut through the air, and the shadows attached to them corroded the surrounding air, making hissing sounds. Three dark crescent moons flew towards Eli.

In the blink of an eye, the shadow attack had already arrived in front of Eli and touched his shield.

The sound of his shields shattering rang out, and each shield was like paper. At this moment, Eli finally understood how terrifying the creature in front of him was. He immediately took a step back and dodged the attack by a hair’s breadth.

However, the shadow Dragon had already gotten even closer.

“Go to hell, you damned Mage!” Chris let out a cruel smile.

He was going to vent his anger on this weak little wizard.

At that moment, he was less than fifty meters away from Eli. Such a distance was like being right in front of his eyes.

Suddenly, the photostone not far away emitted a blinding light, and a figure slowly appeared again.

“I was waiting for you.”

Nick was wearing a wizard’s robe and holding a magic staff in his right hand. He looked at Chris calmly and then waved his magic staff!

In an instant, countless chains appeared out of thin air in the sky and wrapped themselves around Chris. The shadow Dragon’s huge body was directly trapped in the Sky.

“Nick, you old man.” Chris was also confused by the sudden restraint. However, he immediately understood when he saw Nick. He had been tricked.

This old man had hidden another spirit in the photostone, or it could be said that his true spirit had not dissipated before.

Even after thousands of years, they could still predict what would happen. These damn mages.

“Eli, this is my final gift to you, the bloodline of the shadow Dragon.

“Shadow Dragons are the best at hiding and camouflaging. They can easily imitate the fluctuations of other creatures and camouflage them. This way, you’ll have a much easier time in this world.” Nick turned his head and said to Eli as if he had not heard Chris’ words.

The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched.

This turn of events was truly out of his expectations.

But where did this Shadow Dragon come from?

“Nick, don’t get too cocky. Do you think I didn’t know you had a backup plan?” Chris, who was Trapped in the Sky, roared angrily when he heard Nick’s voice.

He had been trapped for more than three thousand years after Nick’s death!

After three thousand years, he naturally thought that Nick might have a backup plan. After all, he was once a four-circle creature!

Chris took a deep breath, and large shadows appeared around his body. Today, he was going to burn what little life he had left to find a chance to survive in this world.

In an instant, his aura continued to rise.

Second circle.

Three circle.

After his aura rose to three circle, it grew much faster, but it still rose steadily. A few seconds later, the aura of three circle was broken.

Four circle.

He opened his huge Dragon mouth and stared with his dragon eyes. He let out a cruel voice and said, “Watch me tear you guys apart!”

??

Even Nick didn’t expect Chris to be so crazy.

Chris used to be an extremely calm creature. Now that he had become like this, it was a little troublesome.

Chris advanced to the fourth-circle level when he was only 2000 years old and was captured by Nick, who came from another world. He was then trapped in a small cell for 4000 years.

That was four thousand years!

If he had not burned his power, he would have died inside.

“Go to hell!” Chris, who had returned to the fourth circle, broke through the chains. The chains that filled the sky turned into runes and disappeared. He then charged toward Nick’s soul.

The battle began.

This was also the first time Eli had witnessed a battle between celestials. Although the two of them were in a much-weakened state, it was still extremely terrifying.

Nick cast a shield over Eli and threw him somewhere else in the arcane realm.

“Where is this place?”

After being thrown out, Eli realized that he was no longer in the same place as before but in the prison that Vivika had been to before.

Eli was dumbfounded. ‘Why didn’t you just send me out of the secret plane? This place is still dangerous!’

Well, at least he was sent away from the battle. After all, even if it was a battle between two weakened celestials, it was enough to annihilate Eli in the aftermath.

“Forget it. Let’s just wait.” Eli shook his head.

One man and one dragon, they were already at their limits.

The battle would be over in a short while.

If the Magic Dragon wins, it’s over for Eli, and if Nick wins …
