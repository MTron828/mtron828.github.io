160 Second-Circle Warlock

Time was fair to everyone because the time that passed for Eli was the same as everyone else.

In the blink of an eye, another ten years had passed, Eli had also passed through the initial stage of chaos in this newly born faction, and the White Tower had also begun to gradually become orderly.

At this time, he was already the seventh member of the White Tower Council. This was because one of the previous council members had died in a battle, so the subsequent council members were promoted.

Of course, this was not worth mentioning to Eli. As a mage, his spiritual force was at 61%, his elemental essence conversion was at 66%, and he had officially stepped into the late stage of the first circle. However, he seemed to have made more progress in the direction of his bloodline. He had already reached 95 points of compatibility and could break through at any time.

This wasn’t what Eli wanted. He was a mage, after all, but he made more progress as a warlock than a mage. He was probably the first one to break through in his bloodline even though he was already on the path of a mage.

!!

The arrow had already been nocked and had no choice but to be released.

Therefore, more than a year later.

After applying for leave, Eli came to the iris campsite, just like every few years.

“What a great change!”

It was different from thirteen years ago. The camp was in a completely different situation.

Standing on the tree outside the mage camp, he saw a large camp in front of him. The area was two to three times larger than before, and the number of people was also twice as large.

Except for a few mages who grew naturally in the wizard camp, the rest were all foreign mages. Fortunately, they were well managed. There were now four mages in the original camp, so they had the ability to take care of everything.

After a brief look, Eli jumped down from the tree and walked into the camp.

“Lord Roland is back!”

Someone saw Eli and shouted loudly. The crowd also looked in his direction.

After living here for a while, they all knew that there was a mysterious battalion commander in this camp. On average, he would only return once every few years, but he was undoubtedly the person in charge of the camp. He also had a channel for magic plants and potions, so he was an indispensable person in the camp.

“Go and find Tijie. Tell her to come to the Mage tower. I want to see her.” He gave an order to someone and went straight to the Tower.

Half an hour later, Eli saw Tijie again.

“Lord Roland.” Tijie lowered her head humbly.

“Well, you’ve managed the camp well during this period of time. You deserve a reward. Eli nodded, then threw out three bottles of potions, and said, ” this is the blood bamboo flower potion. It can greatly increase one’s mental power. I suggest that you use one bottle each time at most.”

“Thank you, my Lord.” Tijie’s eyes brightened as she caught the potion.

“It’s nothing. How’s the preparation for the blood pool?” he asked, shaking his head.

The blood pool was built under Eli’s orders. The blood collected by the camp would be stored inside, and Eli would come back to absorb it once in a while. Otherwise, it would be impossible to reach the limit of 95%. The last time he was here was three years ago.

“My Lord, it’s ready,” Tijie replied.

“I’ll be using it tomorrow. Also, no one is allowed to get within 500 meters of it.”

He only had one purpose for returning this time, and that was to break through to become a second-circle Warlock.

“Alright,” Tijie nodded her head. She already knew that Eli had also trained in the path of a warlock. However, she was very confused about this. After all, a mage’s life would not increase if one did not become an actual warlock. What was the point of simply improving their bloodline power without becoming an actual warlock?

A normal mage could live up to 200 years old, but in this strange world, they could only live up to 130 or 140 years old. That was why all mages tried their best to break through to the higher level to gain longevity, but Elin did not seem to care. He was really a strange wizard.

“Then you can leave first. I’ll go take a look at other places.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After sending off Tijie, Eli came to the laboratory here. As a pure mage’s laboratory, there was only one mission here at the moment, and that was to continue studying the fragments of the devouring spell.

Eli gave them the task of studying the first and second stages of the spell. The later stages were up to Eli himself. After all, this was very important knowledge and he couldn’t just throw it around.

After settling the laboratory’s problem, Eli learned more about the camp’s situation, then returned to his room and waited quietly.

…

The next day.

At the agreed time, she arrived.

“Your Excellency, please.” Tijie led the way.

The blood pool was actually built entirely for the convenience of Eli. It was built on a small hill beside the campsite, in a naturally formed karst cave.

After passing through the tunnel that was covered in layers of spell formations, the two of them entered the mountains.

In front of them was a huge stone door that was seven to eight meters in size. Not only did they use part of their alchemy knowledge, but they also used a large number of materials, which were paid for by the camp.

Since they had been here many times, the two of them directly pushed the door open.

As soon as the door opened, the smell of blood immediately rushed into Eli’s nose. In front of him was a very large stone room, and in the center of the stone room was a huge blood pool.

The radius was about seven to eight meters, and the depth was about the same. There was also a tube on the dome that was flowing with a large amount of blood. The camp had thrown the blood in from other places.

This was Eli’s blood pool, a pool of blood accumulated by an entire camp. It was also the driving force behind Eli’s constant breakthroughs.

“You can go out now. Guard the nearby area.” Eli said to Tijie.

“Yes.” Tijie nodded her head.

After Tijie left, Eli summoned a large number of skeletons again. The Sorcerer model was activated, and a large number of skeletons began to shatter and reform. After that, a giant skeleton that was five meters tall appeared at the gate, and the aura it emitted also exceeded the first circle, but it was not as strong as the second circle.

This was the spell that Eli had created by allying with the mages.

“Guard this place and don’t allow anyone to enter. If anyone tries to break in, kill them,” ordered Eli.

The giant skeleton didn’t answer. It just stood guard at the door.

Eli nodded. Compared to humans, he trusted the undead more. As long as you control them, they would never betray you.

After setting up everything, Eli slowly walked towards the blood pool.

Seeing the blood rush to the top of his head, he resisted the disgust and took off his clothes before jumping in.

Unlike water, the blood here was extremely viscous. He sank straight into it like he was in a swamp.

As he sank, Eli closed his eyes as well. At the same time, The Black ring on his hand was like a black hole, constantly devouring the blood around him. At the same time, Eli’s bloodline power was also constantly strengthening.

A magical change was happening.

Just like that, it was as if Eli had fallen into a deep sleep. Outside the door, the skeleton stood guard without a word. Outside the mountain, a large number of apprentices were patrolling as well. The mission they received was to not let even a single soul into the cave.

…

Half a day later.

Outside the mountain, all the patrolling members suddenly felt a tremor and turned their heads.

“What happened?” Everyone was shocked because they felt as if there was a monster growing in the mountain. The powerful force made them, who were apprentices, tremble.

“Damn it, is there a beast inside?”

Some people suddenly realized that the small animals on the mountain were running down the mountain as if they had seen a ghost. It was as if there was something terrifying.

For a moment, noise and chaos became the theme of this place. Everyone was confused and at a loss, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, a low roar like a Dragon’s Roar sounded.

“A Dragon?”

Everyone was scared stiff.

However, the Dragon’s Roar seemed to only last for a few seconds. After that, the aura that had frightened everyone earlier had long disappeared. However, it seemed that with this fluctuation, the surrounding forest also began to riot.

A small beast tide was brewing, and this was something that no one in the campsite had anticipated. Tijie quickly gathered the people in the campsite and stood on the wall, ready to fight.

Just when everyone thought that the beast tide was about to begin.

Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar came from the mountain not far away.

Everyone was dumbfounded, but when they turned around, they suddenly realized that the beast tide had dispersed.

“What?”

Everyone’s mouth was wide open, followed by loud shouts to celebrate the end of the danger that didn’t really start.
