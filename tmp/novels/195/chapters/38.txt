Chapter 39: Conversation

Translator: Lonelytree

Sitting in the carriage heading to Alina’s family, Eli looked at count Gimori with a bitter expression.

Count Gimori was also a little embarrassed. After all, he had made an agreement with Eli back then. Therefore, he could only apologize.

“It was indeed my fault, but you don’t have to worry. I only told the Marquis because the Marquis asked. I can’t do anything about it.

“Don’t worry. You’ll be safe.” Count Gimori spread his hands.

“Thanks to you saving the Marquis and capturing the Earl, after reporting to the king, the Count’s family was eliminated. I heard that it was related to something even bigger. I don’t know how many people were captured.

“This should be the safest period of time in Junlin city.”

A small bottle of medicine had caused the death of countless people and ruined many people’s plans.

“Don’t worry. In order to protect you, this meeting with the Marquis will be a secret. There will definitely be benefits, so don’t worry.”

Eli nodded and did not say anything else. After all, what had happened had already happened, and it was obvious that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. The only bad thing was that he had been exposed.

However, this also served as a reminder to Eli. In the future, when he had reached a certain level, he must learn some curse-type or mental-type sorcery to ensure that his identity would not be exposed.

Along the way, the count was very talkative, and it was obvious that he was very happy.

After asking, he found out that it was because of the potion that count Gimori had become the Marquis ‘most valued aide. With the Marquis’ strong support, his family’s power had once again expanded.

As for Earl Monchi, he was temporarily silenced.

Count Monchi would never have thought that he would be defeated by count Gimori after all the preparations he had made. What was even sadder was that count Gimori had announced to the public that the Marquis had been cured by two young apothecaries. This made Doctor Robert depressed, and he announced that he would retire.

As for the mystic sect, the students were in tears when they heard that there were many new poison-related courses.

...

The carriage was fast, but it didn’t use the normal path. Instead, it entered the back door.

Eli and the others were guided along the way, and finally, Eli met Marquis Alina in a room.

At this time, Marquis Alina’s condition was much better, but the white hair on his head had increased a lot. Fortunately, he looked very energetic and his eyes were bright.

It was hard to imagine that a month ago, this Marquis had almost died from poisoning.

“Lord Marquis, I’ve brought the person. I’ll take my leave first.”

After dropping Eli off, Gimori turned around and left the room, leaving the two of them some private space.

Eli was not worried either. After all, he was only a few meters away from the Marquis. If something were to happen, this distance was enough for him to kill the Marquis or kidnap the Marquis.

However, the chances of that happening were less than one in a thousand. After all, no one would risk a Marquis for him. He was just an ordinary librarian.

The Marquis looked at Eli with a smile. He probably never would have thought that in just a few seconds, Eli had already thought of how to abduct him and escape.

“ahem, I specifically called count Gimori to get you here for two reasons. One is about the potion I drank, and the other is about your reward.” Said Marquis Alina.

‘ It seemed that the Marquis was very interested in potions.’ Eli thought helplessly.

“I want to ask, do you still remember the person who sold you the potion? Can you describe them to me?” Count Alina looked at Eli with a warm gaze.

‘What kind of logic is that? I just made up that person!’

“Uh, that person, he’s wearing a black robe, his eyes are very bright, he looks very old, and his face is full of wrinkles.” Eli even started to make up a story with a serious face.

“Yes, yes.” The Marquis listened very seriously and kept nodding.

Eli also did not understand why the Marquis would be so interested in a person.

“Lord Marquis, if it’s convenient, may I ask why you are so interested in that person? ” After describing a common face, Eli asked with a puzzled look.

Marquis Alina shook his head and hesitated for a moment before saying, ” I suspect that the potion you bought isn’t simple. It’s a real secret, but since you saved me, I can tell you.

“Do you know when the Empire was established?”

“Of course, the Empire was established three hundred years ago.” Eli nodded. He was naturally very clear about these things.

“Then do you know the name of the first king of the Empire?” Marquis Alina asked again.

“the first king’s name was Merlin the first. His name was...” suddenly, Eli realized that he did not know the king’s name at all, and he did not know anything about the king’s name in his memory. It was not recorded in the books at all.

“You don’t know, do you?” Marquis Alina smiled as if he was happy that he had made things difficult for the scholar, Eli.

Eli nodded. From the Marquis ‘words, he felt that what he was going to hear next might be a huge secret.

“Then do you know?” Eli asked.

“Um.” The Marquis was stunned. He touched his beard and smiled awkwardly. “I don’t know.”

‘Fine, then you’ve been speaking in riddles all day!’

The Marquis might have felt a little awkward, so he continued, ” but I’m sure that this King came from somewhere else, and he’s not simple. He built such a big country in just ten years, and as far as I know, every one of his subordinates is extremely loyal. This is ridiculous.”

Perhaps he had said too much. The marquis picked up a glass of water from the side and took two sips. Eli sat quietly opposite him. He wanted to know what the Marquis was trying to say.

And he had a faint feeling that this might have something to do with him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“After the kingdom was established, the king did not expand further. Instead, he stopped, but he did not develop it. He just kept sending people to various places as if he was searching for something. ”

What was he searching for?

Eli’s eyes moved as he recalled the title page in Saleen Metatrin’s notes. The last sentence on it was as such.

‘I wonder if I’ve found it?’

Furthermore, Saleen Metatrin’s surname was close to Merlin, and combined with the king’s story, it was hard for him not to make the connection.

“Of course, this isn’t the main reason. The reason I’m so interested in that person is that I’ve seen that bottle of the potion of yours before. It was a gift from the king when I was young. At that time, the king was Merlin I, so I’m curious about that person.”

Alina said calmly as if reminiscing about the past.

But what he didn’t know was that a storm had already set off in Eli’s heart. The basic antidote potion was a truly extraordinary potion, and it was impossible to concoct it without using magic. Didn’t this mean Merlin I was a wizard?

Or could it be that Saleen Metatrin was actually Merlin I?

Establishing a country just to find one thing?

Eli felt like he had just discovered something big.

However, there was still a question in Eli’s heart. If Saleen Metatrin was really Merlin I, then where did he come from? Or rather, was there a way to reach the territory of the mages? And how did his kingdom become a kingdom of knights?

These were all questions for Eli.

‘But there’s no rush. We can slowly collect these things.’ Eli shook her head. So what if he knew? he still had to take it slowly.

These were all just his guesses.

“It’s really amazing. I always feel that there should be other powers in the world besides Knights. It might be outside this area, outside the endless sea, outside the surrounding countries.” Marquis Alina shook his head and sighed.

“I’ve seen some magical beasts before, and their strength was even greater than that of a Grand Knight. I was thinking that there might be more powerful ones and that black-robed man might be that kind of person.

“It’s a pity that I won’t be able to see them in my life!”

Marquis Alina let out a long sigh and fell into a state of melancholy. On the other hand, Eli was certain that the Marquis did not know about the existence of Wizards. It seemed that there were no mages in the kingdom at the moment.

“Forget it. Let’s talk about the reward for saving me.”

After a few minutes of dejection, Marquis Alina looked at Eli sternly.

Eli sat up straight as well.

Instead of worrying about the vague and even uncertain information, it was better to care about the reward that the Marquis was going to give him.
