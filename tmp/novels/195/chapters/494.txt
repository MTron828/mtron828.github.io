495 Crushing Nero, Suppressing the Demon Heart King

“Eli, why is it you!”

Nero’s eyes widened as he looked at the humans on the mountain of corpses.

The person in front of him was none other than the person he had been waiting for, Eli.

But wasn’t he fighting outside?

He immediately looked outside. They were indeed still fighting, and the dragon was completely at a disadvantage under the siege of the demons. It was only a matter of time before it lost.

But where did this Eli come from?

Could it be…

Gulp!

Everyone knew that Eli had the ability to clone himself. However, from the beginning to the end of this war, no one had thought about this problem. That was because the combat strength of the person at the front line was already abnormally strong. How could he be a clone?

But what if he was a clone?

Nero’s throat moved, and he suddenly felt that it was difficult to breathe.

“Are you Eli?” He straightened his body and asked solemnly.

“It’s me!” Eli looked at Nero and replied angrily.

At this moment, he was furious!

He had thought that he was strong enough to face anything. However, when he entered the city during the attack and saw the bloody road in the City of Dawn, he felt his humanity awaken.

He only wanted to do one thing now.

“I want to kill you, Nero!” He looked at Nero, and countless shadows spread out in all directions, enveloping the city in a hazy shadow.

His figure also rapidly rose, and his celestial body, which was like a giant, pulled out of the ground. Endless blood essence power turned into a dense fog that enveloped his celestial power, and the two fused.

The Blood Celestial Body appeared again.

That was not all. When the Blood Celestial Body appeared, his life force was also burning. A pitch-black wizard book with chains was taken out.

“What is this?”

At this moment, Nero, who was watching from afar, was stunned.

When the celestial body appeared in front of him, he was already in a daze. He didn’t quite understand, but a terrified voice sounded in his mind.

The voices in his mind were chaotic and complicated, but he accurately grasped a word.

“Mage!”

He pursed his lips and looked at Eli.

Eli was actually a Mage, a Mage who was hated by Warlocks, and the leader of a top bloodline Warlock force in the Western Regions was actually a Mage?

“You’re actually a Mage? Who would have thought that a Mage would be in control of a Bloodline Tower? If this news were to spread, I’m afraid your situation wouldn’t be any better than mine. You’ll be in the same miserable situation!” Nero looked at Eli and suddenly felt a sense of kinship.

The situation of demons and mages in the current world was not much different.

“If I kill you, how will people know?” Eli smiled and activated the Curse Spell in his hand.

In the next second, thousands of years of life suddenly turned into resources. With the help of Nero’s aura that was already prepared, curses began to take effect. Soul Curse, Flesh Curse…

Dozens of curses suddenly took effect.

In the distance, the smile on Nero’s face was also slowly disappearing.

“What exactly is this?”

He lowered his head to take a look. At this moment, his body seemed to be rotting, and a stench spread out. Even his soul felt a twitch as if there were thousands of thorns winding around him. It was extremely painful.

Puff!

After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Nero wiped it off and felt his aura drop by a third.

“He’s crazy. He used at least a thousand years of his lifespan to curse you!” The sharp voice in his mind seemed to remind him of what had happened.

“You’re crazy!” Nero’s mouth twitched as he looked at Eli.

“No!”

Eli shook his head. In the next second, layers of blood-red marks began to stack. He exploded his blood, causing his aura to soar again.

After doing all these preparations, he looked at Nero and waved his hand. “Come on, fight me. How strong are you, trash?”

Damn it!

Hearing this, Nero could no longer hold it in.

He endured the curse in his body with difficulty, and then his bloodline erupted. The huge bloodline avatar slowly appeared. It was the most common Balor bloodline in the heart of the abyss, but at this time, a layer of the black curse was wrapped around his body, like maggots attached to bones!

“Damn it!” Sensing the curse, Nero let out a furious roar.

Then, he charged directly at Eli. The giant red flaming hand attacked, emitting endless light and heat like the sun god.

“Go to hell, Eli.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The flames were like the wind, engulfing the world.

At this moment, Eli was still calm, but his burning life seemed to represent his anger.

“Scum!”

After cursing, the Bloodline Celestial Body suddenly rose and attacked Nero. It was also a huge palm, but it was a shadow palm!

Seeing this, Nero was delighted!

Although he did not understand Mages, he knew that Mages were not good at close combat!

But the next second, his smile stopped abruptly.

The giant palms suddenly collided. The giant flaming palm shattered into countless sparks like glass. It did not even last for a second. Then, he saw the giant shadow palm attack him directly.

“Impossible!”

Nero was furious!

However, in the next second, the huge shadow palm grabbed him directly, and his strength seemed to be completely sealed in this instant, unable to use any more strength.

At this moment, he truly felt the power contained within Eli.

“You must be joking!”

The power he felt was at least 50 times stronger than he expected. At this moment, he even suspected that he was facing a fifth-circle powerhouse!

At this moment, Eli was also walking towards him, and Nero’s throat moved slightly.

“Eli, let me go. This is really not me. I beg you, let me go!” Nero immediately begged for mercy, tears streaming down his face.

At this moment, he finally felt the fear of death.

Especially after experiencing the difference in strength, he realized that he was no match for him.

Eli was simply a monster!

“Beg for mercy?” When Eli was 100 meters away from Nero, his eyes narrowed.

In the next second, the shadow exerted force, and with a shrill cry, Nero’s life force instantly disappeared from this world. Even the remaining flesh and blood were instantly devoured by the shadow!

Eli couldn’t be bothered to say anything to this scum!

The moment Nero died, a blood-red aura suddenly rose.

It was the figure of a succubus, the Demon Heart King or rather Demon Heart Queen. At this moment, she looked at Eli angrily and roared, “Damned human, you have to pay the price for your actions. No, damn it, you damned human…I will return…”

Looking at the Sealed Devil Imprint, Eli was a little disdainful.

It was just a sealed demon. So what if she was a fifth-circle demon? If she could escape the abyss, she would not have planned for so many years. As for crossing the seal at the last minute, it was naturally impossible. The sacrifice did not even succeed.

There were no unexpected mistakes in his story!

“However, it seems that I have to strengthen this Abyss Seal for a few decades. Otherwise, I’ll be a little worried!” Eli pursed his lips and decided to fortify the seal regardless of the cost of his life.

However…

“Is it over just like that?”

Looking at the dead Nero and the sealed demon, Eli still felt that it was unreal!

As the biggest boss in the region, this is too easy.

“That’s not right. I’ve been patient for hundreds of years. I’ve accumulated my strength and done experiments just for this day. It’s reasonable for me to be relaxed!” Eli shook his head. It wasn’t that he didn’t do anything. On the contrary, he had done too much.

But it was not over yet. Eli turned his head and looked outside the city.

At this moment, the four limbs and tail of the huge shadow dragon were grabbed by the demons, and it was tied up in the sky in a large shape. The other five demons in front revealed ferocious smiles as if they were executioners.

Of course, there were also tens of thousands of despairing Warlocks on the ground.

“It’s time to go out and harvest faith.”

Eli smiled and flew out of the city.
