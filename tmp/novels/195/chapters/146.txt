147 500 Years of Lifespan

When Rawls sighed with emotion, some people arrived at the camp.

“Kratos, you’ve gone too far this time.” A one-circle Ultimate Warlock looked at Kratos and said angrily.

He was wearing black clothes and a belt made of snakeskin. He had a long face and black eyes that looked like a man-eating lizard, and he was staring at Kratos.

Kratos nodded but did not make a move.

The newcomer’s name was Mike Jalger. Although he was only a peak first circle Warlock, he was sent here as a representative of the shadow Lizard Wizard Academy. He was also sent here to supervise the camp, so he couldn’t make a move.

“Yes, yes.” Kratos nodded.

Mike’s mouth twitched, and he reached out his hand, even wanting to hit Kratos, but then he retracted it.

He had no choice. As long as he didn’t make a move, he would be fine. If he did, he would probably be killed.

“Heh, Kratos, the Academy has seen what you’ve done. Besides, you fought passively with the foreign Warlock last time and gave a sloppy report. Do you think I didn’t see it?” Mike sneered.

“Don’t think that you’re so great just because your teacher is the Academy’s Dean. He’s already old, and he’ll be replaced next month.” Mikel glanced at him calmly.

He had come here this time to see if he could occupy this place.

“Oh, I still have something to do. You can go first.” Kratos glanced at him calmly, and Mike felt a chill in his heart and turned to leave.

After Mike left, Kratos shook his head.

“I still need time. Fifteen years should be enough.”

As for Mike, as long as he didn’t go too far, he could do anything. But if he went too far, he would let him know what a second circle warlock was.

…

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

Ever since Mike had arrived, the camp had changed quite a bit.

Mike didn’t come alone this time. He brought more than a dozen of his men, including five or six official Wizards.

Mike wanted to take over the camp, and he had done a lot of work for that.

Potion Department.

“How about it? If you follow me, I can give you more benefits. The conditions can be discussed.” Mike looked at Evelina across from him. Every time he looked at her, there was a hint of greed in his eyes.

“I’m sorry, please leave.” Evena frowned.

“Don’t be so heartless. As far as I know, you’ve always been short of money. Here are 50 mid-grade magic stones.” Mike took out a bag, revealing the shiny magic stones inside.

Mid-grade magic stones were much higher than low-grade magic stones in terms of magic content and quality, so the current market ratio was generally 100. The same was true for high-grade magic stones, which were equivalent to 100 mid-grade magic stones. However, there were very few of them, and almost no circulation was made.

Taking out 5000 low-grade magic stones at once, Mike could be said to be quite generous. It was obvious that he wasn’t acting alone, and there was a force supporting him in this.

The camp that Kratos managed was the largest camp of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy, and the annual profit was very high. The Academy wanted to consume it.

“Consider it,” Mike said with a smile. Evena was so fond of gambling that she often borrowed money, so she definitely needed it.

“Get lost!”

But to his surprise, Evena only said calmly. As for the magic stone, she picked it up and threw it out of the window behind her.

“My magic stones!” Mike’s eyes widened, and he immediately went out to pick up the magic stones.

A few minutes later, he looked at the bag that was missing a few mid-grade magic stones. He gritted his teeth and left. It didn’t matter. If he couldn’t convince Evena, there were others.

Next, the magic plant division.

So, Mike went to find Eli first, but after seeing that he hadn’t found him for five days, Mike left with a twitching mouth.

He found Rawls.

“I’m sorry, but I refuse,” Rawls said righteously.

“Although I’m also the Minister of the potions Department in name, in fact, Eli is the one who manages this place. Kratos trusts him more, so there’s no point in you recruiting me.”

“Alright,” Mike sighed. The people in this Department were a little hard to deal with!

“What if you’re the manager?” Suddenly, Mike asked a question.

“I can consider it,” Rawls just said calmly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Okay, I got it.” Mike nodded.

He finally had some gains, but he didn’t plan to do anything about it. He would ask the other departments first.

Soon, Mike’s recruitment seemed to have yielded results.

Slowly, people secretly accepted Mike’s recruitment, and the team was still expanding because everyone knew that behind Mike stood his teacher, the soon-to-be Dean of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.

And three months later.

The remaining departments were the potions Department, the magic plants Department, the mage relic Management Department, and two other departments.

“Cole, I want you to go find Eli. How did the talk go? ”

In a room, Mike asked a first-circle Warlock beside him.

“My Lord, I’ve met him, but he didn’t talk to me at all.” The first circle wizard named Cole said to Mike with a sigh.

“I see!” Mike nodded. The other two departments were almost done as well. At the moment, only Eli and Evena were still hesitating.

It was difficult for them to convince Evena because she had been with Kratos since she was a child, but they didn’t expect that Eli would be like this too, which put them in a difficult position.

“Forget it. I’ll go find him myself.” Shaking his head, Mike prepared to visit Eli personally.

…

The next day.

Mike had been waiting at the door.

As time passed, the door finally opened, and Eli walked out.

He glanced at Mikel and continued walking.

“Warlock Eli, I think we can have a good chat,” Mike asked with a smile.

“There’s nothing much to say. Can you let me continue to manage these two departments in the future? ” Eli was walking on the road.

Mike followed Eli, but when he heard what Eli said, he was stunned. They had quite a number of people too, so how could they give up power to Eli after taking over the camp, and two departments at that?

“I’m sorry, but we can’t do that. But we can give you other benefits, whether it’s bloodline or magic stones. Of course, women are also fine.” Mike probed.

“Trash,” Eli said calmly.

To him, these things were of no use except for magic crystals.

The corners of Mikel’s mouth twitched, and he looked at Eli for a long time without saying anything.

“I’m sorry. Don’t look for me again.” He had already arrived at the Department.

Mike watched as Eli swaggered in. His mouth twitched, and his eyes flashed with a murderous glint.

A first-circle warlock was a little too arrogant.

Even without turning his head, Eli could already sense a thick killing intent.

It wasn’t strong, but it made Eli feel a little dangerous.

He sighed and walked in.

He had just managed to stabilize his condition, but this was the result. He was helpless!

Whether it was the Department of Magic plants or the Department of magic relics, they were all things he needed right now. If he left this place, the speed of his growth and other progress would drop rapidly, and that was something he didn’t want to face.

So, it seemed that he had to think of a way.

…

“Mike went to find Herman, but he rejected him.”

A warlock reported to Kratos in his office.

“Well, I see. I know. You can leave first.” Kratos nodded, and the warlock also walked out.

As the door closed, he walked to the window and sighed.

“My teacher isn’t dead yet, but so many people already can’t wait. I didn’t expect that the people standing on my side would be these few people.

“Evena, Rawls, Herman…”

There were only seven or eight of them, but there were dozens of people in the camp management.

“Forget it. I can make up my mind this way, but not now.” Kratos said seriously. “It looks like I can only get rid of Mike. This guy is a first-circle Warlock. I haven’t seen such an idiot in a long time. He’s just a pawn.”

He immediately walked out of the door.

He had already found out where Mike lived, on a small hill outside the camp. Tonight, he would just kill him.

…

At night.

Kratos left the wizard Tower quietly.

“Darkness deeper than darkness, a strange mist more violent than poison. Today, I, Elie Lucifer, will use five hundred years of my life as the price to curse Mike Jalger. I want him dead.”

On the other side, a curse that used tremendous life force as a sacrifice was in progress. At the cost of five hundred years of life force, Eli began to curse Mike.

From the moment he revealed his killing intent, Mike was someone that Eli had to kill.

Unfortunately, his current level was limited, and 500 years of lifespan was already his limit. Otherwise, he would have to use at least 1000 years of life force to cast a wave of curses.

Eli was also looking forward to seeing how the curse would turn out.

As the curse mark slowly disappeared, Eli’s life force instantly dropped by 500 years. His body instantly began to wither, his hair turned white, and wrinkles began to appear on his skin. He instantly turned into an old man that was about to wither.

However, the white light pillar in his body was still bright, and his life force was slowly being replenished.

Eli’s condition was gradually recovering.

After half an hour, Eli felt a little better.

“Damn, I’ve consumed too much at once. I almost couldn’t make up for it. Fortunately, my current limit is 100 years of life force.” Fear still lingered in Eli’s heart. For a moment just now, he even thought that he was really going to die.

It was a little sloppy.

This was also the first time he had offered 500 years of his lifespan as a price. In the past, he had done weaker curses, but it seemed like he should do them less in the future.

“I’m already in such a sorry state. I wonder how Mike is doing.”

Eli stood up.

Using 500 years of his life to curse a first-circle Warlock.

Eli had no doubt that Mike would die, but how would he die?
