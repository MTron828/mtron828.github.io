257 Silver Moon Lake

In the blink of an eye, another five years had passed.

On this day, as soon as Eli came out of the laboratory, he received a message from Vivika in the distance. “Teacher, there’s a piece of news that you might be interested in!”

“Information?”

“It’s related to the silver Moon Lake!”

Vivika’s message was simple, but Eli was stunned.

According to the past, the silver Moon meeting that was held once every 50 years should be in one or two months. However, it was clear that there would not be a Silver Moon meeting this year!

However, the silver Moon Lake was different.

As a precious resource that nurtured the elemental heart, it was truly like a Lake of treasure to Eli. It could be said that this was the strongest resource Eli had ever seen.

Silver moon lake was not valued in the current world, but Eli could imagine how popular it used to be in the mage world. As for why there were no records of it in the books, it was likely that it was the private property of some force and not open to the public.

He could only obtain it now that the mages had escaped.

The last time he had five elemental hearts, he had been able to advance from a fifth-grade talent to a fourth-grade talent. If he did it again, he might even have the chance to reach a third-grade talent. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What happened? Tell me in detail!” Eli thought for a moment, then sent it to the soul brand.

..

At this moment, in the distant bloodline tower, Vivika received a message from Eli.

“I knew it!” Vivika had come to tell her teacher about this matter because it seemed that her teacher had been particularly concerned about this matter.

“Teacher, the latest news is that the Holy tower seems to have new reinforcements. In order to deal with them, the heart of darkness has also taken out their trump card. It is said that it is the core of an ancient elemental creature. As long as it absorbs enough elements, it can condense an elemental giant that can listen to commands. Its strength far exceeds the limit of the third-circle, but the problem is that there must be a lot of these elements.

“That was why Sergei thought of the elemental turbulence that happened once every fifty years at the silver Moon Lake.

“As long as he absorbs all of them, he should be able to create an elemental giant, and then he can directly destroy the Holy tower and their alliances!”

“Oh? Will this affect the silver Moon Lake a lot?”

Eli was puzzled.

“The silver Moon lake’s structure is very special. It seems to be built on an elemental core. Once the core is taken away, it may even cause the silver Moon Lake to disappear!” Vivika quickly transmitted.

“Destroyed?”

In the distant irises, Eli frowned.

Destroyed?

That was a big deal!

Once the silver Moon Lake was destroyed, it would be troublesome for him to improve his talent.

He couldn’t let Silvermoon Lake be destroyed. Another problem was that once the elemental creature was created, the Holy tower would probably be destroyed.

If the Holy tower were destroyed, even with the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s warning, Sergei would still come for Eli.

“That’s why I have to stop all of this!” Eli thought for a moment.

Whether it was for the improvement of his talent, or to give him time to develop, or for Vivika, Nikola, and the thousands of people who relied on him, he could not stand by and watch this time.

But how did Vivika know about this?

“How did you find out?” Eli asked.

“An internal member of the heart of darkness accidentally revealed it, but this should probably continue as planned. However, since the Holy tower also knows about this, Sergei won’t go in person. Instead, Sergei will probably send his men to take over silver moon lake.”

“Understood!”

Sergei wasn’t going!

Then, Eli relaxed.

As long as Sergei didn’t go, he wouldn’t be afraid.

Of course, unless Sergei sent out a group of late-stage third-circle warlocks, Eli would still have to run, but with the Holy tower’s restraint, it was impossible for so many of them to escape.

Therefore, the probability of safety could be guaranteed.

“Then, teacher, do you need me to send someone?” At this time, Vivika’s news came again.

“No!”

‘No?’

In the Tower, Vivika was a little confused.

Did the teacher really not value this Silver Moon Lake?

Suddenly, another piece of news came, and Vivika sensed it.

“Don’t worry. I’ll make my move!”

Looking at the news, Vivika was stunned.

Sergei would send a lot of powerful warlocks to secure the lake. Would her master be able to handle that?

“But teacher should be fine, right?”

Vivika decided not to think about it anymore. Who knew how many more trump cards her teacher had hidden?

..

The blazing sun was like fire.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

There was only a month left until the silver Moon Lake riot.

...

A week ago, Sergei had started to gather people to go to the silver Moon Lake. It was said that not only the heart of darkness but the forces under him had also sent people.

And because the news had been leaked in advance, he did not hide their actions!

The Holy tower’s side also responded positively and immediately sent people to stop them.

A few of the third circle late-stage Warriors went forward, but everyone was paying attention to this battle.

In their opinion, the Holy Tower would still lose.

The heart of darkness had a strong foundation, to begin with, and after so many years of development, its overall strength had already surpassed the Holy tower. This was not only reflected in the combat power of the upper echelons but also in the lower echelons!

A total of 1000 first-circle warlocks, 500 second-circle warlocks, and more than 50 third-circle warlocks were going to this operation. For the sake of the elemental giant’s success, Sergei had sent almost all the resources he could mobilize.

Although the Holy tower wanted to stop them, they did not have enough manpower.

Their number of people was almost half.

However, the Holy tower was closer to the silver Moon Lake, which allowed them to arrive earlier. Thus, a line of defense had been formed at the bank of the silver Moon Lake.

Everyone was waiting for the arrival of the heart of the darkness’s team.

...

Everyone’s heart was filled with apprehension.

This was a fight that would determine the direction of development for the next few decades.

If the Holy tower successfully defended Silvermoon Lake, then the Holy tower’s lifespan could be extended by a few decades, but if they lost, then it would be the heart of night’s crushing victory. The outcome would not be unexpected unless there were even bigger changes.

Time passed by slowly!

The sound of the silver Moon lake riot was getting closer and closer. Just three days before the riot, the heart of darkness’s people finally arrived. At the same time, Eli also received the news.

In the irises’ campsite.

Eli walked out of the laboratory and headed out of the camp.

He met Grimm on the way!

“Where are you going, my Lord?” Grimm was puzzled.

“I’m going to fish!” Eli cast a glance at him and said calmly.

The next second.

Eli’s figure flew into the sky, and a blood-red light appeared.

Like an arc of light, he set off towards the silver Moon Lake in the distance.

At the same time, Eli sent a message to Vivika.

He needed her help with something!

“Fishing?”

Grimm blinked his eyes in confusion.

Fishing for what?
