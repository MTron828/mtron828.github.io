425 End

Boom!

Endless shadows rippled in the air like seawater, covering the sky and causing the entire land to be dark.

All of a sudden, invisible ripples spread out, and shadows gradually entered the void. The sun shone down from the sky, shining on Eli’s body. It reflected in the eyes of tens of thousands of people on the battlefield, shining brightly.

On the ground, countless Warlocks raised their heads and looked at this shocking scene. Time seemed to last forever at this moment!

!!

“He’s simply like a god!”

” That was the Eight-Armed Naga’s patriarch, Jess, one of the strongest experts in the northern part of the Western Region. He died just like that! ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The war is over!”

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower on the ground murmured as they stared at the two Elis in the sky!

There was no doubt that their emotions were complicated at this moment. From the initial despair to the hope that arose from the arrival of Eli to the despair of Eli’s death, and then to the ecstasy of Eli’s doppelganger and the other two doppelgangers, and finally to the shock of the death of the three Radiant Suns of the Eight-Armed Naga family!

But no matter what, their respect for Eli had reached its peak!

What was that saying again

“Sir Eli has saved the Bloodline Tower once again! ” Nikola’s body trembled as he spat out a few words.

This time, his master won again, and it was still a crushing victory.

CloneWho would have thought that his master actually had a clone technique, and even he didn’t know about it?

” And I actually doubted you before the battle! ” Nikola secretly gave himself a big slap on his heart. Then, he flew to the opponent’s Warlock and gave his opponent a big slap in reality!

The previously powerful Warlock was still in a daze as if he had yet to recover from his shock. It was only when he was slapped that he was forced back to reality.

He subconsciously wanted to make a move, but he instantly retracted his hand. He only gave Nikola a gnashing expression to show his anger.

He had no choice. He did not dare to make a move now.

Seeing that the Warlock didn’t dare to fight back, Nikola was speechless.

The Warlock covered his face and glared at him.” Nikola, don’t go too far! ”

“Hey, what’s wrong with me going overboard?” Nikola looked over in disdain. His master was still here. What do you dare to do?

Looking at Nikola’s expression, the Warlock was furious and said, “I just … I just … I will curse you!”

Ha!

The corner of Nikola’s mouth twitched. What an iron-willed warlock!

Ignoring the Warlock, he turned his head to look. He wanted to see the reactions of the other Eight-Armed Naga Warlocks!

The Celestial Warlocks were flying in the sky like wooden chickens.

Their eyes were fixed on the dead Radiant Sun and Eli in the sky. No one knew what they were thinking. It was obvious that what had happened today was the first time in their long lives.

Clone? Who would have thought that a Warlock could create a clone? Moreover, he used his clone to fight. What was even more ridiculous was that he had won!

None of the celestials had any thoughts of escaping because they knew that with Eli around, they couldn’t run, and they couldn’t run anywhere.

Compared to the composed celestials, the low-level warlocks reacted much more.

Their blood-stained faces were filled with confusion and despair. They stood where they were and accepted the punishment from the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower. Some of them couldn’t accept it and chose to commit suicide. After all, the death of the radiant suns meant that the Eight-Armed Naga family would disappear from this land in the future!

This was still a good thing. There were also some who went crazy and couldn’t accept it, and then attacked the surrounding Warlocks and were directly killed!

Looking at the shocking scene, Nikola sighed. Although he was proud, he knew why he was so proud.

Yes, sir!

If it weren’t for Sir Eli, he wouldn’t be any better than the Warlock in front of him today, and the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower would definitely not be in a better situation than the Warlock on the other side!

” Everything is the same, but we won this time. No, Sir Eli won! ” Nikola sighed. He seemed to have gradually understood why Sir Eli was always so cautious!

The road of life was too long. If he lost once, it would all be gone. However, if danger came, he would avoid it or even endure it until the danger could be resolved before coming out. There would be no problem!

This was the wisdom of a real master!

At this moment, the two Elis who had finished their battle also flew down to the ground. Nikola immediately stepped forward, and the other Warlocks also quickly stepped forward.

“My lord!” Many Warlocks looked at Eli respectfully.

“I’ve dealt with Jesse and his people. I’ll leave the rest to you.” Eli said to these people.

“Yes, sir!” Nikola was the first to nod, but he reminded, “Sir, there are also some enemy Warlocks remaining! They work for the Nagas but only as subordinates.”

At this moment, the expressions of the Warlocks on the Eight-Armed Naga’s side changed, and cold sweat poured down like rain.

Eli turned to look at the Warlocks and said with a smile, “You are all Warlocks affiliated with the Eight-Armed Naga family. In theory, I need to get rid of you, but I still need some manpower to occupy the territory of the Eight-Armed Naga. So …”

Upon hearing Eli’s words, the celestials were stunned for a moment before they revealed looks of ecstasy. The Warlock that Nikola was fighting walked out and said respectfully, “Sir Eli, your strength has completely conquered me. I wish to represent the Hamil family, a rank 3 force, to join the Bloodline Tower! ”

The Warlock expressed his sincerity.

Seeing his performance, the remaining nine Warlocks also expressed their willingness to join the Bloodline Tower.

Eli smiled.

Eli wouldn’t let go of the Eight-Armed Naga’s territory, but the Bloodline Tower’s current manpower was definitely not enough. The forces that were attached to the Eight-armed Naga were a good choice. Of course, in order to avoid any problems with these people, Eli continued with a smile, “Everyone, hand over a bit of your Origin Bloodline.”

Upon hearing El’s words, the few celestials were instantly shocked!

As the name suggested, the Origin Bloodline was something very essential. It was something similar to the blood essence of a Warlock after they advanced to the celestial realm. It could provide power to the bloodline, but once it was obtained by someone, it could be used to cause great harm to the owner of the blood. At the very least, the bloodline power would decline, and the owner would die!

Therefore, handing over the origin of the bloodline was equivalent to handing over their weaknesses!

Everyone looked at each other. No one spoke for a while. Eli also looked at these people calmly and did not speak.

However, he would not force these people to make a choice. If they did not agree, he would only kill them kindly!

...

As if sensing Eli’s friendly expression, the Warlocks ‘mouths twitched, and they all agreed willingly!

Very soon, Eli received their Origin Bloodlines and stored them away.

After briefly explaining to Nikola, Eli turned into two golden lights and left!
