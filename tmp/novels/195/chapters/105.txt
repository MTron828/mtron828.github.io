106 Bloodline Knight

“Anna, what’s the current situation?”

In a room, Eli sat at the main seat while Anna sat opposite him in a dignified manner, her legs crossed, listening carefully to what Eli was saying.

“Teacher, the situation has not been good recently. The Vis Kingdom is much stronger than we thought. Bryne has been weak for too long. We are not as strong as them in terms of Knights, and they have more Grand Knights than us.” Anna said bitterly, somewhat unwilling.

If it had not been for her stupid father, the Empire would not have been so weak.

It could only be said that her grandfather’s judgment in choosing people was really bad.

“Teacher, you’ve come to ask this question. Do you have any ideas?” Anna asked expectantly. To be honest, she had always thought that Eli was omnipotent.

“of course, I’m here to help you this time,” Eli said with a smile. For his experiment, what he was about to do was indeed to help Bryne.

“I have an experiment here that might be of help to you, but I need your cooperation,” Eli said.

“Teacher, just say it. Anything is fine.” Anna had been under a lot of pressure these days, and she was eager to get help.

“Alright, I need some Knights, even Grand Knights,” Eli said without any trace of politeness.

“Sure,” Anna said without hesitation.

Following that, Eli gave a simple explanation. Anna nodded and began to call out.

Soon, a Knight was summoned.

“Andre, you are an advanced Knight and one of the people I trust the most. I have an experiment here that might be of help to the Empire. Are you willing to participate? ” At this time, Anna was already sitting in the main seat, and ere stood up. After all, Anna was the ruler of the Empire on the surface.

“Everything for the Queen, everything for the Empire.” The Knight knelt down on one knee and offered his loyalty.

“Then I’ll leave it to you, teacher.” Anna turned her head and said to Eli.

Eli smiled.

“Leave the rest to me.”

…

Year 361, December of the bryne calendar.

Following Bryne’s defeat, the vis Kingdom made their move again.

They quickly sent out a large number of troops, leading a large number of Knights, and headed toward the Bryne Empire. Their intention was clear. They wanted to tear a piece out of Bryne.

The battle started at once.

When the news reached Junlin, the nobles were also terrified.

Everyone was filled with uneasiness.

…

At the same time.

In a martial arts field in the palace.

Andre panted heavily and looked down at his body.

He was now two meters tall, and his eyes had turned into strange vertical pupils. The muscles on his body were bulging, and he could feel that his perception and strength were far beyond what they had been before.

“Your Majesty.” He took a deep breath and looked at the Queen, who was not far away, but when he looked at Eli beside him, he had a look of fear.

He didn’t know what had happened to his body. How did he become like this? he was drugged by Eli and was like this after he woke up.

At first, he was terrified, but when he thought of the Queen’s order, he gradually calmed down.

“Teacher, is this your experiment?” Anna’s throat moved slightly as she asked.

“That’s right. I’ve been studying bloodlines recently. I’ve integrated the bloodline of the explosive Lion into his body. It seems that the effect is not bad, but there are some flaws. I may need to slowly make up for them later.” Said Eli as he pursed his lips.

He had completely treated Bryne as his testing ground, using the resources of a Knight’s Kingdom to support his growth.

“Let’s test our strength,” said Eli directly.

“Alright!” Anna nodded and waved her hand, and a man appeared on the other side of the stage.

“Greyson, a Grand Knight, is my personal guard.” Anna introduced.

On the martial arts stage, Greyson was also looking at the man opposite him in shock.

“Are you Andre?” Greyson knew Andre and was also shocked. What happened? How did Andre become like this? was this the power of the devil?

“Greyson, do you want to test Andrew’s strength?” Anna shouted, not far away.

Hearing the Queen’s order, Greyson nodded and became serious. The vitality force in his body shook, and a steady stream of power emerged in his body.

In an instant.

He made his move.

He took half a step back with his right leg and bent it slightly. Then, he stepped on the ground, and a small pit appeared in the ground. His body quickly approached Andre.

Seeing that Greyson had made his move, Andre also let out an angry roar and rushed toward him.

Bang!

Like two cannonballs colliding, the two of them instantly collided.

The sound of bones rubbing against each other rang out. The dust dispersed, and the two figures were facing each other. From the looks of it, they seemed to be evenly matched.

Anna was extremely shocked.

Andre was only an advanced Knight, and he was a far cry from a Grand Knight. But now, he was actually able to fight with Greyson. It was simply unbelievable.

Grayson’s eyes widened.

He felt the power coming from Andre’s hand. It wasn’t any weaker than his. How was this possible?

Originally, he could easily take down five Andres, but Andre was now fighting toe-to-toe with him. It was simply incredible. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He instantly pulled back and changed directions to attack from the other side. Andre didn’t give in either. Just like that, the two of them started to attack each other.

The battle was evenly matched.

Greyson was also fighting seriously, but he suddenly realized that as the battle began, Andre’s eyes seemed to become redder and redder, and his strength seemed to have become stronger.

Roar!

With a roar that sounded like a beast’s roar, Andre attacked Grayson like a primitive beast. He looked like he had completely lost his mind, and a few wounds instantly appeared on Grayson’s body, from which blood flowed.

Sensing the smell of blood, Andre seemed to have gone even crazier. He launched a desperate attack. Greyson frantically tried to block it, but even he couldn’t stop such a desperate attack.

Anna was also shocked when she saw this.

She immediately waved his hand, and a few more Grand Knights rushed in. They were also surprised to see the crazy Andre.

“Control him,” Anna ordered.

A few Grand Knights attacked at the same time, but it took them five minutes to control the crazy Andre and tie him to the ground.

Andre, who was under control, slowly regained his calm and passed out.

“Teacher, what is this?” Anna turned her head and asked.

“It’s called an experiment because it’s not yet perfect,” Eli replied calmly.

At this moment, Greyson also walked over and knelt down in front of Anna.

“Greyson, what do you think of Andre’s current strength?” Anna didn’t ask Eli anymore but asked Greyson instead.

“Your Majesty, Andre’s current combat power is already comparable to a newly promoted Grand Knight who doesn’t use elements. If he goes berserk as he did just now, even a Grand Knight who has been promoted for a few years would have to avoid him.” Greyson replied with a lingering fear.

“Yes.” Anna nodded, but she was still hesitant.

A few days ago, her teacher had suddenly come to offer her help, and today she was shown an experiment. The experimental target was indeed very strong, but it had other flaws, which made her a little uncertain.

However, she only hesitated for a moment before turning to face Eli.

“Teacher, I will give you more Knights, even Grand Knights.”

Eli nodded and smiled.

Bryne was so weak now, so as long as Anna did not want to lose, she would have to agree. Although he could force her to agree, Eli still preferred to convince people with reason.

“Yes, thank you for your help, teacher.” Anna nodded.

Eli would get more from the experiments, but Anna still had to thank him respectfully.
