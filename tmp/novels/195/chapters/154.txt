155 Endless Devouring

“Damn it, is this virus not finished yet?”

Some people were happy, while others were sad.

In the Blood Alliance, a second-circle warlock angrily smashed his cup on the ground.

“Who can tell me how long it’ll take to resolve this virus?” At this time, they were also having a seminar. At this time, in addition to him, there was a large number of warlocks from the blood Alliance.

“My Lord, it might take a long time.” One of the warlocks said tactfully.

“How long?”

“Five years,”

“Five years?” The second-circle Sorcerer’s mouth twitched, and he was about to get angry.

“Sir, you really can’t blame us for this. Not only is this virus evolving at any time, but what’s worse is that no one in our organization has ever studied this thing before. We’re even collecting resources now.” The Warlock felt wronged.

“Then why didn’t you study it before? ”

“My Lord, everyone studies bloodlines and the power of bloodlines. Who would study this for no reason? ” The Warlock replied.

Second circle warlock, “…”

For a moment, he fell into silence. The entire room fell into silence. That’s right, who would study this kind of thing for no reason? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

…

“What the f * ck? How did this virus evolve into a first-circle version? ” When Eli received the news, he was also stunned.

His virus had always only affected the zero circle, but he did not expect it to evolve into a first-circle version on its own. Fortunately, the basic sequence had not changed, and the potion was still useful. Otherwise, it would be difficult not only for the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy and the blood Alliance but also for the White Tower.

One could only say that nature was too great.

“Sigh, it’s just a coincidence.” Eli sighed. He would definitely be able to develop a first-circle virus if he was given time, but three months was already his limit.

However, this had nothing to do with him. He was still in the mage camp and would think about it after the war was over.

With that in mind, Eli walked out of the tower and into the camp.

Compared to seven years ago, there were many more mages here, and many of them came because of their reputation. Relying on the large magic herb field in the secret plane, not only did Eli get a lot of things from the camp, but the camp also relied on his resources to develop.

It could be said that Eli’s arrival had brought New Hope to this place.

That was why Eli’s reputation here was very high.

“Good Morning, Mr. Roland.”

“Good Morning, my Lord.”

Along the way, people greeted him from time to time, and he responded politely.

Soon, he arrived at another part of the camp.

This was the place in the camp that was especially responsible for researching fragments of the devouring power. The last time Eli was here, the progress had already reached 99%, and they were only one step away from success.

“My Lord, the last fragment has been analyzed.” In a room, Eli looked at the 18 complete models and smiled.

The devouring power that he had been researching for hundreds of years was finally going to produce some preliminary results.

Eli took a look at the models. The eighteen models were incomparably exquisite, and they looked like they were eighteen independent segments, but only Eli knew how to connect them.

“Everyone has worked hard. Everyone will get 50 magic stones per person.” Eli was happy too.

“Lord Roland, this is what we should do.” Hearing that there was a reward, the apprentice showed a happy expression.

This period of time was the happiest time for them. Not only were they rewarded with dozens of magic stones every month, but they could also occasionally receive guidance from Lord Roland. Everyone was improving rapidly.

Later on, some people even wanted to join for free, but it was too late.

“Well, thank you for helping me with my work. I’ll take my leave first.”

When he got the models, Eli was very anxious and wanted to test them immediately.

Back in the tower, Eli entered the arcane realm.

He passed by a large magic plants field. At this time, dozens of people were working day and night. In addition to these, there was also the blood bamboo flower Forest that had already taken shape. Unfortunately, it had not evolved to the second ring. The improvement of the magic plants was still good, but it was not as good as before.

Of course, there was also that sapling.

It was about three meters tall and had brown tree trunks and dark green leaves. It looked very ordinary, but its aura was already at its limit, exuding a unique aura.

This plant was quite good for Eli because it could gather elements, which made Eli’s elemental conversion process much faster than he had imagined.

Of course, today’s focus had nothing to do with this. Holding the models, Eli quickly came to the laboratory and began to copy the models.

A total of 18 models seemed like a lot, but when all the models were out, it was easy to imprint them. The difficult part was how to connect them.

As for how to connect them, from his previous observations, Eli had already discovered that there was a magical structure between the models. This was also why he was so bold as to ask his subordinates for help.

Soon, as the models were gradually connected, a trace of magical fluctuation was slowly produced, and the air began to ripple.

Seeing this familiar fluctuation, a smile appeared on Elie’s face. This was the fluctuation that he had observed countless times. After experiencing countless failures, he finally succeeded.

“However, this requires a carrier.” Eli’s mental power withdrew, and the model collapsed instantly. He still needed a bit more time to flesh everything out.

…

A year later.

Eli walked out of the laboratory, and a black ring appeared on his shoulder. The ring looked very dark in color and absorbed all light.

This was the result of his hard work for a year.

Endless devouring of the first circle seal.

As for its effects, it was similar to the blood bamboo flower. It also absorbed blood to create power, but unlike the blood bamboo flower that could convert blood into mental power, the ring could only convert bloodlines to increase the bloodline compatibility of a warlock.

Eli was also helpless. This devouring power was much more complicated than he had thought, and there was still a lot of research to be done.

As he walked out of the secret realm, Eli immediately called for Tijie.

“Lord Roland, what do you need us to do? ” Tijie asked.

“I need the blood of magical beasts. Go and collect some for me.”

“Oh?” Tijie nodded her head doubtfully. “do you need to do an experiment with the blood of a magical beast?”

The blood of magical beasts was used for many experiments. There were a lot of them at the campsite. Half an hour later, Tijie brought a huge Bucket of Blood.

“Sir, this is the blood of a zero circle demonic bear. It was just captured yesterday.” Tijie replied.

Eli nodded. Then, under Tijie’s surprised gaze, he reached his hand into the box.

What surprised Tijie was that as Eli’s hand entered the bucket, the black ring on his arm began to emit a mysterious power. Then, the power in the blood disappeared rapidly. What was even more ridiculous was that Eli’s aura seemed to have become stronger.

“Not bad.” Elie nodded, feeling the power of the bloodline in his body improve slightly. Although it was not much, one had to consider that this was only a zero-circle demonic bear, and there was only a small Bucket of Blood.

It could be said that as long as he had a large amount of blood, he could even be directly promoted to the level of a first-circle Ultimate Warlock.

This was the power of a mage. Sometimes, a breakthrough in knowledge could lead to a rapid increase in power. This was also one of the reasons why mages were powerful.

Power was just a gift as one pursued the truth.

However, Eli had to be careful not to let this secret be known by the warlocks, or else they would do anything to get the ring.

After all, it was always a Warlock’s goal to quickly improve their bloodline power.

“Tijie, I’ll give you a new mission now. Collect more blood. I need more blood. I will give you all the magic stones you need.”

Now that he had the ring, the next step was naturally clear. He had to rely on the camp to collect blood and then quickly level up until the end of the war.

“Yes.” Tijie nodded and left.

Very quickly, the news of the blood collection in the camp spread. With generous rewards, a large number of apprentices set out toward the forest to bring back the blood of magical beasts for Eli.

Eli’s bloodline compatibility was rapidly increasing.

On the other hand, with the large number of resources that Eli had contributed, several new first-circle Wizards had appeared in the camp. They had also joined in, and the blood of the first circle magical beasts they brought back had further accelerated Eli’s progress.

Four years had passed in the blink of an eye.

With the help of the camp, the strength of Eli’s bloodline compatibility had already reached 75%.

At this time, the situation outside had also changed greatly. At this time, the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy had almost been swallowed up by the White Tower. The enemy of the blood Alliance had become the White Tower.

White Tower, with the help of Eli’s virus, was gradually suppressing the Blood Alliance.

However, the Blood Alliance already had experience in defending against viruses, and they were always able to take measures to prevent the spread of small areas, which made the White Tower’s attack less fierce than before.

Everyone was waiting for a decisive battle that could change everything.

Whether it was the blood Alliance or the White Tower, they were all actively preparing.

If the White Tower won, then there would be a new force in the world. If the blood Alliance won, then they would take over the shadow lizard and the White Tower’s inheritance and become an even larger force.

Thus, everyone was looking for ways to increase their chances of victory.
