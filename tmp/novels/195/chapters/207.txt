208 Wind Travel Stone

“A Mermaid statue!”

A few kilometers away, beneath the surface of the ocean, Eli held the statue in his hand, a curious look in his eyes.

It was an ancient statue of a very strong male Merman. Shells covered his private parts, and his eyes were sapphires. He held a Trident in his right hand.

When the murloc priest was not paying attention, he sneaked into the battlefield, stole the statue, and left without a sound.

!!

The reason why he stole the statue was mainly that he was interested.

As a mage, Eli actually had a certain understanding of this thing. It should be considered a kind of religious object of the Marine race.

The history of the sea tribe was actually longer than that of the human race. This led to a certain difference in their knowledge compared to that of the human race.

On one hand, they relied on the power of nature to strengthen themselves, and on the other hand, they were connected by clan and bloodline. This gave birth to another interesting power in the process.

That was the power of faith.

Powerful creatures would seal their own power into the statue, and then their subordinates would worship it. After a long period of worship, the power of faith would be produced.

Not only could this be used to give feedback to one’s disciples, but one could also use the power of faith through objects of worship to exert influence. It could be considered one of the interesting development paths. There were even legends that said that sea creatures relied on the power of faith to become celestial.

Of course, the statue in front of him was far inferior. Due to the use of the power of faith just now, the power of faith was almost exhausted. Otherwise, the statue would not be covered with cracks and almost collapsed.

Eli was only interested in the power of faith and had no other intentions. He wanted to see if he could unearth this knowledge based on the statue.

It was probably quite difficult, but it didn’t matter to Eli. At most, he would fail. It wasn’t a big deal, there was always some knowledge that he couldn’t grasp.

The creation of statues of faith required strength. One had to be at least at the third circle to be able to make them. It seemed that this murloc tribe was not simple. They should have a big power behind them.

The complexity of the ocean tribe was no less than that of the land tribe.

Fortunately, Eli wasn’t a sea creature so it had nothing to do with him.

Thus, he kept the sculpture and prepared to leave.

However, just as his body was moving toward the surface of the sea, a green light quickly flew toward him from not far away. A familiar figure was wrapped in it.

“Devil killer whale?”

Eli looked at the figure and blinked.

Just now, after the figurine was used, Eli stole it and left. He didn’t see the battle after that. Now it seemed that Hu Wei was defeated and ran away. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have lost his tail fin.

“Get lost!”

On the other side, Hu Wei, who was wrapped in the green light, saw that there was an obstacle in front of him and shouted.

A wave rolled over and then slammed Eli to the side.

Struck in the face by the waves, Eli was also dumbfounded. Then, he looked at Hu Wei’s departing figure and narrowed his eyes.

What the f * ck!

He minded his own business when he was smacked. Eli had to take revenge. Plus, Hu Wei was holding an extraordinary green stone. It seemed to be fated with him.

As he thought about it, he immediately chased after Hu Wei.

The fleeing Hu Wei looked at Eli behind him.

He was seriously injured and needed to get to a safe place to heal immediately. He had no time to fight. Moreover, the green stone had a special power and was extremely fast. Even a third circle Merman couldn’t catch up to it, let alone a human.

Eli looked at the green light that was getting further and further away and took a deep breath.

In the next second, Eli used the burning blood technique, and his life force was rapidly consumed. Eli’s speed instantly increased by several times, and a blood-colored trail appeared behind him.

As his life force was being consumed, his speed became faster and faster. Soon, his speed surpassed that of Hu Wei and he was getting closer and closer.

“What the?!”

On the other side, Hu Wei looked at the rapidly approaching Eli and opened his mouth wide.

“I only hit you once, and you sacrificed your life force to chase after me. And from the looks of it, you don’t care about the consequences at all.” For a moment, he was a little confused.

However, he really didn’t have the mood to stop, so he continued to run. The remaining power surged into the green stone again, and then his speed increased again.

However, what left Hu Wei dumbfounded was that the blood-red trail behind Eli was getting bigger and bigger. Even from a few hundred meters away, he could feel the rapid depletion of Eli’s life force. Eli was draining ten years of his life every second.

“Is he mad?” The corner of Hu Wei’s mouth twitched.

He wanted to go faster, but he realized that the green stone had already reached its limit. He could only helplessly watch as Eli got closer and closer.

Two minutes later, he looked at Eli, who was right in front of him and exuded the aura of a peak second-ring mage. The corner of his mouth twitched.

“My Lord, how are you?” Hu Wei no longer had the arrogance it had earlier.

He understood that it was impossible for him to defeat a two-circle mage at his injured. However, he couldn’t understand why Eli consume so much life force just to chase after him.

Am I worthy?

Hu Wei really wanted to ask this question.

However, he was greeted with a barrage of spells. For a moment, the waves rolled and the remote sea was dyed red. A few minutes later, Hu Wei rolled over.

After confirming that Hu Wei was dead, Eli quickly collected the items.

However, to his disappointment, other than some pearls that contained energy, there was also a tooth token and the green stone.

Pearls should be the sea tribe’s currency for trade, and Eli had no use for them. The token should be the identity token of Hu Wei. Eli was most interested in the green stone. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“This is a wind travel stone!” Eli quickly recognized the green stone.

This was a type of stone that could only be produced when the wind elements were highly condensed. Just now, Hu Wei had used the wind elements within to move so quickly.

However, Hu Wei used the stone too crudely and it was wasted.

“I’m still lacking a moving tool, and this is just perfect.” A smile appeared on his face.

...

The wind travel stone was a precious material. It could be considered a resource in the third circle. He was lucky that Hu Wei came to deliver this to him.

Neither side won this battle. Eli was the biggest winner.

The murloc tribe lost their underwater magic Herb Farm and statue, and a large number of their clansmen died. The devil killer whale clan’s plan fell through, and their leader, Hu Wei, also died.

After putting away the wind travel stone, Eli looked in the direction and moved towards the shore.

This incident should end there. He had gathered all the ingredients so he should get down to business, advancing to a third-circle mage.
