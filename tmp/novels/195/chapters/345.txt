346 On the Road

The huge airships entered the uninhabited soya mountain range.

At the forefront of the airship, on a grandstand that extended out, Eli looked down from above, observing the Sofia mountain range below.

The Sofia mountain range separated the West Coast from the central continent. There were many natural resources and powerful creatures in the area. Even the third-circle warlocks didn’t dare to venture too deep.

However, Eli was very interested in this place because there was a lot of good stuff there. Of course, this place was very close to the West Coast, and the bloodline tower had also explored it, so Eli was not interested.

!!

Therefore, he stayed in his room for the first period of time.

As for safety, there was no need to worry too much. This was a large-scale flying mage tool specially made by Eli. Thanks to thousands of years of accumulation, his mechanical construction was completely different from before. Just these airships alone, creatures below the third circle would almost be unable to cause any damage to them.

Of course, they didn’t need to worry about the fourth-circle creatures. After all, they were at the edge of the mountains.

They gradually entered the depths of the mountain range, an area where few people tread.

Some trouble also came.

…

One night.

Eli and the others were resting in the airship when they suddenly felt the airship shake. Then, they heard a terrifying roar.

The loud roar instantly woke everyone up. The warlocks got up and went to the windows, looking out.

On the ground in front of the airship.

A hundred-meter-tall giant was roaring at them.

This giant was covered in long fur and had a body as huge as an ape. There was only one huge vertical eye on its huge head, which was filled with bloodthirst and curiosity. Below it was a huge mouth.

It was standing on a mountain, holding a stone with a radius of a few meters in its right hand, and it was throwing it at them.

The rock streaked through the air like a meteor. Many people screamed, but wind elementals appeared around the airship, deflecting the rock.

There was no doubt that the trembling just now was because of this giant.

In a cabin.

Alida’s eyes widened at the scene.

“a fourth circle Cyclops. I heard that this creature often hunts passing creatures. Are we being targeted? ” Alida recognized this creature.

The Cyclops was a kind of Giants. They had no consciousness, but they were extremely powerful. They were the creatures that people who passed by were most unwilling to encounter.

Generally speaking, they would pass through quickly if they encountered such creatures. Even an ordinary fourth circle would not be willing to face them.

“So, how will Eli deal with this?” She was also very curious.

Suddenly, the door of a room not far away opened, and Eli was pleasantly surprised.

He quickly came to the front of the airship and looked at the ground.

“It’s a fourth circle Cyclops. I heard that the eye of a Cyclops has a unique function. How lucky!”

Alida’s mouth twitched as she looked at the surprised Eli.

This was a celestial. Even warlocks of the same rank would be afraid of him.

But judging from what this Eli was saying, it seemed like he wanted the eyeballs.

Alida watched Eli make the decision to stop the airship.

Then, Eli flew out of the airship.

At this moment, Alida saw Nikola also fly out.

“It seems like they are sending two people.” Alida heaved a sigh of relief.

Two celestials would be fine, but she still felt that it was inappropriate. The battle with the one-eyed giant would not end in a short time, and it might attract other enemies, which could put the airship in danger.

She didn’t understand what Eli was thinking.

But when she saw Eli flying down alone, she was stunned.

Is Eli going down alone?

Didn’t he just advance not long ago? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

…

Eli looked at the one-eyed giant below him with a look of pleasant surprise.

After being out for so long, he had finally encountered something interesting.

The Cyclops was a creature that did not exist on the West Coast.

Although it was a creature with a strong physical body, it was said that its eyes had unique spiritual power fluctuations, which was very rare. One had to know that Eli also had a mental power earring that had not been upgraded in a long time.

Watching Eli land quickly, the one-eyed giant revealed a cruel smile. He pulled up a hundred-meter-tall tree beside him, cut off its branches, and pointed it at Eli.

Although his opponent was not a sea tribe, Eli was not afraid at all in the face of a fourth-circle Cyclops.

Eli stopped in mid-air, and the biting cold wind caused his robe to flutter. This robe, which was made from a giant deep-sea octopus, emitted light. The spiral staff in his right hand flickered with time sand, and countless elements surged around it.

“Rising Hurricane!” Eli looked at the one-eyed giant on the ground.

The next second, the Cyclops revealed a look of horror. A hurricane rose from the earth, and his hundred-meter-long body was sent flying into the sky. He couldn’t even resist.

The people on the airship also watched this scene with their mouths wide open.

This was not a small animal but a hundred-meter-tall Cyclops. Its weight was comparable to a mountain, and it flew up just like that.

Even the one-eyed giant would never have thought that they would one day fly.

But all of this had nothing to do with Eli. He was only looking at the eyeball with greed.

...

In the next second, Eli waved his staff again.

“Tornado slash!”

Countless earth and wind elements gathered again, and in the air, dozens of tornadoes that were dozens of meters long turned into thin ropes that were a few meters thick, twisting and flying toward the one-eyed giant.

The one-eyed giant’s eyes were wide open, but he couldn’t move at all due to the control of the rising Hurricane.

He could only watch helplessly as the ‘wind rope’ approached him.

Rip!

Blood splattered everywhere. The one-eyed giant’s grayish-white skin was bleeding as if it was bound by a fishing net. The one-eyed giant howled in pain, but he only managed to hold on for a few seconds. In the next moment, the one-eyed giant was completely cut up. His body, which was hundreds of meters long, was instantly turned into countless pieces of meat. The only thing that remained was a huge eye.

Blood splattered everywhere like a blood-colored rain, falling to the ground. There were even pieces of giant flesh mixed in.

Eli ignored this scene.

The giant eyeball flew toward him and he collected some more of the bloodline of the Cyclops before returning quickly.

Nikola also followed.

...

Looking at this scene, Alida’s eyes widened.

It had only been a few seconds, and a single-eyed giant had died just like that.

This was too terrifying!

Did he just advance? Who are you trying to fool?

Until the ship started up again, Alida couldn’t calm down for a long time.

She had a faint feeling that their trip to the central mainland this time would probably cause quite a lot of changes.

This branch was really outrageous!

‘And what level is this Eli at!’

There were still a few months of travel ahead, and she felt that she needed to observe carefully.

But she hoped that there would be no accidents on the way.

…..

In fact, Alida was overthinking.

She had thought that she would be able to arrive in half a year, but in the end, it took a full year.

It wasn’t that eli and the others had encountered any danger, but Eli would stop the airships whenever they encountered anything interesting.

Along the way, he had to draw dozens of liters of blood or collect some biological samples from the magical beasts that the others were not willing to encounter.

Doggo really shook his head.

Were they really traveling to help the main tower? This was clearly bandits passing by, robbing as they walked.

However, this process also made Alida completely convinced of Eli’s strength. Eli’s strength was beyond her imagination. At least, none of the fourth-circle creatures they met on the way was a match for him.

As for when she asked Eli, his answer also made her grit her teeth.

“I’m just a minor Warlock who just broke through to the next level.”

She fell silent at Eli’s words, but she also felt relieved. At least the reinforcements this time were really strong.

But she also had a question, and that was, ‘where was the third celestial?’

She only saw Eli and Nikola.

It was very strange!

She didn’t ask, as this was a little too much.

Of course, other than its combat power, what shocked her was the airships. At least, she had never seen such a powerful airship. It had spell formations, runes, and everything. It was as if it was completely new. She couldn’t understand how such a complete airship could still exist on the West Coast at this time.

At least on this point, the main tower was once again surpassed.

In such an environment, after a year, they finally crossed the Sofia mountain range.

…..

The three airships sped up when they saw the exit of the mountain range not far away.

At the very front, Eli stood at the very front with Hydra lying on his shoulder and Alida standing beside him.

Alida ignored the new pair of earrings that looked like eyes and the Hydra and asked, “My Lord, the exit is up ahead. We’ve arrived.”

“I see it.”

Eli’s gaze was calm, and his vision spanned a thousand miles. He had already seen the Warlock city that stood at the edge of the mountain range.

If he remembered correctly, that should be their first stop in the central continent.

Holmes city.

They had arrived at the central continent.

“Speed up again!” ordered Eli.

Alida was also overjoyed. She had brought back reinforcements.

She hoped that the main tower would not be too shocked.
