453 Opening a New Path?

Thank you readers!

Weng!

Just as Eli made up his mind, a Sky Cloud Whale slowly entered the Western Region from the edge of the Western Region.

At the very front of the cloud whale, a gentle breeze ruffled the corner of Jin Ji’s clothes as he calmly looked at the land in front of him.

“I’m finally back!”

Jin Ji took a deep breath and felt a wave of relief.

It had been almost 60 years since he last left this place. Although the president said that the situation here was very good, returning to his own territory was truly reassuring.

” It’s a pity that we’ve wasted our time. Although the ruins belonged to Gray’s students, there are only some remains and some information left behind. Although there are some inferences about Gray’s Wizard Tower in the information, we don’t know how long it will take to deduce it. Even if we deduce it, it’s most likely useless. Anyway, we’ve already experienced this situation countless times! ” Jin Ji shook his head. He was not optimistic about this.

Fortunately, even if it were just an inference, with the efficiency of that group of people, it would probably take decades, so there was no hurry!

The most important thing now was to head to the headquarters in the Western Regions and reassess his forces.

Of course, Jin Ji remembered another thing that kept on bothering him.

“I want to see Eli once!”

Jin Ji whispered.

…

Time flew by, and another month passed.

During this period of time, Eli had also learned of Jin Ji’s return, but he did not pay too much attention to it because he was still nervously concocting the potion!

In the laboratory!

Eli looked nervously at the five Flowers of Eternal Night on the table in front of him, as well as a large number of support resources!

Although he had only brought back two, he had managed to quickly grow five Eternal Night Flowers that met his requirements for a breakthrough by relying on the Life Essence.

However, even though he was familiar with the recipe for the Eternal Night Potion, he still felt a little nervous!

After a long while, Eli took a deep breath and slowly began to move!

Begin configuration!

Although he was a little nervous, when Eli began to concoct the potion, his expression instantly calmed down. His hand movements were smooth and smooth as he quickly processed the potion one by one. Then, he used various methods to fuse their properties together before finally activating them.

Three hours later!

A potion bottle appeared in front of Eli’s eyes. It was filled with a black potion, and silver dots of light were scattered in it. It looked like a galaxy with stars flowing in it. It was extremely beautiful and emitted a strong, attractive force!

“The Eternal Night Potion is done!”

Eli took a deep breath and was pleasantly surprised. He did not expect that he would succeed in such a high-level potion on the first try without even simulating it.

However, it was normal. After all, he had been studying Potionology for more than 2,000 years. His level was really high. He could be called a Potionology Grandmaster!

“Since the potion is done, then the next step is to prepare for the breakthrough!”

Eli walked outside and summoned Nikola and Hydra. “I’m preparing to break through. Seal off the valley, and don’t allow anyone to enter! ”

“Yes, sir!”

Nikola nodded in shock. He had been with Eli, so he naturally knew that the last time Eli had a breakthrough was more than twenty years ago.

Breaking through so quickly was really a little ridiculous!

Hydra, on the other hand, did not think much of it. He would go devour the wind element lode once in a while, and his strength was rapidly increasing. He was now at the peak of Radiant Moon, the same level as Nikola.

Soon, the Grassi ground was filled with fog again, and many spell formations were activated. Hydra and Nikola stood guard outside.

Meanwhile, Eli entered the mage Tower and entered a meditative state!

Meditation begins!

His consciousness also sank into the spiritual world. A dark sun-like celestial was entrenched in the high sky of the spiritual world, and its surroundings were burning with dazzling celestial power. This was the state of a corona-level celestial, and its huge corona also meant that he was already at the peak of the corona level!

Eli slowly connected with his celestial, and his spirit and body gradually reached their peak!

A day later!

He suddenly opened his eyes and consumed the potion.

The ice-cold potion entered his body through his throat, then passed through his limbs and bones, passing through every inch of flesh and blood.

Elu felt his consciousness gradually sink, and the solar corona in his spiritual world gradually extinguished as if he had returned to the dark sun stage. This was only the beginning. After a while, even the dark sun began to ” extinguish “, and it was even darker than before!

Without the illumination of the celestial, the space of consciousness fell into darkness.

In such an environment, Eli’s perception of time and space was gradually blurring. However, he could clearly sense that a new change was taking place in the dark sun!

Time passed by slowly!

A month later!

Boom!

At this moment, a terrifying aura was emitted from Eli’s body.

Nikola and Hydra, who were standing outside the Grassi Lands, turned to look at the same time.

“He broke through!” Nikola let out a sigh of relief and smiled at Hydra.

Hiss hiss hiss!

Hydra also let out a happy neigh!

On the other side, the illusory flames burned from the inside out, and Eli’s consciousness gradually returned.

Eli slowly opened his eyes.

Looking at the familiar laboratory in front of him, Eli lowered his head and looked at himself. He felt that the space of consciousness was really as dazzling as the sun, and he let out a long sigh of relief.

Looking at the time, it had already been more than a month.

“One month, not bad.” Eli stood up and stretched his muscles and bones. At this moment, he felt unprecedentedly powerful. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this moment, his Power had reached 260 units. Although he had only broken through by one unit, he could feel that his strength had increased by at least 30%. The power of his spells had also increased. This was because breaking through a stage had a huge increase in strength!

Throw!

The golden power of destiny dissipated, and the dice stopped after rolling for a while. It showed thirteen!

“Thirteen? Not bad!” Eli was still very happy. After all, he had felt that it was only a 50 – 50 split before!

“Eh, I wonder where the Heart of Abyss is!”

At this moment, Eli remembered that he had not tested the Heart of Abyss yet, so he shook it again.

“The possibility of defeating the Heart of the Abyss, Nero!”

The name of the ruler of the Heart of the Abyss wasn’t a secret, so Eli directly said it.

However, he soon realized that the dice had been spinning for an hour!

“Is there interference?” Eli put away the die, not surprised.

As he grew stronger, the dice would sometimes become less accurate. However, this was the first time he had been unable to predict.

Could it be that he is at the fifth circleThat was impossible. If the Heart of the Abyss were so powerful, the Abyss would have been eliminated long agoTherefore, there must be some item that concealed the prediction or some other reason!

Eli guessed.

Since Nero wouldn’t do, then he would change his target to Tuman!

This time, it went smoothly, but when Eli saw the same 14-point win rate, he couldn’t remain calm!

“F * ck!” Eli’s mouth was wide open. Clearly, he had not expected this scene.

Was Tuman actually this strong? It was actually not much different from the giant tree in the mountain range!

It seemed that the Heart of the Abyss was not simple. Tuman had always been a Radiant Sun Warlock to the public. It seemed that he was hiding his strength.

” I feel that something is wrong. A Warlock of that level is actually wandering around and even contacting forces everywhere. What is his goal? ” Eli took a deep breath.

After thinking for a long time, Eli still didn’t have an answer and finally gave up.

” Forget it, forget it. I’ll just focus on my development. It’ll be fine when I reach the peak of the Radiant Sun or when I reach the level of the giant tree in the mountain range! ” Eli immediately decided to keep a low profile in the future. For now, he would keep a low profile and develop. When he became stronger, he would care about the Heart of Abyss.

At the very least, the Heart of the Abyss had been very stable for the past few decades. There should not be any problems in the short term.

However, Eli still felt a strong sense of danger. After all, there was only a 50% chance of defeating the enemy, which made him feel very uneasy.

He needed to be stronger.

“I need information on breaking through to the fifth ring. According to the laws of the fifth ring, the strength of the giant tree in the mountain range is probably related to the laws. I also need to start comprehending the laws.

“However, all of this will take time. It will only be useful after reaching the peak of the Radiant Sun Stage. Perhaps I still need to start from other aspects.

“The first is to refine the Mountain Giant Tree into the body of the staff. This will give me a certain level of improvement.

“The second was to refine the dozens of fourth circle giants’ corpses hanging from the giant trees in the mountain giants fragment into spirits of the dead. This would be of great help.

“Third, I need to become stronger. Relying solely on the power of celestial is only one path. I shouldn’t be stuck on one skill tree. Perhaps I can try to fuse the path of Warlocks and mages. Perhaps I can use both bloodline and spells at the same time!”

Many thoughts swirled in Eli’s mind as he thought about the opportunity to become stronger.

In fact, he had already thought about this. After all, he would either use the Celestial Body or the Avatar Body. It was equivalent to using the two powers separately. Other people used both magic and physical fighting skills to unleash their effects, but he had a clear distinction here. It greatly reduced his potential!

If they could be used together, the increase in combat strength would definitely be terrifying.

In fact, this unprecedented pioneering work would open up a new path for Mages!

“I want to try!”

Eli pursed his lips and immediately decided to add another project to the experiment.

Regardless of whether it worked or not, he had to give it a try. Although no one had done such a thing before, he would become the first!

Of course, these were all arrangements for later. He first had to go out and rest for a few days. After all, he had just broken through!

With that thought, Eli pushed open the door and walked out. Nikola and Hydra were still standing at the door.

However, Nikola had a strange look on his face. When he saw Eli come out, he said, “Sir, an old friend of yours has come to visit you.”

“Old friend?” Eli, who had just taken a breath of fresh air, looked over in confusion.

“Yes!” Nikola nodded, then slowly spat out a name whom the two were once very familiar with.

“Jin Ji!”
