357 The Exploding Situation

Under the moonlight, three figures appeared before the four of them.

The one at the front had a handsome face. He was wearing a black mage robe that flickered with a unique color. The spiral staff in his hand flickered with a unique color, and his eyes were shining brightly, making the four of them feel uncomfortable.

Without a doubt, this was Eli.

Because compared to him, there were two inhuman figures behind him.

One of the tiny figures gradually grew with the moonlight, and in the blink of an eye, it turned into a huge snake that was more than 100 meters long. The huge snake had pitch-black scales that flickered with the unique color of the shadow, and it also had four heads.

The four heads were also very unique. Their eyes were all different. The center was black, while the others were red, blue, and green. At the same time, shadows, flames, ice, and storms followed. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The other figure was also dozens of meters tall. Its grayish-white body was like a huge cloak, and one could vaguely see countless undead looking at them. The spiritual fluctuations it emitted even caused the surrounding moonlight to ripple, making it seem both real and illusory.

Among them, Eli was in the front, and two figures were on both sides.

The three figures stared at the four people in front of them at the same time.

Frowning!

The three people behind Wellington frowned at the same time.

Three celestial?

Wellington told them there was only one!

“Wellington, are you sure this is the Bloodline Tower branch you’re looking for? ” The armored celestial asked Wellington in an unfriendly tone.

” That’s right. This isn’t the strength of a sub-tower, right? And three celestials? You lied to us. ” The Warlock, who was like a king, also hoped that Wellington could give an explanation.

On the other hand, the woman remained silent, but her expression was serious.

What the three of them didn’t know was that Wellington was also stunned at this moment. His mind was a mess.

He even suspected that he had found the wrong person.

However, Eli’s outfit was the same as the description, and there was even an airship, which meant that they were not looking for the wrong person.

But didn’t this mean that these three celestials were all from the Bloodline Tower?

They were actually hiding their strength.

Was this reasonable?

This was too unreasonable!

Wellington felt like his worldview was about to shatter. Three celestial from a tower in a remote place like the West Coast?

Even the top forces of the Western Regions weren’t that domineering.

You call them a branch?

“You are Eli?” Wellington asked uncertainly.

“Shouldn’t you find out before you stop me?” Eli smiled.

Two nebula and two cluster-stars warlocks!

It was quite a scene.

However, from the looks of their bloodlines, the four of them should not be from the same faction. They were most likely affiliated factions.

After coming to the Central Mainland for some time, Ely learned that the forces here seemed to be layered on top of each other. The situation was much more complicated than before.

“Wellington, you have to give me an explanation!” Hearing Eli’s admission, the armored Warlock questioned loudly.

“The difference between this and what you said is too great. With two more celestials, we’ll be in a lot more trouble.”

“We need an explanation.” This time, the purple-robed woman spoke up as well. Clearly, she was very dissatisfied with Wellington’s concealment.

“Everyone, I was also deceived this time. Who would have thought that a branch tower would actually have such strength?” Wellington felt troubled, but he had to keep his three helpers at bay.

Eli watched quietly from afar. It would be better if they collapsed internally.

“Everyone, you don’t have to worry too much. The two non-human creatures behind him seem to have just advanced. Purple Sand and I will deal with Eli, and the other two will each take one. We can easily finish the battle.” Wellington comforted.

At this moment, he was extremely glad that he had found three people to join him. If he was alone, he was afraid that it would be troublesome.

“That’s true, but we still have risks.” The Armored Warlock frowned.

There was no risk in four versus one, but now it was four against three, so it was different.

After pondering for a few seconds, the Warlock said leisurely, “You have to pay more, four times more.”

“Alright.” Wellington’s mouth twitched.

” I only want twice as much. I want the Undead Crystals and Magical Beast corpses! ” The king-like Warlock said.

“I want the things on Eli. ” the woman added.

The three of them stated their conditions in tacit understanding.

Wellington’s face was dark. He had already paid a huge price to make up for his mistake. With this increase, he would not be able to bear it unless he asked for help from his family. However, his family was not united. It was difficult to get help, especially since this was his personal action.

However, if he did not agree, the three of them would probably turn around and leave.

He was afraid that he would die there.

“Fine!” Wellington gritted his teeth and agreed after ten seconds.

With this promise, his lifetime’s accumulation was gone. He would probably have to waste hundreds of years in the future.

Seeing Wellington agree, the three of them nodded.

This was taking advantage of a burning house. They naturally understood that Wellington had realized it, either. Otherwise, it would have been their clan’s Radiant Moon Warlocks who had made a move, not them.

After all, who would have thought that a sub-tower would actually have three celestials? This was a little too ridiculous.

...

If the main tower were stronger than the sub-towers, the current situation would not be so bad.

“Everyone, we have obtained the benefits. I hope that everyone will work hard!” Wellington, who had paid a huge price, looked at the three of them.

“Of course.” The three of them said at the same time.

Eli’s team was very strong, but they were still not their match.

Wellington also turned his head and looked at the three of them with a ferocious expression. At this moment, his hatred for Eli had reached its peak.

Eli looked at them and turned to Nikola and Hydra. “You guys deal with the two star Warlocks. I’ll deal with the two Nebula warlocks. Just stall them for a while. I’ll finish the battle quickly.”

“Yes.” Nikola nodded.

Hydra was drooling as it looked at the celestial in the distance. It was hungry.

After giving his instructions, Eli turned to Wellington and said, “You don’t mind us moving away from here to fight, right? After all, if the airship is damaged, it will be a big loss for you.”

“Sure.” This time, Wellington thought of his debt and did not refuse.

The seven celestials flew off into the distance in tacit understanding, stopping after a dozen kilometers.

...

The moment he stopped.

In the next second, the source of the four people’s bloodline instantly erupted.

Bang!

The armored man instantly transformed into a giant that was 200 meters tall. He roared at Eli and the others. Rocks covered his body and formed armor. Then, a huge stone pillar was held in his hand as a weapon. He had the Bloodline of a Mountain Giant.

The Warlock, who was dressed like a king, suddenly transformed into a 50-meter-long lion in the air. Its golden mane was burning with golden flames, and its eyes were pure gold. There was a red gem on its forehead. He had the Bloodline of a Blazing Lion.

As for the woman, a purple light flashed, and a huge butterfly appeared in the sky. Its huge wings were 100 meters long. With a gentle flap, a strong wind blew from the ground, like a natural disaster. The patterns on the huge wings formed two huge white eyes that emitted a bewitching power. She had the Bloodline of a Dream Butterfly!

Wellington also transformed into a giant lion of the same size, but his face was like a human face. There was a thick scorpion tail behind him that was covered in purple patterns. The poisonous gas that it emitted was enough to corrode the surrounding air.

In an instant, four huge figures appeared under the moonlight, staring at the three of them.

Nikola’s body expanded rapidly until it was a hundred meters in size. Hydra did not need to change.

Eli looked at the four of them. Countless shadows covered them, and in the blink of an eye, the shadows disappeared again.

A huge shadow dragon appeared in the air, and countless shadows surrounded it. Its huge dragon eyes emitted golden flames, and the shadows at the corners of its scales were like flames. A pair of dragon wings spread out on its back, covering the sky and the sun, covering a few of them.

His body had already reached 500 meters.

Compared to when he was at Morning Star, he was more than three times bigger.

The four people who were stared at by the scarlet-golden dragon eyes felt a chill.

This body shape and size…

The situation didn’t seem right.
