439 30 Years Later

“Apland is suppressed?!”

Jin Ji had a strange look on his face. Was Conilla’s ability that strong? Had he underestimated his subordinate?

“Hehe, I’ve been paying attention to it for you.” The president chuckled and explained, ” It’s like this. You might not know this, but all of this is caused by a change called the Bloodline Tower, or rather, a Warlock called Eli! ”

“Eli? Bloodline Tower?” Jin Ji narrowed his eyes.

It seemed like something had really happened. Otherwise, Eli would not have been able to enter the eyes of one of the most powerful people in Central Mainland!

“Oh, it seems like you know this person?” The president looked at him strangely.

“I know a little. He has some connections with my past.” Jin Ji nodded.

“I see.” The guild leader didn’t ask about the origin and directly explained, “Ever since Eli came to the Western Regions, in just a few decades, the Western Regions has undergone earth-shattering changes. In less than thirty years, Bloodline Tower has grown from an unknown 4th-tier faction to a 2nd-tier faction. Moreover, he can even produce many potions and alchemy products!

“Conilla was in contact with this Warlock. No, it seems like you were the one who instructed him to contact him. After that, he used the channels of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association and its own characteristics to develop rapidly. Your power also developed rapidly within it, and now you can almost suppress Apland!”

The more Jin Ji listened, the more shocked he became. He could no longer maintain his composure.

Magic potion? An alchemy creation? Could these things be produced by a warlock force?

” And what’s interesting is that a few days ago, Eli started a large-scale pre-sale of some potions. Do you understand what that means? ” The guild leader said with a smile.

Hiss!

Jin Ji naturally understood the meaning behind this. This meant that the Bloodline Tower already had the capital to produce on a large scale!

This was a great opportunity for the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, but why did the president suddenly want to talk to him about this?

“Sir, are you preparing to let me go back?” Jin Ji’s eyes lit up.

“No!” The guild leader naturally understood what Jin Ji was thinking, but he still consoled him, “Don’t worry, Apland won’t be able to take it away from you. In this economic war in the Western Region, Apland is obviously not suitable, so the Western Region will be handed over to you in the future!”

“Ah, this!” Jin Ji’s jaw dropped.

He had never expected that he would win so inexplicably, even though he had left.

It was a pity that his lord was no longer around. Otherwise, he would definitely repay him a million times over!

“I was going to let you go back, but something big happened in the Eastern Region this time. Come with me!” the guild leader said. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Eastern region?” Jin Ji raised his eyebrows. That place was so far away from the Western Regions. Did something big happen?

The president glanced at him and said, ” It’s the remains of a mage who was injured and did not leave during the mage war. It’s said that he was once a student of the owner of the Gray Wizard Tower, Wizard Gray. It’s very likely that he knows the exact location of the Gray Wizard Tower, so we have to go and take a look. Moreover, the excavation has already begun. It’s said that his inheritance is among them, and it also contains all the information from the first to the fifth circle. Maybe we can find something useful for us.

“These things left behind by Mages are really a treasure!”

“Gray Magus Tower!” Jin Ji’s gaze turned sharp. He was naturally not unfamiliar with this name.

Wasn’t this the reason why those forces in the Western Regions had been there? Moreover, only when he arrived at the central continent did he know that the various large factions had never given up and had been searching for this Magus Tower. After all, it was rumored that if they found it, they would have the power to unify the current world.

No force could resist such temptation.

“Alright then!” Jin Ji nodded his head, but he sighed in his heart. The eastern region was so far away. It would probably take decades for this to happen!

He had to postpone his meeting with Eli again!

Thus, following the president’s command, the Sky Cloud Whale changed its direction and left.

Jin Ji and the president returned to their room and sat down. They began to discuss the future development of the Golden Cicada Trade Union.

However, a thought flashed through his mind. If the lord were still here, he would ask him to help get the information on the mages. Herman had always been interested in these things!

“Forget it. I’ll get a copy of the information about the fifth circle when I have the chance.” Jin Ji leaned on the comfortable sofa and stretched his body.

And the next time he went back, he had to go see Eli. With his relationship with Herman, Eli would definitely be shocked!

Hehe!

Jin Ji thought mischievously.

At the same time!

In the Grassi land.

Eli felt the statue of faith in the distance slowly withdrawing its power of faith and then returning to the wizard tower.

Next was his own time!

….

A year later!

The connection between the Bloodline Tower and the Green Field was completely established through the spatial teleportation circle. The resources of the Bloodline Tower were continuously transported to the Green Field, and the resources were converted into resources that could bring benefits to the warlocks with the help of many races. Most of them were sold, and some were provided to Eli.

At this time, Eli had also collected the materials for the Corona stage Corona Potion and began to concoct the potion under Hill’s cultivation to promote his growth!

At the same time, Eli began to study sealing spells and purification runes and began to cultivate the Blood Bamboo Flower!

However, something else happened that year. The team of Warlocks who went to the Heart of the Abyss confirmed that there was someone among them who surprised even Eli. It was Vivika.

Eli was shocked that Vivika had requested to join the team. After all, it was very dangerous.

However, under Vivika’s insistence, Ely finally agreed and gave her a small statue of faith that could protect her in times of crisis!

In the end, Eli sent Vivika away. This time, the duration was 30 years!

…

The second year!

Vivika had just arrived a month ago when she was in a life-threatening situation. The statue of faith saved her life and allowed Eli to observe the abyss for a while.

It was an underground cave under the darkness. The creatures inside were a large number of demons, such as inferior demons, fire demons, and other abyssal creatures. Other than that, there was nothing unusual. However, Eli still felt that it was just the appearance. He did not let Vivika do anything.

This year.

...

After Eli concocted the first Corona Potion, his celestial increased by two units, and he was one unit closer to the sun.

Five years later!

At this moment, Eli’s celestial Power had already reached 241 units, and it was still steadily increasing!

At this time, the Bloodline Tower had also begun a large-scale sale of potions, earning countless profits and rapidly accumulating wealth.

During this process, Eli was also searching for the knowledge to break through the fifth circle, but he still found nothing!

However, this year, with the help of a large number of resources, Elven Queen Erwin successfully advanced to the fourth circle. All the races came to congratulate her. Of course, the races in the core area of the green fields did not come, and they still chose not to see her. Eli did not enter the core area either.

Firstly, he wasn’t sure if there were any stronger creatures there. Secondly, the current ones were enough for him to develop. There was no need to cause trouble!

Of course, the races in the green fields that had joined Eli were also developing well due to a large number of resources. There were even a few more races that had joined them!

At this moment, his power in the Green Field had even surpassed that of the human world. This was the influence brought by the Mage Alliance. Even after thousands of years, its prestige was still there.

Ten years later!

Liliana returned. She was now a celestial, but she was still in charge of contacting Ely.

...

Eli hadn’t returned to the laboratory for days!

At the same time, another major event happened this year.

In the Northern Region, which was far away from the Western Region and connected to the northernmost part of this world, a force called the Lich Tower was discovered.

Lich Tower’s philosophy was that warlocks were inferior and that all warlocks had to be transformed into undying liches. However, it was said that once they were transformed, the human will would gradually walk toward darkness and eventually fall into darkness.

This incident had shaken the Warlock world greatly because Warlocks had always been affected by life drain. For a time, countless old Warlocks departed to the Lich Tower. There were even some that left the western regions.

This time, it really shook the entire Warlock world.

But in the end, it seemed that the forces of the Central Region had allied with the forces of the Northern Region to repel them. The Lich Tower had retreated to the extremely cold land!

Of course, Eli didn’t pay attention to this matter because he had already accumulated 250 units of celestial Power and was getting closer and closer to the sun.

Over the years, Eli had also descended into the Abyssal world a few times, but he found that there seemed to be no problems.

For a moment, Eli doubted his own guess. Could it be that there was really nothing wrong with the Heart of Abyss?

Therefore, Eli temporarily ignored the Heart of Abyss and focused on developing himself.

Another ten years.

After consuming a large number of high-level potions, Eli’s celestial Power finally reached 259 points, which was the peak of Corona.

In the same year, he tragically discovered that he seemed to be stuck at a bottleneck again!

He had the Sunlight Eternal Night Potion that could actually help break through the bottleneck. However, this potion was missing one of the magical plants, the Eternal Night Flower!

In the blink of an eye, another two years passed.

Eli had also mastered sealing spells and purification runes. The Blood Bamboo Flower still hadn’t broken through its limits!

However, there were still no clues about the Flower of Eternal Night. Even though Eli had mobilized the Green Field, Bloodline Tower, Golden Cicada Trade Union, and Charm Mansion, they still could not find the Flower of Eternal Night.

Eli was very regretful!

But at this moment, Eli couldn’t care less about this matter because as time passed, the time of the agreement with Gade had arrived!

It was time to explore the ruins of the world fragment!
