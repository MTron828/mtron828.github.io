491 The Arrival of the Advancement

Time slowly passed.

In the laboratory.

Eli sat on the ground, silver light flashing in his eyes. He looked through the passage formed by the power of faith and observed the shadow law wrapped in the black fog law.

Corrosion, transformation, death, decay…

The various characteristics of the Shadow Law flashed in Eli’s eyes, causing him to frown.

After a full hour, he closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his eyes had returned to normal. However, his expression still seemed hesitant.

What he was hesitating about was not the upcoming war but the choice of laws.

The Shadow Law sounded like it was only related to shadows, but if it was broken down, there were too many facets. Every one of them was different. To advance to half-step five-ringed, he naturally had to choose one of them. In this regard, Eli had yet to decide which one to choose.

“Let nature take its course.”

Eli shook his head. He couldn’t rush this step.

He got up, sealed the rules, and left for the mage tower.

However, just as he walked out of the door, he suddenly stopped and raised his head to look at the back of the Grassi Land, the corners of his mouth curling up.

Through the space, he saw six figures heading toward Bloodline City.

“You came quite quickly.”

Eli stretched his body and strode in that direction.

..

At this moment.

Six Warlocks in black Warlock robes were quickly shuttling through the forest.

Suddenly, a figure stopped, and the others looked at him.

Through the faint light shining from the forest, one could see that it was a man with a long scar on his face. His eyes were high and mighty as if he was looking down on everything.

He looked at everyone and said,

“We’re very close to Bloodline City, only about 5,000 meters away. According to the plan, we need three people to seal off the area. The other three will be responsible for capturing the higher-ups and destroying the city.

“Hamis clan, Saladin clan, St. Kevin clan, you three will be in charge of the siege, and we will be in charge of the kidnapping. This arrangement should be reasonable.”

“No problem.” The others nodded without any questions.

“Alright, let’s continue.”

Everyone nodded and set off again, following the road.

However, a few minutes later, when the man saw the familiar forest in front of him, he could not help but frown. He looked at the others, and their expressions were also a little ugly.

It wasn’t because they had gone the wrong way but because the scene in front of them was exactly where they had stopped just now.

“What is the reason? We have four half-step fifth-circle warlocks here. Could it be a large-scale spell formation or an illusion?” The man frowned and looked at the others.

The others also had ugly expressions. One of them pointed to the side.

“Over there.”

The others looked over.

At some point in time, the lush green mountains had turned into a dense black color. Large shadows rolled like tides, emitting dense malice.

The most terrifying thing was that they had no perception of it at all.

” Something’s wrong. Retreat!” A hint of panic flashed across the man’s eyes as he quickly spoke. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When he turned around again, cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

He looked at the forest on the other side, and his body stiffened. His throat moved slightly, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.

The others also turned their heads, and their expressions instantly turned ugly.

On the other side of the forest, a man in a wizard robe was looking at them. It was none other than Eli.

“Why are you here?” The man found it hard to breathe

They naturally knew that Eli had a clone, but everyone knew that a clone could not be stronger than the main body. The combat power of Eli on the battlefield was obvious to all, and everyone thought that one was the main body.

However, when he saw the person in front of him, he realized that the energy of this Eli was even more terrifying. This meant that the person in front of him was the main body, and the one on the battlefield was actually a clone.

“It’s obvious that I’ve never left. Instead, you’ve trespassed into my territory without permission. You’ll have to pay a certain price.” Eli smiled.

Feeling the bright smile, the smiles on their faces instantly froze.

They understood that the Alliance had severely underestimated Eli’s strength.

“Price? We’re just passing by. I’m sorry to barge in, but do you intend to fight?” The man’s reaction was also very fast. He changed the topic as if they were really just passing by.

Eli looked at the man’s performance and said calmly, “Fine!”

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they heard Eli’s words.

However, just as they heaved a sigh of relief, they saw Eli take a step back. Everything in front of them turned into a thick shadow, which turned into a tsunami and attacked them.

They were instantly swallowed into the shadows, and their surroundings fell into darkness.

A few minutes later.

Eli looked at the corpses and waved his hand.

“Since these people were here, the other group should have arrived at Green Fields too.”

He looked into the distance.

..

Green Field!

In the elven temple.

Eli’s doppelganger sat at the highest spot with his eyes closed. Beside him was Erwin.

Further down were the patriarchs of dozens of other races.

“Why did the Lord gather us here?”

“Did something big happen? No, everything seemed normal!”

The representatives of the non-humankind whispered to each other, trying to guess the reason why they had been summoned.

Suddenly, Eli, who was at the front, opened his eyes.

When they saw Eli open his eyes, the others also looked at him.

“Lord Roland, what exactly happened? Why do we need to summon all the races?” Erwin also looked at Eli and asked curiously.

“There is indeed one thing!” Eli nodded and looked at the foreign tribes below him. He said calmly, “Everyone, is there anyone who knows which faction is the strongest in the current Warlock world?”

“Warlock Union!” As soon as Eli finished speaking, there were other races who immediately answered.

“Very good.” Eli nodded and smiled.

“Everyone, as you all know, I am the vanguard sent by the Mage Alliance. My mission is very simple, which is to clear all obstacles before the Mage Alliance returns. According to my judgment, the Warlock Alliance is the biggest obstacle. I recently learned that there is an army of the Warlock Alliance that is going to pass through here.”

Hearing Eli’s words, the representatives of the other races didn’t dare to speak.

At this moment, Eli stood up and said with a sharp gaze, “In the name of the Mage Alliance, I order the various races to gather their armies immediately. Everyone, it’s time for you to show your loyalty!”

When he said the last sentence, Eli glanced at everyone.

In the next second, everyone stood up and lowered their heads toward Eli.

“Yes, sir!”

At the same time, a letter was sent over from the Dragon Clan’s teleportation array in the distance.

Giovanni took a look at it and then let out a dragon roar.

“All dragons, gather.”

Three days later.

In the eastern part of the Green Field, a team of tens of thousands of people entered the Green Field.
