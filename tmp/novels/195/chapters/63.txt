64 Queen Cynthia

“Long time no see, Victor!”

In the end, it was Aria who broke the silence. His uncle’s name was Victor Kazan.

“Long time no see!” Victor was also stunned, but he quickly returned to normal. He glanced at him and said, “Aria, you are getting more and more impolite. You don’t even want to call me uncle. I am so sad.”

“I don’t see any sadness on your face.” The two of them looked at each other, and Aria said coldly.

“That’s all in the past. Why are we still talking about it?” Victor waved his hand as if he didn’t care.

Then, he scanned Aria from head to toe and looked at the perfume bottle in his hand. He raised his eyebrows and said, ” This perfume bottle looks like the classic perfume of the Kazan Chamber of Commerce, called Venus. Unfortunately, it has been out of use for a long time.”

“Yes, but in the future, the name of Venus will once again spread throughout the entire Lorraine Kingdom.” Aria also glared at him and said impolitely.

Victor shook his head to show his disdain.

Although he did not ask, Aria’s intention was obvious.

He just wanted to use the perfume to gain the Queen’s support, and he had the same goal. How could he win against him with that plain-looking perfume?

“Aria, I’m sad that you left the Chamber of Commerce. If you’re willing to come back, I’ll be very happy.” Victor shook his head as if he was sighing.

“I’ll only be happy if you leave the chamber of commerce, thief.” aria gritted his teeth and said, word by word.

“Little bastard!” Victor was also a little angry.

Victor glared at Aria but did not make a move.

Not only was the location unsuitable, but he was also just an ordinary person. His combat ability was not as good as Aria. If he rushed over, he would probably be beaten up.

At this moment, the sound of heels stepping on the ground could be heard from outside the door.

The two of them immediately stopped arguing because the Queen had arrived.

The gorgeous red door was pushed open, and the Queen slowly walked in.

The red dress was inlaid with gold thread, and the gorgeous crown was full of gems. Her face was not the standard oval face, but it gave people a sense of nobility.

The corners of her eyes were slightly raised, and her facial features were well-defined. Her figure was covered by her dress, but everyone could feel the beauty of her figure. Her neck was slender, making her look very slim. Her eyes were bright and full of vigor, full of majesty, and oppression.

Aria and Victor lowered their heads at the same time.

“Greetings, Your Majesty!”

At this moment, there were many guards following behind the Queen. Queen Cynthia waved her hand, indicating for them to wait outside. Then, she walked into the house alone.

“Take it out. Let me see your perfume!” Queen Cynthia glanced at the two of them and said directly.

The two of them didn’t dare to say anything. just standing in front of the queen made them feel immense pressure.

After all, she was a real Queen.

In just a few decades, she had led the Lorraine Kingdom to its current prosperous state. It was not because of her beauty but because of her iron-blooded and decisive will.

“My queen, this is the new perfume set I brought. It’s called Months of the Year.”

Victor stood up slowly, took the box, and opened it gently. Suddenly, white mist drifted out. He opened it and revealed the bottles inside.

Twelve bottles of tight perfume were quietly placed in a velvet box, surrounded by ice to temporarily store the perfume.

“Your Highness, this is the Kazan Chamber of Commerce’s latest top perfume. They correspond to the twelve months of a year. For example, this is January, also known as the month of the first sun. It’s soft and friendly, making people feel as if winter is about to pass and the beauty of the first sun is rising. This is the second month...”

Victor quickly began to introduce the characteristics of each bottle.

Queen Cynthia’s eyes lit up with interest.

Being a Queen was very stressful, and perfume was one of her few hobbies.

“Your Majesty, do you want to try?” Victor took out the first bottle respectfully and presented it to the Queen.

The queen’s guards didn’t try to stop him. after all, the perfumes had already been inspected. Furthermore, queen Cynthia was a grand knight. Not many guards could defeat her.

In the early years of the kingdom, Queen Cynthia would often go out with the Army, and her reputation was truly earned.

Queen Cynthia directly took January.

The bottle was shaped like a crescent moon. The body of the bottle was uneven, and the reflected light was beautiful.

Holding the perfume, queen Cynthia sprayed it directly in front of her. Immediately, a gentle fragrance appeared. queen Cynthia took a deep breath and revealed a satisfied smile.

“Very good!” This perfume should be in the top 30 of her collection of perfumes.

She had cold storage that stored perfume, and there were about 3000 types of perfume in it.

“Your Highness, do you want to try February?” Victor’s face also relaxed a little, and he took out another bottle of perfume.

“Of course, I’ll try them one by one. In order to experience the new perfume, I rejected a very important negotiation. The Kazan Chamber of Commerce really didn’t disappoint me.” Queen Cynthia seemed to relax a little upon seeing her favorite perfume. She was very happy.

She kept her word. For the next ten minutes or so, Queen Cynthia really did go over to them one by one. Every time she was done, she would even share her feelings.

“Not bad, not bad at all!” After experiencing everything, Queen Cynthia revealed a smile on her face.

This series of perfumes was indeed very exquisite, and she liked it very much.

“It’s my job to produce the best perfume for her Highness.” Victor also cheered in his heart, but he still said respectfully.

“Oh, and Aria, you’re old Kazan’s son. I have some expectations for your perfume.” the queen then asked Aria Kazan, who had been standing to the side.

Aria was nervous. It seemed that Victor’s perfume was also good, so he was very nervous. When he suddenly heard the Queen’s call, he was stunned and then reacted.

The Queen actually knew his name. He was touched, and although he hesitated, he still took out his perfume.

The bottle was like a harp, and there was a colorless perfume flowing inside.

“This is mine.” Aria also presented the perfume.

Queen Cynthia was speechless.

“Isn’t this Venus?” Queen Cynthia had a very good memory. This perfume was one of her favorites. It was also because of this perfume that old Kazan had gained her support.

She knew what Aria and Victor’s intentions were, but if Kazan Junior thought that the same perfume could get her support again, he was thinking too much.

She thought that Kazan Junior could surprise her, so she was a little disappointed.

“Your Highness, the bottle is the same, but the perfume is different,” Aria quickly added.

“I see!” Queen Cynthia nodded. Then, she took out some perfume and sprayed it lightly.

Instantly, a smell entered Queen Cynthia’s nose.

However, Queen Cynthia didn’t seem to feel anything. She seemed to have fallen into a daze.

Victor’s expression didn’t change, but he was gloating in his heart.

The silence lasted for more than ten seconds before Queen Cynthia slowly spoke.

“Leave the room now!”

A voice that left no room for doubt was heard. Arria and Victor were a little surprised and did not understand what had happened, but they were quickly taken out of the room. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Bang!

The door slowly closed.

Queen Cynthia finally moved.

She slowly closed her eyes, and two streams of tears flowed out from the corners of her eyes.
