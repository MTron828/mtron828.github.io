287 Just So

“Who is this?”

“Lord Hydra was actually captured. How is this possible? ”

“He’s so strong!”

The warlocks of the bloodline tower watched this scene with their mouths wide open.

It was hard for them to imagine that the Holy tower actually had a backup plan.

The Holy tower’s warlocks were even more shocked!

“My God! How can he be so strong? This is ridiculous!”

“Could this be the legendary celestial? Otherwise, I can’t imagine how a third-circle warlock could be this powerful!”

“Hahaha, with the help of such a great Lord, isn’t our victory inevitable? Even if that Herman comes, he’ll be nothing more than a dog!”

The Holy tower’s morale instantly soared, and even the power of their bloodline burst was much stronger. In an instant, the Holy tower completely suppressed the bloodline tower, and the bloodline tower’s aura became sluggish!

“What is this?”

At this time, Vivika, who was holding the longbow, was also shocked.

Eli didn’t tell her about Klay’s existence, so when she saw Klay’s attack, she was instantly overwhelmed with shock.

The power of Hydra was already something she had never heard of before. However, the appearance of this person in front of her seemed to have broken everything. He had actually captured Hydra easily with just one hand!

However, she was not in the mood to pay attention to it at the moment!

Because after Hydra was captured, there was nothing in front of Situ, and Situ, who was bursting with a powerful aura, flew toward her like a bolt of lightning.

“Stop him!”

A few third-circle sorcerers stood in front of him, trying to stop him.

“Get lost!”

It was obvious that Situ was not interested in them. With an angry roar, a bolt of lightning flashed, and a few of them fell straight to the ground, creating a few large pits with a bang!

A few third-circle warlocks couldn’t even last one move against Situ.

Vivika’s eyes were solemn. There had been an amazing accident in this war. Her mood of victory had suddenly become low, and she was even more frightened when facing Situ!

She didn’t have the confidence to block it!

Blood flowed through her body, and the power of her bloodline was activated. The wind elements around Vivika began to slowly spin, and a tornado slowly formed, trying to block Situ’s attack.

A smile appeared at the corner of Situ’s mouth, and he increased his speed.

This level of defense could not stop him.

But in the next second, shadows appeared in the void, and a shadow wall suddenly appeared.

“This is!” Situ’s pupils instantly shrank.

There was only one possibility for this familiar shadow!

Herman was here!

Situ was shocked. The lightning he had accumulated instantly began to dissipate, and his body quickly left in the opposite direction, not much slower than before.

However, it was too late. Several shadow pythons flew out of the shadows, crossed the space, and arrived directly beside Situ. They devoured the lightning around him and directly wrapped around him.

Then, the snakes slowly returned to the shadow.

From the shadows, eli stepped out.

He stretched out his hand and grabbed Situ. He looked at Klay in the sky and smiled.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Herman!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the sky, Klay looked down calmly at Eli.

The shadow on Hydra’s body was already on the verge of being defeated. It was struggling frantically, letting out howls, and its three snake heads were spinning like windmills!

“I’m Klay!” He said calmly.

..

On the ground, the battle was in full swing. Roars and the sounds of weapons intertwined. Elemental attacks were as common as raindrops on a rainy day. However, even on such a dangerous battlefield, many people turned their gazes to the sky with grave expressions.

“master Herman finally showed up. I almost forgot how many years ago he last showed up.”

“Master Herman is still as strong as before, to actually finish off Situ in a short while!”

“I don’t know if he can defeat that Warlock. This Warlock named Klay is not a normal 3rd circle warlock. It seems a little difficult. Even Hydra was easily subdued!”

A few minutes ago, Hydra had been captured, and Situ faced Vivika alone.

All the warlocks of the bloodline tower tensed up.

The Hydra was the most powerful creature in the bloodline tower’s battlefield, and Vivika was the command center. Losing either of them would be a great loss to the bloodline tower, especially Vivika.

In fact, before the war began, some people had suggested that Vivika not show her face, but she insisted on fighting personally.

Fortunately, Situ was stopped by one of the most important figures in the bloodline tower, Herman.

He was a Warlock who had not appeared for hundreds of years but was still remembered by everyone.

At this moment, he was holding Situ in one hand and rising rapidly to the same level as Klay.

“You are very clear that the battle between you and me is the key to the outcome of this battle. I will let Situ go, and you will let Hydra go. How about it?” Eli said as he looked at the man.

“Alright!”

Klay was very straightforward.

...

Today, he was in battle mode and was wearing a gray-white Warlock’s robe. He controlled the Hydra with his left hand and held a long gray-white sword in his right hand, which was emitting waves of lightning!

Upon hearing what Eli said, the lightning on his left hand disappeared instantly, and the Hydra’s huge body fell to the ground. With a bang, it melted into a large shadow and then condensed into a Hydra that was one size smaller.

The Hydra was an elemental creature to begin with, and it had used up a lot of its power just now.

He looked rather miserable at the moment.

Looking at the Hydra’s appearance, Eli’s gaze turned cold, and Situ also smashed toward the ground.

“I didn’t expect warlocks to use a sword!” Eli said to Klay.

“This is only a matter of course. Sooner or later, the weapons of the Magi will be replaced. Compared to those, warlocks are more suitable for using the weapons of these mortals!” Klay held the longsword, his eyes emotionless.

“Well said!” Eli nodded.

“Hmph, I don’t have time to chat with you today. Situ told me about you before. You’re very strong, but it’s a pity that you’ll die Here today!” Klay pointed his longsword at Eli and said calmly, “as someone who is half a step into the celestial realm, you have no idea what true power is like!”

BOOM!

As soon as Klay finished speaking, the sound of thunder suddenly rang out on the battlefield.

...

Everyone looked up and saw a large patch of thick dark clouds in the sky. Countless bolts of lightning were intertwined in the sky, emitting terrifying lightning.

A huge lightning eagle appeared behind Klay and looked down at him.

Countless bolts of lightning surrounded Klay. At this moment, he looked like a god of Thunder. He looked down at the world.

The warlocks on the ground were all shocked.

“Herman, are you ready to die?” Klay looked at Eli, the sword in his hand glowing with lightning as he pointed it at him.

Eli looked at him calmly, his eyes gradually turning silver. Three silver rings were spinning within, and in his consciousness, a sharp force was slowly brewing.

He was also looking at Klay, and a translucent blade slowly appeared in front of him.

Ordinary, without any fluctuations, as if it didn’t exist.

This was the feeling that this five-hundred-year-old soul Blade gave off.

And as the blade condensed, the silver light in Eli’s eyes gradually bloomed. The blade seemed to transform once again, and threads of fluorescent light wrapped around the blade. When the silver light dissipated, silver marks had already appeared on the blade!

“Is this your trick?”

He slowly stretched out the long sword in his hand, and endless lightning gathered.

“Thunder Eagle!”

The longsword swung down, and a giant lightning Eagle that was almost fifty meters long condensed like a bolt of lightning that cut through the sky. Then, with an unstoppable momentum, it charged toward Eli.

He did not hold back at all. As soon as he made his move, Klay used his strongest move.

So was Eli.

With a thought, the soul Blade, which was only a few dozen centimeters long, flew into the sky.

In just a few seconds, the giant Eagle and the sharp blade collided, but to Klay’s surprise, as the sharp blade entered the lightning, all the lightning began to melt like snow.

The enormous lightning Eagle actually disappeared into space.

Klay’s mouth was wide open.

“This …”

In the next second, the sharp blade arrived, but Klay had no time to react.

He only felt as if his soul was being torn apart, and his consciousness was gradually fading.

The longsword in his hand fell, and Klay stared at Eli. His last consciousness gathered, and he looked at Eli, gritting his teeth, “This is not a Warlock’s technique!”

The next second, he lost consciousness!

Klay was dead!

Looking at this scene, Eli shook his head and slowly flew to the ground.

“Half-step celestial is just so-so.”
