528 The Crazy Warlock Alliance

“War has broken out?”

In the Wizard Tower, Eli was sitting on one side, looking at Alida on the other.

“Yes, my lord.

“Just this morning, the Warlock Alliance launched an attack in the northern part of the western region, the southern region, and the eastern region. They mobilized more than a million Warlocks.” At this moment, Alida’s expression was very ugly, and her voice was a little anxious.

“Is this a declaration of war?”

Eli narrowed his eyes.

This was faster than he had expected. It seemed that the Warlock Alliance could not hold it in any longer.

However, he had yet to reach the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm. This was not the time to fight.

“Has the fifth circle warlock made his move?” Eli suddenly asked.

“Not yet!” Alida shook her head and added, “However, this time, the Warlock Alliance is mainly targeting our homeland. The Warlocks from the other two regions and other regions seem to be more inclined to hold them back. This can be seen from the Warlock deployment.

“At this moment, the number of Warlocks gathered outside the western region is almost more than the other three regions combined. According to the current information, it is very likely that the Warlock Alliance is under pressure from many parties. They probably do not have the courage or ability to subdue all the regions. Their idea should be to eliminate us first, the leader, before making other plans!”

Indeed!

Eli nodded.

This was something that Alida could see through.

It seemed that although the Warlock Alliance had started a war with them, they were destined not to focus all their attention on them because they had an even more powerful opponent in the north-the Lich Tower!

Compared to the Lich Tower, the Bloodline Alliance might even be weaker!

After all, they were not destroyed under the joint attack of the six families. They even existed today and occupied a large area of the Northern Region.

Therefore, it was highly likely that they were planning to destroy the Bloodline Alliance as fast as possible.

To defeat the Bloodline Alliance, the best way was to defeat the Bloodline Tower or kill the number one villain, the mastermind behind the Bloodline Tower, and the actual controller of Greenfield, Eli.

“Since they want to fight, then let’s fight. If it’s basic combat strength, we won’t be too weak. I’ll send Nikola and Hydra to help you.” Eli thought for a moment and said.

“Yes!”

At this point, they had no other choice.

Either fight or perish!

Soon, Alida left, and Eli turned around and entered the secret realm again.

However, this time, Eli felt a little more pressure. Thus, he entered deeper into the time world fragment and began to devour the time law to increase his strength.

..

Ten days later!

Something big happened.

The Lich Tower in the extreme north made a move!

As if they knew about the war between the Warlock Alliance and the Bloodline Union, the Lich Tower, which had been silent for decades, suddenly started a war. Millions of Liches came to the Northern Region.

In just one day, another quarter of the Northern Territory came under the Lich Tower.

The Warlock Alliance was shocked!

Facing both the Bloodline Alliance and the Lich Tower, they instantly felt a huge pressure. In fact, the pressure on the Bloodline Alliance was weakened for a short period of time.

According to Miya’s investigation, almost all the masters of the Warlock Alliance had woken up from their slumber. They had to face this great crisis that had lasted for thousands of years together.

It was said that although there were no Ten Thousand Flowers among them, there were quite a number of Thousand Leaves!

In a short period of time, a large number of Warlocks would enter the Northern Region to resist the Liches!

Once again, Eli was given a short period of respite. At this moment, there were 450 leaves of the Time Law.

.

War was destined to be cruel.

In the blink of an eye, more than two months had passed since the war in the northern region. Every day, a large number of Warlocks died. The entire northern region had been turned into a scorched land of death. The red blood dyed the place red!

The five families in Heaven City had cold expressions on their faces!

“Everyone, we made a mistake in making this decision!” The Press Family Head frowned and sighed helplessly.

“I don’t think we can be blamed for this. Who would have thought that the Lich Tower would suddenly erupt after being silent for so many years? Fortunately, the war between us and the Bloodline Alliance has not begun yet.” Master Yunge shook his head.

Patriarch Dylo slowly raised his head and frowned. “For now, we can be considered to have stopped the attack of the liches. However, as the slaughter continues, their strength is increasing, but we are constantly weakening. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Moreover, the Bloodline Alliance is behind us and could stab us at any time. We have to be on guard!”

Hearing this, everyone nodded.

If the Bloodline Alliance were to launch a sneak attack on the Warlock Alliance, then this was definitely a good opportunity. Moreover, if they attacked at a critical moment, they would definitely vomit blood!

Everyone felt that Eli would definitely make a move!

After all, they had been dealing with Eli for a long time and were deeply aware that this was a very difficult opponent. Once he found an opportunity, he would definitely not let go.

“Then what should we do?” Master Sella looked at the three families at the front.

The room fell silent for a moment!

The silence lasted for a full five minutes before Master Yun Ge cleared his throat. His eyes flickered as he said, “Just like what the Sella Family said, the Bloodline Alliance has to be eliminated.

” Although the outside world thinks we are at our weakest, the awakening of our ancestors has made us extremely powerful. Why don’t we hold the Lich Tower and quickly mobilize our forces to attack the Western Region and take down the Bloodline Tower? It’s best if we can take down Eli. Even if we can’t take him down, it’s fine. As long as we cut off his wings, the damage he can cause will be limited. What do you think?”

She looked at everyone.

“There’s a certain risk, but it’s not a big problem.” Patriarch Press nodded.

“I’m fine with it too.” Dylo, York, and the three leaders of the families hesitated for a moment before agreeing.

A new meeting soon began, but this time, it was about how many combat forces to send into the Western Regions.

The discussion lasted for half a day before it ended.

” It’s decided. The five families will send their own people to attack the Bloodline Tower. There will be five Thousand Leaves in total, including two peak Thousand Leaves and six Divine Trees. They will destroy the Bloodline Tower in a week.” The Press family gritted their teeth.

Everyone looked at each other and nodded.

This time, they had only reserved their fighting strength to resist the Lich Tower. They had used the remaining fifth circle force without holding anything back. This showed their determination.

“Bloodline Tower, how will you survive this time?”

Everyone revealed a smile that they had not seen for a long time and felt a wave of relief.

..

” I’m finally at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm!”

In the time world fragment, Eli stretched his body.

After two months of hard work, he had also reached the peak of Thousand Leaves. He could even see that the lightning in the time world fragment had become much thinner, which was largely related to his ” wanton ” consumption.

“But it’s all worth it!”

Eli felt the power of law in his body. He had never felt so powerful. At this moment, he was more than twice as strong as he was three months ago.

After all, the power of laws was not one plus one equals two. It was greater than two.

“All kinds of secret techniques, other methods, and the Mercury Blade that I recently condensed. With my current combat strength, I can defeat even a dozen or so Thousand Leaves. As for those below, they’re like chickens!”

Eli silently assessed his own combat power and suddenly felt much more relaxed.

He could finally relax a little as he had been pressed for time by the Warlock Alliance.

“However, they shouldn’t make a move in the short term. After all, there’s the threat of the Lich Tower!” Eli considered the current situation and did not think that they would attack them again!

“Unless they are crazy…”

The corners of Eli’s mouth curled up into a smile.

However, a few seconds later, his smile gradually faded. He took out a crystal ball and saw the information inside. The corners of his mouth gradually twitched.

“F * ck. Why did I jinx myself?”

He cursed.
