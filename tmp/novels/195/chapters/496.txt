497 Shocked by All Sides, Counting the Harvest

Charm Mansion!

“What? The Heart of the Abyss, Nero, attempted to collude with the Abyssal Demons to open the seal, but Eli’s main body arrived and killed him, stopping their plot!”

Liliana, who had just been promoted to the manager of the Charm Mansion, widened her eyes and asked the Warlock.

“Yes, my lord.” The Warlock replied.

Hiss!

Liliana gasped.

After a few seconds, she pursed her lips and sighed. “As expected of him!”

..

“As expected of Ely!”

At the same time, Jin Ji sighed.

“My lord, you’re truly a divine schemer. I’m afraid you already knew that the Bloodline Tower would win, which is why you rejected the Warlock Union!” Conilla laughed as he flattered him.

“I really don’t know this time!” Jin Ji shook his head and said, “Who would have thought that Eli would be so powerful?

“Even his clone is so terrifying. I’m afraid that no one below the fifth circle can match him in this world. Even in the Mage World, he will be a dazzling existence!”

“Indeed, Lord Eli is different!” Conilla sighed deeply.

When he first came, Eli was just the person in charge of a small branch, but now he was indeed the number one and only first-class force in the Western Region. He was in charge of the Western Region.

It was so terrifying.

“Alright, the construction of the Western Regions will definitely require a lot of resources. I think we should go and prepare. This is also a rare opportunity for us.”

Jin Ji stood up and silently thanked himself for making the decision.

..

Heaven City!

“The Bloodline Tower has won, and the Heart of the Abyss has been confirmed to be colluding with the Abyss. This time, they have really found a valid reason, and our Hamis family can’t find a suitable reason to attack!” Azak said helplessly.

“It’s normal for him to win, but I’m afraid that Eli’s strength in this war is the not under the fifth circle.”

“He’s so terrifying. If I don’t get to the fifth circle, I’m afraid I can’t do anything to him.”

Judging from Eli’s combat ability, it would be difficult for them to do anything to him. His combat ability was extremely exaggerated. He was simply not human!

“Also, we’ve investigated the matter of the Green Field. We’ve confirmed that there’s a Mage named Roland who claims to be a Mage who returned from the Mage Alliance and is messing with the Green Field Races!” At this moment, an old voice sounded.

Hearing this, everyone else turned around. It was the white-haired warlock of the Press Family!

“Then what should we do?”

At this moment, someone looked at Tibor and asked curiously.

“Hehe, I have a good idea!”

His white beard trembled as he revealed a mysterious smile.

Not far away, Azak was also curious. After a while, his eyes lit up.

“I agree!”

He was the first to agree.

..

“The Warlock Union has sent news that they will not interfere in the matters of the Western Regions, but there is a condition.”

Back in the Grassi Land, Eli looked at Alida curiously.

“Yes, my lord.” Alida nodded helplessly. They were helpless against a behemoth like the Warlock Union. After all, they were not on the same level.

Although they were already a first-class force, each of the six families was stronger than a first-class force. Not only were they powerful, but it was also said that they all had combat strength that surpassed half-step fifth circle, which was the legendary fifth circle. Of course, such people had not appeared for many years, and no one knew if they still existed.

“What condition?”

Eli asked. He was very cautious about the Alliance.

Alida cleared her throat and said, “Sir, it’s like this. They discovered the existence of a Mage in the depths of the Green Field and have even allied with most of the other races. Their request is for us to wage war against the Green Field and kill or capture that Mage alive!”

Ely, “??”

Eli’s expression gradually became strange.

Did he hear wrongly?

Had his clone been discovered? However, this condition was really…Not bad!

“Alright, tell them that I agree. As long as we rest and recuperate, it won’t take a year!” The corner of Eli’s mouth couldn’t help but curl up. Wasn’t this a replica of the West Coast?

With the Warlock faction in his hands, he was able to compete with his own Mage faction. This was happening again.

However, this time, it was him against himself. However, he also needed time to develop. This matter was also a good thing for him. When facing a powerful enemy, it was better to keep a low profile and accept their conditions in humiliation.

“Yes, I’ll reply to them later. Oh, Sir, the resources regarding the Heart of the Abyss have also been sorted out. We’ve also placed all the high-value items outside the valley.” Alida asked again. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Bring it in. I’ll take my time to look through them.” This time, Eli really smiled.

It had finally come to this.

He hoped that a first-class force wouldn’t disappoint him.

“Yes, sir!” Alida nodded and left.

..

Three hours later.

Eli walked out of the Mage Tower.

At this moment, hundreds of thousands of items were piled up in the valley, forming small mountains. They were dazzling and emitted a beautiful light like Magic Stones.

“So many!”

Eli gasped.

It was a little scary. Even with his current silver eye, it would take at least a day or two to sort through so much.

“Happy troubles.”

Shrugging his shoulders, Eli walked towards the resource mountain.

..

Three days later.

Eli walked out.

It took him more time than he had expected, but he did find a lot of good things.

Excluding most of the resource-type materials and some items that Eli was interested in, there were not many that were useful to Eli. There were only about four or five items.

Thinking of this, Eli lowered his head and opened his interspatial ring, taking out five items.

A dark red robe, a monocle, a dark purple eye, a longbow, and a small bottle of flowing marrow!

The robe was called the Crimson Sorcerer Robe. It was a fifth-circle mage robe that was made from the World Veil of a small world, which was also the world membrane, and a large number of other precious resources.

It was able to withstand the attacks of the fifth circle law. Moreover, due to the characteristics of the world membrane, it could automatically resist all kinds of external attacks. It had an extremely strong defensive effect against hidden attacks. It was a high-grade mage’s robe.

Of course, at this moment, Eli was not able to unleash all of its defenses, but it was still far superior to the sorcerer’s robe he was wearing, which was refined from the skin of the Deep Sea Giant Octopus.

The second was the monocle. Although it was the monocle, the effect was quite interesting. It can make the protagonist completely invisible.

Eli liked it.

Anyway, he was quite fond of this kind of concealment attribute of the weapon.

The third eye, this made Eli a little confused, because he had not found any traces of this item in the past. However, it was emitting a faint black fog aura. Eli seriously suspected that it might be related to the Dark Cursed World that destroyed the mage world.

Eli had also tried to put it together with the black fog. It could absorb the black fog, but it could not absorb the black fog that was bound by laws.

The third item was a two-meter-long bow. It had a slender and elegant bow shape, and it was a pale gold color. It was a fifth-circle Warlock weapon that could double the power of bloodline attacks. It was an ultra-long-range weapon, and it contained a large number of spatial materials, allowing it to cross space.

Together with Eli’s Eye of Mercury, it was a set of sharp weapons.

What Eli could see was his attack range.

As for the last one, Eli lowered his head to look.

The marrow was placed in a sealed transparent bottle, emitting a rainbow-like color, and it had a great attraction to Eli.

This thing was called the Rainbow Light Pith. It was taken from the ancient elements realm. It was rare and extremely precious, and its value was comparable to a complete small world.

And it only had one use.

” Assist in breaking through the fifth circle.” Eli pursed his lips and felt his heart beating a little fast.

He didn’t know how Nero obtained this thing, but there was no doubt that he had prepared it for himself. However, this was a huge advantage for Eli.

Even if he couldn’t use it now, he would definitely need it in the future.

“Good man!”

Eli sighed deeply.

To put it bluntly, he wouldn’t exchange this thing for the entire Western Region.
