464 After the Event

Astral Sealing Technique.

Thank you readers!

One of Eli’s first gains in Green Field was a powerful sealing technique unique to the astral spirits. Ever since Eli learned it, it was also the first time he used it in battle.

Now, it seemed that the effect was not bad!

With a wave of his hand, the giant shadow hand brought the dragon Giovanni to a spot not far away from him.

“I think we need to talk!” Eli looked at the dragon and smiled.

Roar!

A roar was heard. Although Giovanni’s power was sealed, he was still awake. He felt around him and looked at the human in front of him. He was flustered and helpless. He did not know how this could happen!

This shouldn’t be!

He was clearly not even a half-step fifth circle. How could he have done such a thing?

“What do you want to talk about?” Giovanni looked at Eli and lowered his tone a little.

“I’m not interested in you, but I need help with an experiment. If you and your people can help me complete this experiment, I can let you and your son leave!” Eli said.

Feeling the comfort of not being able to break free, Giovanni turned his head, which was the only thing he could move. He thought for a moment and then said softly, “I need to see Ortiz!”

“Good!” Eli nodded and shrugged. “However, you’d better tell your clansmen to calm down. You don’t want me to kill them, do you?”

Giovanni nodded. As he was bound, the dragons in the sky panicked and were ready to rush up to save him.

“Sayis, tell all the dragons to wait where they are. Don’t do anything else.” Giovanni lowered his head and looked at the ground. A loud voice traveled through space!

“Very good, let’s go!”

In the next second, Eli flew towards the Grassi Land, and the dragon was forced to move along with him.

The two of them quickly fell into the valley!

…

“… We are not allowed to do anything else!”

Hearing the Dragon King’s voice, Sayis was still flying in the same place in a daze, suppressing his original intention to make a move.

At this moment, a large number of dragons behind him were frightened, and the elements on their bodies were activated as if they were triggered. Seeing this scene, Sayis had no choice but to shout, “All dragons, stay where you are and wait for Lord’s news!”

Hearing his words, everyone calmed down, but their expressions were still filled with disbelief.

“How is this possible? The Dragon King was defeated so easily!”

“Heavens, when did such powerful humans appear in the northern part of the Western Regions?”

” Impossible! Absolutely impossible! ”

The dragons had their own thoughts, but all of them showed disbelief at the failure of Dragon King Giovanni, or rather, confusion about Eli!

It shouldn’t be!

…

“Our lord won!”

“We’re saved, we’re saved!”

“Oh my god, what was that light just now? I thought I saw a god!”

The Warlocks in Bloodline City were all dumbfounded.

Although they firmly believed in Lord Eli’s strength, they did not expect Lord Eli to be so powerful!

The thousand-meter-long dragon had been defeated so easily. This made them feel as if they had just survived a calamity!

He was saved!

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower weren’t the only ones in the city. There were many other forces as well!

The Holy Tower’s supporters watched in a daze as the giant dragon was led away by Eli while the other giant dragons remained where they were!

“Does he need our support?”

The person in charge of the support team said with a twitching mouth.

They had come here with the determination that there was a high chance of death, but the battle had ended before it even started.

They hadn’t done anything yet!

“But … Everything should be over!” The warlock sighed. The Dragon King had been taken away to negotiate. The war was undoubtedly over, although it had not yet begun.

At the same time, he was completely convinced by Eli!

Compared to what they had imagined, Eli was much stronger!

“It’s over.”

At the same time, the person in charge of the Siren family not far away also heaved a sigh of relief.

Although things had taken an unexpected turn, their support this time was absolutely right.

It didn’t matter whether they had helped or not, but they had already conveyed their intentions. He believed that after the war, the Bloodline Tower would definitely express their gratitude.

“Fortunately, my lord didn’t make the same choice as the Twilight Lizard. I guess the Twilight Lizard will be kicked out of the cooperation list in the future. ” He couldn’t help but feel fortunate, and at the same time, he felt sympathy for his neighboring power.

They hoped that their family head’s expression would be better after hearing this news!

….

Grassi Land!

“Father is here. According to the time, the battle should be ending soon.

“I’m finally going home!”

Ortiz stood on the ground and poked the ground with his hands happily, causing the soil to arch forward!

In his opinion, his father’s arrival was no surprise.

“And you, poor Elo, you are about to lose your life, and the Red Dragon King Ortiz will regain his freedom!” Ortiz laughed out loud, which made Nikola, Dylan, and even Hill look at him.

Feeling these gazes, Ortiz proudly raised his head.

After living here for 50 years, he had become more familiar with these people and creatures!

Sha Sha!

Suddenly, a rustling sound was heard. Ortiz turned his head abruptly to look at the sky. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Something came in!

Ortiz was about to shout, but he realized that Eli didn’t seem to like it.

“I’m about to leave, and it’s Father who came in. What am I afraid of?….. Father!” Ortiz slapped himself and shouted toward the sky.

“Stop shouting. Don’t you know that it will be very noisy?”

The familiar voice of Eli rang out. Ortiz blinked, suddenly having a bad feeling!

In the next second, as Eli slowly dissolved the outer spell formation, and Ortiz saw the huge dragon behind him that could not move like a dumpling, Ortiz’s smile instantly froze.

‘It’s over. It’s over…This human was indeed a demon. His father had actually been captured…. This was impossible. How could this be?.. ‘I’m finished. What should I do…’ F * ck, even his father failed. Could it be that he became an experimental subject too?

‘No, that’s not right. Does this mean that I can reduce my workload by half?’

Ortiz’s heart was gradually filled with filial piety, but looking at his father’s appearance, there was no doubt that his father had been defeated by Eli and even captured!

He knew that Eli was strong, but he didn’t expect him to be this strong!

Of course, he was more concerned about how he should speak first, so he foolishly said, “Father, you were captured too!”

Giovanni was speechless.

“I suddenly don’t want to see him anymore. Why don’t we talk somewhere else?” Giovanni said to Ely with a dark face.

“Let’s have a chat. Ortiz is very familiar with what happened. He has been doing this for 50 years!” Eli smiled as he turned his head and said to Ortiz in the distance, “I’m sorry to have shattered your beautiful dream!”

“No, no, I believe that Milord will definitely win! ” Ortiz revealed an expression that was uglier than crying, but his words made his unlucky father’s face darken even more!

“Since we’re all here, let’s talk about my conditions!” When they arrived, Eli turned to look at the dragon Giovanni.

“Good!”

Giovanni nodded in resignation.

What else could he do?
