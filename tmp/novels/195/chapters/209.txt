210 Third Circle

“My Lord!”

Eli stood in front of the white bone altar. At that moment, a spirit of the dead flew over from not far away. It was Nikola.

“Hmm, how’s the preparation of the soul crystals? ” Looking at Nikola, who was right in front of him, Eli said directly.

Long ago, he had already asked Nikola to use the remaining spirits of the dead to condense a soul crystal for him.

“It is ready!!” Nikola looked at Eli respectfully. Perhaps it was due to the soul brand in his mind.

“Okay, go and set it up. I’ll make some potions in the next few days. yes.” Eli nodded. Nikola was quite reliable.

“Yes, sir. There’s a mage Tower here. It’s a very suitable environment.”

Nikola took Eli deep into the forest. Not far from the center, there was a mage Tower, but it looked quite dilapidated and should have been abandoned for a long time.

Eli walked in without hesitation. It was very clean inside, and he dispersed Nikola and took out all the materials needed to make the soul Fusion potion.

The water elemental fruit with blue light, the dark beech wood of fear, the human-faced flower …

He had spent a lot of time collecting each and every magical herb. In order to increase the success rate, he prepared a lot of them.

“Let’s begin!”

Eli took out all sorts of equipment for concocting the potion and then began to process it. This lasted for a full day, and a day later, Eli began to concoct the potion.

The concoction of the potion was much smoother than Eli had imagined. A day later, the first Soul Fusion potion was successfully concocted without any accidents.

This was normal. Although he was only a second-circle mage, his knowledge of potions had already surpassed his current level. Moreover, he had already simulated this process countless times over the past few hundred years.

If an accident were to happen, he would be disappointed in himself.

And so, three days later, Eli looked at the five bottles of Soul Fusion potion and the dozen or so bottles of various potions that were neatly arranged and smiled. With these, things should be settled.

“Something’s wrong!”

Suddenly, Eli seemed to have realized something and took out the fate die.

He threw it out.

Six!

“Now, that is what I like to see!”

Eli took the magic medicine and walked out of the mage Tower, then headed towards the altar.

He quickly arrived at the altar, which was filled with a large number of soul crystals and had many alchemy spell formations carved on it.

“My Lord, the undead have been dispersed!” Nikola said as he walked up to Eli.

“Go and stand guard outside the forest. Don’t let any creatures enter. If they try to force their way in, kill them!” Eli said to Nikola, his eyes calm.

“Yes!” Nikola flew out of the forest after hearing that, while his head turned around from time to time.

Speaking of which, he was most puzzled about his master’s age. He used to think that Eli was a third-circle warlock, but he later found out that he was a second-circle warlock. But how did a second-circle warlock Live for so long?

Therefore, there must be a big problem with this master, but that was not important.

A few hundred years had made him realize a problem. This was no longer the world of mages. If he wanted to live long, he had to rely on someone else. And that person was Eli.

“I’m going to guard the forest well!” Nikola’s eyes became determined.

No matter who it was, they could forget about taking a step into the forest.

..

On the other side, after checking the altar once again, Eli began to meditate. This was to allow him to reach his peak state.

Three days later.

Eli opened his eyes, and they flickered. Time was up. This was the time for him to advance.

In an instant, Eli took out a bottle of potion from the row of potions in front of him and consumed it directly. At the same time, he activated his mental force.

As he consumed the potion, his 200 points of mental force finally began to increase slowly. He was breaking through the limit of his second circle, and his aura began to increase.

200.

201.

..

210.

At the same time, the soul crystal on the altar began to burn, and a large amount of pure spiritual energy gushed toward Eli like flowing water, allowing him to break through this process.

The increase in mental force caused Eli’s eyes to emit a bright light, and the surrounding air was constantly trembling under this pressure. Meanwhile, in the sky, a massive amount of Nature Power was slowly gathering towards this place.

A huge elemental vortex began to form.

“the second step is to fuse mana and mental force.”

Eli quickly began the second step of the breakthrough. Instantly, the mental force crystal in his consciousness began to melt, and the mana in his body also began to flow, slowly combining with his mental force.

Soul force was slowly taking form within his body. This was also one of the differences between second and third circles.

“It’s going very smoothly!” Eli felt the changes in his body. Everything was going according to plan.

Once the second step was completed, it meant that the advancement was complete.

But at this moment, something unexpected happened to Eli. In his mind, the shadow Dragon bloodline crystal began to melt slowly, and then it joined the fusion of his mental force and mana.

For a moment, his mental force, bloodline, and mana began to merge.

Eli was also stunned. What the hell was going on?

Why would the bloodline crystal be added to it? Wasn’t he a mage? Bloodline fusion … That was how warlocks achieve breakthroughs!

...

‘This …’

For a moment, the momentum of Eli’s breakthrough seemed to have stagnated for a second.

But then, Eli became determined. Damn it, at this point, there was no turning back. And he had a vague feeling that this was not that bad either.

He continued!

The other two bloodline crystals also started to melt slowly. The three powers began to merge to a greater extent, and a new power slowly formed.

Compared to the fusion of mental force and mana, there were also bloodline crystals. It seemed like his power level had been raised to another level, which surprised Eli.

One day.

Eli could feel the new power that was formed from the fusion of his bloodline, mental power, and magic power. The power within it was much stronger than any of the other powers.

Eli had also accepted this strange change.

The second step had been completed.

“the next step is the third step, which is to establish a connection with nature.” Eli looked up and saw that a huge elemental vortex had already appeared in the sky.

...

It had a radius of a few dozen meters.

Without any hesitation, he picked up the soul Fusion potion and directly consumed two bottles. Then, he took a deep breath, and his eyes became determined.

In the next instant, the elements in the sky gushed toward Eli as if they were pouring in reverse.

Eli was immersed in a sea of elements. The connection between his entire body and the outside world was slowly being established. At the same time, the cells in his body were absorbing the elements, and the number of elements that each cell could absorb was also increasing.

This was the third step to breaking through to three rings.

Communication with nature.

This step was also the biggest difference between second and third-circle mages.

Once completed, a third-circle Mage would be able to mobilize the natural elements, and the number of elements they could mobilize would be several times or even dozens of times more than before.

This process was not complicated. It only required time. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Three days later!

Eli opened his eyes, then picked up another bottle of Soul Fusion potion and consumed it.

According to the plan, two bottles should have been enough, but it seemed that with the new power of the fusion of the three powers, it had increased the attraction of Eli to the elements, so two bottles of medicine were not enough.

“I’d like to see how many bottles I need!” Eli pursed his lips.

The more time passed, the better it was for a mage. This would increase a mage’s attunement to nature.

A normal third-circle mage could mobilize three times the power of nature compared to a second-circle mage. The most talented mage would only be six to seven times that. But now, Eli’s connection to nature was still improving. Even Eli was shocked. After all, his talent was not that good.

“How much longer could this go on?” Eli closed his eyes again.

Three days passed by quickly.

Eli opened his eyes again and took another bottle of potion. At this time, he could already mobilize about ten times more nature elemental. It was simply terrifying.

“Let me see my limits.”

Eli grinned.

10 times was already the level of a third circle intermediate stage Mage. And he hadn’t even broken through yet.

However, this should be his last time taking the potion. The further he went, the slower his improvement became. He was almost at his limit.

At this time, the elemental vortex in the sky had expanded to 500 meters, which was more than a dozen times its original size. It could be said that it had turned from a small puddle to a large lake.

With the support of the huge elements, Eli was still in the process of breaking through.

Half a day later, Eli opened his eyes again, his gaze burning. At this time, the elements he could mobilize were fifteen times greater than before, a level that only a senior middle-stage third-circle mage could achieve.

As he opened his eyes, the elemental vortex in the sky slowly began to dissipate.

The third step was completed.

He had successfully broken through to his third circle.

At the year he was 630 years old, Eli finally broke through to the third circle.
