426 Increasing the Impact

On the other side.

After leaving the battlefield, the two Elis flew into the sky, fusing into one and returning to the Grassi Land!

Along the way, Eli activated the remaining power in his clone, causing the golden light to become even more intense. The light it emitted was like a golden sun.

And Eli’s goal was simple. Since he had already been exposed, he might as well maximize the benefits to obtain more faith!

!!

The blue sky was clear as a golden sun streaked across the sky without any restraint. He even passed by some cities or human settlements. The intense energy radiation also caught the attention of many Warlocks in the cities, and they raised their heads one by one.

Solo City was a city located at the edge of the Bloodline Tower.

Due to the dark clouds of war, the city was dead silent. Other than some Warlocks who were unable to leave, the rest of the Warlocks had already left the city!

City Lord Soni Suter stood on the wall with his body straight. He looked into the distance, but his eyes were filled with worry!

” I wonder if I’ll still be alive after everything is over! ” Soni sighed deeply.

Although he was at the back of the battlefield, he knew some things about this war.

” Three Radiant Suns and a top-notch second-class force have come out in full force! ” Every time he thought of this news, he felt a little suffocated!

The enemy was too strong!

They were so strong that the Bloodline Tower didn’t stand a chance. After all, the Bloodline Tower was only a Level 3 force at the moment!

” Of course, there’s also Sir Eli, but … ” Soni had once believed that he had absolute trust in Sir Eli, but this time, he could not be sure.

“So be it if I die!” Soni shook his head and prepared to leave the city wall. However, just as he turned around, a golden light suddenly appeared in his peripheral vision!

Soni immediately turned his head to look. In the sky, a ball of light that was like the sun was rapidly approaching Solo City!

“What’s that?” Soni immediately stared at the golden light as if he was facing a great enemy.

He wasn’t the only one who saw it. Although they were more than ten kilometers away, the golden light was strong, turning Solo City into a golden ocean. The remaining Warlocks and mortals also walked out and looked up at the golden sun!

Panic, nervousness, fear, the unknown, and all kinds of emotions quickly spread among the crowd. At this special moment, everyone’s emotions were more likely to intensify, and fear silently spread!

Soni flew into the sky and shouted, “Everyone, don’t panic!”

The words of the city lord seemed to have some effect. The city became a little more stable, and some guards began to maintain order.

Even so, everyone still looked up at the approaching sun.

“What exactly is it?” Soni was still as nervous as ever, but strangely, he didn’t seem to feel any danger.

As time passed, the golden sun arrived above Soni City and left, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

The Great Sun left just like that?!

Nothing happened?!

Soni was dumbfounded. He stared blankly at the departing sun with mixed feelings.

At this moment, a Warlock suddenly flew towards him. It was his trusted aide, and his trusted aide quickly said something to him. During this time, Soni’s mouth opened wider and wider, and the excitement on his face became more and more intense.

By the time the Warlock finished speaking, his blood was boiling, and tears were flowing out of his eyes.

He looked down at the curious crowd in the city and shouted with all his might, “There’s news from the front lines. Sir Eli has rushed to three battlefields and killed almost all of the Eight-Armed Naga’s celestials. Even the Eight-Armed Naga’s family, Jesse, is dead.

“That was Sir Eli!”

The vigorous voice spread like ripples. In the city, all the Warlocks in the city were stunned at first, then they cheered loudly!

It was unknown who started it, but the Warlocks in the city began to shout Eli’s name. In front of Eli’s statue in the city, there were many people kneeling!

Even Eli, who was far away in the Grassi Land, could sense the massive increase in faith!

And this wasn’t an exception. As Eli transformed into the sky and the news of the Bloodline Tower’s victory spread, a feast of faith belonging to Eli began!

Countless people were cheering in the city. Everyone was enjoying the joy of victory at the same time!

Eli won!

….

Elsewhere, after walking around the Bloodline Tower, Eli’s clone entered the Grassi Land.

Bloodline City!

Liliana was standing in a room in the wizard tower, watching the sky with her mouth wide open.

“What’s that? It seems to be flying towards the grassi land.” Liliana was confused.

Bang!

At this moment, the door suddenly opened, and a woman with seductive eyes and a mature peach-like appearance walked in.

“Teacher!” Liliana blinked her eyes and asked curiously, “Teacher, why did you come to Bloodline City at this time?”

Lobelia glared at her and said, “It’s all because of your good lord. This time, your partner is really going to be famous in the Western Regions!”

“Ah?” Liliana was confused.

“Hmph, it looks like you don’t know anything!” Lobelia couldn’t help but laugh. She sat on the sofa and said, “An hour ago, Eli first appeared at the Bloody Moon Lake battlefield. Then, the Radiant Suns of the Bloodline Tower used the spatial imprint to go there and fight Eli. ”

“Ah, what was the result?” Liliana asked anxiously.

“It seems that you still care a lot!” said Lobelia with a smile.

“Teacher, stop joking!” Liliana asked, “Is Sir Eli alright? ”

Seeing Liliana’s anxious look, Lobelia shook her head and sighed, ” You know the Eight-Armed Naga’s combat power very well, so he naturally lost. However, he self-destructed and killed one of the Radiant Suns while seriously injuring another! ”

Thud!

“Sir Eli!” She bit her pink lip, and her entire person seemed to have fallen into a row of darkness!

...

Seeing her student’s expression as if he had lost her mind, Lobelia raised her eyebrows. She realized that in this student’s heart, Eli was probably much heavier than she thought!

Forget it… It was better not to joke around.

Cough cough!

Lobelia coughed and said to Liliana, “I said that the Eli of this battlefield is dead, but I didn’t say that the real Eli is dead! ”

Liliana raised her head and stared at Lobelia. “Teacher, what do you mean?”

“Stand up.” Lobelia said angrily, ” All of us have underestimated this guy’s strength again. This guy, Eli, actually has the ability to split himself. The one that appeared on the battlefield was only one of his clones. Then, two Elis appeared on the other two battlefields at the same time. We just don’t know if there are real Elis among them. After dealing with the battlefield, they went to Bloody Moon Lake to provide support. Then, they killed Jesse and the other Radiant Sun and ended the war! ”

Liliana opened her mouth wide and stared at her own teacher.

Her teacher naturally wouldn’t lie to him, but if all of this was true, it would be too shocking!

Was Sir Eli that strong?

She was still at her lowest, but compared to the victory of the war, she was more happy that her lord was still alive.

It was good that he was aliveLiliana felt as if a huge stone had been lifted off her chest. Her heart was filled with happiness, and she had a strong urge to see Eli!

...

” Humph, wipe your tears. Come back to the headquarters of the Charm Mansion in the Western Region with me! ” said Lobelia.

” Hmph, I don’t know what kind of luck you have to have such a person with such potential on the list. I really regretted not going after him personally back then! ” Lobelia complained for a few seconds and then said, ” Now, the higher-ups have rated Eli’s level as the highest. Due to the good relationship between the two of you and the possible benefits that you may bring in the future, the director has decided to give you the resources to break through to the celestial realm! ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ah!”

Liliana felt her heart beating fast.

In fact, she had just broken through the limit of the third circle not long ago. She had thought that she would need to accumulate a few hundred years before she could have enough resources, but this time, it was too surprising!

“Go back and breakthrough first. The Bloodline Tower will be busy for a while. You can come back later!” said Lobelia. Then, she sighed and looked down at her beautiful figure. Then, she silently regretted it!

She should have done it herself back then!

Unfortunately, it was too late Perhaps it wasn’t too late. She could do it now. She just didn’t know that Eli liked the teacher-student pairing!

“Teacher, Eli is mine!” Liliana’s purple eyes stared at her.

Lobelia shrugged her shoulders helplessly, her fair chest undulating with the waves!

Fine, it seemed unlikely.
