238 The Man Favored by Fate

“It seems that there are no accidents!”

Outside the room, Jin Ji peeked inside through a transparent window.

Eli, whom he had brought in previously, was currently chatting happily with the manager Jin Huan. Jin Huan was all smiles and looked very happy. The man opposite him was the same.

His judgment this time was not wrong. This was indeed an honorable guest.

Suddenly, the two of them stood up. It seemed that they had finished talking. Jin Huan smiled and welcomed Eli. Jin Ji immediately stood up straight and opened the door for the two of them.

“Not bad, young man!”

Eli looked at the open door and glanced at Jin ji.

He had finished talking with Jin Ji about the matter. They had agreed to meet in ten days. At that time, he would come with him to the destination to deal with the demonic bear.

“Hahaha, this is a young man who just arrived. He’s really good!” Jin Huan laughed from the side and looked at Jin Ji with admiration.

He didn’t expect that a young man who had just arrived would help him solve a problem.

“He’s indeed not bad!”

As he passed through the corridor and went downstairs, Eli glanced at Jin Ji again before going downstairs.

“Did that Lord just glance at me?” Jin Ji, who was standing at the door, blinked and said with uncertainty.

For a moment, he had felt that Eli’s gaze was somewhat profound.

“Good job!” Before he could finish his thoughts, a large hand patted his shoulder. He looked up and saw that it was the store manager who had just sent Eli out.

“Manager, this is what I should do!” Jin Ji said respectfully.

“Hahaha, you’ve helped me solve a problem this time. Seeing that you’re about to advance, how about this? when the next batch of Golden cicada bloodline comes, you can buy one at half the price!” Jin Huan looked at Jin Ji.

“Thank you, my Lord!”

Jin Ji’s eyes lit up.

He had made the right bet!

..

“My Lord, do you need slaves? We have all kinds of things here!”

“No, no, no!”

After casually rejecting the enthusiasm of a slave trader, Eli walked aimlessly on the commercial Street, thinking about the young man just now.

“Jin Ji?”

… Eli pondered the name.

Only God knew what he had just seen!

The constant use of fate die, a spell that involved fate, and the accumulation of hundreds of years also caused some unique changes in Eli. For example, he could sometimes see the fate of some people!

It was a mysterious fate, but because this ability was still very weak unless the target’s fate was very strong, he would not have the chance to see it. Up until now, this ability had not been used.

However, the moment he glanced at Jin Ji just now …

With a quick glance, Eli saw that on Jin Ji’s head, the power of fate was being emitted. Threads of it coiled around and formed a Golden cicada that emitted a dazzling golden light.

That intense power of destiny amazed even Eli.

He was a person blessed by fate.

“Interesting, interesting!” Eli smiled and left the commercial Street.

In his opinion, if nothing went wrong, jin ji’s future might be pretty good. Eli didn’t mind investing a sum at this time, but he didn’t do anything just now.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to do it, it was just that the time wasn’t right.

Because at that time, Eli saw that there were still traces of black lines wrapped around jin ji’s fate.

That meant that something might happen to that guy soon.

Therefore, he left a trace of his aura on Jin Ji’s body, so that he could help him when he was in need.

In any case, his purpose for attending the silver Moon banquet this time was to take a stroll and relax, so he did not mind making an investment in advance.

..

Three days later!

Beside the silver Moon Lake.

The bright sunlight shone on the entire Lake, making it look like a mirror. Through the surface of the lake, one could even see the fish swimming under it.

On this beautiful Lakeside, two people were leisurely sitting on deck chairs. In front of them was a fishing rod, and above their heads was a parasol that blocked the sun.

“Herman, I don’t want to say this, but your fishing skills aren’t good enough!”

A skinny old man beside him stroked his beard as he turned to speak to him.

In front of the two of them, there were two buckets. The old man’s bucket was already filled with a few spirit fish, and it exuded a unique aura. On the other hand, Eli’s bucket was empty.

“Haha, maybe my skills aren’t good enough!”

Eli looked at the old man again and stretched his body comfortably.

Of course, he had to look relaxed. Eli had been fishing here for the past few days when he had nothing to do. He also got to know the old man, old John.

“Hahaha, let me tell you, there are techniques to fishing. I’m an experienced one, do you want me to teach you? ” Old John glanced at Eli and said smugly.

“Alright!” Eli sat up.

There was much precious fish in the silver Moon Lake, so there were many people fishing, but Eli didn’t know how to fish so he almost didn’t catch any.

...

“Hey, there’s a lot of knowledge in this. Come, come, come, let me tell you!” The old man’s face bloomed with a smile as he began to teach Eli.

“Heh. You’re barely qualified to be teaching others!”

At this moment, a voice was heard.

“Who is it?” The old man’s expression changed. He looked to the side and saw a middle-aged man. At this time, there were more than a dozen fish swimming in the bucket. It was full, and he was looking at them with a smug expression.

Old John’s face darkened, and in an instant, an aura was released. Second circle.

The middle-aged man’s eyes widened. Realizing that he had caused trouble, he immediately lowered his head and stopped talking.

“Hmph!”

Old John glanced at him and turned back to look at Eli. At this time, he was still basking in the sun, as if he didn’t see anything.

This was just an interlude. Following that, he began to talk to Eli about his experience in fishing. Eli was also very interested, and the two of them chatted as they drank tea.

“This is life!” Eli felt a sense of relief.

Suddenly, Eli felt his vision go black. He looked up and saw an alchemy spaceship flying towards him from afar.

...

“That’s the Holy tower!” Old John explained to Eli.

Eli looked over. The bloodline tower had arrived earlier, and there were still quite a few forces that had yet to arrive.

At this time, the alchemy ship was already very close and was slowly landing on the side of the silver Moon Lake.

As the spaceship landed, warlocks jumped down from it one by one.

There were only a few dozen people, and the leader was a peak late-stage third-circle Warlock. He wore a white Magus robe and had a tall figure. His eyes were round as he walked in front with large strides.

He glanced at them with a look of disdain and left.

Eli only cast a glance at him and ignored him.

Fishing was still the happiest!

“sigh, once the Holy tower is here, the remaining ones will probably be here soon!”

John sighed. He was also a casual player, so he didn’t care much about these things.

“He’s taken the bait!”

Suddenly, John Heard a cry and turned around. At this moment, Eli’s rod was bent, and the fishing line was taut as if he was hanging something huge.

John’s eyes widened.

A big fish broke out of the water. It was three to four meters in size, and there were still splashes on its body. Then, it crashed heavily on the grass in front of Eli.

John’s eyes widened as he looked at the fish. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This is a silver Dragonfish. It’s so big. I’m afraid it’s worth two or three thousand magic stones!”

He never expected that the empty-handed Eli just now would be so lucky.

He looked at his small fish and closed his eyes.

The middle-aged Warlock turned his head and saw this scene. He blinked and sucked in a cold breath.

“Beginner’s luck!” His lips trembled as he kept repeating this sentence.

Other than him, the other people in the distance also looked over with their eyes wide open. At this moment, regardless of their strength, they all looked at Eli with envy.

Fishing had nothing to do with strength.
