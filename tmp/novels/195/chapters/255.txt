256 45 Years

Forty-five years later!

“Nina, slow down!”

In a Valley behind the irises’ campsite, Grimm looked ahead with a smile. He looked to be in his thirties or forties, with a protruding belly and slight hair loss.

On the grass not far away, a little girl was running happily. Her laughter was as clear as a bronze bell, and her white feet were stepping on the grass.

!!

“Such days are so good!” Grimm revealed a smile.

Feeling the aura of a first-circle mage, he revealed a satisfied smile.

He was already a first-circle mage. He even met his current wife twenty years ago and had a daughter. After that, he was usually in charge of the preparation work for Eli’s experiment.

As for the revenge thing …

“Ah, I was young back then!” Grimm sighed and shook his head.

Isn’t it better to live a normal life?

The pursuit of the truth was too tiring, so it was better to forget it.

He was no longer a seven or eight-year-old child!

Bang! Bang!

Suddenly, he heard a voice from afar.

He turned around and saw the door of the laboratory slowly opening.

Grimm’s eyes lit up, and he immediately ran over.

The door opened, and Eli walked out.

“My Lord!” Said Grimm respectfully.

“Yes, your daughter is much bigger than the last time I saw her!” Eli nodded and sighed as he looked at the little girl not far away.

Forty-five years ago, Grimm was still a little boy. Forty-five years later, he was already a father of a child.

Time was a terrifying thing!

“Hehe!” Hearing Eli’s praise, Grimm scratched his head and was a little happy.

“I still remember the Grand words you once said!” Eli teased.

“Milord, please don’t mention this matter!” Grimm’s face turned red, and he pouted. “In fact, I might have read too many stories about Knights and mages at that time!”

“Hahahaha!”

Eli laughed heartily.

Grimm’s face had already turned red, and he no longer spoke. He only muttered, “How can you take a child’s grumblings seriously?”

“Grandpa Roland!” At this moment, the little girl saw Eli coming out and ran over.

“Hahaha, little Nina!” Eli rubbed the girl’s head and picked her up.

With the girl in his arms, Eli walked toward the other parts of the arcane realm.

As a third-circle warlock, the existence of the secret plane was no longer a big deal to him, so Grimm usually stayed in the secret plane.

As they walked, Grimm reported to him what had happened over the years.

“Ever since the heart of the darkness started fighting with the Holy tower, there would be a large-scale battle every year. The territorial battle has also been ongoing, and the entire central region is in chaos.

“20 years ago, the Holy tower had been almost defeated by the heart of darkness.

“But what no one expected was that a warlock of the Holy tower had also silently become a peak third circle warlock with the Holy tower’s resources. Together with another peak third circle warlock, they launched a counterattack.

“The situation changed all of a sudden, but Sergei was also strong enough to survive.

“What was even more unexpected was that Sergei managed to kill one of the two peak third-circle warlocks, which changed the situation again.

“The attack and defense were reversed!

“The heart of the darkness gained the upper hand again.

However, the strange thing was that the Holy tower seemed to have received help from a certain force. It seemed to be a force from the North. With their help, they could even suppress the heart of darkness!

“However, the heart of darkness wasn’t just for show. At this time, they took over the Harpy school, which had always been neutral. As this force joined the heart of darkness, everything changed.

“Then, the heart of darkness was suppressing the Holy tower.

“The Holy tower was retreating!

“If there aren’t any major changes, the Holy tower’s failure might just be a matter of time!”

Grimm told Eli about all the things that had happened in the past few decades.

“I see!”

Eli nodded.

It seemed that both forces had a lot of trump cards. Sergei was indeed extraordinarily strong. He could kill one of the two peak third-circle Masters. He must be very strong among the peak third-circle Masters.

Their foundations weren’t bad.

“Sergei is strong. He should be stronger than me!” Eli sensed his state.

His current mental power was about 280 points, which was about 20 points higher than before. However, he was still far from the 330 points required for a third-circle late-stage.

But fortunately, his combat strength had nothing to do with this.

At this moment, he could mobilize nearly 60 times the elemental power in his body.

He was completely comparable to a normal late-stage or even some peak third-circle Warlock, but he was still a little weaker than Sergei. The limit of third-circle was obviously not an ordinary limit!

...

However, he wouldn’t fight with this guy in the short term.

At the very least, he had to wait until the war was over.

He also knew why Sergei didn’t attack the bloodlines tower forty years ago. He didn’t expect that it was because of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce.

Under the influence of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, the bloodline tower was almost unaffected by the war. They had lived through these years in peace. Vivika had grown very quickly and had reached the middle stage more than a decade ago.

As for Nikola, he also lived in the forest behind the bloodline tower.

And the White Tower.

Eli had almost forgotten about this faction.

The White Tower had always been developing in the South, but it might not be very good. Up until now, there were no third-circle warlocks. They were currently attached to the bloodline tower, and Eli also had some means to indirectly control this force.

He rarely came into direct contact with the White Tower.

Through Vivika, he was able to control the bloodlines tower, which in turn controlled the White Tower and other small forces below, providing a steady stream of resources for Eli.

This would greatly reduce his presence!

...

It was the same for the irises camp. Catarina had died of life-force exhaustion ten years ago, and another wizard was in charge of it. He was under the control of Eli, who could provide some help and support.

At this moment, Eli finally understood why the great mages of the past world wanted to build their own forces. It was not because they were not strong enough but because they needed more resources.

It was very difficult to support a Mage who was getting stronger and stronger with just one person’s resources.

Every powerful Mage had a huge reserve of support.

Mages were like trees, and these forces were like the roots. They depended on each other and developed together.

It was the same for Eli, but he just had more choices. At most, he would give up on the roots and let him start growing again from a sapling, and then regrow!

This was the advantage of an immortal!

Therefore, when it was necessary, if he encountered danger that he could not resist, he would still put his own life as the first priority and abandon everything else.

“But if the Holy tower is destroyed, it will be troublesome!”

That was what he thought, but there were some things that Eli couldn’t give up so easily.

After all, doing it all over again would be very time consuming and not worth it. Simply relying on hiding for life was not good either.

Then it would be hard to say if it was Eli who controlled immortality or immortality who controlled Eli.

Mages had to have their own will.

“Let nature take its course!” In the end, Eli could only sigh.

At this moment, they had also arrived at an open space.

Hill was growing here!

Looking at Hill, who seemed to be in a dream, a smile appeared on Eli’s face.

He could feel that in a few decades at most, Hill would definitely grow into a second circle.

Seeing that Eli and the others had arrived, Hill also extended his branches to approach them.

Nina giggled in Eli’s arms.

Grimm, who was behind him, sighed.

Time seemed to have changed a lot, but his Lord had not changed much.

Time forced the mages to move fast, but his lordship was indeed at ease.

“Is this what a real wizard is like? confident and calm, with only the pursuit of the truth in his eyes!” He recalled his own thoughts and felt a little emotional.

After taking a break, Eli returned to the laboratory. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He still had an experiment to do!
