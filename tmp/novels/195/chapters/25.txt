Chapter 26: Leave

Translator: Lonelytree

“You have a good student.”

In the huge living room, count Gimori and scholar Clement sat opposite each other, with Eli standing on the side.

The count was holding a glass of red grape wine in his hand and looking at Eli in admiration.

“Yeah, Eli is indeed a studious student, but I didn’t expect him to have such an experience in taming horses.” Scholar Clement also smiled, looking at Eli in relief.

With Eli’s help, he successfully kept the count’s donations in the library, solving the salary problem of dozens of people at the bottom of the library. It was not only a good thing for the library, but it was also a good thing for him.

He felt that he had to reward Eli well when he got back.

“Eli, you should sit too!” Seeing that Eli was still standing, the count beckoned him to sit down.

“no, Sir count. I’d better stand.” Eli smiled and refused.

Other than being polite, it was also good for him to observe the Count more carefully from a distance.

If one were to look closely at Eli’s eyes, one would be able to see that mysterious sorcery was being used in the depths of his eyes, and invisible mental strength was collecting the Count’s data.

This was the first time he observed a Grand Knight.

He had observed low, intermediate, and high Knights and found that there was no essential difference between them. It was nothing more than an increase in vitality and a strengthening of the physique.

However, the count, a Grand Knight, seemed to be a little different.

Eli observed through the magic that the Earl’s body had definitely experienced the infiltration of elements. Traces of elements had been imbued into his flesh and tissues. This not only allowed him to explode with power that exceeded that of an Elite Knight, but if Eli was not wrong, a Grand Knight should have the power to use elements.

It might be crude, but it could be used.

This was probably the reason why Saleen Metatrin was impressed by some knights.

“What a polite child!” The Count nodded and thought of his own unlucky child.

But what he didn’t know was that the polite child he was talking about had almost scanned his entire being.

The count and scholar Clement exchanged pleasantries for a long time before he remembered what he had to do. He smiled and asked Eli, “Well, I have a batch of wild horses from the Semi plateau that has not been tamed. I want you to help me tame them. Is that okay? ” he asked.

Eli was a little hesitant.

“ten silver tars for one horse, so there should be around fifty horses in total.” The count said with a smile.

One horse had ten taels, so fifty horses would be five hundred silver taels, which was equivalent to five gold taels. It was equivalent to about eight years of Eli’s salary, enough for him to carry out a few experiments.

“Your Excellency, I am willing.” Eli agreed easily.

He had no reason to reject the offer of making money and building a relationship with a count.

“Alright!” The count patted the sofa and laughed happily. The servants served tea and desserts, and Eli would reply occasionally. They drank tea and ate cake, and Clement and the Earl had a good conversation.

Soon, the sun slowly set, and dusk was approaching.

After the count and Eli agreed on a time, Eli left with Clement.

When they turned a corner, they happened to pass by Rias’ group.

They had just finished hunting, and most of them looked a little messy. Some of them had blood and mud on them, making them look extremely dirty.

Immediately, Eli was a little glad that he had been called away by the count.

Hunting?

Was that more comfortable than drinking tea?

“What did you talk to my father about, Eli?” Rias asked curiously as she walked over.

“Children shouldn’t ask about adult matters!” That one sentence drove Rias completely mad.

“Hmph, fine, I won’t ask you. I’ll ask him myself.” Rias snorted and left.

“Eli, I’m looking forward to meeting you next time.” Alex also walked past him with a smile on his face, but the dirt on his face made him appear rather unsightly.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

Many other nobles also greeted him, their attitudes completely different from when they first saw him in the banquet hall. This included Klein, the noble son who looked down on him.

“It seems like you’re quite popular!” After everyone left, scholar Clement said with a smile.

“Maybe I’m more handsome.” Said Eli as he touched his face.

Not too far away, Kurt was already waiting for them in the carriage. Scholar Clement and Eli got on the carriage and left Moore Manor.

Sitting in the carriage, Eli looked at the scenery outside the window, taking stock of the things that had happened and the rewards he had gained on this trip.

He received the goodwill of many nobles at the ball. He stopped the red-haired man from taming the wild horse and successfully received an investment. The most important thing was the order from the count, which finally allowed him to start the production of the potion.

It was a perfect day.

A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

“Why do I feel like we’ve forgotten something?” As the carriage moved on, Kurt, who was sitting beside Eli, suddenly spoke up.

Eli looked at the senior, and in just a moment, he understood what he meant.

“Argh! Why did you leave me behind!”

At this moment, in the Moore Manor, Herman had just changed his clothes. He looked at the setting sun and shed tears of grief.

...

Just as Eli and the others were walking back.

The Imperial Knight Academy, in the principal’s office.

“Didn’t you get this donation?” On the luxurious sofa sat a middle-aged man with half-gray hair and simple clothes. In front of him stood an old man and a red-haired man. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Tell me, what happened?” The middle-aged man held a pen in his hand as he asked the two of them.

Then, the two of them told him what they had seen.

“What, you guys actually lost to a scholar in horse training? No, he’s not even a scholar! Do you think you guys are suitable to be part of the Imperial Knight Academy? And you, you’re about to become an intermediate Knight, yet you can’t even tame a mixed-blood horse!” The principal was so angry that he started cursing.

“principal, as you know, low-level mixed-blood magical beasts can’t use elemental power. I...” the red-haired young man said through gritted teeth, feeling wronged.

“Okay, okay, okay. Don’t deny your mistake, but this is indeed a little against the norm.” The principal also frowned, but he couldn’t think of a reason.

Moreover, from the red-haired student’s words, he also knew that he had tamed the horse, but the horse suddenly went out of control. This was undoubtedly a little suspicious.

‘Could it be that someone had affected the wild horse?

‘But how could that be possible?’ even Grand Knights could only affect their inner strength and not the outside world.

The red-haired man was also thinking. He thought of the man who had tamed the wild horse so easily, but then he shook his head. How could a scholar from the library be able to influence the mixed-blood horse so much?

“fine, stop finding excuses. From today onwards, you will have three additional lessons in horse riding every week!” In the end, the principal decided to add more classes to the Knight Academy, which was already full.

As for where it would be added to, it would naturally be within their break time.

“Young people should practice more. It’s fine as long as you have enough rest time.” The principal decided to use this opportunity to rectify the school’s spirit.

The same thing happened in the mystic academy, but they had to increase their knowledge of potions.
