341 Hydra and Nikola

On the surface of the sea, the corpse of a huge deep-sea octopus floated on the surface of the sea like a huge island. In the sky, Eli looked down at this scene from above.

“Such a huge corpse should be enough for Hydra and Nikola to advance.” Eli’s gaze was calm.

Even though Eli had improved tremendously over the years, Hydra and Nikola did not improve much. They were both at the peak of the third circle.

Hydra was still fine. It was a half-elemental creature created by Eli, and it was also a Chimera, so there was no need to worry about its lifespan. However, Nikola’s situation had not been too good these years. His mental power had been seriously drained. If he weren’t the leader of the marine observation department and got to kill over the years, he would have been gone a long time ago.

“Once they’ve all reached the celestial realm, I’ll have more assurance in the central continent.” Eli’s thoughts were simple.

He hoped that he would be of more help when he went to the central continent.

“I wonder what the situation is like in the central continent.”

It had been a long time since Eli had contacted anyone from the central continent, but he had some info from Aisha.

It was said that warlocks nowadays had given up on meditation techniques when they were still warlock apprentices and had begun to get used to their bloodlines to cultivate. It could be said that instead of being called warlocks, Eli preferred to call them bloodline harvesters.

Other than their bloodline, they had nothing else.

This was a tragedy.

After all, no matter how powerful the magical beasts were, they were still not the source of mages’ power. They would dig out the essence of their power, but now, warlocks were directly using the power of their bloodlines without much thought. This completely lowered the status of warlocks.

“And Jin Ji. This guy seems to be half in charge of the Western Region.” This man left a deep impression on Eli.

However, ever since Eli had settled on Mercury Island, they had had very little contact.

Especially in the last few hundred years.

However, Eli was still looking forward to the two of them meeting. After all, Jin Ji was a rich man.

However, there was no point in thinking about this. He could just take his time.

Eli looked at the huge corpse, and waves suddenly appeared behind the corpse, pushing the huge octopus corpse forward.

As Eli controlled the direction, he summoned Hydra and Nikola.

Its huge body advanced towards Mercury Island.

…..

On Mercury Island.

Hydra was sitting on the mountain peak. Its 100-meter-long body did not grow much over the years. At this moment, it was sleeping with its eyes closed.

At the foot of the mountain, Doggo was still tinkering with the machine, and he kept gesturing. After years of hard work, his combat power had reached the third circle.

Suddenly, he seemed to have heard something, and he raised his head to look into the distance.

Not far from Mercury Island, a huge octopus was moving in this direction. Its body was not much different from Mercury Island, and its height was still higher than the mountain on the island.

“What kind of creature is this?” Doggo was shocked. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He seemed to have never thought that such a thing would happen here.

In an instant, he jumped up and ran towards the wizard Tower. As he ran, he shouted, ” Eli, something big has happened. There are enemies, very, very strong enemies.”

However, before he could run, he found that the octopus was getting closer.

Doggo was even more afraid.

But when he turned around, he was stunned.

“What are you shouting for? this octopus is already dead. ” Eli shot it a glance.

Doggo was dumbfounded.

When he looked at the huge corpse in the distance, he realized that it really didn’t seem to have any life aura.

“Eli, you’re improving so quickly!” Doggo’s mechanical eyes flickered in surprise.

Eli ignored him.

In the distance, Hydra opened its drowsy eyes and flew toward Eli.

At this time, a figure appeared on the sea’s surface, and Nikola was flying in their direction.

Nikola quickly moved forward and was shocked to see the huge body, but he soon found that it was a dead body, but the soul had not completely dissipated.

He had also come to Mercury Island.

“My Lord!” Nikola said respectfully to Eli.

“You are all here.” Seeing that both Hydra and Nicholas were here, Eli pointed at the corpses in the distance and said, “That’s the corpse of a four-circle creature. Nikola devoured the flesh and you devoured the soul. It should be enough for you to advance.”

Hearing this, Nikola’s eyes lit up.

In fact, he was already very close to the celestial, only one step away, but he had been unable to do anything about this step.

On the other hand, Hydra, who was standing at the side, did not think too much about it. It was only drooling as it looked at the huge corpse, and its three pairs of eyes were filled with desire.

“Go,” Eli laughed.

In the next second, Hydra and Nikola rushed toward the corpses in the distance, leaving Doggo, who was envious, at the side.

“Eli, when can you get me to the fourth ring too?!” Doggo said.

“Didn’t you build a body in the central continent? We’ll probably be there in a hundred years.” Eli replied,

“What? Have you finally decided to leave?” Doggo’s eyes lit up. He had been waiting for this sentence for more than a thousand years.

He still remembered that more than a thousand years ago, Eli had told him that it would be soon, but he had waited until now. He was almost in despair.

Therefore, when he heard that it would take a hundred years, he felt that he had finally made it.

A hundred years was really short!

...

Looking at Doggo’s complicated emotions, the corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. This silly dog had indeed become silly.

…..

On the other side.

After Hydra and Nikola devoured the flesh and soul of the deep-sea octopus, they fell into a deep sleep on Mercury Island.

A month later.

A huge soul fluctuation suddenly burst out somewhere on Mercury Island, and a huge soul body rose up, surrounded by countless gray dead souls.

On the other hand, Eli was standing in the wizard Tower, watching this scene.

after a short while, Nikola flew in his direction. His soul was at least a dozen times larger than before, and its density was much higher. The aura he exuded had reached the fourth circle.

“My Lord, I’ve broken through,” Nikola came to Eli’s side and immediately withdrew his aura.

Compared to Eli, he was still lacking.

“Okay, go and stabilize it. Call me if you need anything.” Eli nodded.

...

“Yes!” Nikola left in excitement.

One had to know that even in his previous life, he had never broken through to the celestial level. If it weren’t for the fact that Eli would occasionally give him some souls, as well as this great supplement, it would have been almost impossible for him to break through.

It was extremely difficult for an undead to break through.

‘I’ll have to be loyal to My Lord in the future.’

Watching Nikola leave, Eli also looked at the huge mountain not far away, where Hydra was also undergoing a transformation.

Another month passed.

As Hydra opened its eyes, the three heads let out a long hiss and a new head appeared. This head’s eyes were green, and his body grew rapidly. In the blink of an eye, he had grown to a thousand feet. The original mountain peak could not bear him anymore.

As soon as it broke through, Hydra immediately flew into the sky. Countless storms were wrapped around its body, just like a dragon riding on the clouds.

“It seems that the new element is wind.”

Eli also appeared outside the Mage Tower and looked at Hydra.

His subordinates had almost all reached the celestial realm.

Meanwhile, Hydra saw that Eli was also flying towards him, but in the process, he was constantly shrinking until he was only a few dozen meters in size.

“It looks like you can control your size freely now.” Eli touched Hydra’s head.

“let’s go to the laboratory. I need to do a comprehensive test.” Eli said in a low voice as he flew towards the laboratory not far away.

The Hydra’s body shrunk and quickly followed.
