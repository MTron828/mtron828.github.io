247 Crushing

“Who is it?”

The four people who first discovered Eli was above the deep pit.

A few of them frowned at the sudden appearance of Eli.

An unfamiliar third-circle warlock?

!!

Who was this person? Although there were not many people who came to the ruins, they were all high-level people from many forces. Although they might not be familiar with each other, they must have met before.

However, the person who had suddenly appeared from the forest was a complete stranger.

“Who are you? Where are you from?”

The three-circle warlock belonging to the heart of the darkness stared at Eli and took a step forward.

“From the outside!”

“Outside?”

The Warlock was stunned. How could it be outside? The outside world had been sealed off by a barrier. Could it be … Not good!

He immediately raised his head and looked at the sky. The barrier was still there!

“It was really scary.” The Warlock took a deep breath and continued, “Which force do you belong to? What is your purpose? I’ve never seen you before!”

“I’m a free man!” Eli smiled and slowly walked out of the forest. “As for the purpose, it’s naturally to save people!”

As soon as they got out of the forest, Vivika and Udo, who were in the deep pit not far away, finally saw the people who had arrived. They both sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Teacher!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“My benefactor!”

Vivika and Udo shouted in surprise at the same time. They did not understand why Eli, who was originally in Silvermoon town, would appear here. Vivika did not know about Udo’s tip-off, and Udo did not know about Vivika’s connection to Eli’s brand.

The two of them were in an even more wonderful mood!

The situation was ever-changing.

“could it be that teacher has been following me all this time? ” Vivika’s thoughts were simple. After all, she didn’t tell her teacher about the danger here. Even if she had been detected with his wand, it would have been too late.

‘It turns out that teacher has been behind me all this time!’

Vivika pursed her lips, feeling extremely touched!

“My benefactor!”

On the other side, Udo also took a deep breath.

Even though they didn’t understand how Eli had come all the way here, there was no doubt that he was there. Perhaps they still wouldn’t be able to defeat the opposing team, but at least they would have the power to protect themselves.

Besides, Eli must’ve come in from the outside, so they must’ve had a way out.

“Udo, this is the best decision you’ve made today.” He revealed a smile.

“Udo, why are you smiling like an idiot?” Not far away, the three-ring early-stage woman looked at Udo and sneered, “He’s just an early phase third-circle warlock. Don’t tell me you think the outcome will change. You deserve to die!”

“Hmph!”

Udo didn’t pay attention to it. Initial stage? Which early-stage warlock could instantly kill a third-circle mid-stage earth demon bear? Eli must have been in disguise. He was at least a peak mid-stage sorcerer.

However, killing these three mid-stage third-circle warlocks would be difficult. However, it shouldn’t be a problem if they were there to assist Eli.

“Hmph, I’ll go test this guy first!”

On the other side.

The heart of the darkness warlock spoke to the three of them, then slowly walked towards Eli.

As he stepped on the shattered stone ground, streams of moonlight-like power wrapped around his body. He looked at Eli and let out a deep roar.

In an instant, the moonlight penetrated his body, and his entire body began to swell. In the blink of an eye, he grew from two meters to about four meters tall. Instantly, his muscles bulged, and four bone spikes protruded from the depths of his palms!

“Night demonic Wolf, moonlight transformation!”

Udo said in shock.

The night demonic Wolf controlled the power of moonlight. It could store moonlight in its body in advance and then burst out with a powerful attack. It was the most powerful technique of the night demonic Wolf.

“he’s too cunning. He clearly said he didn’t care, but he still used his most powerful means!” Vivika looked at Eli worriedly.

“Oh, it’s over!”

“What a pity!”

The other people who knew the Warlock also shook their heads and looked at Eli with pity.

An early-stage third-circle warlock wouldn’t have the slightest chance to resist this kind of power.

“I haven’t used it in a long time!” The standing Warlock let out a sinister smile, then looked at Eli who was not far away.

With just a stomp of his foot, a large crater instantly appeared. At the same time, his body shot toward Eli like a cannonball, and there was even a tempestuous wave of air surrounding his body!

“Go to hell!”

The Warlock let out a terrifying roar and waved his arm at Eli.

Bang! Bang!

The huge wave of air obscured everyone’s vision. The others only heard a huge explosion and then nothing else. There was silence.

“It’s over?”

Vivika blinked.

“It can’t be, right? our benefactor should be fine, right?” Udo’s body was trembling slightly. Such a powerful attack, even Eli would probably not have survived.

...

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, what a pity!” The female warlock crossed her arms in front of her chest and sneered.

If she were to take this attack head-on, she would probably die in less than a second. However, the guy in front of her was not any better.

She thought he would be a little more powerful if he were here to save someone.

The result was nothing more than this!

“Since it’s over, it’s time to get rid of Vivika and Udo!” She said.

The remaining two mid-stage warlocks no longer cared about this. They looked coldly at the two people in the deep pit. One of them started moving, and a flash of lightning flew toward Vivika.

Because it was a sudden attack, and Vivika was also seriously injured, she did not react in time.

However, it was only for an instant. A black-light shot out of the mist like a lightning bolt. Like a small snake, it collided with the lightning bolt. Then, under the Warlock’s dumbfounded gaze, it swallowed the lightning bolt and returned to the mist.

“What is that?” The Warlock was dumbfounded.

“I think you should be more concerned about where this attack came from.”

The Warlock at the side seemed to have suddenly realized that something was wrong. He looked at the mist with a serious expression!

...

As time passed, the smoke slowly dispersed.

The scene inside was also reflected in everyone’s eyes.

“How is this possible?” The female Warlock was the first to exclaim in surprise.

The others also looked as if they had seen a ghost.

In the core of the smoke, a huge figure appeared. It was the moonlit night Wolf Warlock, but unlike a minute ago, his body had been penetrated.

A shadow as large as a tree ran through his body, and the shadow that extended out was like a branch that ran through every part of his body. His blood was even flowing on it!

Meanwhile, Eli, who was supposed to be dead, was just standing there, as calm as he was when he came.

In an instant, the backs of the three of them were drenched in a cold sweat. They also understood why there was no sound.

This was because the warlock from the heart of darkness, who was at the middle stage of his third circle, was killed by Eli in an instant. He didn’t even have the chance to let out a roar because his internal organs were already shattered, let alone his throat!

They looked at this hideous scene!

The three warlocks looked at each other and then turned their heads at the same time.

Run!

There was no doubt that the person in front of him was a terrifying enemy.

They had been tricked. What third circle early stage? this was definitely a third circle late stage or even a peak Warlock. How sinister!

Looking at the three of them running away in different directions, Eli just took a step forward.

Instantly, the ground under their feet seemed to be the mouth of an underwater spring. Countless shadows surged out from it. A shadow wave appeared in the blink of an eye, along with countless shadow snakes. The wave and the shadow snakes pounced at the three of them at the same time.

There was no resistance, no struggle.

The moment the wave and the shadow snake touched the three of them, they struggled, but it was useless. In just a few seconds, the three of them fell into darkness.

Three middle-stage third-circle warlocks and one early-stage third-circle warlock, dead!

Hiss!

Not far away, Udo sucked in a cold breath.

A second ago, the Warlock had struck them with a bolt of lightning, and the next second, the four of them were dead.

Did it have to be so exciting?

Moreover, his benefactor was too strong. At this moment, he was sure that this person was at least a late-stage third-circle Warlock, and he wasn’t the weakest among the third-circle warlocks.

“Teacher!”

Vivika was also stunned!

It seemed like … His teacher was much stronger than he was 150 years ago.

He was only at the early stage of the third circle at that time. It was really too much!

After eliminating the four of them, Vivika and Udo immediately ran toward Eli.

“Teacher!”

“My Lord!”

The two of them shouted, but to their surprise, Eli ignored them and looked into the distance.

They also looked over.

In the sky, a late-stage third-circle warlock was flying in their direction!
