Golden Cicada Merchant Association!

In a villa in the resplendent Western Region headquarters, a man stared at a piece of paper in front of him.

The man was wearing a gorgeous robe made of golden silk and a crown inlaid with many gems. His face was round and full of flesh, and his eyes were faintly golden.

The man’s name was Apland Madison. He was the second vice president of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce in the Western Region after Jin Ji. He controlled half of the affairs in the Western Region!

“He actually won?” Apland closed his eyes in pain.

If there were anyone who wanted the Bloodline Tower to die, he would definitely be one of them.

A few decades ago, Jin Ji left the Western Regions. At that time, he felt that this was the best time for him to surpass Jin Ji. However, the Bloodline Tower suddenly appeared, relying on unique potions and some creations to benefit Jin Ji’s side. It had even made up for the disadvantage of Jin Ji’s departure, and it had even made him feel immense pressure!

In fact, he also wanted to attack the Bloodline Tower, but he realized that he didn’t have the strength to do so. After all, he was just a merchant.

That was why he was extremely happy when the Akasha Family made their move 20 years ago. However, whenever he thought about how the Bloodline Tower had won in the end, he would feel a sense of hatred.

He felt regretful, but there was nothing he could do.

Just like that, more than twenty years passed. He received news from the Eight-Armed Naga that they were going to attack the Bloodline Tower!

He was really happy. After all, the Eight-Armed Naga Family was a powerful force. The Bloodline Tower was definitely not their match!

Just like that, he waited with anticipation. Then, he received the news of the Bloodline Tower’s victory.

“Eli, how can this person be so strong? He even f * cking used a doppelganger? Is this what a Warlock should do?” Apland leaned back on the chair weakly, and the chair let out a desperate cry!

Attacking Eli?

Sorry, he really didn’t have the courage. Or rather, he couldn’t find enough experts.

The Golden Cicada Merchant Association was actually only a second-class force in the Western Region, and Eli had just destroyed a complete second-class top-notch force!

Sigh!

Thinking of this, he sighed in despair. He had no choice. He really had no choice.

” Fortunately, it’s only in terms of potions, and the supply of potions is very limited! ” Apland sighed.

That small number of people was still unable to defeat him!

He didn’t believe that the Bloodline Tower had the ability to mass-produce potions. This was something that even those plant-based bloodlines couldn’t do!

Thinking of this, Apland pulled himself together again.

“Good luck!” Apland clenched his fists to encourage him, but he was even more resentful of Eli!

Where the f * ck did he come from?

….

The Amina Family!

In the temple, many warlocks of the Amina family had gathered.

“What? The Lord won?” Selona’s mouth was wide open. He couldn’t believe what he had just heard!

“Yes!” Simon nodded and said to Salona, “And if my lord knew the details of the war, I’m afraid you would be even more surprised!”

“Oh?” Selona raised his head and looked at Simon. His gaze seemed to be saying, ‘Do you think I, your patriarch, have never seen the world?’

“What do you mean?” Selona looked at Simon with disdain. He felt that his imagination was big enough.

A few minutes later.

Selona, “…”

His mouth was wide open, and his eyes were wide open.

CloneExplosionThree battlefields

He maintained this expression for a full minute before he coughed and said proudly, “I expected this.”

He sighed in his heart. Master is amazing.

“Eh?”

Everyone pursed their lips and looked at Selona.

…..

Holy Tower!

At Luo Ye’s Mage Tower!

He was sitting on a chair, listening to the Warlock in front of him describe the details and outcome of the war.

After he finished speaking, he took a deep breath and looked out of the tower.

After a few minutes, he finally expressed his opinion.

“How amazing.”

He had never thought that the Bloodline Tower would win. After all, their opponent was the Eight-Armed Naga Family, a famous and powerful family among the Level 2 Families. Who would have thought that they would be defeated by the Bloodline Tower, or more accurately, by Eli?

“What an outrageous Warlock!” Luo Ye sighed deeply. This Herman disciple from the West Coast was really strong, and his methods were really f * cking evil!

Clone?

Was this an ability that a dragon bloodline should have?

Moreover, wasn’t his combat strength too exaggerated? A clone could fight three Radiant Suns and even kill one in the end.

” Sir, other than this news, the Pagoda Master has another order! ” At this moment, the Warlock at the side spoke.

“What is it?” Luo Ye raised his head and asked curiously.

...

” Pagoda Master wants you to prepare and pay a visit to our new neighbor! ” The Warlock said respectfully.

“Oh?” Luo Ye had a strange expression on his face, but then he smiled!

To see Eli?

He had long wanted to meet him. He wanted to see what kind of Warlock he was.

And how did Herman nurture such a student?

He was looking forward to this meeting!

…

Swamps of Gloom!

The dim candlelight burned silently, barely illuminating the space inside the castle.

There were only two people in the castle at the moment. One of them was an old man wearing a dark Eight-Armed Naga robe, while the other was wearing a pure black robe and a demon mask!

“I failed!” At this moment, the old man leaned back in his chair with a face full of despair, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.

...

Although the Eight-Armed Naga had sent all of its members to the outside world this time, it would definitely leave behind some high-end combat power. The old man was one of them. He was a peak Radiant Moon Warlock and Jess’s only trusted aide. If anything happened, he could temporarily act as the acting patriarch to handle matters.

Today was his first day as the acting family head, but this identity did not make him feel at ease. Instead, it was like a sharp sword floating above his head.

However, there was still hope. As long as the faction represented by the Warlock beside them was willing to help them, there was still hope.

He immediately sat up and looked at the Warlock wearing the devil mask. He gritted his teeth and said, “Tuman Slamu, the decline of our Bloodline Land is directly related to you. The Heart of the Abyss must be responsible for this matter.”

“Oh?” A hoarse voice came from under the mask. The Warlock opposite him raised his head, and two blood-red eyes lit up in his eye sockets.

He looked at the old man with a hint of mockery in his eyes.”Of course, we will take responsibility for this matter. After all, this matter can’t be exposed to the public. Therefore, I went to your family’s Bloodline Land early this morning to clean up the traces there. I guarantee that the Bloodline Tower won’t find anything!”

“What?!” The old man suddenly stood up and stared at the Masked Warlock, his body trembling.

“How could you do this?”

“I’m sorry, this is a must. Just like you said, we have to be responsible. Naturally, I have to be responsible for cleaning things up!” The Masked Warlock shrugged his shoulders helplessly, his eyes fixed on the old man!

Looking at the devil-like eyes, the old man’s expression changed drastically. As if he had realized something, he instantly stood up!

The color of the blood gradually disappeared. The masked Warlock looked down at the old man who had fallen and smiled. Then, he turned around and strode out!

The old man was the last to know something, so he had to be killed. As for Jesse, he was already dead, so there was no need to worry too much!

” However, I still have to visit this Bloodline Tower. It’ll be another obstacle to the implementation of my plan in the future! ”

The Warlock shook his head and left through the back door!
