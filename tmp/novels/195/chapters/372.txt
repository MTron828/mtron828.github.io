373 Welcome Party

Eli stood up and looked around.

They were currently in the middle of a mountain range. If Eli remembered correctly, this place should be inclined toward the north of the Western Regions. Further north was a large primitive forest, and that place did not seem to belong to humans anymore. It was occupied by foreign races.

” My lord, our holy city is in front of us, Angel City. ” Simon instructed Eli.

In front of them was a huge dam. In front of the dam, there was a huge statue of an angel that was hundreds of meters tall. It was made of white jade and had a warm and lustrous luster. The huge white wings on its back blocked the sunlight, like an angel pitying the people.

!!

Not far from the huge statue was a plain that stood in the mountains.

A huge city stood there, occupying a huge area. Although the buildings were not tall, most of them were made of white rock, like a white city. At the center was a huge temple. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It had to be said that this city looked quite beautiful.

At this moment, the giant eagle happened to fly past the angel statue and then flew toward the city in the distance.

In the sky outside the city, there were seven or eight squads of Warlocks riding on the same giant eagles patrolling.

Seeing the giant eagle approach, a team of Warlocks immediately flew over.

“Can’t you see that it’s me? Get out of the way.” Simon immediately stood up and shouted at the Warlocks.

If the giant eagle stopped, his life might also stop.

As expected, when they saw Simon, the Warlocks immediately moved aside. It was obvious that Simon, as a Celestial Warlock, had an extremely high status here.

The giant eagle flapped its wings and flew directly into the city.

“I heard that Master Simon went to the Bloodline Tower. He is back so soon.” After Simon left, a few Warlocks chatted.

“I saw another person on the eagle. He should be a Warlock from Bloodline City. It seems that the matter has been discussed.” a Warlock said.

“I don’t think it will go that smoothly.” A Warlock said thoughtfully.

???

The other Warlocks looked at him.

The Warlock looked at them and hesitated.” I don’t know if it’s just an illusion, but I feel that Lord Simon was a little nervous just now, as if he was kidnapped. ”

As soon as he said this, the few of them looked at each other in silence.

…

On the other side.

The giant eagle flew directly to the city wall.

“Sir, flying magical beasts cannot enter the city. I hope you understand.” Simon laughed.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

“Milord, please wait for a moment. I’ll get the other Warlocks to inform the Patriarch first. Then, I’ll lead Milord there. ” Simon said. Then, he called a Warlock on the city wall. After saying a few words, the Warlock ran away.

“Sir, this way, please.”

Simon bent down and bowed at Eli.

Eli walked forward.

Simon stood up again, but he seemed to have suddenly stiffened halfway.

“Isn’t this my territory? I should stand up straighter.” Simon seemed to have realized something. He straightened his body and regained his confidence.

“Simon, hurry up.” At this moment, Eli’s voice came from afar.

“Alright, my lord, I’m here.” Simon subconsciously bent down again and quickly followed him, his expression returning to flattery.

His instinctive actions made Simon cry in his heart.

“Sigh, it’s definitely not that I’m afraid of the strong. It’s just that I treat my guests well.” Simon found an excuse for himself and instantly felt much better.

That’s right, Eli was a guest. It was reasonable for him to do so.

It was definitely not because he was afraid of being beaten to death by Eli.

Yes, that was it.

Hence, Simon quickly followed him and started introducing the Amina Family to Ely.

“Milord, the Amina family currently controls a large area south of the Forest of Greenfields. There’s nothing special about this area except for the abundance of magical plants. Everything else is very ordinary, and we’re considered a mid-tier force among the rank 3 forces. We’re slightly stronger than the Manticore family. Our patriarch is a Radiant Moon second-stage warlock. Including me, there are six celestials, one Radiant Moon, and four Morning Stars.”

Along the way, Eli listened to the conversation and soon had a general understanding of the Amina family.

It had to be said that Simon was telling him everything he knew!

He was a bootlicker, and his adaptability was really good. He also had a big mouth. In the end, even Eli knew how many women Selona, the head of the Amina Family, had.

It was four.

…..

At this moment, in the temple of Amina.

Chief Selona was sitting on a huge white jade chair. He had two pairs of huge wings behind him.

Other than him, there were three other warlocks in the hall. They were all celestials, one Radiant Moon, and two morning stars.

” Sir, Simon has brought back the Bloodline Tower’s Eli, the Warlock who killed Jalin a while ago. He has replaced Glen as the new authority holder of the Bloodline Tower. ” the Warlock on the far right said. He was the other Radiant Moon Warlock of the Amina family.

” It seems like they came with ill intentions this time. This Eli isn’t as weak as Glen. ” The Warlock in the middle shook his head.

” Indeed, and since Eli wants to talk to the Patriarch, it means that Simon has already been rejected in the Bloodline Tower. He’s really useless. ” The leftmost Warlock said again.

“But he actually dared to come to our territory directly. He’s really too arrogant.” The Warlock on the right turned his head and revealed a sinister smile.

“Patriarch, what do you think?” He asked Selona, who was in the middle.

...

Previously, Salona had been sitting on the chair without saying a word. Now, he turned to the Warlock and said, “No matter what method he used, whether it was a gang fight or assassination since he killed Jalin, it means that his strength is still respectable.

“But…”

Selona’s tone turned cold. “If he thinks he can negotiate with me by coming alone, he’s still far from it. If he agrees, he can still leave this place. If he doesn’t agree, then he can stay here forever.”

Hearing Selona’s words, many Warlocks smiled.

” Kenan, Eli will arrive at the temple in a while. Go and test him. I’m curious if he really has the ability to kill Jalin. ” Selona turned to the Warlock on the left.

The Warlock named Kenan nodded and walked out without saying a word.

…..

“Sir, the temple of the Amina family is in front.”

Simon said to Eli in front of a wide avenue.

Eli looked up. At the end of the road was a huge temple. The temple was completely white and supported by sixteen huge stone pillars. There seemed to be many angelic creatures carved on the stone pillars. The entrance to the temple was two huge stone doors that were ten meters tall, just like the giants, but they were open at this time.

” My lord, the temple is carved with the race of angels. We still have quite a few of these creatures in captivity. ” Simon explained.

...

“Captive?” Eli looked at Simon in surprise.

“That’s right. They are reared in captivity. Otherwise, where does Milord think a family’s Warlock bloodline comes from? Every major power has its own bloodline cultivation ground, which is also the starting point and foundation of their power. The Bloodline Tower definitely has one, but maybe Sir isn’t too clear about it. ” Simon said.

Eli nodded.

This was indeed the first time he knew about this. It seemed that he needed to go back and ask Glen.

As they walked, they had already arrived at the steps in front of the temple.

Simon walked at the back while Eli walked in front.

At this moment, a tall warlock stood in front of the main hall with his hands in his hands, completely blocking the path.

“This doesn’t feel like a welcome party!” Eli narrowed his eyes.

He could see that several Warlocks in the temple seemed to be looking at him.

A show of strength?

Eli smiled, and a faint silver light flashed in his eyes. A faint mental power surged toward the Warlock.

Kenan stood where he was, calmly watching the arrival of the two. He wanted to see how Eli would respond.

The patriarch was right behind him. He didn’t believe that Eli would dare to make a move.

” Eh? I feel like the space in front of me is flickering. ” Kenan shook his head and blinked.

In the next second, he felt that his vision was swaying even more. The air around him was also rippling and sparkling as if it was a crack between the illusory and the real world. As for Eli and Simon, they swayed and disappeared from his sight.

What happened?

“Kenan, Kenan.” At this moment, he suddenly heard a call, and the flickering in front of him gradually disappeared.

In the blink of an eye, he was back.

However, he realized that he was standing at the side of the hall, and Simon was standing beside him.

He turned his head abruptly and saw that Eli was walking straight into the hall.

Kenan’s throat moved slightly as cold sweat broke out.

What had just happened?

” Kenan, what were you doing earlier? You were blocking the door to the temple, but suddenly, you moved aside and bowed to let Sir Eli in. ” Simon asked in confusion. This was what he had seen just now.

Simon’s words made Kenan feel as if he had fallen into an ice cave!

He bowed?! He even invited Eli in.

Why didn’t he remember anything?

As if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head, he looked at Eli in the distance.

He felt that everyone had underestimated this Warlock. He was much more terrifying than everyone had imagined.

“Kenan, why aren’t you saying anything?” Simon asked again.

” Yes. I was sent to welcome Sir Eli. ” Kenan looked at Simon and said. He couldn’t possibly say that he was here to cause trouble.

” I see. I thought you were going to stop Sir Eli! ” Simon gently nudged Kenan and said with a smile.

Kenan laughed awkwardly, but his heart was rolling like waves, unable to calm down.

However, he quickly calmed won. With the two Radiant Moon warlocks in the hall, Eli couldn’t do anything.

He believed that the Patriarch would teach Eli a lesson.

“But … What happened just now?”

Kenan was still deeply puzzled.
