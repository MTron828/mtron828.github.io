449 Golden Shrine

Thank you readers!

Three days later.

Eli’s clone streaked across the sky and once again descended on the territory of the Saka clan. However, he was not there for resources. He was here to take a look at the spatial rift!

And this time, the one who led him there was Nikola.

Nikola led him into the heavily damaged city. In the center of the city was a huge pit that looked like a small abyss, leading to the dark underground. At this time, people were coming and going around the pit, but the two of them did not attract any attention.

“Sir, please come with me!”

Nikola led Eli out of the deep pit and through the winding underground passage into a huge underground cave!

” This is the spatial rift! ”

Eli looked into the distance. In the huge karst cave, there was a ten-meter-long spatial rift in the air. It was dark behind it, and demons would descend from the spatial rift from time to time. The demons that stayed here would kill the Warlocks who stayed behind to guard the rift.

“Sir, this spatial rift has almost merged with the space here. It can’t be destroyed.” Nikola sighed.

At this time, Nikola’s arrival had attracted many people, including a Radiant Sun from the Holy Tower.

When he opened his eyes and saw the person beside Nikola, he opened his mouth wide and flew over.

“My lord!” The Warlock said respectfully.

“Yes,” Eli responded, but his gaze was fixed on the spatial rift not far away.

“Sir, I’m afraid there’s no way to deal with this spatial rift. However, yesterday, the Heart of the Abyss sent a message. In order to ensure the safety of the spatial rift, they decided to take some responsibility and prepare to take on the mission of guarding the rift alone. Then, they planned to cancel the support teams of the various factions and let them guard this place!” the Warlock said.

“Heart of Abyss?” Eli raised an eyebrow.

This matter sounded like there was no problem, and it seemed to be righteous. However, if they lost supervision, who knew what the Heart of the Abyss would do?

So …

Eli glanced at the Warlock, and then his clone flew towards the spatial rift in the distance. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Warlocks in the underground space raised their heads in surprise.

“What is he doing? ”

“Why is Milord here?”

Even the Radiant Sun Warlock was dumbfounded. He didn’t know what Eli meant, but he didn’t dare to stop him!

Meanwhile, Eli had also arrived at the bottom of the rift. Looking at the rift, his eyes narrowed slightly!

Since he could not destroy it, he might as well seal it up.

Eli stretched out his hand, and instantly, spatial chains appeared in the air in front of him. These chains continuously spiraled and danced in the air, flashing with a special luster. Then, the chains flew towards the spatial rift, winding around it like needles and threads and then repairing it bit by bit.

In just a few seconds, the spatial rift was sealed, and there was only a scar-like wound in the air!

However, Eli wiped his hands again, and the wound slowly disappeared in front of everyone’s eyes. Then, he flew toward the Radiant Sun Warlock.

At this moment, he was dumbfounded. The shock on his face could not be concealed. After all, that was a spatial rift. How could it be repaired just like that?

” This is the effect of a Sealed Artifact that I accidentally obtained in a mage’s ruins. This spatial rift has already been sealed. You can reject the Heart of the Abyss’s request and say that the spatial rift can be repaired without any help. The Bloodline Tower will be in charge of this place in the future! ” Eli said to the Warlock.

What a joke. Could he let the Heart of Abyss get what it wanted?

This was only the first one. He still had hundreds of sealing techniques. He was not in a hurry!

“This … “Hearing Eli’s answer, the Warlock’s mouth twitched, but his face relaxed a lot!

“Yes, sir!” He nodded, but he was still a little hesitant.

” And this clone of mine will always be here, and you don’t have to worry. ” Eli naturally understood the warlock’s worries. He was worried about the reliability of the seal!

The Warlock no longer had any misgivings and nodded.

A day later, all the forces heard the news. Although they were shocked, they did not say anything. After all, this was nothing compared to what had happened before. They were just more respectful of Eli. This man really had all kinds of tricks up his sleeve!

Then, he walked towards the gray Warlock Tower in the distance.

Not long after, the sound of a glass being smashed could be heard from the window. Half an hour later, Tuman rubbed his head and walked out of the door. He glanced at the mage tower behind him and then walked out. His mind seemed to still echo with Master Nero’s angry voice.

He was very sure that his lord had really planned everything this time because the evacuation of the Warlocks was the next part of the plan!

“It looks like we can only wait for the next opportunity. It’ll take at least a few decades, or else I’ll be noticed! ”

He shook his head and left quickly.

Just as he left, the black-haired Vivika happened to pass by, but her eyes also had a hint of seriousness!

After many explorations, there did seem to be something wrong with this Heart of Abyss!

…..

While Eli’s doppelganger remained in the cave to install seals, Nero broke through the defenses, and Vivika scouted. Eli, who was far away in the Grassi Land, was no longer in the mood to pay attention to this place. This was because the few people in the Giant World Fragment had finally arrived at the final region after three months of exploration.

Mountain Giant World Fragment!

In the thin black fog, Gade took a deep breath and looked at the three people beside him. Then, he looked at Eli, who was leading the way. He was filled with emotions.

Three months!

They had actually been here for three months.

In the past three months, they had witnessed the power of the first echelon of the giant World. Among them, they had encountered dozens of celestial giants. Some of them were even more dangerous than the first time, but fortunately, they were all dealt with safely.

Of course, it wasn’t solved by them. It was mainly because of Eli’s powerful strength.

Even the powerful Radiant Sun Giant could not survive a single move from Eli.

“Sir, we should be very close to the core region!” Gade said to Eli.

“It’s not very close. We’re already here!”

...

Eli turned around and smiled.

Everyone’s eyes lit up as they looked forward.

It was unknown when, but it was no longer a mountain range in front of them but a plain. On the plain, there was a large group of buildings, each of which was hundreds of meters tall. At the center was a golden temple that was nearly a thousand meters tall, as if it was the residence of the God of Creation.

In front of the temple, there was a huge tree that was over a thousand meters long. Countless black fog was coiling around it.

” Sir, that’s the giant tree of the mountain range. Moreover, the Night Flower that Sir needs usually grows beside the giant tree! ” Gade shouted excitedly. After being together for three months, they naturally knew what Eli needed.

“I saw it too.”

Eli said excitedly.

Even though he was a few kilometers away, he could still see that not far from the giant tree, there seemed to be a bunch of flowers growing. They looked a little like the night flowers!

“Let’s go!”

Without any hesitation, everyone sped up.
