415 Establishing a Connection with the Bloodline Statue

Eli didn’t know about the changes in the Feathermen race.

But at this moment, outside the elven palace, the statue of Eli had been completed!

At this moment, Eli and the many priests were standing in front of the huge statue with Eli!

Eli looked up.

!!

The statue was nearly ten meters tall and was carved out of warm white stone. It wore layers of sorcerer robes that covered most of its body, but its two hands were stretched out. One hand held a spiral staff, and the other held a mage book!

What surprised Eli was that the face wasn’t carved in Roland’s likeness but a person covered in a black cloth. Two black gems were embedded in his eyes, emitting a lustrous glow like dazzling stars!

” Sir, I think this is better. Although you’ve covered your face, it’s more in line with your temperament! ” Erwin said.

“That works too!” Eli nodded.

So what if it was not his statue? As long as he didn’t expose his face!

In fact, he also felt that it was strange to make statues for others!

As he thought about it, Eli slowly approached the statue. His hand touched the statue. He wanted to establish a connection with the statue!

When the others saw this scene, they retreated silently.

As soon as Eli’s hand touched the statue, his body slowly turned into golden lightning that filled the sky. Then, it began to circle around the statue and cover it, turning into mysterious runes that established a connection with Eli, who was far away in the Bloodline Tower.

At this moment, the elves watched with their mouths agape as Eli established a connection.

In their eyes, Eli’s body seemed to be made up of countless light spots. As the light spots approached the statue, Eli’s body visibly weakened a little, like rippling water waves, which seemed a little unreal.

Of course, this scene only lasted for a few seconds before Eli retracted his hand, and his body returned to its original state!

Erwin and the Priests looked at each other, each having their own thoughts!

“The contact has been established. I will send someone to deal with the exchange of materials and resources. Of course, this may take some time.

“When the time is right, I will bring you to see the Mother Life Tree!”

Eli looked at the elves in front of him and smiled.

The priests ‘eyes lit up when they heard about the Mother Tree of Life, but Erwin understood what Eli meant!

“Yes. It’s time for me to go back.” Eli nodded.

The truth was that this clone had exhausted a lot of faith power into it, which made it slightly unstable.

He had to go back as soon as possible. Otherwise, he was really afraid that this clone would suddenly collapse. It was not a big deal if it collapsed, but Eli did not forget that he still had a lot of gains. He had to bring them back. If these things were lost, Eli could cry to death!

“Then I look forward to meeting you next time!” Erwin’s silver eyes reflected on Eli as she said.

“Alright, but I have to tidy up my things first.” Eli smiled and dispersed the sadness of parting!

He wasn’t sad, but he felt that this elven girl seemed to be looking strangely at him, making him feel like he had to run.

It was a little like the way Vivika looked at him!

After a simple farewell, Eli flew into the sky, took out the aircraft, and set off for the Bloodline Tower!

Erwinwatched him leave with his own eyes. She looked at the statue for a while before turning around and walking towards the Elven Palace.

Although it was only less than a month, she had experienced too much.

From finding the Mother Life Tree to getting to know Sir, from the scattered races to unity, from an ordinary moon elf to the queen of the elves, everything was related to Sir Eli. It was also Eli who gave her everything.

At this moment, she had also walked to the front of the palace!

Ivan turned his head and looked at the setting sun. She pushed open the palace door and walked towards the throne. At the same time, a voice that only she could hear sounded!

” Lord Eli, thank you! ”

…..

On the other side.

Eli passed through a large area of green fields smoothly and arrived at the defense line of the Amina Family again.

After going through a simple review, Eli passed through this area that was difficult for wild creatures to pass through.

Eli had planned to have a good chat with Salona about the defense line and plan for future communication, but he had directly passed through here. The reason was that the elves had just been unified, and it would take some time to build it into what Eli had expected, so he would talk about it later.

The most important thing now was to send back Eli’s spoils.

After that, the journey was unexpectedly smooth. After a few days, Eli returned to Bloodline City.

The doppelganger circled around and entered the Grassi Land, arriving at Eli, who was under the Hill Tree.

Eli looked at the clone that looked exactly like him and took the ring. The clone suddenly dissipated.

The scattered faith surged towards the mark in Eli’s hand, filling up the second mark and illuminating the third mark that was almost half-filled. Ever since the battle at Nightfall City, not only did the Bloodline Tower occupy the territory of the Akasha Family, but Eli’s faith had also attracted a new round of disciples. Not only did the third mark condense, but it had even filled up almost half of it in the next few months.

One should not underestimate this half. As the power of faith increased, it became more and more difficult to condense a faith mark.

It was already a lot, and the third mark was growing much faster than before Eli left. This was obviously the help of the elves, and there might be other foreign races who were eyeing ” Roland “!

Of course, this had nothing to do with him for the time being because he had to deal with his gains.

Eli stood up and said loudly to Hill, “Hill, you did well this time.”

“Hehe!” Hill chuckled and swayed her countless branches like a child.

After thanking her, Eli returned to the wizard tower.

Not far away, Dylan raised his head, curious about what Eli’s doppelganger was doing when he was out!

However, he didn’t want to ask because he was immersed in sadness. A week ago, under the guidance of the celestial of the Bloodline Tower, he had also walked around the Bloodline Tower, but he still didn’t feel his body.

Dylan sighed and lowered his head in silence.

...

…

Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli had already digested most of the knowledge, and he almost understood the sealing spell and purification rune. After all, he was also a genius in magic, and as an elite mage, he understood it very quickly.

Of course, in the past six months, Eli had also begun to refine the Sun Potion. He had not succeeded yet, mainly because he had spent all his time digesting his harvest. He had not put too much effort into the crafting of the potion. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But even without the potion, as time passed, Eli’s Power increased a little.

From 230 points to 231 points.

And this was only the change in Eli. The Bloodline Tower had also changed greatly.

As they and the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce expanded, the Bloodline Tower could be considered a real third-level force in terms of both range and strength.

However, there was also an obvious problem. The supply of potions was seriously insufficient!

The orders had been piling up for ten years, so the Bloodline Tower didn’t dare to take orders from other forces anymore. This even affected the development of the Bloodline Tower!

However, this problem was still alright because, after half a year of development, the elves had also completely reorganized themselves. He planned to start his grand plan!

...

So, one day, when Eli was about to contact Erwin, a knock suddenly sounded on the door.

Pa, pa, pa!

The voice was hurried, clearly anxious. Ely knew who it was because only Vivika could freely enter and exit the Grassi Land!

“Come in!” Eli replied.

The door opened, and indeed, it was Vivika. However, at this moment, she looked anxious. When she saw Eli, she said,

“Milord, something bad has happened.”
