563 The Great Battle Begins

The war was about to begin!

Perhaps even the Bloodline Alliance didn’t realize this.

Three days later, a large number of Liches began to gather. The large-scale gathering instantly attracted the attention of the Alliance and shocked everyone. After all, it was too sudden.

However, the Bloodline Alliance reacted quickly. The airships, Warlocks, and resources were all sent to the border under the Bloodline Alliance’s command, ready for a battle that could break out at any time!

During this process, scouts entered the Lich Tower area one by one. The reason for the energy activity from before was gradually clear, which surprised everyone.

Bloodline Tower.

The higher-ups of the Bloodline Alliance sat on both sides of the long table. Alida sat in the front while Eli sat on the other side.

” The previous incident has been investigated. The final cause seems to be a conspiracy between the Calamity and the Bone Dragon Lich. They gathered a few fifth-circle Liches and set a trap to kill and devour almost all the other Liches, resulting in this tragedy!” Alida spoke with a serious expression.

It was clearly the Lich Tower’s act of self-harm, but it made them shudder.

“Don’t they have phylacteries? How did they die?” Nikola asked curiously.

Alida glanced at him. “It’s the deception of the Lich of Calamity and the Bone Dragon Lich. They used the Lich King to pass on false information, and then all the Liches brought their phylacteries. However, we don’t know the details at the moment. Of course, that’s not important.

“The important thing was that the strength of the two Liches, the Skeletal Dragon and the Calamity, had already achieved a leap. They were at least above Myriad Flower, or perhaps even a level higher!”

Hiss!

Everyone gasped in shock.

How strong was the Myriad Flowers? Could they withstand it?

At this moment, everyone turned to look at Eli. Eli’s eyes were still calm as if he didn’t care. They immediately felt relieved.

“What about the Lich King?” Suddenly, Eli asked softly.

“Lich King?” Alida hesitated for a moment before she said,” After the two Liches advanced, they had a huge battle with the Lich King. After that, the Lich King escaped with heavy injuries. We don’t know where he is now. The entire Lich Tower is already under the control of the Bone Dragon and the Calamity.”

Eli nodded and didn’t say anything.

Everyone looked at Eli’s calm reaction and did not know if they should panic!

However, Alida began to make new arrangements again, and all the topics were discussed again. Meanwhile, Eli, who was sitting in the corner, was very calm, only thinking in his heart.

How should he put it? He immediately felt that this matter was a scam!

The Calamity Lich and the Bone Dragon Lich might just be a smokescreen!

The curse that he had observed that day had penetrated deep into every Lich’s body. Although Eli did not know how he had applied it, David could easily control any Lich if he wanted to. Of course, it might be different for high-level Liches, but David could still influence them greatly.

Therefore, in his opinion, the Lich King’s escape was more like a… A scam!

It was a scam!

“A large number of fifth-circle Liches died, but he won’t die. Otherwise, it would be difficult to organize such a large army. Therefore, it’s very likely that he’s just borrowing the hands of the two Liches to achieve his goal.” The corners of Eli’s mouth curled up as if he had discovered something interesting.

As for the Calamity Lich and the Bone Dragon Lich, he wasn’t that worried.

Even if both of them had advanced to the level of laws, so what?

After more than a thousand years, his combat power could crush them easily, not to mention that he had a full set of Mage Tools!

“Since you’re acting, then let me play with you.”

Eli muttered.

“Sir, we have finished our discussion. Do you have any other opinions?” Suddenly, Alida said to Eli.

“No, just follow your plan!” Eli waved his hand. He had no intention of telling them about this. This might alert the enemy!

“Yes, my lord.”

Alida nodded and then announced the end of the meeting.

Everyone stood up, and Eli left as well, returning to the mage Tower.

..

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.

The atmosphere of the war was getting stronger and stronger as they walked on the road. Everyone’s faces became more solemn. The entertainment venues and battle-related industries in every city were crowded!

Everyone knew very well that the upcoming war would be very cruel.

As for Eli, he continued to sit and experiment as if he was not affected at all.

In fact, during this period of time, his Law of Light had broken through to the second level, and the suppression of the black fog and curses was even stronger. This made him even more confident in the upcoming battle.

As for when the war would start, Eli estimated that it wouldn’t be too long from then.

.

Sure enough!

War broke out the next month!

Countless Liches stepped into the border and launched an attack on the Bloodline Alliance. The Northern Region had completely turned into a land of war.

There was no need to explain the cruelty of war, not to mention that their opponents were Liches. They were creatures that did not fear death. In fact, each Lich needed two Warlocks of the same level to suppress them. This caused the intensity of the war to escalate again.

At this moment, Eli was also paying attention to the battle, but he did not make a move.

In the blink of an eye, another month passed.

At this moment, the number of Liches and Warlocks participating in the war had exceeded two million. The impact of the war had affected the entire world, and even the deep sea had noticed it.

Laura even participated in the meeting of the Imperial Dynasty, discussing whether the Sea Race would interfere!

During this process, the Conservative Races firmly opposed it, and the Mermaid Race naturally opposed it as well. In addition, the Conservative Race was slightly stronger at this time, so in the end, it was decided that the Sea Race would not make a move.

This also made Eli feel a little more relaxed.

After all, if the Sea Race joined in the war, it might be a little troublesome!

The Bloodline Alliance did not have the ability to deal with two major forces at the same time.

On the other side, the Lich War had passed the initial consumption state. At this time, the Bloodline Tower also began to send high-end five-circle combat power to participate in the war.

The situation of the battle changed in an instant.

The loss of the Lich Tower’s fifth-circle combat power caused the Liches to suffer heavy losses. The Liches had no choice but to adjust their positions and gather the battlefield from multiple to one. At the same time, the Calamity Lich and Bone Dragon Lich appeared.

On the day of their debut, three of the Bloodline Alliance’s fifth circle members died. This confirmed that both of them had actually entered the Law Level!

The Bloodline Alliance’s momentum was greatly reduced, and the Lich Tower was unstoppable!

Everyone was under a lot of pressure, especially Alida. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

One day.

Alida hesitated for a long time before finally walking into the Grassi Land, hoping that Eli would make a move.

However, when he arrived, she found that the entire Grassi Land was empty except for Hill.

When Alida asked about it, Hill asked in confusion, “Are you talking about Father? Hill had seen him leave this morning, and Hydra and the others had gone with him!”

“What?”

Alida was stunned for a moment, but she gradually became excited.

The Lord was finally going to make a move!
