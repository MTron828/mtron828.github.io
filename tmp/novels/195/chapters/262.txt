263 Silver Eye

In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.

Eli was once again on his way back to the bloodline tower.

Half a day later, Eli returned to the bloodline tower and began to take stock of his gains!

There were dozens of bloodline rings. Opening them took half an hour, and after another three hours, he was basically done sorting out his gains.

Four element’s hearts, a gem of an elemental giant, and a large number of third-circle warlocks!

This was a wave of wealth!

“Most of them are useless. Other than materials, there’s only one thing that’s still usable!” Eli took out a book.

This was collected from the ring of the dead tatuck.

It was a special spell.

The spell, Silver Eyes, could track and see through everything from the outside, but it could accumulate mental power and launch mental power attacks from the inside. It was special because this spell was very evil.

It was said that the more you used it, the more powerful it would be. It was said that a fifth-circle Warlock had once learned it, and he could even see through everything. His explosive mental strength attack even surpassed that of a Mage who specialized in this area. The price was that every time a spell grew, it would damage the user’s eyes and it would absorb a large amount of the user’s life force.

Therefore, Mages would become blind after using it for a long time. Moreover, due to the special power within it, they could not transplant new eyes, or else it would cause a mental force explosion.

It simply didn’t make sense!

Although it was powerful, the consequences were also very terrifying.

After all, there were substitute spells for scouting, analysis, and mental force attacks. Although they were weaker, there was no need to learn this knowledge.

It was estimated that even in the Mage world, there were very few people who learned this spell!

But after seeing it, Eli’s eyes did light up.

This spell consumed vitality!

It was another forbidden spell prepared for him.

Not bad!

He loved this kind of power!

Other than that, there was the elemental giant gem.

After inspection, it should be the core of a third-circle elemental giant, but it was in a half-dead state. It was easy to resurrect it, just by being in a large amount of high concentration of elements.

As long as there were enough elements, one could immediately obtain the combat power of a third-circle, which was very valuable.

However, Eli didn’t plan on doing that. He planned to use it as the core, along with the knowledge he had about chimeras, to cultivate a Chimera.

As a good helper of a dark mage in the past, Eli felt that if he had one, it would be of some help to him. Besides, a core at the limit of the third circle was also a rare material. He believed that the quality of the synthesized Chimera would not be too bad.

So next, he needed to collect some materials, and then he could make a Chimera!

As for now, it was time to consume the fishes and learn this new spell.

Oh, right, there was also Rodin, the third circle Warlock. He had joined the bloodline tower and was working for Vivika. The addition of two third circle warlocks had also increased the power of the bloodline tower once again!

..

At this moment, further north from the bloodline tower.

A confrontation was taking place.

The two parties were the heart of darkness Alliance and the Holy tower Alliance.

The warlocks who had arrived filled the entire area. There were tens of thousands of them. This was the main battlefield of both sides, and today was a very important battle.

This was the heart of darkness’s first time entering the Holy tower’s core area.

If he won this battle, Sergei would be able to go all the way to the headquarters of the Holy tower. So, the atmosphere in the area was extremely heavy, and there was no sound. All the warlocks were waiting for Sergei’s order.

“What?”

At this moment, a cry of surprise came from a tent behind the heart of darkness.

Sergei stood up angrily and lifted the three-circle sorcerer in front of him. He said with a ferocious face, ”

“Repeat what you just said!”

“Your… Your Excellency. Herman from the bloodline tower went to the silver Moon Lake alone. Not only did he kill Sir tatuck, but he also killed the other third-circle warlocks and captured the rest of them!”

Sergei’s eyes were full of anger, but then they were filled with disbelief.

He couldn’t believe that Herman was so powerful.

He had thought that Herman was only a slightly stronger third-circle late-stage warlock, but he didn’t expect Herman to kill all of his subordinates by himself.

“Did they not use their bloodline combination skill?” He threw the Warlock away, sat back in his seat, and asked.

“It’s useless.”

“It didn’t work?”

“Herman easily killed everyone with a single strike, and he neutralized the combined spell.” The Warlock carefully looked at Mr. Sergei.

At this moment, Scheer’s face was covered. He seemed to have regained his calmness, but the twitching muscles on his face showed that he was not that calm.

“What about Rodin?” Sergei asked again.

“I heard that Rodin has been caught, but this matter is very suspicious. It seems that Rodin has already thrown the gem into the element, and then it was taken out by Eli!”

Sergei closed his eyes.

Fine, they all failed.

“You pieces of trash!” Sergei couldn’t hold it in any longer. He cursed and released a powerful aura, which terrified the Warlock.

“Herman?” Sergei took a deep breath.

This person had already killed many of heart of darkness’s members and destroyed many of their operations. Originally, he wanted to deal with the Holy Tower before dealing with Herman but he had miscalculated. Herman was too cunning.

To actually have such combat power, it simply made people feel terrified!

“But … He’s provoked the wrong person!” Sergei gritted his teeth. The moonlight behind him seemed to be real.

Even now, he still didn’t think that Eli could defeat him. After all, his strength was definitely at the top among the third circle warlock. He was practically invincible against anyone below fourth circle.

“but we still have to deal with the Holy tower first.”

Sergei regained his calm.

The Holy tower was his main enemy at the moment. After so many years, he had to make a decision, so he didn’t seem to have the time to look for Eli.

And after this, it would probably take him a few decades to complete his cause of conquering the Holy tower.

“Damn it!” Sergei gritted his teeth in anger.

“Then, Milord, do we still fight the war?” The Warlock asked cautiously.

...

“Fight,” Sergei took a deep breath. “But not today!”

“Retreat!”

..

In the opposite camp.

At this moment, more than a dozen warlocks were gathered in a circle, and the atmosphere was heavy.

The leader was an old man with a white beard. His eyes were bright, and he wore a white Wizard robe. He exuded the aura of a peak third-circle wizard. He was Woox, the most powerful man in the White Tower.

However, he was frowning at the moment, as if he was worried about the upcoming war.

He knew very well that they were no match for the other side.

Suddenly, the tent was opened, and a Warlock ran in.

“My Lord, the heart of darkness has retreated!” He shouted, panting heavily.

“Retreat?”

Everyone was shocked. Even Woox immediately stood up and looked at the man.

“What did you just say?”

“my Lord, just now, the heart of darkness organized their troops and retreated to the back. They gave up on attacking!”

“How is this possible?”

“What’s the reason?”

The warlocks were dumbfounded, but they were soon overjoyed.

At this moment, a crystal ball not far away suddenly glowed, and everyone stopped talking. Woox slowly walked over and placed his hand on the crystal ball.

A few seconds later, he raised his head.

“My Lord, is this the reason for their retreat?” Someone asked after seeing Woox’s expression.

“Yes,” Woox nodded.

“Then the reason is?”

“someone killed dozens of heart of darkness’s 3-circle warlocks, hundreds of 2-circle warlocks, and thousands of 1-circle warlocks for us!” Woox paused for a few seconds before he spoke.

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire tent was in an uproar.

After Woox explained the situation, everyone took a deep breath.

“I didn’t expect the bloodline tower to be so well hidden.”

“I’m afraid it’s another Warlock at the peak of the third circle.”

“Indeed, this is too surprising!”

The warlocks sighed. They were extremely shocked.

No one had expected that the silver Moon Lake would attract such a powerful figure.

“Then, Sir Woox, what should we do next?” Someone asked.

“Udo seems to have a good relationship with him. I’ll get him to contact Herman. It’ll be best if we can pull him to our side. Even if they lose so many people, our chances of defeating them are still slim!” Woox said.

Everyone also expressed their agreement. Such a strong person indeed needed to be roped in.

“Then, today’s meeting is over!” Woox waved his hand, and everyone got up and left.

Woox was also about to leave, but he suddenly looked out of the tent.

Outside the tent, two familiar auras appeared.

“Here it comes again!”

Woox shook his head.
