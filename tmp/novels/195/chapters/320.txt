321 Attack

“Twenty points!”

Eli looked at the number of the dice of fate, and his expression became more and more strange.

Ever since he had started the curse, he had found that Gaido’s strength seemed to be decreasing. This was directly reflected in the probability of him defeating Gaido increasing. Thus, he persisted in cursing Gaido every year. After all, this was an enemy that he could possibly encounter.

But in fact, Eli was also very confused.

After all, it was only a curse. The speed at which his strength dropped was too ridiculous.

Gaido relied on blood for treatment but Eli applied a bloodline curse on him. Gaido couldn’t stop the treatment, which caused the situation to become like this.

“Sigh, I’m not afraid anymore!”

Eli relaxed quite a bit.

He had been worried that this guy might come for revenge, but now he wasn’t worried at all.

If you have the guts, come!

If you come, I’ll kill you and take the hourglass.

..

Time slipped.

In a room in a Tower.

Anderson stood respectfully at the side, and not far away sat Gaido.

Anderson looked at Gaido and clenched his fists tightly. He was both surprised and excited. He was surprised that Gaido had come out so suddenly without any warning. He was excited because it was time for them to take back the West Coast.

He had been waiting for this day for hundreds of years.

If his lord still did not come out, he would probably die.

“My Lord, your injuries should have fully recovered by now, right?” Anderson asked with concern.

“No!” Gaido shook his head. “my current situation is only slightly better than when I first started.”

Anderson’s heart skipped a beat!

How could it be like this?

He suddenly thought of Gaido’s request for more blood in the past 30 years. He thought that it was his lord who was about to reach his final stage of recovery but now it seemed that it might not be the case!

“My Lord, why …” Anderson asked cautiously.

“I suspect it was Herman.” Gaido sat on the chair and said calmly.

“Herman!”

Anderson’s eyes widened.

All these years, they had completely shrunk their forces because of this man.

30 years ago, the Wanderer’s Alliance was razed to the ground. Although there was no direct evidence to prove who did it, Herman was the biggest suspect. Besides, that level of destruction could only have been done by a celestial.

They didn’t expect that he would actually reach celestial on the West Coast.

“Then what does my Lord plan to do?” Anderson continued to ask.

This time, Gaido glanced at him and then said, “I’m going to kill him.”

Anderson gasped.

“Don’t worry. Even if my level has regressed, killing a celestial that has just advanced isn’t a problem. Besides, I still have the sand of time. He can’t kill me.

“I will ruthlessly pull off his head and let him know that he has done a stupid thing.” Gaido laughed coldly.

Anderson heaved a sigh of relief after hearing what Gaido said.

That was true. His lordship had been a celestial for so many years, and Herman, who had just become a celestial, could not compare to him. Moreover, he still had the sand of time, which was a precious treasure of their time hourglass that they had obtained from a Mage’s ruin.

If it was used at full power, it could make the person burn their life force without them knowing. This was the life-saving trump card that Gaido had when he was fighting the celestial of the central continent.

It wasn’t that they couldn’t kill Gaido, but that they didn’t want to bear the consequences.

“Anderson, start organizing your men. Half a month later, I’ll fly to the bloodline tower’s area and kill Herman. Then, your men will immediately invade the bloodline tower.”

Since he was going to make a move, he would do everything at once.

“I want to kill Herman, and I want to take down West Coast too!” Gaido sneered. His killing intent was like a cold wind that caused Anderson to shiver.

However, he could not hide the joy on his face.

“Yes!” His eyes were filled with determination.

The day had finally come.

‘Stupid Herman, you don’t even know what you’ve done!’

..

Half a month later.

On the plateau, close to ten thousand warlocks had gathered.

They were the main force of the hourglass. Every thousand of them formed a regiment, and every one of them was fully armed. They all had smiles on their faces.

Anderson had already told them the purpose of their trip.

With Lord Gaido taking action, this time, it would still be an easy task.

In front of the warlocks were the higher-ups of the hourglass.

At the center of the group were Gaido and Anderson.

...

“Milord, we’re ready!” Anderson said respectfully.

“Hmm, you’ve done a good job in management!” Gaido looked at the Warlock behind him and nodded in approval.

“It’s what I should do,” Anderson said humbly.

“there’s no need to be humble. Once we conquer the West Coast, the area you’ll have to manage will be many times larger. Your abilities will come in handy.” There was a smile on Gaido’s face. Back then, he had been beaten up by the warlocks of the central continent and had almost died. How could he not be angry?

Today was the beginning. He was going to take back everything that once belonged to him.

“You guys should go too, I’m going.” Gaido looked at him and then flew into the sky.

The moment he flew into the sky, an endless amount of blood wrapped around him. Through space, he gradually turned into a huge bird, floating in the air.

This giant bird was 300 meters long and had a slender neck. Its neck was covered in purple feathers, while the rest of its body was covered in black feathers. Its huge wings flickered with a cold light, and its sharp claws seemed to be able to tear the sky apart.

To everyone’s shock, endless lightning bolts surrounded his body like chains. He was the God of Thunder in the sky!

Heavenly lightning Giant Eagle bloodline avatar.

Everyone on the plateau felt their breathing quicken, but their eyes were filled with confidence. With such a powerful Lord Gaido, this victory was set in stone!

...

The giant bird flapped its wings, and purple lightning appeared within a hundred meters.

“Anderson, I’ll head out first. You guys follow me!” The giant bird’s voice rang out as it flapped its wings.

In the next second, he flapped his wings, and instantly, lightning flashed. His body flew into the distance like a bolt of lightning.

On the ground, Anderson was overwhelmed with emotions.

Flying into the sky, he was in high spirits as he shouted, “Everyone, it’s time for us to take back our territory!

“Let’s go!”

His voice echoed through every Warlock, and they all cheered.

The next moment, Anderson flew forward, and the others followed.

The huge hourglass of time was about to return.

What Herman? what bloodline tower?

They were just nothing.

The huge Thunder Eagle was flying toward the bloodline tower.

The Army behind them also advanced quickly. At this moment, the morale of the hourglass was at an unprecedented high. Although the battle had not begun, it seemed as if they had already won.

..

At this moment.

In a high tower prison at the Hourglass.

Situ was lying in front of the prison’s window, his hands tightly holding onto the window’s railing. His old and turbid eyes looked at Gaido, Anderson, and the others who were far away. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had been locked up here hundreds of years ago and had never left.

At this moment, almost every part of his body was rotten, emitting a foul smell and a strong aura of death. His bloodline had been crippled back then, and he had reached the limit of his life.

“I failed back then, but this time, with Milord here, we will definitely succeed.”

Situ let go of his hand and leaned against the wall, his eyes full of hope.

He couldn’t die yet.

He wanted to hear the news of Herman’s death, the destruction of the bloodline tower, and the revival of the hourglass of time at the West Hope. That would be his last hope of survival.

“Herman, I won in the end.”

Situ’s rotten face revealed a terrifying sneer.

His Lord would bring victory to the hourglass of time.
